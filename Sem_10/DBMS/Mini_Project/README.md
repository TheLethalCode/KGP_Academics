## Title
Booking and Registration Management for Events in Campus

## Description

Before  the  onset  of  the  online  mode  of  education,  various  events  like  SpringFest,  Kshitij,  Societymeetings,  General Championships,  etc.  are a common occurrence in the campus.  All these eventstake place in different venues (auditorium, classrooms, gymkhana) taking their need into account.  Butthe booking process for these venues is extraordinarily troublesome and needs someone to move toand fro between different authorities.  The authorities in-charge themselves also have to keep track ofthe availabilities of the various venues.  To make matters more difficult, different venues have differentin-charges and their information is not really public.  Unless the person carrying out the booking isextremely familiar with various aspects of the process and does this on a regular basis,  finishing abooking successfully is extremely troublesome and lengthy process.

So, we aim to design an application that can resolve this issue and even facilitate the progress ofthe events more smoothly.  To be particular, the application will automate the venue booking processas well as assist the event organisers in user registration as well.  This will help both the managementand the students to save time and focus on other important aspects of the event as well as have acomputerised record of various details without any conflicts and redundancy.

The major features planning to be offered to the students are:


- List available venues on a particular date and the corresponding authorities supervising thosevenues
- Requesting authorities for permission
- Online booking and payment (along with status)
- List of upcoming general events and their details
- Registration for upcoming events (payment, if necessary)
- Store user details (authorities and event managers will use this)
