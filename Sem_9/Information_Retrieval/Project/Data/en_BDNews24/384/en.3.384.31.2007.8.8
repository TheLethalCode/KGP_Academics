 Islamabad, August 8 (bdnews24.com/BBC)-Pervez Musharraf has reiterated his determination to remain Pakistan's president and head of its army. He has told political allies that he intends to get re-elected as president by the four provincial assemblies and both houses of parliament. President Musharraf assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's powerful military. He was later elected president for a five-year term in a controversial referendum held in 2002.

The PPP, with its liberal and left-leaning agenda, remains the largest political party in Pakistan. It has consistently polled the highest number of votes in the past three elections. "The meeting was held to take all political parties into confidence regarding the elections," Pakistan's information minister said. "We want to have everybody on board to ensure free and transparent elections." Analysts say that despite official denials, the president has reached some understanding with opposition political groups. They argue that President Musharraf has been increasingly isolated since his suspension of Pakistan's Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who has since been reinstated. The PPP itself has refused to confirm or deny that any political arrangement has been reached. But Ms Bhutto maintains that no deal will be reached unless President Musharraf relinquishes his role as head of the ar
