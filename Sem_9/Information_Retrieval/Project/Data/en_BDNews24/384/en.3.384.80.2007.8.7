<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank Tuesday directed all banks to maintain a 1.0 percent reserve as provision against all types of loan instruments, including letters of credit as a safeguard against default. The move will help banks have a safeguard against the risk of payment defaults, especially in the case of LCs, a senior official with the central bank told bdnews24.com. Banks will have to comply with the directive from December 31 this year, according to the circular. The central bank initiated the move in line with international banking practice. Defaults on payment from LCs opened by importers also encouraged the regulator to take the measure, the BB official added. "We have observed that banks sometimes faced defaults on payment from importers. Our move will help banks to safeguard depositors' interest and improve their financial health," the official said. The BB official, however, admitted that the latest directive would marginally affect bank profits. The circular, mentioning various lending instruments such as LCs, bonds and guarantees, said banks have to keep a provision against credits they extended against such products. bdnews
