 Dhaka, August 6 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks plunged for a second day Monday as merchant banks' continued sell-offs in their investor portfolio accounts to reduce margin-loan ratios to avoid regulator sanctions. "It appears that the merchant banks are pushing the market down," a senior merchant bank official, who preferred anonymity, told bdnews24.com. Merchant banks rushed to adjust their margin loan ratios, extended earlier to their clients, after the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an inquiry into allegedly excessive sanctioning of margin loans, by some merchant banks. This contributed to the previous surge in the market. "Some merchant banks that manage larger portfolios had previously extended excessive loans to current and former employees as well as their sponsor shareholders," he said. "They are now selling the shares to bring down their loan-extension ratios," the official added. Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 700 million in funds, agreed that a continuation in sell-offs by merchant banks pulled the market. "It's simply a realignment of leverage trading," Sayeed said. Selling pressure sent almost all sectors into a negative terrain, guided by banks and power companies. The DGEN or general index slumped 44.70 points, or 1.89 percent, to 2308.66. The DSI or all-share price index lost 37.36 points, or 1.94 percent, to 1887.34. The DSE-20 blue-chip index plummeted 44.78 points, or 2.11 percent, to 2072.03. Losers beat gainers 162 to 36. Some 13 issues finished unchanged. Turnover dropped Tk 1.34 billion from Sunday's Tk 1.56 billion. All major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange finished lower, amid a downturn in turnover at Tk 153.69 million from Sunday's Tk 155.78 million. Of the issues traded, 16 gained, 87 lost and 6 held steady. Square Pharmaceutical remained the leader in turnover at Tk 103.60 million, falling 2.09 percent to end on Tk 5,144.75. Summit Power lost 0.82 percent to end Tk 1,291. DESCO, BRAC Bank and UCBL finished next to Summit Power. DESCO finished at 930.75, down 3.04 percent. BRAC Bank dipped 2.88 percent to Tk 925.25. A buying spree, however, drove UCBL up 2.51 percent to Tk 3,634.5. UCBL said it would hold its five-year annual general meeting, pending since 1997.
