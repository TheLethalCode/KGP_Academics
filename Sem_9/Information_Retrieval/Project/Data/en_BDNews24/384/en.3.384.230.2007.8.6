 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has dismissed media reports of a possible transfer to Real Madrid by underlining his desire to be a success at Stamford Bridge. "I am totally committed to Chelsea," the Germany captain told the club's official Web site (www.chelseafc.com) on Monday. "I came here to win trophies and be successful in English football, I want to assure the Chelsea fans of that. "I am very happy in London professionally and for my family. The speculation about me leaving is not true. I have no interest in leaving Chelsea and I have had no contact with Real Madrid whatsoever." Ballack, who endured a difficult first year in English football last season, missed Sunday's Community Shield defeat by Manchester United as he continues his recovery from a recent ankle operation. He scored four Premier League goals before sustaining his ankle injury at Newcastle United on April 22. "I am frustrated by my injury at the moment but I am working hard to be fit and hope to be back very soon to join my team mates," said Ballack
