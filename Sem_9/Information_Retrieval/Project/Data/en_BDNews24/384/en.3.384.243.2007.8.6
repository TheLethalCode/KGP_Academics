 Dhaka, August 6 (bdnews24.com)-- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday vowed to continue work for elections despite floods that have battered major parts of Bangladesh. "No work can be deferred in the excuse of floods. National elections will take place by December 2008," he said at the inauguration of a training workshop for district election officials at the Electoral Training Institute in Agargaon. The CEC said he was determined to publish the final voter list with photographs by October, according to a roadmap laid out by the main election office. "If possible, we'll finish the job earlier than planned," he said. bdnews24
