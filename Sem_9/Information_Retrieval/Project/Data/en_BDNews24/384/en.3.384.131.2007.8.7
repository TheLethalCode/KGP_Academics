 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Tuesday granted bail to former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo and stayed his detention order. Besides, the High Court has issued a rule on the government to explain in four weeks why he will not be produced before court to make sure he is not detained illegally. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury gave the order on a writ petition filed on behalf of Mintoo. Mintoo's counsel Advocate Ahsanul Karim told bdnews24.com that there was no case against him. "So there is no bar to his release if no new case is filed," he said. The writ appeal said joint forces arrested Mintoo 67 days ago, counted down to Sunday, when the appeal was filed. But no case was filed against him, nor does he face a detention order. "He (Mintoo) has been kept in illegal detention," the lawyer said. When the writ petition came up for hearing on August 6, the government sought more time. During the hearing, Mintoo's another lawyer, barrister Rafique-ul Huq, had told the court that the government has to ensure that no detention order is given until Tuesday. The government agreed. On Tuesday, barrister Huq told the court that a detention order was given against Mintoo Monday night illegally despite an assurance from the government. The court demanded an explanation from the government counsel and he apologised. bdnews24.
