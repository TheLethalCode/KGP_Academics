 CAMP DAVID, Md., Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush and Afghan President Hamid Karzai vowed on Monday to finish off the Taliban, which Karzai described as a defeated and frustrated force that attacks civilians but is not a threat to his government. Karzai, visiting the United States amid renewed concern about worsening violence in Afghanistan and the threat from militant hideouts across the border in Pakistan, said he was building up his army and police to finish off the Taliban. "Our enemy is still there, defeated but still hiding in the mountains. And our duty is to complete the job, to get them out of their hideouts in the mountains," he said after two days of meetings with Bush at the Camp David presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains. The Taliban, driven from power by a US-led invasion in 2001, are "a force that is acting in cowardice by killing children going to school" and posed threats to innocents, including teachers, clergy, engineers and international aid workers, Karzai said. He added, however: "They're not posing any threat to the government of Afghanistan. They're not posing any threat to the institutions of Afghanistan or to the buildup of institutions of Afghanistan." "It's a force that is frustrated," Karzai said. Bush's strategy session with Karzai came as the US president found himself on the defensive over the troubled effort to rebuild Afghanistan and the failure to find al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. With the six-year anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks approaching, Bush is eager to assure Karzai -- and the American public -- he is committed to shoring up Afghanistan and combating the Taliban and al Qaeda. Reassuring Karzai of US commitment to Afghanistan, Bush said the two countries' shared Islamic militant foes were "part of an ongoing challenge that the free world faces." "The real question is whether or not those of us who have the blessings of liberty will continue to pursue policies -- foreign policy, security policy -- aimed at not only protecting our homeland, but aimed at laying a condition for peace to prevail," Bush said. Bin Laden is believed by US intelligence officials to be hiding in the rugged tribal region of Pakistan, an area near the border of Afghanistan that has been a source of concern to Karzai because it is seen as a hotbed of Taliban activity. US officials have underscored their support for Karzai, whose weak central government faces numerous challenges, including suicide bomb attacks by the Taliban, mounting civilian casualties and a burgeoning opium trade. Bush and Karzai also discussed the crisis involving 21 Korean hostages seized by the Taliban in July. The kidnappers have killed two of the 23 initially captured and are demanding the release of Taliban prisoners in exchange. South Korea has appealed to the United States and the Afghan officials to negotiate the release, but Bush and Karzai agreed that they would make no concessions to the Taliban to win freedom for the South Koreans.
