 ISLAMABAD, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tribal elders in Pakistan's Waziristan region said they would not go to Kabul on Thursday for a grand assembly aimed at building confidence between Pakistan and Afghanistan and dampening support for the Taliban. During the four-day grand assembly, or jirga, Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf are due to address clerics, politicians, writers and tribal chiefs from the ethnic Pashtun lands that straddle the border.

"How can we go there and talk about peace while our own home is burning? There is unrest and a military operation going on," Senator Saleh Shah Qureshi, from South Waziristan, said. Afghanistan's Taliban rejected the assembly as a "waste of time and money" that would achieve nothing. "The US just wants to seek public support for its illegal and inhuman actions through this jirga," said Taliban spokesman Zaibullah Mujahid. Seven hundred elders from both countries are due to attend the jirga. A similar gathering will be held in Pakistan, but no date has been set yet. A Taliban resurgence in the last two years led to accusations by Afghan officials that the insurgents were organising and launching attacks from the safety of sanctuaries on Pakistani soil.
