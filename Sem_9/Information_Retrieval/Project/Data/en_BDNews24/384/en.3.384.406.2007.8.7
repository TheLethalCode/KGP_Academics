<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday deferred by a day the hearings of two separate writ petitions to quash two corruption cases against Sheikh Hasina. A two-member panel of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Mohammad Ataur Rahman Khan made the order after Hasina's counsel barrister Shafique Ahmed appealed for the deferment. The cases involve purchase of Mig-29 warplanes and Frigate warships during Hasina's term in 1996-2001. During the latest political government headed by Khaleda Zia, the corruption charges were brought against the former prime minister. Hasina had denied the charges and appealed to the High Court in 2003 to quash the charges, claiming they were politically motivated. Barrister Ahmed in his appeal Tuesday said he needed time to prepare himself to place his arguments before the court since he got the new appointment after the previous counsel returned all documents, saying he was unable to continue his job. Barrister Ahmed sought one week but deputy attorney general Abdur Rouf Miah opposed. Miah later said barrister Ahmed could get a day for that. Finally the court deferred the hearings for a day and fixed Wednesday to hear the petitions. On December 11, 2001, an official of the now-defunct Bureau of Anti-corruption filed a case, accusing Hasina of corruption in purchasing eight Mig-29 warplanes. Charges of causing a loss of Tk700 crore to the government coffer were brought against Hasina. On January 29, 2003, police formally charged Hasina and six others with corruption in the case. But the same year, Hasina filed a writ petition to quash the case, and the HC stopped all proceedings of the case in the trial court. Separately, another official of the then bureau filed a case in 2002 against Hasina and four others, accusing them of corruption in purchasing frigate warships. The complainant accused them of causing a loss of Tk447 crore to the government coffer because of that purchase deal. Police submitted a chargesheet against the accused but later Hasina appealed to the HC to quash the case in 2003. b
