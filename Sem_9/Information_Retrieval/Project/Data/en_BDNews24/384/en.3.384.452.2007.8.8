<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 8 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Wednesday rejected a stay appeal filed by Rangs Bhaban owners against the Appellate Division verdict that ordered demolition of the major floors of the controversial building. The court, however, said the bottom seven storeys excluding the basement would stay. The latest verdict means Rajuk would slice off the rest of the 22-storey building. An Appellate Division bench of five judges led by Justice Md Fazlul Karim handed down the verdict at 9:20am after a brief hearing on the Rangs appeal. Rajuk won a drawn-out court battle over the construction of the structure and launched demolition efforts Friday amid sharp media attention. During Wednesday's hearing, Rangs counsel barrister Rafiq-ul Huq said: "Rajuk had started demolishing the building before the verdict copy reached all concerned. Damage was done. It was as if Rajuk was celebrating the Appellate Division verdict." "A number of TV channels were broadcasting comments made by individuals. People were heard saying different and confusing things like 'six floors would be kept intact' and 'seven floors may be standing at last' and so on," he said. The court said: "We have clearly mentioned in the verdict that seven bottom storeys of Rangs Bhaban, excluding the basement, will stay. The structure on top of the seven bottom floors was declared illegal." Representing the government side, attorney general Fida M Kamal said anybody misinterpreting or making errant explanations of the verdict should be charged with 'contempt of court'. After the verdict, the lawyer for Rangs said, "The Supreme Court didn't grant the stay appeal." Shakhawat Hossain, another Rangs counsel, said they would file an appeal for review of the earlier Appellate Division verdict. bdnews24.
