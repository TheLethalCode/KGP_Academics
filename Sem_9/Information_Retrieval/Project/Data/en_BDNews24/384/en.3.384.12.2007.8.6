 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel has won access to Imperial Chemical Industries' books after raising its indicative bid for the British maker of Dulux paints to 8.0 billion pounds ($16.3 billion). The two firms said on Monday that Akzo, which has teamed up with German consumer goods firm Henkel for the bid proposal, was now offering 670 pence a share in cash, up 3 percent from the 650 pence a share rejected by ICI last week. Buying ICI would strengthen Akzo's leading position in the world's $85-billion-a-year coatings industry, giving it a market share of about 15 percent and increasing its exposure in North America and emerging markets, as well as in decorative coatings. But some analysts think Akzo, which makes Crown paints, is offering a full price and could face opposition from its shareholders. It could also face a bid battle, after a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that US group Dow Chemical was interested in bidding for ICI. At 0940 GMT, ICI shares were up 1.2 percent at 639 pence, while Akzo was down 0.3 percent at 59.39 euros and Henkel was down 1.8 percent to 36.30 euros. Petercam analyst Jan Van den Bosshe said gaining access to ICI's books was an important step as it could allow Akzo to identify more synergies. "More synergies can also make the bid price more acceptable to Akzo shareholders," he wrote in a research note. Akzo initially proposed a bid at 600 pence a share for ICI in June, and then teamed up with Henkel, the maker of Persil detergents in Germany, for its last two proposals. If the deal goes ahead, Henkel will buy ICI's adhesives and electronic materials units for 2.7 billion pounds. Britain's Takeover Panel has set Akzo a deadline of Thursday to make a firm offer for ICI or walk away. GETTING THE CHEMISTRY RIGHT "The board of ICI has agreed that Akzo can undertake certain limited due diligence, which ICI expects to be completed within a few days," ICI said in a statement. ICI shareholders would also receive a 4.95 pence per share interim dividend under the bid proposal and a second interim dividend of up to 5 pence paid on a pro rata basis from July 1 to the date of completion. ICI, Britain's biggest chemicals company, has long been tipped as a bid target after slimming down to focus on higher-margin paints and adhesives. "Akzo Nobel was able to make this increased proposal after further discussions with both ICI and Henkel," Akzo said in a statement. At 670 pence a share, Akzo is offering over 12 times ICI's estimated earnings, which some analysts said was a high price. "It is important to note that any deal would have to be approved by Akzo's shareholders, which is by no means assured in our opinion," Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. However, analysts also said that Henkel was offering a high price for the part it wants, which would help Akzo's cause. Henkel said it expected to make annual synergy savings of between 240 million and 260 million euros ($332-360 million) from the ICI businesses it hopes it buy. It said it would fund its part of the deal with debt and/or equity capital and was also looking into divesting non-core assets. Goldman Sachs analysts forecast Akzo could achieve around 260 million euros of synergy benefits from buying ICI. DuPont, Germany's BASF and India's Reliance have also been tipped by analysts as potential bidders for I
