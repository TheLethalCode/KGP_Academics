 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears of a global credit squeeze and jitters about US economic strength swept across financial markets on Monday, shaking up stocks, knocking the dollar to a 15-year low and sending oil down more than $1.25 a barrel. Wall Street, which took a beating on Friday, looked set to open higher but European and Japanese shares were down and emerging market shares slumped. MSCI's emerging market share index lost around 1.6 percent. Heightened concerns for economic growth knocked some commodities. with benchmark Brent crude oil down $1.28 a barrel at $73.47. At one point, Shanghai copper futures also lost 3 percent. "People must accept that the market is headed towards a period of correction, and that it's going to take some time before we see a pickup," said Lim Chang-gue, a fund manager at Samsung Investment Trust Management in Seoul. "A credit crunch is spreading fast, and once started, it won't be easy to reverse," he added. Markets are being shaken by the prospect that the borrowing that drives the financial system will either become prohibitively expensive or dry up completely as a result of risk repricing. This began with difficulties and losses in the U.S. subprime -- or risky -- mortgage business but has spread to other areas, including the mergers and acquisitions that have been a main driver of stocks markets. Several companies have delayed or withdrawn planned offerings of shares, bonds or loans. There are also concerns about the stability of the financial sector. Monday's ructions, for example, followed sharp losses on Wall Street on Friday after ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned that mortgage credit problems could hurt investment bank Bear Stearns' profits. Bear Stearns, which was one of the first to be hit by the subprime upheaval, said it was weathering the storm but that credit markets were in their worst shape in two decades. US jobs data was weak and there was weaker growth in the U.S. service sector and there are concerns that a poor housing market will slow the economy's reacceleration. Stock markets were the most obvious victim of the flight from riskier assets on Monday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares recovered from earlier losses of around 1 percent to be down 0.4 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 index was 0.3 percent lower and France's CAC40 off 0.5 percent. Germany's DAX managed to gain 0.25 percent. "The turmoil in credit markets and the fear of contagion is going to mean volatility for stocks this week," said Barclays strategist Henk Potts. MSCI's emerging market share index fell 1.6 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.4 percent, leaving it nearly 8 percent off this year's peak marked in February. The broader TOPIX index lost 0.3 percent. The dollar weakened across the board on Monday, hitting a 15-year low against a basket of currencies. The dollar index dipped below the psychologically key 80.0 level before recovering, while the euro rose to within sight of its record high above $1.3850 struck two weeks ago. The euro was up a third of a percent at $1.3818. The dollar pared some of its earlier losses against the yen to stand flat on the day at 118.06 yen. "Investors are taking risk off the table," said Laura Ambroseno, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. Euro zone government bond yields weakened as demand grew. The interest rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield was down 1.2 basis points at 4.274 percent. The 10-year Bund yield was flat at 4.326 perce
