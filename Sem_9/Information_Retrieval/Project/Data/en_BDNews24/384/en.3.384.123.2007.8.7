<TITLE> US regulators sorting bad Apple over iPhone </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Martyn Warwick London, August 7 (bdnews24.com) -- A bit more gilt has rubbed off the iPhone gingerbread with the news that the New York Consumer Protection Board (NYCPB) is acting on a barrage of complaints being made by many owners of the most hyped mobile handset in history. The powerful regulator is taking Apple to task over the sealed battery the company insists in placing in the iPhone. The chairperson of the NYCPB, Mindy Bockstein, has written to Apple CEO Steve Jobs requiring him ensure that the design of the iPhone is changed to allow owners of the device to gain easy access to its battery so that they can change it for themselves. Another Apple device, the iPod, sells in its tens of millions and is enormously popular but buyers have always been infuriated about the fact that it too was designed with the battery hidden away in a sealed space. iPod users have complained for years that the batteries on their music players fail far too quickly, often in less than a year after purchase, and it costs almost as much as buying a new iPod to have the thing repaired and a new battery inserted. Indeed, consumers in the mid-west state of Illinois are so incensed that they are pursuing as case that seems likely to result in a class action suit against Apple for its restrictive practice. There are strong suspicions that Apple is ripping-off iPhone owners by charging an exorbitant amount to change the battery when it fails. The iPhone is far from inexpensive as it is. The two versions of the device currently available cost either US$499 or $599 each and Apple is charging $79 just to change the battery! On top of that there's another cost, $29 to rent a replacement phone whilst the one with the duff battery is being "maintained". Money for old rope. What is particularly annoying iPhone owners and particularly exercising the NTCPB is that Apple itself admits that the iPhone battery has a lifespan of a mere 300 charges. That means for even an ordinary user the things going to go dead within about 15 months and for a heavy user it will fall over in less that 12 months. Mindy Bockstein says, "A high-end cell phone shouldn't have to have low-end customer service and opined that Apple's replacement battery scheme (or should that be scam?) is a hidden extra $108 annual tariff tacked on to the already outrageously expensive price of the device itself. The board also wants something done about to AT&T's swingeing $175 cancellation fee for early termination of the iPhone service. Troubles are mounting elsewhere as well for that nice Mr. Jobs. In June a California advocacy group, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, filed a complaint saying that Apple knew the integrated battery design was controversial when it was introdced with the iPod and repeated with the iPhone. The group adds that Apple should therefore provide free replacement batteries for the lifetime of the handset since it the company "deliberately chose not to allow subscriber access". The iPhone's first software update is also on the way, although Apple won't say when it will be released. iPhone owners, now that the initial honeymoon period with their new handset is over, are discovering that some basic functions (such as cut and paste) aren't there and that there is a distinct lack of downloadable third party applications. Aren't walled gardens good? Especially for the operator. As the blizzard of hype at last begins to slacken into something more akin to the occasional flurry of sleet, it also becoming evident that AT&T, the sole distributor of the iPhone in the US, isn't shifting as many of the phones as it expected and said that it it would. The operator admits that activations are "below expectations" whilst Verizon, AT&T's main rival, gloatingly and gleefully revealed that the spurt of defectors it experienced when the iPhone was introduced has not only dried up but actually been reversed as customers return to the fold. When Apple reported its quarterly figures last month, it predicted that it would sell a million iPhones by the end of the current three month period. A couple of weeks ago Apple was forced to release software "patches" to paste over faults in the Phone that could allow hackers to steal data from phone users and spread spam e-mails. bdn
