<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Tuesday revived Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case proceedings, after a freeze of five years. The Appellate Division has started hearing a series of appeals for permission to move against the High Court's death sentences handed down in 2001 in the landmark case. An Appellate Division bench of Justice Tafazzal Islam, Justice Joynal Abedin and Justice Md Hasan Amin has been assigned to hear the appeals. The three-member special bench sat at 9:18am and started off with rejecting an appeal moved by a lawyer on behalf of two convicts, Bazlul Huda and Syed Faruque Rahman, for deferment of the hearing. The court proceeded with the hearing on a series of appeals for permission to move against the High Court's death sentences handed down in 2001. Advocate on record Nurul Islam said: "Abdus Sobhan, Bazlul Huda's lawyer, died and Mahbubur Rahman was engaged as his new lawyer. That's why here is the prayer for more time to allow readjustment." The court said in response, "We have reassembled here today after a long period to hear the case, not to postpone." The court then rejected the prayer for more time and said, "Let's proceed with the hearing." The court wanted to know when advocate Abdus Sobhan had died. The court said, "This case has four petitions for leave to appeal. Where are the other petitions for leave to appeal? In case we see that no lawyer has arrived to represent the petitioners, we'll go ahead." Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, representing AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed who was extradited from the US, sought the court's permission to attend the hearing. The court then asked why he sought the court's permission if he had been involved in the High Court stage of the trial. The court also asked him whether he was an enlisted lawyer with the Appellate Division. Responding to the court queries, Abdullah Al Mamun pointed to the Appellate Division rules and said, "As per the rules, I need to seek the permission of the court before proceeding further." Asked by the court if Mamun was appointed by the Supreme Court registrar to represent Mohiuddin for the hearing, he said Mohiuddin had appointed him as his lawyer. Senior advocate Abdur Razzak Khan, the lawyer for the death-sentenced convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, said: "I'll represent Shahriar Rashid Khan in this case." Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman on behalf of Syed Faruque Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed moving a prayer for postponement of the hearing said, "I received the hearing notice only Thursday. There was hardly any time left for necessary preparations. That's why we need more time." The court rejecting the deferment prayer said, "Well, everybody knew that the hearing in this case was scheduled for Tuesday. Let's first start with reading the case paper book." Nurul Islam, Bazlul Huda's advocate on record, started reading the case paper book at 9:45am. He started reading out the verdict handed down by Justice Md Ruhul Amin. Twelve of the convicts had their death sentences upheld by the High Court's final verdict on April 30, 2001. Four of them who are currently in prison filed appeals with the Appellate Division the same year. They are former army officers: Bazlul Huda, Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin Ahmed. An appeal date was originally fixed for the four for August 16, 2001. The appeal hearing was postponed eight times before it was finally dropped from the Appellate Division on March 19, 2002. AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, another former army officer, filed an appeal through jail authorities on June 24, 2007 following his extradition from the US. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated along with most members of his family on August 15, 1975. A case was filed on October 2, 199621 years after the killing. bdnew
