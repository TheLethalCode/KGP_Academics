 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team returned to their winning form, inflicting an emphatic eight-wicket defeat to their Malaysian counterparts in the rain-hit third match at the STC ground in Malaysia Monday. Batting first, Malaysia reached 108 for eight in 35.2 overs when rains stopped the play and Bangladesh were given a revised target of 102 to win in 35 overs. Rubel Hossain (four wickets) and Shuvashish Roy (three wickets) shared seven wickets to wreck the Malaysian innings. In reply, Mohammad Mithun and Ronny Talukdar remained unbeaten on 41 and 35 with Bangladesh winning in just 15 overs losing only two wickets. The Bangladesh U-19 squad, who won their first match by 10 wickets and then conceded a three-wicket defeat to their Malaysian counterparts, will play a Twenty20 match against the Malaysian national team Tuesday at the same venue. bdn
