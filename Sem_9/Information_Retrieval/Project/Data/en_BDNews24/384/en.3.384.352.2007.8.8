 TAIPEI, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian is to visit Central America to shore up diplomatic ties as China pressures countries in the region to abandon an island Beijing claims as its own. Chen, accompanied by Foreign Minister James Huang, would attend the Taiwan-Central American and Dominican Republic Leaders Summit in Honduras to discuss energy and environmental issues, said ministry spokesman David Wang. Chen, who will visit the region this month, would also hold private meetings with leaders of participating Latin American countries, Wang said. In June, Costa Rica cut ties with Taiwan after 63 years and set up relations with China, focusing Taiwan's attention on a region that was once loyal to Taipei. The switch cut Taiwan's diplomatic allies to 24, mostly small countries in poor regions, compared to China's 170. Beijing, which has considered Taiwan as part of their territory since the end of the Chinese civil war 1949, seeks to isolate Taiwan internationally and pressure it into reunification. Taiwan on Wednesday also protested against China's rejection of a letter from Chen to the UN Security Council requesting UN membership. China regularly slams Taiwan's fruitless attempts to join the United Nations and last month accused Chen of trying to split the nation and labelling him "scum". The United Nations rejected Taiwan's latest application in July, citing Beijing's "one China" policy that says there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it
