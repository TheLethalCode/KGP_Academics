<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho and Kaka were recalled by Brazil on Tuesday for this month's friendly against Algeria, despite declining to take part in last month's Copa America. However, coach Dunga said the pair had squandered a chance to add another title to their respective careers after Brazil won the tournament in Venezuela, beating arch-rivals Argentina 3-0 in the final. "They missed out on winning a title and each player who wins a championship with the Brazil gets more recognition," said Dunga. "They missed their chance, now we are starting again and it's up to them." The match on Aug. 22 in Montpellier, France, is the first since the Copa America. Kaka and Ronaldinho asked to skip the Copa because they said they were tired after a long season in Europe. Their request, heavily criticised in Brazil, apparently went against the philosophy of the coach, who has demanded total dedication from his players since taking over last year. However, Dunga said: "I'm not angry with anyone. The coach of Brazil has to think for the good of the Brazilian team... we take the best decisions for the team." The pair were among a 22-man squad named for the match, the first against the North Africans since the 1986 World Cup when Brazil won 1-0. Ronaldo, yet to be selected by Dunga, was again left out. Squad: Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter Milan), Doni (AS Roma) Defenders: Daniel Alves (Sevilla), Alex Silva (Sao Paulo), Gilberto (Hertha Berlin), Juan (AS Roma), Kleber (Santos), Lucio (Bayern Munich), Maicon (Inter Milan) Midfielder: Diego (Werder Bremen), Lucas (Liverpool), Elano (Manchester City), Kaka (AC Milan), Naldo (Werder Bremen), Julio Baptista (Real Madrid), Mineiro (Hertha Berlin), Josue (Sao Paulo), Fernando (Girondins Bordeaux), Forwards: Robinho (Real Madrid), Ronaldinho (Barcelona), Rafeal Sobis (Betis), Vagner Love (CSKA Mosco
