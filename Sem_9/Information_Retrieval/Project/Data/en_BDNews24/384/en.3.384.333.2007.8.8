 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three World Cup host cities will be allowed to use proposed name changes on official tournament documents and tickets for the 2010 finals, the Local Organising Committee (LOC) said on Tuesday. Pretoria will now be known as Tshwane, the name of the municipal district containing South Africa's capital, Bloemfontein becomes Manguang and Port Elizabeth will be called Nelson Mandela Bay. The LOC said it had agreed with the world governing body FIFA that the new names would be used within South Africa. Outside the country, a combination of both the old and new names will be used to avoid confusion. Tuesday's announcement comes days after the opposition parties said they would be seeking legal action to stop the proposed changes In March, South Africa's top appeals court ordered the government to resume using the old name for one of the country's towns in a setback for efforts to expunge apartheid-era names
