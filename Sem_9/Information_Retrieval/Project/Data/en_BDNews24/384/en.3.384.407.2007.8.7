<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP 'reformists' Tuesday said they were not thinking about council meeting at the moment in the wake of countrywide flooding and would rather distribute relief in the flood-hit areas. A joint statement signed also by BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan was read out after a meeting of former lawmakers at his Gulshan home. BNP's standing committee member and former army chief Mahbubur Rahman said: "The secretary general called upon leaders and activists of the party to stand by the flood victims in their own areas." "Due to the emergency, we will assist the people simply as Bangladeshi nationals, not under any party banner." "We will do whatever is needed. We do not want to mix party politics with floods." "The flooding is our major concern. We are not thinking about the council right now. The council will take place when the right time comes," he said citing the statement. BNP adviser Enam Ahmed Chowdhury added: "This is not the time to do politics. We have to come forward to help the people." "The aim of our reforms is to prepare the BNP for the upcoming elections in 2008. We have to bring changes to the party as required. If reform does not take place, we will be swept aside in the elections," he said. bdnews24
