 DUBLIN, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aer Lingus on Tuesday launched its first base outside the Republic of Ireland, at Belfast, in a bid to boost growth prospects for the former state airline. Aer Lingus said three A320 Airbus aircraft would be based at Belfast International airport in Northern Ireland, and will primarily serve London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. "The new base gives the potential for up to one million new passengers per year and will comprise a total investment of 150 million euros ($206.9 million)," it said in a statement. Aer Lingus said it would transfer valuable Heathrow slots from Shannon airport in Ireland to Belfast. "In the current climate Aer Lingus believes the Belfast Heathrow services present an accelerated growth opportunity, using its available fleet and slot resources," it said. The move has proved unpopular with the company's workers, expecting job losses, who heckled Chief Executive Dermot Mannion during the meeting with staff in Shannon, Irish media reported. "This has been a very difficult and sensitive commercial decision for Aer Lingus to make," Mannion told reporters on Tuesday after the meeting. "We have limited availability both in terms of aircraft and slots at Heathrow." Aer Lingus has been battling with unions to cut overheads after its privatisation last year. A company spokesman said a total of eight short-haul routes from Belfast would be launched and included flights to Barcelona, Geneva, Budapest and Malaga, together with London and Amsterdam. The carrier's shares were 0.8 percent higher by 1257 GMT in thin trade, compared with a 1.8 percent gain for the wider Irish market. Aer Lingus has used funds raised from its initial public offering (IPO) to expand its fleet of Airbus aircraft as part of its growth plan, which includes more long-haul routes to the United States. The company said in June it was on track to meet market expectations of mid-teen operating profit growth for 2007. RYANAIR The airline continues to face a challenge from its bigger Irish rival Ryanair. In June the European Commission blocked a takeover bid for Aer Lingus by Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier. "The cutting of Shannon-London Heathrow demonstrates Aer Lingus' focus on profit as it comes under pressure to deliver following last year's IPO," NCB analyst Neil Glynn wrote in a research note. "Ryanair is performing well from Shannon to UK destinations and this development shows the intense competition Aer Lingus is facing." The Aer Lingus spokesman said three Heathrow slots from Shannon will be transferred to Belfast, with four slots to be used at peak times of the year. The Heathrow route will begin in January 2008, with some flights from Belfast starting in December this year, the spokesman added. Aer Lingus will still fly to the United States and Dublin from Shannon airpo
