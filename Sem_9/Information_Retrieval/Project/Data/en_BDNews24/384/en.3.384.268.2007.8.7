 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is taking preparation for holding the election in three months in line with the FIFA guidelines in view of resignation of federation general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal. "We are preparing for holding a fair and acceptable election in next three months according to the FIFA guidelines, keeping country's image intact," BFF president SA Sultan told reporters at the BFF House Tuesday. The BFF is now waiting for the National Sports Council (NSC)'s approval for their draft statutes to form football associations in all 64 districts before holding the BFF election. "The NSC is now examining the statutes and may respond in a couple of days," said BFF general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal, who had his last office Tuesday.He submitted his resignation two weeks ago. In this regard, an emergency meeting of the BFF will be held on Wednesday to discuss Helal's resignation and it is almost clear that deputy secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu will act as general secretary. The four-year tenure of the Sultan-Helal committee expired in April and the FIFA extended their time until the next election and advised them to form the football associations in all districts in one year. "I have tendered my resignation after thinking a lot and I don't want to continue anymore," said Helal, who might join the meeting Wednesday, adding that he would return to Mohammedan SC , his root from where he has emerged as an organiser. Talking to the reporters, Helal said his realisation during his stint was that football should be developed at the grassroot level instead of the national level. He, however, is happy to lay the foundation of the school football league, scheduled to start this month, though he could not spread the school league across the country. To make the football federation more dynamic, Helal believed that the BFF secretariat, marketing, technical and coaching departments should be professionalised. Asked whether he would contest the BFF election in future, Helal said that he now wants to take rest and would think of this later.
