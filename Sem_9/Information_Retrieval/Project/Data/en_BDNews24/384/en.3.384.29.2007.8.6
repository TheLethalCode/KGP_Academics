 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Workers from the readymade garments industry Monday voiced concern over the focus of recent research into the industry by the Centre for Policy Dialogue. Readymade garments workers highlighted several shortcomings they saw in the nongovernmental think-tank's study, including its findings on the status of women in the sector and the implementation of minimum wage rules. Speaking at a discussion held in the CIRDAP auditorium, garment workers' leader Shamima Hafiz said: "The research had not brought the most important issues to the fore." "You have presented inaccurate data and concealed important facts in your research. Female workers are supposed to get four-month maternal leave. But most of the workers don't get that." CPD's executive director Debapriya Bhattachariya said: "A greater number of RMG workers are getting maternal leave." Debapriya went on to concede some of the points the workers raised. "Ten percent of sub-contracting factories still lock workers into the factory. In addition there are no toilet facilities in 90 percent of those factories." "The research shows that although there has been some positive restructuring in the RMG sector, female workers are still getting lower wages than their male counterparts." "The study also reveals that the larger factories are providing better facilities than previously, with an improvement in the overall working environment," he said. CPD's research data is drawn from a study of 87 RMG workers55 of them womenfrom 41 factories in Dhaka and Chittagong. The total number of RMG factories in Bangladesh stood at 3,560 in 2006, according to a survey. A garment factory worker, Shamima Nasrin, asked: "How can you draw such positive conclusions by surveying only 41 factories out of about 4,000 factories." "The research has not shown any findings on the construction of daycare centre's, for the children of RMG workers," she said. "You have called RMG workers illiterate. I object to that. They are perhaps less educated, but certainly not illiterate." Aminul Islam, another garment worker, added: "You have not mentioned whether workers enjoy any trade union rights in the garment factories." The government fixed the minimum wage at Tk 1,662.50 a month in August 2006. RMG worker Shahidul Islam told the meeting: "The owners have not implemented the tripartite agreement on minimum wages yet." Labour and employment adviser Anwarul Iqbal said: "Thirty-eight RMG factories have not implemented the minimum wage as of June 30 this year." "Legal action has been brought against them, although the time for implementing that agreement has now been extended up to August 31," he said. bdn
