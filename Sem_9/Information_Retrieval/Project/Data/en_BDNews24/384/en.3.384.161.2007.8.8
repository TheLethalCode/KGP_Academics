<TEXT>
 Nilphamari, August 08 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim Wednesday asked people to wage a social movement to rein in soaring prices of daily essentials, partly blamed on middlemen. The adviser conceded that government efforts to control the prices of essentials had not been completely successful. "Consumers have to pay much higher than the prices at which farmers sell," the adviser said at a meeting with representatives of civil society and the district administration in Nilphamari. Referring to the prices of green chillies in kitchen market in Dhaka, the adviser said that city dwellers had to pay Tk 150 for a kg of the item whereas farmers sold it at much lower prices. "It would not worry us if the money went to the farmers. The middlemen have been looting this money," he added. He asked people to come forward to stop "this vested group". Karim said the government had taken necessary steps to keep the prices of essentials tolerable in the month of Ramadan. The district administrators apprised the adviser of the flood situation in the district and he asked them to carry out their responsibility of distributing relief properly. After the meeting, Karim visited the flood-hit Teesta Barrage area. bdnews
