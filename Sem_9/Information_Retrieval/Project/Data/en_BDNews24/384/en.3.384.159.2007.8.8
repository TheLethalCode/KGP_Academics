<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 8 (bdnews24.com) - The government is set to sell part of its stake in the IFIC Bank, a top official said Wednesday. According to the plan, the government will offload 8.5 percent or 1,20,000 shares out of its holdings of 35 percent or over 14,00,000 shares in the bank. "It's a welcoming move when the demand side is high now. Supply of issues should be increased considering the long-term development of the market," SEC chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi told bdnews24.com. The government has already appointed Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, a state-run investment bank, as manager of the issue. The move came in line with a decision on offloading of shares of state-run enterprises in power, energy and banks. A senior official with the ICB, who wished to remain unnamed, said IFIC shares were still paper-based and needed to be converted into market lot. "Shares of IFIC need to be divided into market lot. If the government decides to demat (dematerialise) the shares through CDBL, it will be possible to automatically convert them," he said. "We have already informed the government on the matter," he added. The official failed to say when the shares would hit the market. "It depends on how fast the government moves," he said. IFIC Bank was listed on the stock market in 1986 with a total of 40, 63, 861 shares. The book value of each share is at Tk 100. Sponsor shareholders of IFIC Bank hold 34 percent stakes while general or public holdings account for 31 percent shares of the bank, according to Dhaka Stock Exchange. Shares of IFIC are now traded as Z or low-quality shares due to its failure to hold annual general meetings for three years since 2003 because of a legal wrangle in the court. The High Court however has ordered the bank to hold pending AGMs. Following the court directive, it posted 30 percent stock dividends for three years since 2003. The bank also announced 24 percent stock dividends for 2006. IFIC, with a total share capital of Tk 406 million, also received permission from the central bank to raise its authorised capital to Tk 1.6 billion from Tk 500 million. bd
