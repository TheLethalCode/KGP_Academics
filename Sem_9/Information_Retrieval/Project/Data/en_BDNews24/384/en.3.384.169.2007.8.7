 Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com) The Supreme Court Tuesday closed the first day's proceedings of the Bangabandhu murder case that saw light after a freeze of more than five years. The court continues the proceedings Wednesday. The Appellate Division Tuesday started hearing a series of appeals for permission to move against the High Court's death sentences handed down in 2001 in the landmark case that had been ignored for years. The independence leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated along with most members of his family on August 15, 1975 at his Dhanmondi home. His two daughters, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, were spared since they were abroad on the deadly night of the brutal murders. Some of the killers, however, proclaimed through foreign media that they had killed Bangabandhu and his family members. But the subsequent governments had spared them from being tried for years. Some of them were rewarded with overseas jobs at foreign missions. A case was filed on October 2, 199621 years after the historic killing and it was only after Hasina came to power. The High Court in 2001 upheld death sentences of 12 convicts in the case but the subsequent legal proceedings remained thwarted after the Khaleda Zia-led four-party coalition came to power in October 2001. The emergency government finally decided to revive the proceedings, and a three-member special panel of Justice Tafazzal Islam, Justice Joynal Abedin and Justice Md Hasan Amin revived the course of law at 9:18am Tuesday. They started off with rejecting an appeal moved by a lawyer on behalf of two convicts, Bazlul Huda and Syed Faruque Rahman, for deferral of the hearing. Advocate on record Nurul Islam said: "Abdus Sobhan, Bazlul Huda's lawyer, died and Mahbubur Rahman was appointed as his new lawyer. But Rahman suffered a heart attack. That's why here is the prayer for more time to allow readjustment." The court said in response: "We have reassembled here today after a long period to hear the case, not to postpone." The court then rejected the prayer for time extension and said: "Let's proceed." The court wanted to know when advocate Abdus Sobhan had died. The court said, "This case has four petitions for leave to appeal. Where are the other petitions? In case we see that no lawyer has arrived to represent the petitioners, we'll go ahead." Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, representing AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed who was extradited from the US, sought the court's permission to attend the hearing. The court then asked why he had sought the court's permission if he was involved in the High Court stage of the trial. The court also asked him whether he was an enlisted lawyer with the Appellate Division. Responding to the court queries, Mamun pointed to the Appellate Division rules and said, "As per the rules, I need to seek the permission of the court before proceeding further." Asked by the court if Mamun was appointed by the Supreme Court registrar to represent Mohiuddin for the hearing, he said Mohiuddin had appointed him as his lawyer. Senior advocate Abdur Razzak Khan, the lawyer for the death-sentenced convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, said: "I'll represent Shahriar Rashid Khan in this case." Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman on behalf of Syed Faruque Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed moving a prayer for postponement of the hearing said: "I received the hearing notice only Thursday. There was hardly any time left for necessary preparations. That's why we need more time." The court rejecting the deferral prayer said: "Well, everybody knew that the hearing in this case was scheduled for Tuesday. Let's first start with reading the case paper book." Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, Bazlul Huda's advocate on record, started reading the case paper book at 9:45am. He started reading out the verdict handed down by Justice Md Ruhul Amin. The court adjourned the hearing of the case and decided to continue it Wednesday after Bhuiyan read 123 pages of the paper book. After the adjournment, Bhuiyan told reporters that he told the court that the convicts did not gave their confessional statements willingly. Conspiracies are there, he said. Deputy attorney general Syed Haider Ali told reporters that reading out the whole paper book was necessary before the opposing lawyers place their arguments before the court. Twelve of the convicts had their death sentences upheld by the High Court's final verdict on April 30, 2001. Four of them who are currently in prison filed appeals with the Appellate Division the same year. They are former army officers: Bazlul Huda, Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin Ahmed. An appeal date was originally fixed for the four for August 16, 2001. The appeal hearing was postponed eight times before it was finally dropped from the Appellate Division on March 19, 2002. AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, another former army officer, filed an appeal through jail authorities on June 24, 2007 following his extradition from the US. bdnews24
