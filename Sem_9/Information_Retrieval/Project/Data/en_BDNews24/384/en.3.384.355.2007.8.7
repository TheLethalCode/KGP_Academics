 Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka stocks shook off jitters from a regulator probe in midday trade Tuesday, buoyed by a fresh buying into bank, power and pharmaceuticals shares. Fears of the Securities and Exchange Commission's sanctions on merchant banks' unbridled margin loans triggered selling pressure in the last two days. The market returned from losses in the morning session to take advantage of a price fall. The DGEN or general index added 16.55 points or 0.71 percent to stand at 2325.22 at 11.33am. The DSI or all-share price index climbed 13.56 points or 0.71 percent to 1900.90. Turnover stood at Tk 359.26 million in morning trade. Total turnover was Tk 1.34 billion at Monday's close. Gainers beat losers 107 to 33. Some 13 issues held steady. Summit Power, the mostly traded issue until 11.33am, moved up to Tk 1,300 from Monday's close at Tk 1,291, reporting that it had signed an agreement for syndicated loan facility of Tk 3.88 billion under zero coupon bonds. The fund will be used to establish four small power plants with 110 MW total generation capacity, it said. UCBL rose for a third day to trade at Tk 3,910 from Tk 3,624.5 after it said it would hold its annual general meetings, pending for five years from 1998 to 2002. A court case had earlier barred the bank to hold AGMs. UCBL also posted 30 percent stock dividends for 2002. Buying pressure pulled Square Pharma up at Tk 5,176 from Tk 5,144.75. Square had earlier said it would raise its authorised capital up to Tk 5.0 billion from Tk 1.0 billion. BRAC Bank rose to Tk 934.5 from Tk 925.25. Prime Bank increased to Tk 773 from Tk 761.35. Buying pressure also pulled the remaining top issues National Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Olympic, AB Bank and Social Investment Bank up in turnover. bd
