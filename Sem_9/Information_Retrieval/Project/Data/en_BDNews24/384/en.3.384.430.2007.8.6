 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) - Business leaders Monday hailed a government decision not to question people on the source of aid to flood-affected people. They said the move would encourage the people to involve more in relief activities. Communications adviser MA Matin, also the chairman of the coordination committee on checking serious crimes, told reporters Monday that he did not understand black money or white money regarding help to the flood-affected. "What is important is to serve the suffering people," Matin said. "I think businessmen will now come forward to help the flood victims as they had done in facing previous natural disasters, including floods," Anawar-Ul Alam Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com. He said that businesspersons were not coming up to help the flood affected-people fearing the tax issue. "I have heard that many businessmen are fearing for that," the BGMEA president said. President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Mir Nasir Hossain said the adviser's clear-cut talk on aiding the flood victims might encourage businessmen to come forward. "A tax relief could encourage the businessmen in this regard," Nasir told bdnews24.com. Welcoming the decision, Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the move would remove confusion among people afraid to help the victims. However, he asked the government to be flexible on the channel of distributing aid by individuals. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday urged those who wanted to contribute to the relief work to donate to the chief adviser's relief fund or to contribute to the relief funds formed in different areas. "This restriction should be relaxed," Hoque told bdnews24.com. bd
