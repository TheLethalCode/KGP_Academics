 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Nine advisers of the emergency government have specifically been tasked with monitoring relief and rehabilitation work in flood-affected districts, the government said in a statement Monday. Each adviser has been assigned to do the job separately to smooth relief work and rehabilitation, according to the statement. The distribution of the new duties came amid reports that the government lagged in rushing relief to flood victims. The situation has become grave as political parties, social organisations and rich individuals are off the scene. The statement said the advisers would also work to engage local people and various organisations, including NGOs. Information and law Adviser Mainul Hosein has been assigned to monitor Satkhira, Narail, Barisal, Khulna, Faridpur, Magura and Jhenidah districts while finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam will take care of Bogra, Sirajganj, Rajshahi, Pabna, Chuadanga and Natore. Communications adviser MA Matin got the assignment for Brahmanbaria, Comilla and Feni while disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury for Sherpur, Jamalpur and Tangail. Industry adviser Geteeara Safiya Choudhury has been tasked with responsibilities for Rajbari, Shariatpur, Madaripur, Manikganj and Munshiganj. Education advisor Ayub Quadri will oversee Mymensingh, Netrakona and Kishoreganj districts while Dhaka, Narsinghdi, Narayanganj and Gazipur come under local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury will look after Sylhet and Sunamganj, and agriculture adviser Chowdhury Sajjadul Karim will monitor Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Rangpur, Gaibandha and Nilphamari. Health adviser Matiur Rahman has been left out of duty as he is abroad. bdnews2
