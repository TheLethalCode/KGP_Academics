 LONDON, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The financial market rollercoaster hurtled along on Tuesday with European stocks soaring as expectations rose that the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates this year. Oil prices firmed slightly but stayed below $72 a barrel after being battered by worries that the U.S. economy may slow. The dollar was steady. Wall Street looked set to open flat ahead of a Fed meeting later in the day, after a sharp Monday rally followed a Friday of bloodletting. While the Fed was expected to leave rates at 5.25 percent, bets on an eventual easing have been increasing and investors were looking for comment on recent market volatility. There is a view in some circles that central banks may step in to help if problems with global credit markets become worse. "No-one is expecting the Fed to move rates (on Tuesday) but the statement will be very, very important," said Mitul Kotecha, head of global foreign exchange research at Calyon. "It seems that they will maintain that the inflation risk is predominant, but markets are looking for any comments whatsoever on the state of the debacle in credit markets." Signals that the U.S. economy may be picking up speed more slowly than expected and fears that trouble in the U.S. subprime -- or risky -- mortgage sector will prompt a global credit crunch have shaken investors over recent weeks. Investment bank UBS calculates equity risk aversion to be at "extreme" levels and currency risk appetite to be near historical lows. One result has been a sharp increase in volatility. The S&P 500, for example, lost nearly 2.7 percent on Friday but rose 2.4 percent on Monday. That spilled over into Europe on Tuesday where stocks were rebounding from a 4-month low. The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 1.2 1 percent after falling 0.9 percent on Monday. The index, however, is still around 7 percent off the 6-1/2 year peak set on July 13 before the deterioration in the U.S. subprime market hit investor confidence in the credit markets. London's FTSE 100 index rose 1.2 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX gained 0.8 percent and the Paris CAC 40 rose 1.6 percent. MSCI's main emerging market stock index was up 0.2 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei inched up 0.04 percent or 7.31 points to 16,921.77. The broader TOPIX shed 0.47 percent to 1,660.16. Oil steadied after Monday's mean 5 percent slide, supported by the rebound in equity markets and expectations for a fifth weekly drop in U.S. crude inventories. Current benchmark Brent crude gained 45 cents to $71.62. The dollar edged up against a basket of major currencies ahead of the Fed meeting. Prospects of the Fed staying on hold for some time or cutting have hit the greenback hard recently. The dollar index was up 0.1 percent at 80.361, after falling below the psychologically key 80.0 level on Monday to a 15-year low. It was little changed against the yen at 118.72 yen, after setting a four-month trough on Monday and the euro was steady at $1.3787, within sight of its record peak just above $1.3850. Euro zone government bond yields rose as stock markets rallied and eroded a bid for safe haven investments. Benchmark 10-year cash yields were 2.4 basis points up at 4.348 percent while the two-year Schatz yield was at 4.308 percent, up 1.7 basis poin
