<TITLE> Hollywood producers to make film about HIV medics </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SOFIA, Mon Aug 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hollywood filmmakers hope to bring to the big screen the eight-year ordeal of six foreign medics convicted of deliberately injecting 460 Libyan children with the HIV virus. Sixth Sense Productions Inc, which helped raise funding for Oscar-nominated genocide drama "Hotel Rwanda", said the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor had signed over their life rights for the film project "The Benghazi Six". The medics, who were sentenced to death, were freed on July 24 after the European Union brokered a cooperation deal with Libya following years of complex legal and political battles. The medical workers have always maintained their innocence and said they were tortured into confessing to intentionally starting an epidemic in which hundreds of children were infected with the virus that causes AIDS while working in Libya's second biggest city of Benghazi in 1998. "The story of 'The Benghazi Six' is ... inspirational having the six medics survive what they survived in prison throughout the years and lived to see their freedom," said Sam Feuer, president of development and production at Sixth Sense. "The world needs to learn about this injustice. It's not just a Bulgarian story, its a human story that the world will relate to and learn from," he told Reuters by email on Sunday. The EU, which Bulgaria joined in January, and the United Sates had pushed for the medic's release, pointing to evidence of torture and studies showing the epidemic started before the nurses arrived at the Benghazi's children hospital. Although focused on the medics, the film will also show the tragedy of the children infected with the virus, Feuer said. More than 50 of the children have died. Sixth Sense is in talks with Ann Peacock, who wrote the screenplay adaptation of the children's fantasy blockbuster "The Chronicles of Narnia", to write the script for the medics film, Feuer said. The company is also interviewing directors. "Hollywood stars will star in it. Our job is to develop the best script possible that will attract them," said Feuer. Sixth Sense producers will come to Sofia to meet the medics and their families once the company lines up a screenwriter. The medics said they were glad their ordeal might be shown one day on the big screen. "The world will see the truth. The world must see the truth. Such a case doesn't happen every day," said Dr Zdravko Georgiev, husband of one of the nurses. He was acquitted in the HIV case in 2004, but not allowed to leave the country until last month. The Bulgarian nurses and Georgiev left the relatively poor Balkan country in the late 1990s to work in Libya where medical workers' salaries were higher. Nineteen Bulgarian medics were detained in early 1999 and 13 were later released. Western scientists have said Libya's inefficient health-care system was the real culprit for the HIV infection. Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov pardoned the nurses and the Palestinian doctor, who recently took Bulgarian citizenship, after they arrived in Sofia two weeks ago. The medics return to Bulgaria closed what Libya's critics called a human rights scandal and advanced the long-isolated north African country's efforts to normalize ties with the We
