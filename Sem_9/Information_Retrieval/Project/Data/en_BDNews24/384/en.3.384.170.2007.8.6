 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday said the current flood situation could be tackled without a global appeal for aid. Speaking to reporters at the foreign ministry, he said: "Unless it is a grave humanitarian emergency it is difficult to generate a multilateral appeal to the world." "In fact, in such a situation it is better to discuss such assistance bilaterally rather than going through the UN system," he said. "We have to face floods that come almost every year now in a systemic manner. "We can discuss with the world's key players who deal with floods to draw up a permanent roadmap to deal with the natural calamity," said the foreign adviser. Following a press briefing on the outcome of the Asean regional meeting in Manila, which he attended recently, the adviser answered reporters' questions on the flood crisis. "We do not require foreign assistance for the moment. If we can pool our resources, I believe we can tide over the flood situation," said the adviser. However, Chowdhury went on to say that since Sunday three countries had committed relief funds for the flood situation. "The UK will give $2.5 million, the Canadian government is to give 250,000 Canadian dollars and the Turkish government will give $100,000. More funds may be contributed in the days to come," said the adviser. In addition India has offered 40,000 tonnes of rice, 10,000 tonnes of wheat and 1,000 tonnes of milk powder. Germany has also committed through the World Food Programme a sum of $658,000. "We have not yet appealed for any foreign help and so far we have not yet decided whether to appeal for assistance at all in the future. However, if any donor offers to help we would not refuse," Chowdhury said. Earlier, the foreign adviser said that Bangladesh had signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Manila, which will open the door of cooperation with South East Asian countries. The treaty envisages peace, stability and development to which Bangladesh is committed, the foreign adviser had said in his speech at the Asean Regional Forum (ARF). The adviser said during his stay in Manila, he had a significant meeting with Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi in which they had discussed the possibility of a Bangladesh-Myanmar-China highway network. The foreign adviser also met with US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte who welcomed the ongoing political reforms in Bangladesh. bdnews
