<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) has finally made 418 unwilling former lawmakers pay Tk 4 crore in outstanding phone bills until July 31. The state-run telecoms provider's internal report reveals that it has realised Tk 1.72 crore by serving legal notices and Tk 2.34 crore after filing cases against the former members of parliament who deliberately defaulted on clearing the bills. "Some Tk 2.34 crore has so far been collected from some 169 lawmakers after filing the cases," a senior BTTB official, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "Additional Tk 1.72 crore was collected after issuing notices against the defaulters." "Such move has by far worked very well," another BTTB official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com. The telecoms provider still buckles under Tk 9.13 crore in bills unpaid by some 801 parliamentarians since independence. Many of the legislators have died but BTTB is pressing their families to pay the outstanding bills. It intensified its bill collection drive after the BNP-led coalition government ended its five-year term on Oct 28 last year. The board has so far filed 338 cases to recover years-old pending bills amounting to Tk 5.75 crore. BTTB's overall revenue collection has also risen Tk 350 crore to Tk 1,666 crore in the fiscal 2006-07 compared with the previous year, official statistics said. But it is way short of the revised revenue target of Tk 1,822 crore. According to official data, BTTB raised some Tk 619 crore in revenues in the first half of the previous fiscal. It however received Tk 1,047 crore in the second half because of the makeshift government's drive against corruption, officials said. bd
