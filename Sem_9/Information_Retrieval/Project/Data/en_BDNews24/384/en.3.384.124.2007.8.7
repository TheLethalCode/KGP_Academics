 LONDON, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Camelot Group Plc was selected to continue operating Britain's National Lottery for a further 10 years from 2009 on Tuesday after it won a two-horse race to become the preferred bidder. Camelot, owned by Royal Mail, De La Rue, Cadbury Schweppes, Thales and Japan's Fujitsu, has run Britain's lottery since its inception in 1994. Camelot beat Sugal & Damani, which has businesses ranging from diamonds to tourism and Indian lotteries and was the only firm to make a rival bid. The National Lottery Commission, which announced the decision, has said that the preferred bidder must improve technology systems and show it is has ideas for new games to increase lottery sales. It has yet to agree details of the licence with Camelot. Camelot said in February it had signed a deal with Ticketmaster, part of IAC/InterActiveCorp, the world's largest provider of tickets for sports, music and theatre, to sell such tickets through lottery terminals but that the deal was dependent on winning the licence. Camelot has also signed a deal with Endemol UK, part of Dutch TV company Endemol, as a strategic partner to work on new approaches to showing lottery draws on TV as well as developing a range of interactive content. Camelot had lottery sales of 4.91 billion pounds in the year to end-March, with almost 1.25 billion pounds going to charities and other causes. At its peak it had sales of around 5 billion pounds. Averaged out over the current seven-year licence period, of every pound spent on the National Lottery, half is paid out in prizes, 28 pence is given to causes, 12 pence goes to the government in lottery duty and 5 pence covers retailers' commission. Camelot takes 4.5 pence in operating costs and its shareholders get the final halfpen
