<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  A senior prisons official late Monday went to visit Wazed Miah who has been suffering from multiple complications and now being treated in the city's Square Hospital. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqi went to see Miah on request from the nuclear scientist's wife Sheikh Hasina. Siddiqi then met Hasina at the special jail on the parliament building premises to let her know about her husband's latest physical condition. Hasina has been in the jail since July 16 pending trial in a case that involves charges of extortion. "Wazed Miah is very sick and he finds it difficult to recognise people. But his physical condition is stable now," Siddiqi told bdnews24.com after meeting Hasina. "He can read newspapers," he said. Siddiqi said he promptly responded to the request of the former prime minister as she requested him to visit her husband personally. Hasina separately wrote to the prisons authority on Aug.4 to allow her to visit her husband in the hospital. On whether Miah asked anything about his wife during his visit, the official said: "Well, we didn't talk about things like that. He couldn't recognise me." On what decision the jail authority is going to take on Hasina's appeal to see her husband, Siddiqi said: "We've sent the application to the ministry of home affairs. We are waiting for the reply." bdnews24
