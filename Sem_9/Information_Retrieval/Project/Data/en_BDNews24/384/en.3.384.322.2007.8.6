<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal has tendered his resignation to the BFF president citing personal reasons for his decision. "Yes, I have got the resignation of Helal today (Monday) and called an emergency meeting on Wednesday, which would decide whether his resignation would be accepted," BFF president SA Sultan told bdnews24.com Monday. There was a rumour in the sports arena for the last two weeks that the BFF general secretary was going to step aside on being requested unofficially to do so. But, he sought time till the prize- giving ceremony of the first-ever professional football league that concluded August 5, a source said. "I submitted my resignation to the BFF on July 23 or 24, as far as I remember, on personal grounds" Helal told bdnews24.com by telephone without further elaboration. The BFF president said that he had informed National Sports Council (NSC) Chairman and Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed about Helal's resignation while on the way to the Chief Adviser's office to donate money for the flood-affected people Monday. Replying to a query, Sultan said, "I had been asked to resign through an unofficial channel, but I refused, and told them that I was ready to resign if requested officially." "I have written a letter that the government can't make replacements in any post of the BFF according to FIFA guidelines. If anyone resigns, the next person would assume the post," said the BFF chief, a lawmaker of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) during the four-party alliance government. "They (government) might have contacted the AFC and the FIFA about their plan with the football federation," said Sultan. Sports Adviser to the caretaker government Tapan Chowdhury in early July said that they were going to dissolve all sports federation bodies, which were disputed, to purge the sports arena of politics. The Fakhruddin Ahmed- led caretaker government on July 29 appointed a 12-member ad-hoc committee to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) after the elected board's members resigned en masse on July 24 and 25. When asked whether other BFF officials were going to follow Helal, Sultan said that he had no information about it at the moment. The four-year tenure of the BFF executive committee, led by SA Sultan and Helal, expired on April 29 this year and the FIFA, world football governing body, extended its tenure until the next election is held. The date of the election is still to be finalised. bdn
