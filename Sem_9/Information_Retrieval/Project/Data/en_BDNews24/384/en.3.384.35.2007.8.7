<TITLE> UK foot and mouth outbreak could boost inflation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's latest tussle with foot and mouth disease is unlikely to hamper the economy greatly this year as long as a repeat of the devastating 2001 outbreak is avoided, economists say -- but it could drive prices higher. Two cattle herds in southern England have contracted the virus, triggering a European Union ban on imports of fresh meat, live animals and milk products from Britain. The outbreak will hurt Britain's $1 billion-a-year meat export industry, but the situation is a far cry from that six years ago when more than six million animals were burnt, costing rural economies an estimated 8.5 billion pounds ($17.3 billion). "The difference is that with the experience of 2001 fresh in the authorities' minds the containment and early action may help to nip this incident in the bud," said Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas. "It is still early days though." If the outbreak were to spread rapidly, affected agricultural industries -- already reeling from widespread flooding across England in the last month -- could dampen growth in Britain's trillion-pound economy. "While the full extent of the problem is not yet known ... the potential negative impact on UK GDP going forward remains a concern," said Mark Miller, an economist at HBOS. Agriculture output contributes about 1 percent of GDP. However, there is a definite risk meat prices will rise and boost overall inflation, already running above the Bank of England's two percent target, despite concerns from farming groups that prices will tumble if the public stops eating meat. Last month's floods are expected to have already piled upward pressure on vegetable and milk prices, given the damage inflicted on farms so close to harvest time. Any disruption in the meat supply chain is likely to increase that pressure, economists say, potentially keeping inflation above target for longer than the Bank of England had expected. "The biggest immediate danger in my mind is it is yet another upside risk to food," Clarke said. "In 2001 food price inflation surged." During the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, overall meat prices rose sharply as demand surged for non-red meats such as chicken and fish. Inflation in the sector turned from flat to six percent in the wake of the disaster. Even a temporary repeat of that effect this year could mean interest rates may have to rise further than anticipated if policymakers were worried expectations of higher inflation were becoming entrenched. "There may well be some upward impact on meat prices, which were already likely to be affected by the flooding pushing up the costs of animal feedstuffs," said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. That would pile on the pain for mortgage-paying home owners and debt-laden consumers already coming to terms with five interest rate hikes to 5.75 percent since last August. However the tourism industry, hit hard in 2001, looks likely to survive unscathed. "There was a significant negative impact on tourism in 2001, with substantial areas of countryside being effectively closed off and disturbing pictures being widely broadcast of large animal funeral pyres," Archer said. "The early signs are that this is unlikely to be repeated this time aroun
