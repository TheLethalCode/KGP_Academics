 NEW YORK/LONDON, August 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Growing US economic concerns may send some speculative money in oil and other commodities to the sidelines but strong fundamentals should keep prices from sliding too far. US oil prices have tumbled around 8 percent since hitting a record last Wednesday as concerns about a mortgage crisis in the world's top economy rattled credit and stock markets. The drop in global markets last week also dragged down industrial metals, with copper hit as concerns about the US housing sector raised demand worries. While the wider US economic concerns may shake out some speculative money in the near term, experts said strong demand, especially from emerging markets, should support prices. "I think the aberration will be to the downside but fundamentals are bullish and sooner or later the fundamentals will kick back in," said Jeff Shankman, managing partner at energy fund Trident Energy Managment LP. Oil and commodities prices have shot to record highs over the past four years, drawing in billions of dollars in speculative money from big funds eager to ride the wave. Burgeoning demand for oil, steel, and other commodities from China has been a key factor underpinning commodities. US crude's surge to a record high of $77.78 a barrel last week was fueled in part by a jump in speculative length over the past month as investors piled in when the market began to focus on a potential supply shortfall later this year. Some of that money may be leaving the asset class as investors look elsewhere or take short positions. But analysts say it will not be long before supply-and-demand factors again take over as market drivers. "Commodity markets are vulnerable to an extent because a lot of investment money has come into them," said Helen Henton, head of commodity research at Standard Chartered. "Nevertheless, there is fundamentally a very good reason to invest in commodities as well; the bull case in commodities still remains." "Lead and tin haven't come off very much at all in fact, fundamentals are strong," Henton added. GLOBAL DEMAND Economists said that while the mortgage problems may weigh on the US economy, strong demand growth from Asia and Europe should keep supposing prices for commodities such as oil. "The impact on global oil demand would likely be relatively limited as it is emerging markets demand that is taking over as the main driver for energy commodities as it already has for the rest of the commodities complex," Goldman Sachs said. The US dollar's slide has benefited many countries buying commodities priced in the greenback and should help sustain global growth. "Currency risk points to the deceptiveness of dollar prices as 'real' prices. The market's assessment of crude prices has been falling in euro terms and rising in yen relative to the dollar," Lehman Brothers said in a note. Investors who have traditionally looked to commodities to defuse portfolio risks associated with other asset classes -- especially through commodity indexes such as the S&P GSCI -- may also increase their positions in the case of a wider slowdown in the US economy, analysts said. "The SPGSCI Energy Index has the largest negative correlation with the S&P 500 suggesting, in our view, that this sector is likely to be vulnerable only when there are signs that financial market contagion spreads to the real economy," Deutsche Bank said.
