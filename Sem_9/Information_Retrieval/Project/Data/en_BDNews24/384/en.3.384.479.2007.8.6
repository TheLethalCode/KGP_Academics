The former prime minister made the call after she left her Shahid Moinul Road home Monday for the first time in a month. "Floods have swept the country. People are suffering. I urge the leaders and workers to stand by them in their days of suffering. I call upon the wealthy in society to help the flood victims from their respective positions." Khaleda attended a milad mahfil in Dhanmondi on the occasion of the 23rd death anniversary of her eldest son's father-in-law, the late rear admiral Mahbub Ali Khan. Tarique Rahman's mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu, wife Dr Zobaida Rahman and other relatives also attended, along with several hundred BNP leaders and workers who joined in the commemoration. She last left her home, where she is being held under virtual house arrest, on July 5 when she went to say prayers at the grave of husband Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar.
