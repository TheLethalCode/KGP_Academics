<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com) The Anticorruption Commission will appeal against the High Court verdict that has stayed the effectiveness of the ACC notice sent to Sheikh Hasina on submission of her wealth statement, an official said Tuesday. It was not immediately clear when the appeal would be filed, but ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman told reporters that the commission would move against the HC order. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury however did not answer reporters' questions on the issue. The High Court verdict means the deadline for Hasina's submission of her wealth statement by August 8 became ineffective. The ACC secretary told reporters that the commission would act as per the court verdict. "In the Supreme Court, there are lawyers for ACC. They will appeal against the verdict," Rahman said. A High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury issued the order on a writ petition filed by the detained former prime minister. During the hearing, Hasina's counsel Barrister Rafique-ul Huq said the ACC had sent the notice to Hasina without investigations in line with law. "The ACC chairman is a good and an efficient person. But he is making mistakes as he is not getting proper guidance," he said. He also said, "The notice was given on July 17, a day after Sheikh Hasina was arrested." Hasina sought assistance from Bangladesh Bank and the ACC in making the statement, but the two refrained from cooperating, Huq said. "Instead, the banks have been asked to freeze the accounts of Hasina and her husband," he said. "If one is asked to swimhands and legs tied, how can one swim? Sheikh Hasina is detained, so it is not possible for her to give a wealth statement if she does not get documents." In reply on behalf of the government, additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said Hasina had 18 bank accounts. "If she had written letters to the banks instead of Bangladesh Bank, those banks would have given her the account statements. "Bangladesh Bank is not obliged to give her account statements. So it would not be right to issue a stay order. Sheikh Hasina has been served notice under law," he said. The court said the ACC could serve notice after investigations. "But that process was not followed. If notice was to be given this way, the ACC rules have to be amended," the court observed. bdnew
