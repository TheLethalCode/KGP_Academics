 Fazal M Kamal Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com) -- It's certainly most heartening to notice that at least one regulatory agency has been operatingalbeit latelywith some muscle but more importantly with much sense, courage and alacrity. Recently the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has made certain decisions pertaining to the cell phone service providers; and about time too. It has issued directives relating to a promotional action of one operator and has also set limits to call charges. Though, rather obviously, it deserves kudos for the decisions and relevant directives, not at all surprisingly, some from the mobile phone networks have claimed that these decisions were "unnecessary" and "irrelevant" even though, most evidently, some of the promotional actions can in no way be justified as serving the interests of the customers. This type of reaction from the officials of the companies, as I've stated earlier, is not surprising and I also won't blame them for this much too muchand I might even forgive them because they know not what they say and do. Ignorance, after all, is bliss. Minions of many foreign entities doing business in countries like Bangladesh largely suffer from insufficient knowledge of the rest of the world and how regulatory bodies function in other countries. We often deride officials in the public entitiesand with pretty good reasonsbut we equally often omit to scrutinise the attitudinal deficiencies and the inward looking insularity of especially many of those who are employed by alien companies. There are instances when they are totally oblivious to local conditions and, even at times, the national interests. They, in effect, bring to mind Dido's song "Life for Rent" in the crassest sense and definitely not in the existentialist sense that she had sung it. In the heat of the chase for ever-higher rungs in the employee pecking order their lack of exposure to the realities of the world often gets in the way. The world, if anyone opens her/his eyes, will realise does not consist of their employers and their business alone. It is a vast expanse encompassing enormous knowledge, huge varieties of competencies and, most significant of all, the ability to know the ethical from the unethical, the immoral from the moral. Be that as it may, and maybe on another occasion we will delve deeper into this murky sphere, but to get back to the regulatory and supervisory agencies in Bangladesh, one cannot, in this context, fail to note another body that has done well and one that has, like many others, failed to perform its duties with due diligence. The first would be the SEC, which has from time to time exercised its legal muscle and penalised erring persons and firms. The second case involves the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). It is because of BRTA's incompetence and worsewhich, I'd guess, doesn't require any elaborationthe roads and highways of Bangladesh are swarming with perniciously ignorant drivers who, as most all know, have barely any ability to be in charge of any motorised vehicle and most positively do not have any knowledge of the appropriate rules, regulations, laws and/or bylaws. And since there isn't any application of these rules, regulations, et al bar exceptions, anarchy and mayhem are rampant though no one seems to question if we really have to tolerate this state of things. As has been underscored in these columns a number of times, the crown for incompetence, negligence and corruptionand let's not be niggardly in giving credit where it's richly deservedis undoubtedly on the cranium of what is popularly known as Rajuk. Surely it's not unknown that the initial flurry of that same institution in demolishing, with TV crews in tow, a fact you couldn't overlook even if you wanted to, was partly to demolish not just structures but concrete evidence as well while simultaneously serving as a potent diversionary gambit. You've got to tip your hat at that lightning fast thinking. And the shenanigans go on like a sordid TV series. Recently the authorities in charge of a building now occupied by a school on Road 6 in Dhaka's Dhanmondi Residential Area persisted with violating the building codes and, in spite of information to Rajuk, continued to construct a structure, at full throttle, one might add. Apart from doing in full public view something they aren't supposed to be doing at all, some pertinent questions can emerge from this exercise. For instance, what is the school teaching the young students there? That it's perfectly OK to ignore the rules? That it's acceptable to violate the laws? Are these the lessons the parents of those students want their children to memorise for later use in life? Against the foregoing backdrop oversight authorities like the BTRC and SEC need to be encouraged to operate with legitimate sense and sufficient muscle while others like Rajuk and BRTA need urgent and drastic rectification so that fairness and justice can reign while having the requisite social support. Because without the required social awareness, political grit and the people's active cooperation no amount of corrective measures will hold for long. bdn
