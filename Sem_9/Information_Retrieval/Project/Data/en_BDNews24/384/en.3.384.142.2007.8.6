 HARARE, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has warned businesses to comply with a controversial price freeze, after his security forces arrested more than 7,000 people for violating the new policy over the past few weeks. "Some (businesses) are resisting saying they will not supply goods and services, but we say you will," state media quoted him on Monday as telling a conference in Malaysia. Mugabe has stepped up a crackdown on the opposition and defied criticism from Western powers as Zimbabweans struggle to cope with the world's highest inflation rate and severe food, fuel and foreign currency shortages. Police spokesman Oliver Mandipaka told The Herald newspaper almost 7,500 people had been arrested for overcharging, failing to display prices or concealing basic commodities in the past six weeks. Mugabe's government ordered stores to roll back prices on bread, milk and other items to mid-June levels in an effort to stem runaway inflation that is hovering around 5,000 percent. The move has led to panic-buying and prompted stores to stop stocking basic goods as more and more desperate Zimbabweans flee to neighbouring South Africa in search of work and food, putting the continent's biggest economy under pressure. Capitalising on a divided opposition, Mugabe has tightened his grip on power, deploying a crack unit made up of the police, military, intelligence and civilian officials to enforce the controversial price controls. The government has also collected more than 1 trillion Zimbabwean dollars (about $67 million at the official exchange rate but $5 million at the black market rate) in fines since launching the crackdown, Mandipaka said. Mugabe, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, signaled again that he would not tolerate any criticism, berating journalists for what he called a lack of objectivity. "The press and journalists, are they driven by the sense of honesty and objectivity all the time? Or are they swayed from objectivity and truth by certain notions arising from their own subjective views?" Mugabe said at the only session of the three-day conference that reporters were permitted to attend. Mugabe was among several leaders from Southeast Asia and Africa taking part in the Langkawi International Dialogue, aimed at fostering closer ties between the two regions. Back home, there was no economic relief in sight for Zimbabweans also struggling with widespread poverty and 80 percent unemployment amid an eight-year depression. Mugabe accuses Britain and other Western nations of sabotaging Zimbabwe's economy over his decision to seize thousands of white-owned farms to resettle landless blacks. Church leaders have urged Mugabe to embrace democratic reforms. One of his key supporters, Anglican bishop Nolbert Kunonga, was quoted on Monday in The Herald as criticising fellow clergy for pressing political reforms. Kunonga said it was the clergy's "sacred mission and God-given opportunity to help people reject all Western forms, designs, plots, tactics and strategies to drag us back into a state of boyhood and baboonhood."
