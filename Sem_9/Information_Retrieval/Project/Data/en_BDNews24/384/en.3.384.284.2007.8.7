 NEW YORK, August 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hollywood actors regularly earn millions of dollars per movie, but are they worth it? Apparently some are. A Forbes magazine survey published on Monday showed Matt Damon offers the best box-office return on his salary, more than twice that of Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. For every dollar 'The Bourne Ultimatum' star was paid for his last three roles, the films returned $29 in gross income. Jennifer Aniston was the top-ranked actress, making No 5 on the list with a gross income return of $17.
