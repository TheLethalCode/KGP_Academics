<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) - Magistrate MA Salam Monday apologised unconditionally to metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque for completing a Speedy Trial Act case under the Criminal Procedure Code. A case regarding an incident of mugging at Sutrapur in Dhaka was filed under the Speedy Trial Act on July 26 last year. But the magistrate completed the trial of the case under the CrPC and delivered the verdict in which he sentenced one accused person to five-year imprisonment and cleared another of the charges. Shahinul Islam, the man who was sentenced, said in an appeal that the verdict had been delivered on the basis of assumption. The metropolitan sessions judge, on July 29, ordered the magistrate to appear before the court and explain. Salam Monday appeared before the judge and submitted a written apology saying that such a mistake would not be repeated. In the presence of some legal affairs correspondents, including bdnews24.com's, in the courtroom, the judge said: "As the Speedy Trial Act is a special law it has a provision for punishment and acquittal. So no other law applies to this case. You should have some common sense." bdnew
