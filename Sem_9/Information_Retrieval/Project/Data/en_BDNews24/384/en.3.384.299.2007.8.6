 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A report on Spanish-owned airport operator BAA and its dominance of London airports is due this week, but no quick call to break the company up is in the works, Britain's Competition Commission said on Monday. "This is just the issues, setting out the scope of the inquiry," said a commission spokesman. "This includes the three London airports and the extent to which this benefits or harms competition." "It won't be proposing or recommending anything," he said, rebuffing recent UK media reports which have suggested there could be a call for a break-up of BAA in the report. Provisional findings are another year away, the spokesman said, with final recommendations expected by the end of 2008. The initial report will probably be published likely by mid-week, he said. BAA handles more than 90 percent of London's airline traffic through its Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports and has come in for criticism from airlines and consumer groups who say diversified ownership would spur cheaper and faster expansion of the city's congested airports. Overcrowding, long security queues and technical glitches in baggage handling equipment at Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic, have provided additional arguments for BAA's critics. London Mayor Ken Livingstone recently said Heathrow brought "shame" on London and Giovanni Bisignani, head of airlines lobby IATA, has accused BAA of not spending enough on the airport's infrastructure or staffing. BAA has defended its stance, noting stricter security checks are the result of government policy, not BAA's, and pointing to its 4.2 billion pound investment in building Terminal 5 at Heathrow, due to open next March, as evidence it is spending to better serve a growing air industry. BAA also aims to build a second runway at Stansted. Britain's consumer affairs watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), referred the issue of UK airport services to the commission in March. The OFT launched its probe of UK airports in June 2006. The OFT said it had received 60 responses during its consultation period from airlines, consumers and other organisations. The watchdog said in December it had found evidence of poor customer satisfaction and the need for more competition to reduce costs. In its separate proposals to the commission, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in March recommended greater financial penalties on BAA where services fell short, and the use of financial trigger payments to reward the completion of key capital projects. Ferrovial led a consortium that bought BAA in a 10.1 billion pound ($20.6 billion) deal completed in June, 2006, and which included Scottish airports in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Shares in Ferrovial were down 2.8 percent at 60.90 euros by 1041 GMT, valuing the group at around 8.5 billion eur
