 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Pietersen provided a welcome boost to England's hopes of avoiding a home series defeat to India on Wednesday by returning to training on the eve of the third and final test at The Oval. The 27-year-old Hampshire batsman missed Tuesday's practice session after saying he felt unwell. A statement on the England and Wales Cricket Board Web site (www.ecb.co.uk) on Wednesday said Pietersen had responded well to a course of antibiotics. England, who trail India 1-0, have not lost a home series since 2001 when they were defeated by Australia. Pietersen, who hit a century in the drawn first test at Lord's, has not missed a test since making his debut against Australia at the same ground two years ago
