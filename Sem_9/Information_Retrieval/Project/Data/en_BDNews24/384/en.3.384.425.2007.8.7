 LONDON, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest brewer, Scottish & Newcastle, reported lower first-half profit than expected and said hitting its full-year forecasts would be very challenging, blaming underperforming, weather-hit west European markets. S&N, which brews Foster's and Kronenbourg and is the biggest brewer in Britain, France and Russia, posted a 5.5 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 191 million pounds ($389.5 million) on Tuesday, on revenue up 7.8 percent at 2.1 billion pounds. Analysts had forecast profit of 204 million pounds, according to the average of a Reuters Estimates poll of four investment banks. The company said bad weather in Britain and France and a strike at one of its French breweries had outweighed strong growth from the Russian beer market. "We made good progress during the first five months of the year in our key Western European markets but this was undermined by the severe weather conditions experienced in June," it said in a statement. "The aggregate effect of the factors described above will make the achievement of this year's trading targets very challenging," it added. S&N shares dropped 2 percent in early trading to 564 pence, valuing the business at around 5.3 billion pounds. The stock has fallen around 13 percent in the last two months as speculation that it is a takeover target for Carlsberg has faded and bad weather in Northern Europe has left analysts worrying about the firm's summer beer sales. "The UK profits were really much weaker than we had expected," said one analyst who did not wish to be named. "We don't see the UK getting any better. We think the smoking ban is probably a bigger headwind than they are willing to talk about," he added. The brewer of Newcastle Brown and Baltika beers relied on its east European business Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH), which it owns jointly with Carlsberg, for growth. The Edinburgh-based company said BBH volume grew 30.2 percent, revenue by 47.4 percent and operating profit by 63.3 percent, adding the Russian beer market was forecast to grow around 11 to 13 percent for 2007 as a whole. It said bad weather in Britain, which has seen the worst floods in decades, and a recently introduced smoking ban inside pubs and restaurants would hit beer sales there. "We now believe the overall impact for the second half will be a (UK) beer market down around 1-2 percent and slower than expected growth in the more seasonally sensitive cider market." Strikes, downpours and a marketing blitz by competitors in France also hit sales of Kronenbourg. "(the three factors) resulted in significant share loss for Brasseries Kronenbourg in the month of June." S&N said it would pay an interim dividend of 7.4 pence a share, up 2.5 percent on last year's payo
