<TITLE> Pakistan repeating mistakes of 71: Lashkar-e-Taiba chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, August 7 (bdnews24.com) -- One of the world's most dreaded terrorist outfits, based in Pakistan, has warned that the Pakistani Army is repeating the mistakes it committed in 1971 in the then East Pakistan. Lashkar-e-Taiba, banned globally as a terrorist organisation, has said that Pakistan will have to pay the price for taking on militant Islamists on its own soil. "The result was widespread hatred against the army in East Pakistan and it had to fight a war against its own people," the outfit chief, Hafiz Saeed, says. The warning comes from the Lashkar chief after Pakistan Army recently raided the Lal Masjid in Islamabad to arrest radicals holed up inside the mosque. "Unfortunately, our rulers are making Pakistan's armed forces commit the same mistakes that they had previously committed in East Pakistan the situation, therefore, is becoming critical with every passing day," according to the statement posted on its website. Although Lashkar, which functions under the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, is 'banned' globally as well as in Pakistan, its chief continues his weekly sermons on the website. In his latest statement, Saeed says the army's action against militant Islamists in Pakistan today is as unpopular as what the khakis did in East Pakistan in 1971  when Yahya Khan and other generals played a "despicable role" in "destroying the morals" of unit commanders by participating in and encouraging acts of "licentiousness and lewdness". The organisation's warnings are a pointer to the dangers posed by militant Islamists in Pakistan, which has long received sustenance from the country's military. The statement claimed that the army's reputation had been tainted by the Lal Masjid incident, adding that Pakistan rulers must "apologise to the nation for the debacle". Pakistan has earlier frozen the bank accounts of Lashkar-e-Taiba. The group, the US alleges, has links with Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. bdn
