 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There has been no panic buying of meat in Britain despite a nationwide ban on livestock movements following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, retailers said on Monday. "We've got contingency plans but stock levels are looking good at the moment," a spokeswoman for retailer ASDA, a unit of Wal-Mart Stores , said.

He did not anticipate a supply shortage and called on retailers not to turn to imported supplies. "There is plenty of meat in the supply chain. The shelves won't be bereft of British meat. We are requesting retailers to be sensible in sourcing," he said. Attenborough said there was a shortlived dip in demand for meat, particularly lamb, during the last foot and mouth outbreak in Britain in 2001 linked to prolonged and extensive television coverage of burning carcasses did not expect a repeat this time. "We don't anticipate any drop in consumer demand," he said. Attenborough said the movement ban should not cause any significant animal welfare issues with cattle but could potentially with pigs if they cannot be transferred from breeding to fattening units.
