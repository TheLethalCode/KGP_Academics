 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)- The National Board of Revenue (NBR) Monday accepted former premier Khaleda Zia's application to legalise her undeclared money. Khaleda's lawyer, Advocate Shimul Biswas, told bdnews24.com that the on-duty officer of Circle-21 of Dhaka Tax Zone-2 had accepted the application in the prescribed income tax return form to legalise Tk 1.33 crore in undeclared money. NBR member Ali Ahmed, while talking to reporters Monday, did not say anything clearly about the legalising of Khaleda's undeclared money. He only said, "A taxpayer is a very honourable person to us. We don't have any right under the income tax laws to divulge any information regarding a taxpayer. If any taxpayer pays tax following proper rules, the NBR will definitely accept it." However, a senior official of the NBR, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that Khaleda's application had been accepted. On July 30, Khaleda appealed to the NBR to legalise her undeclared money, but it did not accept the appeal, as Khaleda did not follow a "proper procedure". Shimul Biswas said, "Tax Zone-2 Monday informed us that Khaleda Zia's appeal has been accepted." As much as Tk 33 lakh has been paid in income tax against Tk 1.33 crore, which is the value of 10 FDRs and three cars purchased for election work, he said. bdnews
