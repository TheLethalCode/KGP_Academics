<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of Al-Watany Bank soared nearly four percent on Tuesday after Kuwaiti bidders said they may pay four times book value for the bank, helping Egypt's main stock indices snap two days of losses. A rise in European stocks, which were rebounding from a 4-month low, also boosted confidence, traders said. Commercial Bank of Kuwait's chairman Abdul-Majeed al-Shatti told Reuters CBK and a local partner planned to offer about four times book value for a 70 percent stake in Al-Watany. Al-Watany shares surged to a 2007 high after the news, closing up 3.9 percent to 53.98 pounds ($9.57). Based on the bank's book value at the end of June, that would value the offer at 63.2 pounds per share. "The bid is high but you have to take into account that the only way to get into the market is to acquire a bank as new licenses are not being granted," said Hatem Alaa, banking analyst at HC Brokerage in Cairo. Rising indices in London, Frankfurt, and Paris also lifted investor confidence, traders said. "Global markets were rebounding yesterday and this morning European stocks were performing well, which helps sentiment," said a trader at HC Brokerage. Egypt's benchmark Hermes index gained 0.7 percent to 71,989.10 points and the well watched Case 30 index rose 0.9 percent to 8,137.85 points. "We are trading around a strong support level on the Case at between 8,000 points and 8,100 points," the trader said. "The next resistance level is 8,350 points. The broader CIBC index rose 1.2 percent to 360.88 points. Other banking shares also climbed. Commercial International Bank, which is due to release its first-half profit on Tuesday, gained 1.5 percent to close at 66.56 pounds. Real estate shares bucked the trend, led by Heliopolis Housing, which fell 2.5 percent. "Investors are moving out of the larger capitalised real estate stocks which could be exposed to international volatility," said Mohamed Radwan, trader at Delta Securiti
