 Dhaka, August 7 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina Tuesday won two more legal battles in the High Courtat least for now. The HC granted bail to the detained former prime minister in an extortion case filed by Noor Ali, a long-time pro-Awami League businessman. The same court stayed the proceedings of an ACC notice, which was served on Hasina asking her to turn in a wealth statement. The court also halted the legal proceedings of the extortion charges in the trial court, but allowed authorities to continue the investigation. The court asked the government to explain in four weeks why bringing the extortion case under the emergency powers rules is not illegal. The latest bail order does not ensure freedom for the Awami League chief from jail as the Appellate Division had stayed an earlier HC order for bail in the first extortion case, filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading. Noor Ali filed the case alleging he was forced to pay Tk 5 crore to Hasina for permission to contest in a parliamentary election in 2001 with a ticket from the Awami League. The businessman also implicated Hasina's cousin Sheikh Helaluddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury in the same case filed on June 13. The government included the case in the emergency powers rules but Hasina's lawyers argued that it was a violation of law. Hasina and her party have denied the allegations and branded them as politically motivated. Hasina said the government was trying to prevent her from taking part in the next elections expected to be held anytime between October and December 2008. The government has denied the charges. Hasina Sunday challenged the government in the HC over its move to get trial of Noor Ali's Tk 5 crore extortion case against her under the emergency powers rules. She also sought bail in the same case. Her lawyers filed a writ petition after securing permission from the bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq told the court that the complainant in the case mentioned that the incident occurred in 1999. But the case was filed on June 13 this year and his client was arrested on July 16. He said the case was brought under the emergency powers rules without investigation and, before filing the chargesheet against her. "The whole process is illegal," he argued. Meanwhile, additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said another case that involves charges of extortion remained halted until Aug 14 in the Supreme Court. He appealed to court not to pass any order until the previous case is settled. In another development, the High Court stayed the efficacy of the Anticorruption Commission's notice on her to submit the wealth statement. For this, Hasina's counsels filed a writ petition challenging the validity of the notice. The ACC served notice on Hasina on July 17a day after Hasina was arrestedasking her to submit a wealth statement. Hasina received the notice at the special jail on July 19 and sent a legal notice to the ACC on July 31 to know if a deputy director of the commission could serve notice on a former prime minister. Sunday was the deadline for a reply to her legal notice. As the ACC did not respond to it in time, Hasina's lawyer filed the writ petition with the High Court challenging its legality. The High Court also issued a rule on six people including the ACC chairman and the secretary to explain in four weeks why the notice would not be declared illegal. Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury issued the order on a writ petition filed by the detained former prime minister. At the hearing, Hasina's counsel Barrister Rafique-ul Huq said the ACC had sent the notice to Hasina wanting her wealth statement without investigation and enquiry as per law. "The ACC chairman is a good and an efficient person. But he is making mistakes as he is not getting proper guidance," he said. He also said, "The notice was given on July 17, a day after Sheikh Hasina was arrested. Hasina sought the assistance of Bangladesh Bank and the Anticorruption Commission in this regard. Bangladesh Bank and the ACC not only refrained from cooperating, but also directed that the bank accounts of Sheikh Hasina and her husband be frozen." Huq said, "If one is asked to swim after tying one's hands and legs how will one swim? Sheikh Hasina is detained, so it is not possible for her to give a wealth statement if she does not get documents." In reply on behalf of the government, additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said Hasina had 18 bank accounts. If she wrote letters to the banks instead of Bangladesh Bank, those banks would have given her the account statements." "Bangladesh Bank is not obliged to provide her account statements. So, it would not be right to issue stay order or interim order. Sheikh Hasina has been served notice seeking wealth statement as per law," he said. The court said the ACC could serve notice after investigation and inquiry. But that process was not followed. If notice was to be given this way, the ACC rules have to be amended, the court observed. bdnews24.com/at/
