<TITLE> Separate UK animal labs from cattle, experts say </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British animal research laboratories should be located away from livestock to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks, experts said on Monday, although the public might fear such a move. Veterinary and disease specialists raised their concerns after a herd of cattle in southeast England was infected with highly contagious foot and mouth disease. The cattle were about five miles (8 km) from two animal research laboratories that handle foot and mouth viruses, although it was not clear that either laboratory was responsible for the infection. "Ideally (laboratories) should be well away from agricultural areas," said Graham Brooks, president of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, but added:. "If you situate them near large populations then you have the problem that possible strains of diseases could affect humans. It would be a disaster if one of those leaked out." In the United States, animal disease research is generally carried out away from agricultural areas and large cities. The major research centre at Plum Island is based about 1.5 miles off the coast of Long Island in New York state. "They certainly don't need to be by farms, it's just that historically these types of labs have been located a long way from populations," said Neil Ferguson, Director of the Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling. Ferguson said it might be better if animal health research labs were located on arable land. "It's difficult, given the sensibilities, to consider moving them now, but if we did ever envisage new facilities then that location aspect is to be considered." Above the importance of location, experts say the key consideration in preventing disease outbreaks was bio-security at laboratories and investment in facilities. The laboratories located near the outbreak in Britain -- one government-funded and the other owned by Merial Animal Health Ltd -- have both issued statements saying they have found no breach in their security measures. However, inspectors are concentrating on both as a possible source of the infection as the strain that infected the cattle was uncommon and was stored for use at both facilities. Merial, owned by U.S. drug maker Merck & Co. Inc and Sanofi-Aventis SA , has operated in Britain for 15 years without any disease escaping, the company said. The government-funded laboratory, the Institute for Animal Health, said it had also had no security problems, although a report earlier this year cited lack of funding as a concern and said investment was needed to keep the facility up to date. "It is absolutely essential that this country maintains its infrastructure and capability to respond to future disease outbreaks, whatever they may be," said David Catlow, president of the British Veterinary Association. "Underinvestment in our core research institutes is and would be unforgivable."
