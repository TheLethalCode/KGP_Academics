 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Tuesday formed a five-member bench to hear an appeal for a freeze on the Supreme Court verdict that ordered the top 16 storeys of the Rangs Bhaban to be sliced off. Justice Fazlul Karim will head the panel to hear the appeal filed by the Rangs authorities on Aug 1, hours after appeals court cleared the government to knock down major parts of the 22-storey highrise constructed illegally. Chamber judge Md Hasan Amin on August 5 sent the appeal to the full bench of the Appellate Division for hearing. Rangs counsel barrister Md Sakhawat Hossain said the court would hear the appeal Wednesday. He said they would file another petition to review the previous decision after getting the copy of the latest verdict. The city development agency Rajuk started dismantling the once majestic building Monday, which has been stripped to its skeleton. The government has announced a plan to acquire the land of the building to construct a road that will connect Bijoy Sarani to Mohakhali road. The demolition continued Tuesday. bdnews24.
