 KAKAMEGA FOREST, August 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If you decorated the hall of your wedding party with hundreds of exotic butterflies shipped in from an African rainforest, your friends might think you stylish, extravagant, even decadent. But according to some Kenyan entrepreneurs, you could be helping save one of east Africa's last remaining patches of natural forest, home to thousands of rare species. Countries that are poor but rich in flora and fauna are increasingly seeking new ways to save wildlife from poverty and population pressure. Most rely on visits from dollar-bearing eco-tourists. For the people of western Kenya's Kakamega forest, though, there is more than one way to make money from your wilderness. Besides tourist lodges and tree nurseries growing valuable species of timber and herbal medicines, they set up a farm which cultivates butterflies for export in 2001. Buyers range from European scientists studying the behavior of forest-dwelling creepy crawlies to fashion designers and New York socialites wanting to spruce up their parties. "We get orders from Americans wanting 400 butterflies to look pretty around their wedding reception," says Roseline Shikami, a project founder. "I don't know why butterflies. In Kenya, we use balloons." Shikami says scientists in Europe request species to study their diets, anatomy or mating habits. A fashion designer ordered some to match her dress at a function. "Her outfit is black-and-white, so she wanted the butterfly to match the color of her dress," she says, pointing to a black-and-white patterned insect flitting around an enclosure. HUNGRY CATERPILLARS Successful butterfly farming is tough. First, you have to catch at least two members' of the species you want -- different sexes. Then you have to persuade them to mate. When the eggs hatch, you feed the caterpillars on their favorite forest leaves until they wrap themselves in a cocoon. The insects have to be exported in pupa form or they will not last the journey. "Some of them hatch in just a few days, so you need to ship them out quick," said butterfly farmer Benjamin Okalo. Besides butterflies, Kakamega's forest dwellers are planting and harvesting trees for commercial wood and medicines, including the red stinkwood, hailed as a cure for prostate cancer. Other plants cure malaria and stomach ailments, locals say. "We estimate 70 percent of these plants have medicinal properties, but only a fraction have been discovered," John Atsango, who guides tourists for the Kenya Forest Department, told Reuters. Atsango said a local pharmacy had started manufacturing herbal medicines using the plants for export markets. "We are worried big drug companies will steal the secrets and patent them -- I'm not allowed to tell you what half of these plants do," he said. Conservationists say the undiscovered medicinal properties of many plant species is one of the strongest arguments for saving biodiversity. LIMITED MARKETS Kakamega is the eastern most patch of what was once a vast rainforest stretching from the jungles of west Africa across the Congo into modern day Kenya, before much was chopped down. Kenyan authorities are keen to halt the retreat of forests in a country mostly characterized by dry savanna and semi-desert. Only 36 of Kakamega's 238 sq km (92 sq mile) is protected. But some conservation groups are skeptical about whether schemes harvesting forest products besides timber can make a big difference. "The problem is there just aren't enough markets for butterfly pupae," says Andrew Plumptre of the Ugandan branch of the Wildlife Conservation Society. "It's good for relations with the community, but I don't think it raises a lot of money for conservation." Shikami admits the sums of money involved are small -- pupae go for as little as $1 each -- but she puts that down to unscrupulous middlemen. "We need our own direct market," she says, gently scraping a black caterpillar off her hand onto a broad leaf. "We could make a lot more mone
