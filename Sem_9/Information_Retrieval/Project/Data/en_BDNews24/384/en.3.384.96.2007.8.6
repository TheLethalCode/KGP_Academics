 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday ruled against the decision of Chittagong University syndicate cancelling the LLB certificate of Faisal Mahmud Faizee, who recently resigned from his post as High Court judge. The court declared Faizee's certificate valid. It also ordered Chittagong University authorities to pay Faizee Tk 20,000 in compensation. A High Court bench comprising Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury delivered the verdict after the final hearing on Faizee's writ appeal challenging Chittagong University. The court said the cancellation of results 17 years after their publication was a criminal offence. The verdict also said that cancellation of Faizee's certificate without issuing notice was unjust. The court simultaneously heard writ petitions filed by two Chittagong lawyers, Abu Md Zia Habib and Jasmine Sultana, also challenging the legality of CU's cancellation of their LLB certificates. The court also declared the lawyers' certificates valid and ordered Chittagong University authorities to pay each of them Tk 20,000 in compensation. The HC declared that CU has destroyed lives of many, including Faizee, with its decision to cancel certificates. On the Chittagong University authorities taking so much time in cancelling the certificates the court commented that either the university authorities were inept or negligent. In reaction to the verdict, Faizee's lawyer, barrister Masud Reza Sobhan, told bdnews24.com: "(Faizee) has received justice from the High Court." "Compensation can be sought from Chittagong University following the High Court's verdict declaring the cancellation of the certificate illegal," Sobhan said. Asked whether Faizee can practise as a judge or lawyer now, Sobhan said he could not work as judge as he had resigned from the post of permanent judge of the High Court. As he had never been enlisted as an advocate with the Appellate Division he cannot practise law there either. "If he is enlisted as lawyer with the High Court he can practise there," Sobhan said. On March 3, the Chittagong University syndicate cancelled the certificates of 2,400 people, including Faizee's, on charges of fraudulent results. After the decision was published by gazette notification on March 10, Faizee filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging its legality. Following the writ petition, on March 19 the High Court stayed CU's decision to cancel Faizee's certificate. Faizee resigned his post on July 12 in a letter written to President Iajuddin Ahmed. Barrister Shafique Ahmed and barrister Tanjib-ul Alam represented Chittagong University. bdnews
