 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com) The Anticorruption Commission will appeal against the High Court verdict that has stayed the effectiveness of the ACC notice sent to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina regarding submission of her wealth statement. ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman told reporters Tuesday that the ACC would appeal. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury however did not answer reporters' questions on the issue. Following the High Court verdict, the deadline for Hasina's submission of her wealth statement by August 8 became ineffective. The ACC secretary told reporters that the commission would act as per the court verdict. "In the Supreme Court, there are lawyers for ACC. They will appeal against the verdict," he said. However, Rahman did not say when the appeal would be filed. A two-member bench of the High Court Tuesday stayed the effectiveness of the ACC notice sent to Hasina on July 17 asking her to submit her wealth statement. bdnews2
