 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares traded down by midday on Monday, led by financial stocks as they bore the brunt of concerns over credit markets and by oil shares, which tracked a fall in crude. At 1035 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent, heading for its eighth day of losses in the last 10 sessions and off 7.7 percent from a 6-1/2 year high of 1,635.58 on July 13. The DJStoxx European financial services index was among the worst performing sectoral indexes, losing 1.2 percent on continued concerns over widening credit spreads. Anglo-US fund management company INVESCO topped losers in Europe, slipping 3.5 percent due to its exposure to the US market. "The turmoil in credit markets and the fear of contagion is going to mean volatility for stocks this week," said Barclays strategist Henk Potts, adding that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments later this week may provide clues about the future of the economy. "There are lots of positives for equities. Valuations are still cheap, and profitability growth in the United States has been very strong in the second quarter," Potts said. Index heavyweight oil and gas producers BP and Total slipped 0.6 and 1.2 percent, respectively, as Brent crude fell more than $1 to $73.75 on worries over the economy. US stocks slid sharply on Friday after Bear Stearns said credit markets were in their worst shape in two decades, while jobs data aroused further concerns about economic weakness. Losses in Europe were limited by fresh developments in the race for Dutch bank ABN AMRO, subject of a bid battle between Barclays and a consortium of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Santander. Shares in ABN and Barclays jumped after over 95 percent of Fortis shareholders voted in favour of the Belgian-Dutch bank's part in the takeover of ABN. The vote makes it more likely a consortium of Fortis, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander will win a takeover battle for ABN. Shares in ABN were up 1.5 percent after the pivotal Fortis shareholder vote. Barclays shares rose 0.9 percent. Shares in Fortis were down 1.7 percent, and RBS and Santander shares were down 0.7 percent. Continuing the M&A theme, British chemical company ICI rose 1.2 percent after saying it had opened its books to Akzo Nobel after the Dutch company raised its indicative bid to 8 billion pounds. French bank Natixis was the top gainer across Europe, rising 9 percent after saying that problems in the U.S. subprime market would have a limited impact on the group. German reinsurer Munich Re was up 0.6 percent after its second-quarter net profit beat market expectatio
