 SOFIA, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgaria halted Russian gas supplies to Greece on Monday due to a pipeline leak which caused an explosion in the south-western part of the Balkan country, police and civil defence said.

Bulgaria's state-owned gas monopoly Bulgargaz transits gas from Russia's giant Gazprom to Turkey, Greece and Macedonia. Last year, Bulgargaz supplied Greece with 2.7 billion cubic metres of gas. Police and the civil defence service were investigating the incident, which occurred near the village of Dolno Balgarchevo, 80 km from the border with Greece. An economy ministry spokeswoman said 10 metres of the pipeline had been affected. Bulgargaz Executive Director Dimitar Gogov told Reuters heavy ranfalls and a possible underground landslide might have caused the problem.
