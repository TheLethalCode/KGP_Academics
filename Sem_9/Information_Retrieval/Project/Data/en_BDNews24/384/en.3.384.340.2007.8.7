 ABUJA, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua has suspended a multimillion-dollar scheme to build 774 clinics because the funding arrangement approved by his predecessor was illegal, local newspapers reported on Tuesday. The suspension is a new example of Yar'Adua reversing decisions made by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who stepped down on May 29.

Under the constitution, Nigeria's federal government, 36 states and 774 LGAs are all supposed to get a share of public revenues and the federal government is not allowed to interfere with state or LGA funds without their consent.
