<TITLE> BCB to approve squad after selection </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) from now will approve the national team chosen by the selection committee before the squad is announced. The BCB will declare Thursday the Bangladesh team for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September after approval in the interim board meeting. Spokesman for the interim committee Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby dismissed suggestions that the new move equalled to interference with the selection process. He said the committee has no such intention. "It should be a practice that the team is approved in the board meeting, although the team picked up by the selection committee would be considered final," said Bobby. Asked why they were going to introduce such practice if they considered the team chosen by the selectors was final, Bobby said, "You can say it is a formality. The team must need to be approved by the board. The cricketing world follows this practice so far as I know." Chief selector Faruque Ahmed hoped the board would confine its interests to formalities only when it came to selecting the squad. "I believe the board will maintain official procedures only," said Ahmed, who was given a one-month extension until August 31 after he saw off his stint on July 31. The three-member selection committee did not face such practice during Mahbub Anam-led committee, whose members stepped down late July. bdnew
