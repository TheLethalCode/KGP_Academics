<TITLE> Not all flood aid is tax-free: NBR </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)Individuals or organisations wishing to give money for relief and assistance to flood victims across the country will face a ceiling on tax-free donations, the National Board of Revenue said Tuesday. In line with the Income Tax Ordinance, there is a provision for tax-free charitable donations up to Tk 250,000. However, tax is imposed on any money donated above this amount. The same rule applies to money meant for flood donations, said Ali Ahmed of NBR's income tax cell Tuesday. Ahmed spoke to reporters at the NBR office Tuesday in answer to demands by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, on behalf of the business community, to allow all donations to flood victims to be made free of tax. "The NBR has rejected the demand of the businessmen as many may misuse the opportunity if it is given," Ahmed said. bdnews2
