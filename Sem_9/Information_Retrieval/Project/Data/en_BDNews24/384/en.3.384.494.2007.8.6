 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) - Former prime minister Khaleda Zia has wealth, including movable and immovable property, worth Tk 3.5 crore, according to a statement submitted to the Anticorruption Commission through her lawyer Monday. The statement signed by the BNP chairperson says she does not have property or bank accounts abroad. Khaleda's counsel Ahmed Azam Khan, after submitting the wealth statement to the commission, told reporters, "I have submitted the wealth statement of former prime minister Khaleda Zia on her behalf to the commission. Khaleda Zia tried to give the commission an accurate wealth statement. She gave the statement being respectful to law." Khaleda Zia's wealth includes savings deposits and savings bonds. A lawyers' delegation led by advocate Khan submitted the statement to ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman at 4.15pm. Advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan, barrister Naushad Zamir, barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim, Sanaullah Miah, advocate Afzal H Khan, barrister Ruhul Quddus Kajal, advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder and advocate Kaiser Jamal were present. According to the statement, Khaleda's wealth includes two houses, one on Shahid Moinul Road in the cantonment area and the other in Gulshan. The government allotted the two houses to her at token prices after the death of President Ziaur Rahman. Besides, she has a 10- katha piece of land in Savar that Ziaur Rahman had bought during his lifetime. Khaleda did not have any property abroad, her lawyer said. Khaleda has an FDR of Tk 50,000 with Janata Bank branch adjacent to Bangabhaban. In the same bank, Tk 2,359 is in the savings account in the name of late president Ziaur Rahman. At present, Khaleda has a bank balance of Tk 1.89 crore, FDR with profit worth Tk 1.65 crore and Tk 12,405 in purchase value of immovable property. Khaleda showed her honorarium and allowances as prime minister three times and once as the leader of the opposition, travel allowance and entertainment allowance on government work during the time, money from her late husband's life insurance and pension and other allowances and money received as house rent from the Gulshan house (1982 to 2007). The wealth at Shahid Moinul Road house includes seven sofa sets, two dining sets, 20 lamps, 10 air-conditioners, two televisions, a palanquin and three carpets. There are four cars: one Nissan Patrol, two Toyota Jeeps and a Toyota 1300cc in Khaleda Zia's name. Of them, the 1300 cc Toyota car was brought in 1995 under the MP's quota. Others were bought in 1991 for election purpose. The ACC on July 18 sent a notice to Khaleda asking her to submit a statement of her movable and immovable property in seven days. Later on Khaleda's appeal, the commission extended the deadline by seven more workdays to August 7. Income tax worth Tk 33.49 lakh was deposited for Khaleda to Bangladesh Bank against her undisclosed wealth on July 31. The National Board of Revenue did not accept the amount as the filled-in income tax return form was not submitted with it. The NBR asked her lawyers to fill out the form and submit the statement again. bdnews24.
