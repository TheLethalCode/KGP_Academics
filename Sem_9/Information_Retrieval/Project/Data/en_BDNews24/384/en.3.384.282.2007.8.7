The report did not say whether their workers were forced to work overtime or were paid for the work. Chinese firms regularly work staff beyond official limits, often for little or no compensation. The companies' abuses were brought to light after a report in June by London-based labour rights group Playfair Alliance accused the firms, and two other Olympic souvenir makers in nearby Dongguan city, of illegal practices. Le Kit Stationery Co. was stripped of its licence to make Olympic souvenirs after a Chinese probe found it had used eight underage students for packaging work on non-Olympic products, and had failed to provide contracts for other workers, Beijing Olympic organisers said in a statement last week.
