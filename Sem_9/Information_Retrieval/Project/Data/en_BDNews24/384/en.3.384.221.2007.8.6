<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's teeming capital holds on Wednesday its first direct election for governor in a contest that has touched on the role of Islam in politics, corruption and a myriad of social and other problems in the sprawling city. The battle to control Jakarta is also seen as an important marker ahead of the start of campaigning for parliamentary and presidential elections in 2009. Opinion polls expect a low turnout for the election, which may make it a tight race. "I don't think I'll vote ... None of them will change anything," said Muhammad Faisal, a construction worker by day and motorcycle taxi diver at night. Only two candidates are contesting the election. Adang Daradjatun, a previous deputy national police chief, is backed by the Justice and Prosperity Party (PKS), a conservative Islamic party. His opponent is current deputy governor Fauzi Bowo, who is backed by a coalition of 19 parties including leading national parties Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Struggle Party. The Indonesian Survey Institute, a respected independent group, forecast 65 percent of the 5.7 million eligible voters would skip voting. Around half of the 600 people interviewed said they doubted the candidates could do much to effectively combat poverty, ease the dreadful traffic congestion and resolve regular flooding. During the two-week campaign period, both parties appeared to rely on a traditional formula of throwing festive rallies, with popular singers to draw crowds. Media reports said some of those attending rallies were paid up to 35,000 rupiah ($3.78) each for "transport money" to attend. There has been plenty of mud-slinging in the campaigns too. Daradjatun has ridden on anti-corruption ticket and accused the current city administration of incompetence. But Bowo, an urban planning specialist, says his years of experience in local government are a reason to vote for him. Meanwhile, Bowo's coalition of parties have raised concerns that a Daradjatun victory could result in sharia-style laws for Jakarta, a view shared by some rights activists. Daradjatun has dismissed this as a smear campaign and said he has no intention of, for example, of shutting down legal night spots in the lively city. Most Indonesian Muslims, who account for 85 percent of the 220 million population, practice a moderate version Islam, although some local governments have brought in sharia-style laws. Faisal Basri, an economist at the University of Indonesia, also accused both candidates of being influenced by big property interests in a city that has lost many of its green spaces to mega developmen
