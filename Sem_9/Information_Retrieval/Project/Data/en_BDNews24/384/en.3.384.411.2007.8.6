 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British factory output rose for a fourth consecutive month in June as strong demand helped manufacturers shrug off higher interest rates, rising oil prices and the strength of the pound.

But the Confederation of British Industry reported that British factory orders unexpectedly fell in July at their sharpest rate since the start of the year. "There's a clear divergence beyond June in that we've seen a big fall in the CBI measure and a big rise in the PMI, sending confusing signals to the Monetary Policy Committee," said David P
