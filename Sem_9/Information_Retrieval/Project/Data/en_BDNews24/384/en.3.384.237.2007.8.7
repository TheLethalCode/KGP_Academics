<TITLE> Japan chooses upper house leader </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, August 7 (BBC/bdnews24.com) -- Japan's upper house of parliament Tuesday elected a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) as its president. Satsuki Eda won a unanimous vote, 10 days after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)-led ruling coalition suffered a crushing defeat in upper house polls. It is the first time the upper house has ever been led by a politician from an opposition party. Since the polls, PM Shinzo Abe has resisted calls for his resignation. He has, however, pledged a Cabinet reshuffle, which is expected to take place later this month. In the elections on 29 July, the ruling coalition lost its upper house majority. The opposition DPJ made huge gains, becoming the largest party in the house for the first time in its history. Eda, 66, is a veteran DPJ lawmaker. He told the chamber that Japan's political landscape had changed. "The make-up of the upper house has drastically changed after the upper house elections and we are facing a political situation we have never faced before," he said. "I think voters' expectations for the upper house are now extremely high," he said. Some analysts have predicted political deadlock. The ruling coalition still controls the more powerful lower house, but the opposition could now block bills in the upper house.
