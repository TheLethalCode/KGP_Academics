<TEXT>
 DILI, August 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Independence hero and former president Xanana Gusmao was sworn in as East Timor's prime minister on Wednesday as simmering violence continued in some districts loyal to the former ruling party. Breaking a deadlock after parliamentary polls more than a month ago, President Jose Ramos-Horta on Monday appointed Gusmao's coalition of parties to govern after no single party won a majority. Ramos-Horta's move sparked violent protests by supporters of the former ruling party, Fretilin, which claims the right to govern and has branded the president's move as unconstitutional. Gusmao took his oath at a ceremony in the capital, Dili. "I will serve the nation based on laws and the constitution with all my capacity for the people, prosperity, consolidating independence and national unity," the bearded fighter-turned-politician said as he placed his hand on the constitution. The new government consists of 12 ministers. Fretilin's Jose Luis Guterres, a former foreign minister, was appointed deputy prime minister. Police said fresh violence broke out in the district of Baucau on Wednesday, although Dili and Viqueque were calm after youths burned tires and vandalized buildings the previous day. Factional bloodshed broke out in the impoverished country of about one million people last year, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. The mayhem, during which 37 people were killed, was triggered by the previous government's decision to sack 600 soldiers. Fretilin won 21 seats in the 65-member parliament in the June poll, far short of the majority required to rule, while the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) took 18 seats. Gusmao founded CNRT earlier this year. Fretilin, which spearheaded the fight against Indonesia's 24-year rule, claimed the right to form a government because it won most votes in the polls. It has threatened to boycott parliament and the government if Gusmao's coalition takes power. Fretilin had proposed the appointment of an all-inclusive government with an independent prime minister as a way to end the stalemate. Gusmao, who battled Indonesian forces in the hills for years before being captured, appears to have become increasingly frustrated by the pace of progress under Fretilin since independence five years ago.
