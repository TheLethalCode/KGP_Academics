<TITLE> UK scrambles to find source of cattle disease </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British experts scrambled on Monday to find the cause of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease while a drug company at the centre of the investigation said there had been no breach of its biosecurity measures. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said it was vital to contain the outbreak, which infected a local herd of cattle and could cost the British livestock industry up to $30 million a week in lost exports. A laboratory run by Merial Animal Health Ltd, jointly owned by US drugmaker Merck & Co. Inc and France's Sanofi-Aventis SA , said it stopped all production on Saturday, hours after cattle on a nearby farm were found to have an uncommon strain of the disease. A nearby government-funded laboratory, around 5 miles (8 km) from the infected farm near Guildford, south-east England, was also closed and is under investigation. Some 120 cattle have been slaughtered in a cull of animals at the infected farm and those at high risk nearby. Two animals have so far tested positive for foot and mouth and a spokeswoman for the agriculture ministry Defra said on Monday all the cattle that needed to be killed had been destroyed. Farmers' leader Peter Kendall said after talks with Benn and Prime Minister Gordon Brown that farmers were angry about the outbreak and would be horrified if the disease came from the research site. "We need to find a way of making sure this never ever happens again," Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, told reporters. Brown had talked about compensation for the farmer whose herd was destroyed, Kendall said, adding: "Let's focus on eradicating and controlling the disease." David Biland, managing director of Merial in Britain, said it was too early to say what caused the outbreak but insisted biosecurity procedures at the site were very strict. Merial is a leading animal health firm with 2006 sales of $2.2 billion. The head of the government-funded facility, the Institute for Animal Health, has said there was no breach of security at his laboratory and the suspect strain had not been used by his scientists for several weeks. In Brussels, the European Commission said exports of fresh meat, live animals and milk products would be banned from mainland Britain for the time being. The European Union's executive praised Britain for responding promptly to the outbreak and said there was no need for EU countries to take further trade action against Britain. Brown is eager to be seen acting quickly after a devastating foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 when six million animals were slaughtered. He has cut short his holiday and is chairing daily meetings of the government's crisis committee Cobra. Attention focused on the labs as a possible source of the infection after Defra said the strain of virus confirmed in the cattle was not one recently found in animals, but was isolated 40 years ago by British researchers. Benn said he expected initial findings of investigations at the Merial lab and the Institute for Animal Health on Tuesday. Industry experts said British exports of livestock and meat were worth about 15 million pounds ($30 million) a week. The foot and mouth crisis six years ago devastated British farming and hit tourism hard, costing the economy an estimated 8.5 billion pounds ($17 billio
