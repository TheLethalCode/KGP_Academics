 ANKARA, August 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty four people died when a minibus collided with a lorry carrying fruit in central Turkey, the state Anatolian news agency said on Tuesday. All but one of those killed were in the minibus conveying workers to the Black Sea region to help gather Turkey's annual hazelnut harvest. The 24th victim was the lorry driver. The accident occurred late on Monday in Sivas province about 500 km (325 miles) east of the capital Ankara. The local governor said the minibus driver had been driving too fast and had attempted to overtake the lorry. Turkish television showed images of the mangled wreckage of the two vehicles. Road accidents are common in Turkey where drivers often flout basic traffic rules.
