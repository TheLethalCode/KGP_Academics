 GUWAHATI, India, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three people were killed and 25 wounded when separatist rebels triggered four blasts in India's northeastern state of Assam on Tuesday, police said. Police blamed the attacks on the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), which is fighting for a separate country for the state's nearly 27 million people. Three people, including a local politician, were killed in the eastern town of Jorhat where the guerrillas parked a bomb-laden bicycle in front of a police station. At least 13 people were wounded. In separate attacks, the rebels set off three more bombs, including one in a crowded market near Dispur, wounding 12 people. "The rebels will continue with such attacks until independence day," a police officer said, referring to August 15 when India celebrates 60 years of independence from British rule. "We had intelligence inputs about their plans." Formed in 1979, the ULFA took up arms accusing New Delhi of taking away the tea- and oil-rich state's mineral and forest resources and giving back nothing in return.
