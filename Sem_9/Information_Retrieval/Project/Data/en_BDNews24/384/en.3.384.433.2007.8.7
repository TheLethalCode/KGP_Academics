<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Tuesday stayed the proceedings of the Anticorruption Commission notice asking Sheikh Hasina to submit her wealth statement. The court also asked six people including the ACC chairman and the secretary to explain in four weeks why the notice would not be declared illegal. The bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury issued the order on a writ petition filed by the detained former prime minister. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq told the court the ACC had sent the notice to Hasina wanting her wealth statement without investigation and enquiry as per law. "The ACC chairman is a good and an efficient person. But he is making mistakes as he is not getting proper guidance," he said. "The notice was given on July 17, a day after Sheikh Hasina was arrested. Hasina sought the assistance of Bangladesh Bank and the Anticorruption Commission in this regard. Bangladesh Bank and the ACC not only refrained from cooperating, but also directed that the bank accounts of Sheikh Hasina and her husband be frozen." "If one is asked to swim after having the hands and legs tied, how will one swim? Sheikh Hasina is detained, so it is not possible for her to give a wealth statement if she does not get documents," Huq said. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said Hasina had 18 bank accounts had she written to the banks instead of Bangladesh Bank, those banks would have given her the account statements. "Bangladesh Bank is not obliged to provide her account statements. So, it would not be right to issue stay order or interim order. Sheikh Hasina has been served notice seeking wealth statement as per law," he argued. The court said the ACC could serve notice after making investigation and inquiry, which it did not. The ACC rules need to be amended if the notice was to be given in thiss manner, the court observed. bdnews24
