<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks rose on Tuesday, as a rally in shares of financial institutions ahead of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and statement helped the market bounce back from four-months lows. Banks drove the gains, with BNP Paribas up 3.4 percent, Deutsche Bank up 4 percent and Credit Suisse up 4.5 percent. Recently battered mining shares also rose, buoyed by higher base metal prices. Anglo American gained 3 percent, and Rio Tinto added 2.1 percent. At 1023 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.2 percent at 1,521.43, bouncing back from Monday's 0.9 percent drop that saw the market touch its lowest level since the end of March. The benchmark index is up 2.7 percent this year. But the market is 7 percent below a 6-1/2 year high at 1635.58 on July 13, as global equities have sold off in line with rising concerns about corporate access to financing in a deteriorating credit environment. "The recent widening in credit spreads was long overdue and, while this could kill the speculative element that was starting to creep into equity markets -- namely the LBO/M&A frenzy -- we think the global macro outlook remains bullish," ABN AMRO analyst Dario Perkins wrote in a research note. "We are not yet seeing much evidence that problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market are spilling over into the broader global economy. This is why central bankers aren't particularly concerned at this point." The gains in Europe on Tuesday tracked a rally on Wall Street overnight spurred by speculation the Fed may take steps to reassure investors that the turmoil in the U.S. subprime mortgage market won't slow economic growth. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Tuesday, but the market will focus on the accompanying statement expected around 1815 GMT. "Overall, the Fed may attempt to sound pretty confident about the economy, even in the light of recent tensions, and hence still hawkish about inflation risks," Bear Stearns strategist Steve Barrow wrote in a research note. "At the same time, though, it may remind the market that it won't stand by if some sort of systemic issue occurs. Whether the Fed says this and whether such comments will make any difference to the market's perception remain to be seen." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 1.2 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 1.4 percent and France's CAC 40 was up 1.7 percent. Prudential added 3.1 percent after an upbeat note from Citigroup that cited its growth potential and cash generation. AWD Holding jumped 6.3 percent after UBS and Deutsche Bank upgraded the German financial adviser to "buy". Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered gained 3.2 percent after posting forecast-beating half-year earnings and a positive outlook. "In terms of the usual benchmarks, its difficult to argue equity markets are overvalued," ABN AMRO's Perkins wrote. "P/E ratios have remained at reasonable levels, regardless of whether they are calculated on the basis of backward or forward-looking earnings estimates. Similarly, compared with other asset classes, equities look reasonably cheap." French bank Natixis jumped 8.4 percent, continuing its recovery from a 10 percent fall at the end of last week as fears over its exposure to the US subprime mortgage sector continued to fade and as brokers upgraded the stock. UBS raised Natixis to "neutral" from "sell" while French broker CA Cheuvreux upgraded the stock to "outperform" from "underperform". Dexia, also hit recently by worries over its potential exposure to the subprime debacle, added 3.4 percent. The Belgian-French financial services group said after the market close on Monday that it and its subsidiary Financial Security Assurance Inc. (FSA) remained well-protected from the US subprime mark
