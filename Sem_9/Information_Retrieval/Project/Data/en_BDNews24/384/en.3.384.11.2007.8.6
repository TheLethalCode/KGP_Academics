 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inspirational all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has been recalled by England for this month's one-day series against India and the inaugural World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa in September. "Freddie is desperate to get back and anyone who saw him playing (for Lancashire) last weekend will know he is very fit," chairman of selectors David Graveney told reporters on Monday. "He has a number of matches to play now in domestic cricket and we will monitor him carefully and won't be cutting any corners to get him back." Flintoff has only recently returned for his county team following a three-month absence after undergoing ankle surgery for the third time in his career. Several Twenty20 specialists were included in the 15-man squad named for the trip to South Africa including Surrey leg-spinner Chris Schofield, Warwickshire batsman Darren Maddy and Leicestershire off-spinner Jeremy Snape. NEW GROUND "Having reviewed the team's performances in the recent Twenty20 matches against West Indies, the selectors felt it was necessary to include a number of players with greater experience of this format of the game," said Graveney. "The World Twenty20 tournament will be new ground for everyone and we feel that combining players with experience of one-day international cricket together with Twenty20 specialists will give us the best possible chance of success." The 14-man squad for the one-dayers with India shows three changes from the West Indies series. Flintoff, all-rounder Ravi Bopara and fast bowler Chris Tremlett replace Jonathan Trott, Michael Yardy and Liam Plunkett for the seven-match series which starts in Southampton on Aug. 21. "We are pleased to welcome Ravi Bopara and Flintoff back and will continue to monitor Andrew's rehabilitation from his ankle injury closely in the run-up to the tournament against India," said Graveney. "India will be tough opponents and the challenge for the team will be to demonstrate greater consistency in performance as we continue to build towards the next World Cup in 2011.
