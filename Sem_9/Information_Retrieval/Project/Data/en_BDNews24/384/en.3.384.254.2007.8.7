 LONDON, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest car dealer, Pendragon Plc, posted a drop in first-half profit on Tuesday as margins fell but said current trading was in line with its expectations as it looked for more acquisitions. "We're still doing the business but the margins are being eroded ... However, in a trading environment that is not helpful we have historically done some of our best deals," Chief Executive Trevor Finn told Reuters. Pendragon, which tried unsuccessfully to buy smaller rival Lookers last year, bought 19 dealerships from Dixon Motor Group last week for around 17 million pounds ($34.7 million). Finn said he saw more value in smaller deals. "There are lots of smaller dealerships that as the market consolidates will find it more difficult. There is a lot of other activity available to us off the quoted scene. In value terms it's in the small businesses," Finn said. Pendragon, which paid 504 million pounds for Reg Vardy last year, posted pretax profit for the six months to end-June of 33.5 million pounds, compared to 51.5 million the year before as revenue rose to 2.7 billion pounds from 2.6 billion. The group gets just over 40 percent of its gross profits from selling parts and servicing, around 30 percent from selling second-hand cars and about 30 percent from new-car sales. Larger rival Inchcape posted a 7.1 percent rise in first-half profit last week, helped by growth in emerging markets and in its domestic UK business. "We expect both Inchcape and Lookers to continue to outperform Pendragon on an operational level," Panmure Gordon analyst Mike Allen said. Shares in Pendragon, which have lagged the UK general retailers sector by 29 percent over the last 12 months, were up 9.3 percent at 79.5 pence by 0755 GMT, valuing the group at around 523 million pounds. "We would expect the share price to increase this morning as its interim performance have exceeded expectations," Allen said, maintaining a hold rating on the stock and 76 pence per share price target. Pendragon said it would pay an interim dividend of 2 pence per share, up 38 percent from the year befo
