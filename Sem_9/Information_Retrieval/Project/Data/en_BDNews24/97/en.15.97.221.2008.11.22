 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Three Awami League leaders, who failed to get party nominations for parliamentary polls, met with party president Sheikh Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on Saturday. They are Abul Kalam Azad seeking the Natore-1 ticket, Junaid Ahmed Palak of Natore-3 and Mahfuza Goldanz, wife of former lawmaker for Mymensingh-10 Altaf Hossain Goldanz. Emerging from the meeting all three told reporters that the party chief had assured them of "reconsidering the matter". Palak claimed he got the party ticket for the constituency for the cancelled Jan 22 election, but all three said they would accept the AL president's final decision. AL has nominated retired captain Giasuddin for Mymensingh-10 constituency, Shefali Momtaj, wife of slain AL leader Momtajuddin, for Natore-1 and district AL general secretary Hanif Ali Sheikh for Natore-3. bdnews
