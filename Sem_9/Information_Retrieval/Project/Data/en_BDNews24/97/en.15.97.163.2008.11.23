 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club are looking forward to stopping highflying Abahani Limited in an vital encounter of the Citycell B. League on Tuesday. The arch rivals' derby starts at 4:30pm with Channel i telecasting the match live from Bangabandhu National Stadium. Holders Abahani Limited did not have a good start after a shocking 2-1 down to last year's bottom team Rahmatganj MFS in the league opener, but they bounced back strongly to stay atop the points table pocketing 15 points from six matches. The Dhanmondi-based outfit are in a fantastic rhythm having registered five straight wins, which is a moral boost for the players before the high-voltage match. Taking into account the state of the spirited Abahani, Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq banks on his players' zealous strength accrued from the winning spree in the league. "The speed will be key for Mohammedans in Monday's match and I believe the boys will continue to show excellence against Abahani," Maruful told a pre-match briefing at the Bangladesh Football Federation Sunday. After being held to a 1-1 against Brothers Union, Mohammedan reacted sharply to hand a 2-1 defeat to title aspirant Sheikh Russel KC in the next match and raised their points to 11 from five outings. The Mohammedan coach, however, didn't want to take Abahani lightly. "Abahani have so far no weakness on the pitch as they have been playing well," said Maruf adding that it was a big advantage for Abahani, whose players had remained together for two years. Mohammedan coach might also face a tough challenge from their archrivals as Maruf has yet to settle a permanent playing eleven even after playing five league matches as the young coach seems suffering from indecision in players' selection for each new game. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen sounds optimistic about the team's winning streak by thrashing Mohammedan in the season's second meeting between them. Despite taking an early lead in the Federation Cup final, the sky blues outfit lost to the black and white outfit in a tiebreaker in season's first meeting, and Abahani will certainly be looking to returning the drubbing to their old foes. The Abahani coach was a bit worried over medio Mamunul Islam and defender Wali Faisal, who sustained minor injuries during practice a couple of days back. Sen, however, hoped both of them would return to the playing fold for the crucial match. "We always take to pitch for win, and there is no alternative to it this time against Mohammedan," said Sen adding that the players were mentally fit for the match. The B. League remained suspended for two weeks from Nov 11 to Nov 23 due to the national team's involvement in the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Malaysia, and both coaches think the break might affect the players' performance in the match. bd
