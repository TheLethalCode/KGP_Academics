<TITLE> Storm keeps SA waiting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bloemfontein, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  A thunderstorm in here before the lunch delayed South Africa's celebrations against Bangladesh as the third day's play of the first Test was called off at OUTsurance Oval on Friday. The storm came just 25 minutes before the scheduled lunch with Bangladesh on 67 for three in the second innings, which eventually forced both teams to take an early lunch. Later the umpires amid rain called off the day's play, two and a half hour before the scheduled close. Bangladesh, still needing 221 runs to avert the innings defeat, will resume the fourth day with Mohammad Ashraful and Mehrab Hossain Junior remaining unbeaten on seven and nought respectively. The Tigers had almost passed the first hour of the day without any casualty as overnight batsmen Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique batted bravely. Tamim threw his wicket away just before the drinks in the first session for 20 off 49 balls. Tamim hit paceman Dale Steyn for two successive fours in the fourth over of the day to show his determination, but the left-handed opener lost his concentration to edge a short and wide ball from Makhaya Ntini to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Eight overs later, Junaed also made the same mistake when he poked at a Jacques Kallis delivery and was caught by Boucher for 27, leaving the side at 67 for three in 23.5 overs. Bangladesh, following on, resumed the day on 20 for one and added 47 runs for two wickets before rain brought to a sudden end
