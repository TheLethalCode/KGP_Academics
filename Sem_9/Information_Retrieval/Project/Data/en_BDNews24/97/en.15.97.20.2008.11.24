 NEW DELHI, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England skipper Kevin Pietersen has told his players to keep fighting after India stamped their authority to take an unassailable 4-0 lead in a seven-match one-day series. The hosts won the rain-hit fourth game by 19 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method in Bangalore on Sunday, leaving England facing the prospect of a routing in the series. "We're in India and we've still got a test series to come," Pietersen was quoted as saying in the England board website (www.ecb.co.uk) on Monday. "The boys have been treated well, they've been having a fantastic time and I want their chins up. "I don't want to see anybody with their heads down and moping around, we want to come back firing on all cylinders on Wednesday (in Cuttack)." Pietersen took over as skipper in the summer and led the team to a 4-0 home one-day series win over South Africa but has come under intense scrutiny in India. England's batting order, as well as the inability to play spin, has been criticised. "We've got to bounce back and make sure we keep this series competitive," Pietersen added. "We're going to hold our heads up high and get on with trying to win some games of cricket." India have won their third consecutive one-day series after skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's side won a tri-series in Australia in March and then beat hosts Sri Lanka in August. 'POOR TACTICS' Former England batsman Graham Thorpe blamed poor tactics and said England had been "out-thought, out-skilled and outplayed by a very good, competent Indian side." The visitors, chasing a stiff target of 198 in 22 overs, were criticised for a slow start, scoring 21 runs in the first six overs with field restrictions. Thorpe said Pietersen should have promoted himself to open the innings to take advantage ahead of persisting with the orthodox Ian Bell, who made 12 from 15 deliveries. Owais Shah (72) and Andrew Flintoff (41) smashed 82 runs off just 48 balls for the fourth wicket before England ended on 178 for eight. "England haven't played anywhere near what I think they could have," added Thorpe, who is now working in broadcasting. "That has been the most disappointing thing. "I don't think this England side is a bad side, it shows India are a very good side. If you don't play to your potential in this country, you come off second best. "They deserve to be 4-0 down and they got an uphill battle now, not just for the rest of the one-day series, for the test series after.
