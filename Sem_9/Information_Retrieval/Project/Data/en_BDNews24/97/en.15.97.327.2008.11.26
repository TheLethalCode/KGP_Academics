 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The World Bank predicts tough times for the incoming elected government as Bangladesh's economy may shrink in the wake of the ongoing global crisis, though the finance adviser has rejected any forecast of a slowdown in GDP growth. "The negative impact of the global financial crisis will affect Bangladesh's economy in the near future," said World Bank Dhaka bureau chief economist Vinaya Swaroop at a workshop at the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar office on Wednesday. Export earnings and remittances are likely to shrink which in turn will mean a decline in GDP growth from 5.4 percent to 4.8 percent, he said. The GDP growth rate has been targeted at 6.5 percent for the current fiscal year. In 2007-08 it was 6.2 percent. Last year, the export sector contributed 14.1 percent of GDP while this year it was estimated at 16.4 percent, Swaroop said. But if the crisis turned severe this would come down to 15.7 percent and if the crisis was medium it would be 16 percent, he said. The current fiscal year estimated the contribution from remittances to GDP was 10 percent, falling to 8.9 percent in case of an acute crisis or in a medium crisis it would come down to 9.2 percent. The WB official said that it was estimated that 1 million people would go abroad for work this year, but only 2 lakh people had found overseas work in the first three months (July-September) of the current FY. There is much doubt whether the remaining 8 lakh people would find work abroad in the face of the current crisis, he said. "The present caretaker government might go more or less unscathed, but the new government taking over in January 2009 shall be facing the challenges posed by the global crisis," Swaroop said. That's why, he said, the next government must undertake economic activities after drawing up specific and detailed plans. WB resident representative Xian Zhu was present there. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam ruled out the prediction of the WB official. In his reaction, the adviser told reporters at the Secretariat that GDP growth would not fall under 6 percent. On whether Bangladeshi currency should be devalued against the US currency to tackle the loss in export earnings and remittances Swaroop said the Bank was not in favour of devaluation this moment. The government and Bangladesh Bank will decide on it considering the overall situation, he said. The fall of prices in fuel and food in the world market may have a negative impact in realising revenue, however, the WB economist added. The country's economists also fear that the current global credit crunch might lessen remittances, foreign loan and aid. The finance adviser called for utilisation of greater internal resources on Tuesday to tackle the crisis. bdnews24.com
