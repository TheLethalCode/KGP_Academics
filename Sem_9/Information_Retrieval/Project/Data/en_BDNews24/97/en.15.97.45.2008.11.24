 BANGKOK, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's parliament postponed an important legislative session on Monday after thousands of protesters besieged the compound in their latest bid to unseat the elected administration. Hundreds of riot police armed only with shields did not even offer token resistance against at least 10,000 demonstrators from the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), many of whom were armed with iron bars, golf clubs and stakes. Speaker Chai Chidchob said a new session to debate legislation for a regional summit to be hosted in the northern city of Chiang Mai next month would be rescheduled "once the situation returns to normal." The PAD, which called the march after a grenade killed one activist and wounded 23 last week, said they planned to lay siege to other government offices, the stock exchange and the homes of leaders of the ruling government coalition. "May victory be with the people," said Somkiat Pongpaiboon, a co-leader of the PAD, which has occupied Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat's offices at Government House since August in a bid to force out the elected People Power Party (PPP) administration. Somchai, who will return mid-week from an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru, told Reuters in Lima he would exercise the "utmost" restraint but reiterated that he had no intention of resigning. "We have to talk and try for reconciliation," Somchai said. When the PAD blocked access to parliament last month police burst through their lines with teargas and baton charges, triggering a day of running street battles in which two people were killed and hundreds, including police, were injured. NATIONWIDE STRIKE Public sector unions have called a nationwide strike for Tuesday unless Somchai stands aside. If carried out, the strikes would deepen the economic impact of a political crisis now in its fourth year. Government decision-making has ground to a halt, intensifying fears about the export-driven economy's ability to withstand a global recession. Some foreign firms are already cutting back production and jobs. The latest economic data showed Thailand's economy is on track to expand by 4.5 percent this year, slowing from 4.9 percent last year, amid stuttering export growth and weakening investment. The PAD is an unelected group of royalist businessmen, academics and activists who accuse the government of being a puppet of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. A PAD security guard died on Sunday after another grenade attack a day earlier. Major bloodshed would raise the chances of a military coup only two years after the army's removal of Thaksin, who now lives in exile after skipping bail on corruption charges. Army chief Anupong Paochinda, who has put more than 3,000 anti-riot soldiers on standby to help the police, has said a putsch would do nothing to resolve the country's fundamental political rifts. Somchai, Thaksin's brother-in-law, said in Lima that the military had repeatedly said there would be no coup and that the political turmoil was confined to Bangkok. The PAD enjoy the backing of Bangkok's urban middle classes and elite, including Queen Sirikit, while Thaksin and the government claim their support from the rural voters that returned the PPP in a December election
