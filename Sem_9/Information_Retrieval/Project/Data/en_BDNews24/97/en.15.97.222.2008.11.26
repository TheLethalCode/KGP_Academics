<TITLE> AirAsia to fly to London for 99 pounds </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia X said it will fly to London from next March with fares starting at 99 pounds (S$229), and that the cost could halve if the service is popular, according to Malaysia's The Star daily. AirAsia X will fly five times a week between the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur and Stansted Airport on the outskirts of London, it said late on Tuesday. Tony Fernandes, founder of the long-haul airline's affiliate AirAsia, said he hoped to attract Europeans who would explore the region through AirAsia's extensive route network in South-east Asia. "AirAsia X's London-Kuala Lumpur route is the realisation of a long-held ambition to open up affordable access between Malaysia and Europe for both (South-east Asian) and European communities," he said in a statement. Fernandes told The Star daily that the one-way fare of 99 pounds could fall to as low as 49 pounds if the flight frequency was increased. "Volume is the key. If we can find the plane and get two or three flights a day, I guarantee you 49 pounds will be a reality," he told reporters at the launch in London. AirAsia X, which currently flies to Australia's Gold Coast, Perth and Melbourne, and Hangzhou in China, has ambitions of expanding sales tenfold to US$1 billion (S$1.5 billion) by the end of 2010, despite the global slowdown. AirAsia X and AirAsia have sounded an extremely optimistic note in recent months, despite the uncertain global outlook and predictions of doom for airlines. Earlier this month they scrapped fuel surcharges on all flights to drum up business. With the delivery of 25 Airbus A330-300 aircraft between now and 2013, AirAsia X says it wants to expand to at least 30 more destinations in Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and the Middle East. Even with the 99 fare, it's still cheaper to fly from London to Kuala Lumpur than to take a Black Cab from the city to Stansted Airport, which costs about 110 (RM610) one way! Malaysians flying to London will also pay RM499 for the return flight while travellers from London going to KLIA will pay 99 (RM541) for the return ticket. Online bookings opened at 8pm Tuesday (Malaysian time) for the five-times-a-week direct flights which will be for the travel period between March 11 and Oct 24. Fares start from as low as 99 (RM499) for economy seats and 549 (RM1,999) for XL seats  inclusive of airport taxes and charges. The latest flights will use Airbus A340 planes which will have 286 economy and 30 premium seats. Fernandes said his next step would be to increase the five times weekly flights to daily and even two or three times a day. "The London-Kuala Lumpur route is the realisation of a long-held ambition to open up affordable access between Malaysia and Europe for both the Asean and European communities," he said. AirAsia X CEO Azran Osman Rani described the London route as a significant achievement, allowing those who had always wanted to travel between Europe and Asean to achieve their dream at an affordable price. Stansted Airport's commercial and development director Nick Barton, who finalised discussions with AirAsia X, hailed the launch as a major milestone for low-cost, long-haul air travel around the world. The latest route is the first step for AirAsia to realise its European aspirations and boost Kuala Lumpur as the regional aviation hub and gateway into Asean, China and Australia. Stansted is Britain's third busiest airport, with 22.8 million passengers passing through and many leading low-cost airlines making it their b
