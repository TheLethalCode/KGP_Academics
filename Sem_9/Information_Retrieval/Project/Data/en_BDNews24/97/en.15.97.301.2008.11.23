<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has demanded suspension "at least" of Section 91(E) of the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008, claiming it was meant to harass people. She also said full withdrawal of emergency would be a relief for the people, though she welcomed the Election Commission's announcement of new dates for parliamentary and upazila polls on Sunday. "The EC should at least shelve the clause 91 (E) of the RPO if it cannot annul it," the BNP chairperson said at her Gulshan office. "The issue can be later resolved through discussions in the parliament." She reiterated her demand to lift the state of emergency from the day of withdrawal of nominations. The two demands were included in the four conditions for going to election, set by BNP and its allies last week, along with rescheduling the polls. The BNP chairperson criticised the government for "pushing the country 20 years back" adding there was no employment generation and investments fell and there were reports of rigging in the elections of four city corporations  all providing enough proof that elections amid emergency is not possible. "The recent city corporation election proved that polls under emergency is not possible. So people will be relieved if the emergency goes immediately." She also said, "The Jan 22 election in 2007 was obstructed on the plea of absence of suitable environment. The government will have to shoulder the blame if the situation recurs now." Khaleda urged the authorities to create a "proper" environment without any further waste of time. The former PM was speaking at a function to mark former Barisal PDP leader Sharfuddin Ahmed Shantu joining BNP on Sunday evening. She welcomed leaders of different parties and organisations who had joined her party. BNP leaders, including general secretary Khandaker Delwar Hossain, leaders from Barisal and Bhola and former MPs were also present on the occasion. bdnews24.
