 BANGKOK, Tue Nov 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai protesters surrounded the government's temporary headquarters on Tuesday in an increasingly desperate bid to unseat the elected administration but a threatened nationwide strike failed to materialise. The marchers, who blockaded parliament on Monday and forced it to postpone an important legislative session, converged on Bangkok's old Don Muang airport, where the cabinet has run the country since demonstrators occupied Government House in August. "Our mission to stop the government from exercising its power at Don Muang has been accomplished," a PAD leader said as protesters occupied VIP rooms used by government ministers. Domestic flights were operating as usual from Don Muang, about 50 km from Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi international airport, the gateway for some 13 million tourists a year. There were no major disruptions to air, road or rail services despite a nationwide strike called by public sector unions if the government did not quit, which it has refused to do. One union chief said protesters might picket Suvarnabhumi airport early on Wednesday, when Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat is expected to return from an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru. "I can't tell you what we are going to do now, just wait until the prime minister returns," Chamsri Sukchotrat, head of the union at national carrier Thai Airways, told Reuters. Any serious labour disruptions would likely deepen the economic impact of the long-running political crisis, which has stymied government decision-making and hurt the export-driven economy's ability to cope with a global crisis. The latest data suggests the economy will grow at 4.5 percent this year, its slowest rate in seven years, due to weakening investment and stuttering exports to key markets in the United States and Europe. The PAD has called its latest protests the "final battle" in a six-month campaign that has so far failed to deliver a knock-out blow to the People Power Party (PPP) government. Despite family ties to ousted leader Thaksin Shinawatra, Somchai's bland, inoffensive personality has proved a difficult target for the PAD. Somchai is Thaksin's brother-in-law. The police have also gone out of their way to avoid a bloody confrontation with the protesters. When the PAD besieged parliament on Oct. 7, two people were killed and hundreds injured in running battles with riot police -- the worst street violence in the Thai capital since the army opened fire on democracy protesters in 1992. This time riot police are carrying only shields and are avoiding PAD youths armed with iron bars, golf clubs and stakes. Major bloodshed would raise the chances of a military coup only two years after the army removed Thaksin, who now lives in exile after skipping bail on corruption charges. Army chief Anupong Paochinda, who has more than 3,000 anti-riot soldiers on standby to help police, has said a putsch would do nothing to resolve fundamental political rifts. The PAD enjoys the backing of Bangkok's urban middle classes and elite, including Queen Sirikit. Thaksin and the government claim their support from the rural voters who returned the PPP in a December election
