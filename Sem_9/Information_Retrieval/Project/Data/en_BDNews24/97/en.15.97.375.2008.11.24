 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League has accepted the new general election date of Dec. 29 but wants the Upazila polls schedule cancelled, said a party spokesperson on Monday. "The state of emergency must also certainly, certainly be withdrawn ahead of the parliamentary polls," said Syed Ashraful Islam in a press briefing as a meeting of AL and its allies was going on. "We are accepting this schedule but the election cannot be deferred anymore. If the date is changed again, it means there is a conspiracy to foil the election." The acting general secretary said the schedule for elections to Upazila Parishads, a key local government component, must be scrapped. He said it was for the incoming elected government to hold them. He said the military-installed emergency government was a failure. "The people do not want to see this government any more." The Election Commission on Sunday announced the third amendment to the schedule for the ninth parliamentary and third Upazila Parishad elections. According to the new dates, they will be held on Dec. 29 and Jan. 22 respectively. The last date for the submission of nomination papers for the general election is Nov. 30, with scrutiny of papers scheduled for Dec. 3 and 4. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is Dec. 11. For the Upazila elections, the last date for the submission of nomination papers is Dec. 13, scrutiny of papers between Dec. 17 and 19, and the last date for withdrawal of nominations is Dec. 31. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia welcomed the new general election schedule on Sunday. bdnews
