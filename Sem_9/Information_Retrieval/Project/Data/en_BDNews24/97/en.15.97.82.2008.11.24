 Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com correspondent Chittagong, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Medical College has been closed and students have been ordered to leave the residential halls after students clashed and ransacked dormitories on Monday. Activists of BNP`s student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and it`s ally Jamaat-e-Islami`s wing Islami Chhatra Shibir traded blows over welcoming admission-seekers. The skirmishes erupted into full-blown clashes that raged the campus for three hours, police and witnesses said. The academic council at an emergency meeting asked male students to vacate the residential halls by 8pm and female students by 8am Tuesday. The examinations have also been suspended indefinitely but the admission test will go ahead as per schedule. "After a clash between Chhatra Dal and Chhatra Shibir and vandalism in the residential halls, the institution has been closed and students have been told leave," confirmed Chittagong Metropolitan deputy commissioner Banaj Kumar Majumdar. "Chhatra Dal worker Najmul was beaten by Shibir workers without provocation," claimed Farhad Hossain, general secretary of JCD. Iqbal Hossain, the ICS leader, made a counter claim that it was the JCD men who had provoked the attack. ICS workers were seen entering the campus wielding sticks. Farhad, the JCD leader, also alleged that the police had not arrived in time despite requests. "The police came to the scene with eight platoons as soon as they were informed but it took some time to bring the situation under control," explained the deputy commissioner. On allegations that non-students had entered the campus, Mesbahuddin, assistant police commissioner, said, "They wanted to enter the campus but were repelled by the police." bd
