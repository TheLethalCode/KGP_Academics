<TITLE> Beatles' iTunes talks stall, says McCartney </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks to put The Beatles' catalog on Apple's iTunes online music store have stalled, former Fab Four member Paul McCartney told the BBC. The Beatles is one of the few big acts left whose music is not available on iTunes, but the settlement of a trademark dispute between Apple and The Beatles' company Apple Corps Ltd last year was seen as finally clearing the way. "We'd like to do it," McCartney was quoted as telling the BBC on its website on Tuesday. "We are very for it, we've been pushing it. But there are a couple of sticking points, I understand. "Last word I got back was it's stalled at the moment," McCartney added. "But I really hope it will happen because I think it should." McCartney said that EMI, which has acted as the distributor for the Beatles since the early 1960s, "want something we're not prepared to give 'em. "It's between EMI and The Beatles I think -- what else is new?" The solo catalogues of all four members of The Beatles are available digitally, and fans are keen for the group, the most successful in pop music history, to follow suit. "We have been working hard to secure agreement with Apple Corps to make the Beatles' legendary recording catalog available to fans in digital form," said a spokeswoman for EMI. "Unfortunately, the various parties involved have been unable to reach agreement, but we really hope everyone can make progress soon."
