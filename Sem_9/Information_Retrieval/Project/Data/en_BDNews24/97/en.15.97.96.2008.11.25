 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  Research on stem cells must start now in Bangladesh, specialist doctors said on Tuesday. "Thousands of people succumb to kidney, liver and lung disorders in the country. The scenario can be changed by applying high-tech stem cell techniques," special assistant to the chief adviser MA Malek said, at the fourth national conference of the Kidney Foundation. "Let there be research on it." National professor MR Khan stressed the need for stem cell research, which if introduced could fetch great advancements in the medical field, saying: "One person's death can save five lives." Dr W L Saksiri, a Thai stem cell specialist, said stem cells are a precious source of regenerative tissue that have yielded astounding benefits in lab tests on mice and monkeys. Acute and chronic kidney patients and kidney cancer patients can benefit from stem cell transplants, he said. Stem cells, found in fetuses and placentae, are undifferentiated cells from which specialised cells such as blood cells develop can be grown or regenerated. Kidney Foundation president Harunur Rashid said the conference's focus on stem cell research in Bangladesh aims at raising awareness among doctors. The Foundation imports new technologies every year to invigorate the country's medical sector. BSMMU VC Dr Nazrul Islam mentioned another vital intervention for kidney patients, cadaveric transplants. "Kidney failure claims 40,000 lives a year in Bangladesh," he cited. "Cadaveric kidney transplant technology can if applied address the scarcity of living kidney donors," he said. German specialist C G Bourg said in developed countries, 80-85 per cent kidney transplants apply cadaver technology. The conference was held at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in the city on Tuesday. bdnews
