<TITLE> EC explains 91E, says UZ polls to go ahead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com) There is no easy way to abuse Section 91E of the Representation of the People Order, nor any way to defer Upazila elections, said election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain on Tuesday, addressing separate election concerns of BNP and Awami League. BNP has demanded annulment or suspension of 91E which gives the EC power to cancel candidacy, claiming it is meant only to "harass' candidates. Stressing it would not be misused under any situation, Sakhawat said Tuesday: "In case of a violation of electoral code, the EC has the power to annul the candidature." "The EC has the authority to apply this section only in case there is a serious written allegation of influencing the election or making the election process difficult." "But it has to be proved under the EC inquiry. The commission will hear the accuser and the accused on the report to be submitted by the EC enquiry committee on the flagrant violation of the electoral code of conduct," the election official clarified. Even if the commission wanted to take measures against anybody, all the commissioners had to be unanimous and, if need be, the aggrieved person could go to the court, he stressed. "Since this section has not been studied well, questions are being raised in different ways, giving rise to misunderstanding," Sakhawat said. BNP and its allies called for cancellation of the provision earlier this month, as a condition for the alliance's participation in the upcoming election, along with three other demands including rescheduling elections and lifting the state of emergency. Since then, Transparency International Bangladesh has issued a statement calling Section 91E "indispensable". If it is annulled, "there will not remain any institutional process to effectively enforce the electoral code of conduct on candidates," said the corruption watchdog. On Monday, constitutional experts voiced their support for the section, but added that it "may be open to abuse". Explaining the process, Sakhawat said Tuesday, "If there is only one candidate left for a constituency after the candidatures of other contestants are cancelled, there is provision for re-inviting nominations. There is no scope for election of a candidate uncontested in this section. Under Section 17 of the RPO, if a candidate or an elected member dies, re-election takes place". The election commissioner also stressed that there was no scope for shifting the Upazila election date beyond Jan 22. Awami League after deliberations on Monaday announced that it would accept the EC's newly scheduled parliamentary polls to be held now on Dec 29, but wanted Upazila polls, that have been rescheduled for Jan 22 to be cancelled so they may be held under the next elected government. However, Sakhawat said Tuesday: "There is provision for updating the voter list at the beginning of the year; so the Upazila election date must not be changed or the next possible date will be uncertain." "Current schedules should make it more convenient to hold parliamentary and Upazila elections because of the wider time gap". Replying to a question on another much-debated electoral issue, Sakhawat said, "If mayors of city corporations or municipal bodies want to contest the parliamentary election, they must resign from their mayoral posts." "But ward councillors can contest the election since they do not hold the 'office of profit'. Union Parishad chairmen also have the scope to participate in the Upazila election on resignation," he said. Sakhawat said letters would be sent to 39 registered political parties requesting them to abide by the electoral code of conduct. Turning to the registered parties, he said, "There is a wide scope to nominate more than one candidate by political parties, but it has to inform the returning officer before finally withdrawing nomination papers in favour of one." He also made a request to nominate candidates on the basis of recommendations from the grass-root level in accordance with the constitution of the party. bdnews24.com
