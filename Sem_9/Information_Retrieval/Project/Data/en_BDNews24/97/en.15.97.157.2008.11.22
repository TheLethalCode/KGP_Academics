 Mymensingh, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said "good omens of change" were in sight in the country. "The people of remote areas and the minorities must also be integrated into the process otherwise efforts for change will not be fruitful," he said. Zillur made the remarks to journalists after visiting Haluaghat Model High School near the district's Indian border. Asked about the recent brief meeting and exchange of pleasantries between the two former PMs, and about the ensuing national elections, the adviser chose a roundabout answer saying: "Bangladesh has made commendable progress and we want to march further towards a bright future. All concerned should be involved in the process." Hossain Zillur earlier spoke as chief guest at Haluaghat Model High School, flanked by his wife Mahbuba Haque. The education adviser said, "The government eyes resolving regional discrepancies and bridging the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged." "We want every child to reach the zenith of attainment," he stressed. The adviser went on to the Bangladesh Agriculture University where he addressed a meeting at the VC's office. Zillur said, "We have overcome a number of crises by dint of the incredible power hidden in agriculture and our farmers." "Even post-cyclone Orissa in India and post-Katrina America had things to learn from the examples our people set in the face of adversity," said Zillur. The government has announced agriculture as the country's top-priority sector, the adviser said. bdn
