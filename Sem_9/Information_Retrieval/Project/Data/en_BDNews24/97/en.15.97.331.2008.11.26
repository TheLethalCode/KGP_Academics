 MUMBAI, Wed Nov 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top airlines in India have withdrawn a transaction fee on air tickets effective Wednesday for tickets sold through call centres, websites or city offices. Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines have withdrawn the fee, which ranges from 350 rupees on a domestic economy ticket to 1,200 to 10,000 rupees on first class international tickets. "We are withdrawing the transaction fee for tickets sold through our offices, airport counters or websites, effective today (Wednesday), a Jet spokeswoman said. "For tickets booked directly with us through our website, call centre or city offices, there will be no transaction fee levied," a Kingfisher spokesman said. "The fee ranges from 350 rupees for domestic fares to 10,000 rupees for long haul first class international flights," the Kingfisher spokesman said. State-run Air India said late on Tuesday it has withdrawn the fee for domestic and international air tickets effective Wednesday. The move comes after the federal aviation minister Praful Patel said that domestic airlines should cut fares on easing jet fuel prices
