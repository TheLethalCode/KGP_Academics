 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has begun selling nomination forms for 263 parliamentary among the party contenders Tuesday, leaving out 37 seats earmarked for its allies prior to the cancelled 2007 polls. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com Tuesday, "We have started selling nomination forms this morning which will continue through Wednesday. Aspiring candidates will collect the nomination papers and submit the same during this period." "Interviewing the nomination seekers is scheduled to start the day after on 27 November." Six booths have been opened at the central office of BNP for the six administrative divisions of the country. The party headquarters looked relatively less crowded with leaders and workers this year. Adequate number of policemen have been deployed in the vicinity of the office. Starting in the morning till 11 am, speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has collected his nomination papers for Panchagarh-1 constituency, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman for Moulvibazaar-3, Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain for Comilla-1, barrister Moudud Ahmed Noakhali-5, retired brigadier general ASM Hannan Shah Gazipur-4, former Dhaka chamber president M Saiful Islam for Dhaka-17, former power state minister Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku for Sirajganj-2 and two forms were collected for Tuku's wife too. But none has collected nomination papers so far for the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia as she has not enrolled herself as a voter yet. BNP leaders said, forms will be collected for her as soon she registers as a voter. The candidates will have to pay a sum of Tk 1,000 each for collecting nomination papers and Tk 20,000 as non-refundable deposit at the time of submission of the nomination papers along with an affidavit duly filled in. bd
