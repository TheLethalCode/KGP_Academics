 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has added two more to the "final list" of registered political parties, raising the number to 39, an official said on Monday. The two newly registered parties are Khelafat Majlis and Freedom Party. "We hope the parties will follow their constitutions in nominating candidates from those changing floors across parties as there is no bar to that," Election Commission joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan said. Asked if the failed aspirants could seek nomination by changing a political party before the elections, Khan said, "A new section (90B sub-section 4) added to the party constitution regarding the nomination requires the parties to nominate from the 'panel' proposed by the ward, Thana, Upazila and district level committees." EC deputy secretary, law, AKM salimullah told bdnews24.com that they had reformed the electoral laws to prevent 'nomination trade' and reduce the influence of `black money` before and during the elections. The latest electoral laws say anyone who seeks party nomination must be member of that party for at least three years, the EC official pointed out. "The new clause will be applicable three years after registration. Since the party registration has started this year, the new guideline will take effect from the tenth parliamentary elections." Khan said they registered 39 out of 107 parties who had applied. bd
