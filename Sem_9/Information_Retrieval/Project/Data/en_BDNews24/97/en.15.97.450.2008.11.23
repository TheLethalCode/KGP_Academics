 Chittagong, Nov 23(bdnews24.com)  Two readymade garment factories suffered huge apparel and machinery losses to a fire that raged for at least ten hours on Sunday in the city's Asadganj, firefighters said. None were injured, but firemen battled the blaze from around noon to late evening, they added. "Angelic Apparels, and Apollo Swing and Garments Ltd both of which are in a six-storey building caught fire at 12:45pm," Bishu Das, a member of fire service engaged in extinguishing fire, said to bdnews24.com. The fire was still undoused at 11pm. "It originated from Apollo Garment's warehouse and spread fast to Angelic Apparels," said Das. "The fire created panic across the area. As the area is congested with narrow lanes, it was difficult for us and to put out the fire." "Most of the workers of the factories were out for lunch. Therefore, a small number of workers who were in the factories were evacuated hurriedly." "My factory lost a lot of garments and machinery worth around four and half a crore taka," Angelic Apparels managing director and Zakir Hossain said to reporters. "In the warehouse I also had some garment ready for export in a few days." He said Apollo Swing owned by Anjan Shekhar had stored some RMG products ready for export. "The exact amount of loss cannot be confirmed until the fire is doused and a damage assessment made," he added. bd
