<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  If voted to power, Awami League will pick an additional deputy speaker from the opposition among other steps to make the parliament more effective, the party president`s aide quoted her as saying on Tuesday. "Since there's provision for engaging more than one deputy speaker in the national parliament, the treasury will seek another name from the opposition for the purpose," said Sheikh Hasina to the visiting UN delegation headed by Francese Vendrell Tuesday at her Sudha Sadan home. The AL is fully geared for the upcoming parliamentary polls to uphold democracy, regardless of BNP's conditional participation, Hasina said when the UN delegates asked her how she appreciated BNP's election moves. "The UN delegates asked our leader if Awami League will run the election in case BNP decides finally not to go for it. She said her party is always ready for the polls for upholding and safeguarding democratic practices," said Hasan Mahmud, special aide. "We'll invite different parties concerned to nominate chairs for various parliamentary committees and work cohesively to render the parliament more effective," Hasina was further quoted as saying to the UN delegates. The BNP and allies will go to the elections if emergency rule is lifted totally and section 91 (E) of the RPO suspended, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Monday. The head of the visiting delegation told reporters that they had met the AL president to discuss the pre-polls situation with her. "What we have observed so far seems quite all right. The United Nations will not send any observer to cover this election," said the head of the UN mission. "The EU and the Commonwealth will be sending down election observers instead." Replying to a query, Francese said, "We want the state of emergency to be lifted before the polls; no one would like an election to be held under the emergency. And if the emergency is unavoidable, it might be there just superficially." AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury, two former ambassadors Muhammad Zameer and Ziauddin and Hasina's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad were present. bdnews
