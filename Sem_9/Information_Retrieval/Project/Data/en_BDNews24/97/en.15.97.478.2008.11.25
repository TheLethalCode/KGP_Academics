 Amit Talukdar bdnews24.com court correspondent Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)Constitutional experts have backed Section 91E of the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008, to which BNP objects for giving the Election Commision power to cancel candidacy - though some warn that it may be open to abuse. "This provision is a fair provision. If any candidate violates the RPO or electoral code of conduct, his candidature may be cancelled. I do not think there is any complaint against it," barrister Shafique Ahmed, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, told bdnews24.com on Monday. "This provision also gives the candidate the opportunities of being heard. So, there is no possibility of violation of the principles of natural justice," he said. Constitutional expert Dr M Zahir, however, says: "I do not think section 91E of the RPO will be of much relevance for the coming election. But, if this provision is allowed to remain in the RPO it may be used malafide in future." "The section authorises the Election Commission to cancel candidature of any person on written information received by the EC about involvement of the candidate in illegal activities or violation of provisions of the RPO or code of conduct," Dr Zahir pointed out. "But, before taking any action the EC must give the person a show cause notice and an opportunity of personal hearing. By which time the election will have been held." Barrister Rafique-ul-Haque, who has represented former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia in court in recent months, told bdnews24.com: "It is not a bad law, but there is possibility of abuse of this section." Section 91E (1) of the RPO provides that if it appears to the EC on receiving a verbal complaint or written report that any candidate or his agent, or any other person on his behalf, by his order engaged or attempted to violate any provision of the RPO electoral or code of conduct, the EC may investigate giving the candidate an opportunity of being heard. Section 91E (2) provides that after receiving the investigation report, if the EC is satisfied that it is true, the commission may by a written order cancel the candidature of such candidate and in that event the election shall be held among the other contesting candidates of the concerned constituency. BNP and its allies, a week ago, called for cancellation of the provision as a condition for the alliance's participation in the upcoming election, along with three other demands including rescheduling elections and lifting the state of emergency. Transparency International Bangladesh has called Section 91E "indispensable". In a statement issued Saturday, TIB said: "If it is annulled, there will not remain any institutional process to effectively enforce the electoral code of conduct on candidates." BNP chief Khaleda Zia, meanwhile, repeated her alliance's demand on Sunday, to "at least suspend if not annul" Section 91E, claiming it was meant to harass people. b
