 Chittagong, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's Chittagong city unit is prepared for the elections, the party's leaders said on Friday. "Electioneering and public relations are going on in full swing," BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman said to bdnews24.com. "Not only in Chittagong, BNP is also organised in the greater Chittagong." Referring to the rally in Laldighi Maidau on Nov. 7, the former minister said, "We successfully held a huge public rally with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia that has consolidated the party's organisational base in the greater Chittagong." Over the lack of suitable candidates, he said, "We will be able to get over the crisis in time. In fact, we don't have any candidate crisis." "Decision will be taken in consultation with the central BNP. It will be the best way to nominate candidates." Over preparations of prospective candidates, another leader Amir Khasru Mahmood Chowdhury said, "Prospective candidates have already made their preparations. They will collect nominations forms immediately after the central BNP makes announcement on election participation." The three city constituencies have bee split in four which are Chittagong-7 (Chandgaon-Boalkhali), Chittagong-8 (Kotwali), Chittagong-9 (Doublemooring), Chittagong-10 (Patenga-Pahartoli). Of the seats, Chittagong-10 emerged anew. Khasru, a member of the city BNP convening committee, said he will want nominations from Chittagong -10 in addition to Chittagong-7. As former lawmaker from Chittagong-7 was convicted, he could not seek nomination due to legal barrier, he said . Khasru added, "Ershad Ullah also may be a candidate for Chittagong-7." Chittagong city BNP's former leader Ershad Ullah said, "I will seek nomination from Chittagong-7 if the party takes decision to go to the poll." bdne
