 HARARE, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spinner Muttiah Muralitharan took two wickets in an effective final over to thwart Zimbabwe's victory push as Sri Lanka won the third one-day international by five runs on Monday. With Zimbabwe needing 10 runs from the 28th and final over to chase down a target of 172, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene tossed the ball to Muralitharan. The off spinner trapped Stuart Matsikenyeri, who had scored 19 off 10 balls, leg-before with the first ball and then conceded just four runs, before having Tawanda Mupariwa stumped off the final delivery when six runs were needed. Muralitharan finished with two for 20 in six overs, fellow spinner Ajantha Mendis took two for 36 and seamer Thilan Thushara two for 31 as Zimbabwe came up short on 166 for seven to go 3-0 down in the five-match series. Opener Hamilton Masakadza had hit a quickfire 77 before he swung wildly at Thushara and was caught at third man. Sri Lanka's innings, which only began in the afternoon after rain had delayed the start of play, never really caught alight as they struggled against Zimbabwe's medium-pacers. Kumar Sangakkara scored 57 in their total of 171 for seven as Mupariwa took four for 39 and Elton Chigumbura three for 37
