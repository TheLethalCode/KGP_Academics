 BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa, November 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm paceman Lonwabo Tsotsobe was the only new cap named in South Africa's 15-man squad on Saturday for next month's tour of Australia. Injuries ruled Andre Nel and Albie Morkel out of contention while left-arm spinner Robin Peterson was chosen as back-up to Paul Harris after taking five for 33 in his previous test innings, against Bangladesh in Chittagong in March. Captain Graeme Smith said the squad had a great chance of doing well in Australia, where South Africa have never won a test series. "I think we have earned the right to be confident. Each player has contributed to our recent success and, as captain, I have a lot of confidence in the squad," he told reporters shortly after South Africa eased to victory in the first test against Bangladesh on Saturday. "We will go to Australia as a mature team in a settled environment, everyone knows their roles and we have a clear goal in mind. I have no doubt we will be able to meet the challenges we find there. Acting convenor of selectors Craig Matthews said the 24-year-old Tsotsobe had the chance to prove himself in Australia. "He has the opportunity to prove himself because we have been looking for a left-armer for a while. It will give him a good indication of where he is lacking certain things," Matthews said. The experienced Nel is only expected to start bowling again in early December after knee ligament surgery, while Morkel has a shoulder injury that will keep him out of action for four to six weeks. Matthews said left-arm spinner Harris, who fractured his thumb on the first day of the first test against Bangladesh, is in doubt for the first test against Australia starting in Perth on Dec. 17, which is why Peterson was recalled. Squad - Graeme Smith, Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Paul Harris, JP Duminy, Monde Zondeki, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo Tsotsob
