 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has embargoed advertisement making false claims of five brands of powdered milk in the media until Jan. 3, a lawyer said on Tuesday. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddique in its order said the lawyers for the Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Nido and Enlene had promised that no further advertisement would appear until then. Rights watchdog Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh petitioned the High Court on Sunday to stop the advertisements by five brands claiming their milk powder was free from melamine. "Eight brands of powder milk have tested positive for melamine. Among them five brands varied advertisements in different newspapers on November 15 and 18, and misled the public without mentioning the presence of melamine," said advocate Manzil Murshid, the lawyer for HRPB, to the court. "The powdered milk companies claimed that the High Court had withdrawn a ban on marketing of their products, which is false. According to Section 19(1) of the Pure Food Ordinance, 1959 the court has the power to stop false advertisement of powdered milks," he said. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the counsel for Nido, said, "Nido has not published any false advertisement. However, the High Court cannot entertain the application under Section 19 of Pure Food Ordinance." For Diploma and Red Cow, their lawyer Mahmudul Islam said no advertisement would be published until Jan. 3. Barrister Tania Amir appearing for Dano argued that her client did not publish any false advertisement, rather supplied information to the people. Upon a writ petition of HRPB, the High Court on Oct. 23 ordered the government to stop sale and display Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashli-1, Yashli-2, Sweet Baby, Nido and Enlene until lab test reports from abroad were made available to the court. On Nov. 10, the court directed the government to collect fresh sample and send them again to Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission and the Chemistry Department of the University of Dhaka for laboratory test. The court withdraw ban on the five brands for 21 days. The Supreme Court on Nov. 17 asked the government to also send sample to World Health Organisation for laboratory test and permitted sale and display of the five brands until Jan. 3. b
