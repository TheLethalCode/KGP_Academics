 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP and allies will go to the elections if emergency rule is lifted and section 91 (E) of the RPO suspended, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Monday. Emerging from the four-party alliance meeting at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office, Delwar told reporters if those two demands were not met by the last date for the submission of the nominations, the alliance would decide about whether or not to run for the parliament. The emergency government incorporated section 91E by amending the Representation of People Order 1972. Under this clause, the Election Commission can cancel the candidature of anyone who, on investigation, is found violating the electoral code of conduct. Earlier, the BNP`s standing committee, the highest policymaking forum, sat and decided to take part in the elections. Delwar said, "A fair and credible election is not possible amid emergency which is why we want it to go by the last date for the submission of nomination papers." He said his party had finalised the list of party nominees and the issue of sharing seats with the allies would be resolved later. Present in the four-party alliance meeting, among others, were Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed and Delwar Hossain Saidee, Islami Oikya Jote leaders Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini and Abdul Latif Nezami, Bangladesh Jatiya Party leaders Andalib Rahman and Shamim Al-Mamun and Khelafat Majlis leaders Moulana Mohammad Ishaque and Ahmed Abdul Kader. BNP chief Khaleda Zia presided over the meeting while the BNP secretary general represented the party. bdnews24
