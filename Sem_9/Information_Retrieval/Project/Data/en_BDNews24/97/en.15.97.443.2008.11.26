<TITLE> Bid to unseat Philippines' Arroyo almost over </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Wed Nov 26,(dbnews24.com/Reuters) - A Philippine parliamentary committee dismissed an impeachment complaint against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Wednesday, almost certainly ending the latest attempt to unseat her. The justice committee of the lower House of Representatives in Congress voted 42-8 to dismiss the complaint for lack of substance, officials said. The decision will be put to a vote in the full 238-member house next week, but the legislature is packed with supporters of Arroyo and is certain to endorse the dismissal of the complaint. Arroyo similarly has survived three other impeachment complaints in each of the previous three years. Under Philippine law, another complaint against her can only be filed one calendar year after an earlier complaint is dismissed. Analysts say Arroyo will most likely complete her term unhindered. She leaves office in 2010. Opposition politicians however were clinging to the faint prospect that the full house could overturn the committee's decision. "We suffered a temporary defeat," said Jose de Venecia Jr., a former close ally of Arroyo who has linked the president's husband to a $329 million kickbacks scandal. "But the fight will go on. The next battle on the floor will take place on Dec. 2 and 3 and, depending on the flow of public opinion, there could be reversals," de Venecia said. "It can happen. History can be made, knock on wood." During the committee hearing, de Venecia linked Arroyo's husband to a government contract awarded to China's ZTE Corp two years ago that was later cancelled after allegations that it was grossly overpriced. He also testified that Arroyo herself offered cash gifts to lawmakers and local government officials in a bid to get a previous impeachment complaint overturned. Arroyo has denied the charges and said no member of her family has benefited from government contracts. Alongside her domination of Congress, Arroyo is supported by the army and the powerful Catholic church. She is not eligible to seek re-election when her term ends in 2010. Analysts have said prominent politicians are unlikely to join any bid to have Arroyo removed by impeachment, with most of them preferring to conserve their energies for the 2010 election campaign
