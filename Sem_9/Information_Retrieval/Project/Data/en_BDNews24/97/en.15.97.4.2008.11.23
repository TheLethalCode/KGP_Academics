 PARIS, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A goal from Ludovic Giuly earned Paris St Germain a 1-0 win over seven-times French champions Olympique Lyon on Saturday. Lyon have dominated in France for seven years and victory would have sent them eight points clear at top of the standings. But former Barcelona winger Giuly, who is 1.64m tall, headed home in the 26th minute to give PSG all three points in Paris and Marseille will have the opportunity to narrow the gap on Lyon to four points when they host Lille on Sunday (2000GMT).

"There were signs of hope, we must go on like this." Stade Rennes extended their unbeaten run to 13 league matches when they snatched a 1-1 draw at sixth-placed Girondins Bordeaux. Fourth-placed Rennes opened the scoring through midfielder Olivier Thomert in the 19th minute, only for France playmaker Yoann Gourcuff to level just before the hour. Toulouse missed a chance to move into the top three when they lost 1-0 at Lorient and dropped to sevent
