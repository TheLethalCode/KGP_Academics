<TITLE> Berbatov out of Manchester Utd trip to Villarreal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United will be without injured striker Dimitar Berbatov for Tuesday's Champions League clash at Villarreal and Cristiano Ronaldo is a major doubt. The European champions travel to Spain knowing a draw would send both teams through to the knockout phase with a game to spare so manager Alex Ferguson is unlikely to lose too much sleep over his depleted strike force. Ronaldo suffered a leg injury late in Saturday's goalless draw against Aston Villa. "His leg's in a mess and he'll be doubtful for Tuesday," Ferguson told MUTV. Berbatov has a hamstring strain picked up playing for Bulgaria in midweek but Carlos Tevez is a handy replacement. Defender Wes Brown is also out while midfielder Darren Fletcher is hopeful he will recover from a knee knock. United and Villarreal, who drew 0-0 at Old Trafford in September, have eight points each, with Celtic and AaB Aalborg both on two. If United and Celtic win, Villarreal must wait until the last round of group matches to try to secure progress while victories for the Spanish team and AaB would keep the holders waiting. DEFENSIVE LAPSES Villarreal have not had the ideal preparation as their unbeaten start in the Primera Liga came to an abrupt end with a 3-0 home defeat by struggling Real Valladolid on Saturday. They were 3-0 down at halftime and coach Manuel Pellegrini was clearly more focused on Tuesday's clash as he withdrew midfielder Marcos Senna and former United striker Giuseppe Rossi for a second half where they made little attempt at a comeback. Villarreal's ability to switch off at the back has led to some Jekyll and Hyde performances of late, like a 6-1 aggregate defeat in the King's Cup against Segunda B (third tier) Poli Ejido, and a 6-3 Champions League win at home AaB. "These types of defeats always knock you but you have to know how to pick yourselves up again," Pellegrini said. "The important thing is to work on our performance levels and to focus on qualifying for the next stage of the Champions League." Villarreal's top scorer Joseba Llorente has joined Turkey striker Nihat Kahveci on the injury list which leaves former United frontman Rossi and Guillermo Franco to lead the line. At the back Uruguay's Diego Godin is also out injured. Probable teams: Villarreal: 13-Diego Lopez; 18-Angel Lopez, 2-Gonzalo Rodriguez, 20-Fabricio Fuentes, 5-Joan Capdevila; 8-Santi Cazorla, 3-Edmilson, 19-Marcos Senna, 7-Robert Pires; 22-Giuseppe Rossi, 9-Guillermo Franco Manchester United: 1-Edwin van der Sar; 2-Gary Neville, 5-Rio Ferdinand, 15-Nemanja Vidic, 3-Patrice Evra; 17-Nani, 24-Darren Fletcher, 8-Anderson, 7-Cristiano Ronaldo, 10-Wayne Rooney, 32-Carlos Tevez Referee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)
