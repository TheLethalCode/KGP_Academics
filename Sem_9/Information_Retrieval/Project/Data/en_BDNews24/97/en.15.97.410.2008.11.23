 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser M A Matin believes even if emergency rule is lifted security will not decline in a clear hint that the interim government is mulling an end to the exigency before the general election. "We expect that the situation will remain normal after the lifting of the state of emergency," said the adviser after a meeting of advisory council committee on law and order on the issue of security surrounding the parliament and Upazila Parishad elections. "People of Bangladesh have been waiting for an election for two years and the government will ensure that the polls take place without any problem." But he said he did not know if the emergency rule would be lifted totally or partially. "That is the decision of the government," Matin added. The adviser added as part of a three-tier security system adopted by the government for the upcoming election, four to five platoons of military personnel will be deployed in each district along with the police, BDR and Ansar. On the date for troops deployment he said: "The army will be deployed for a few days in accordance with the need of the Election Commission." "The police and other security agencies have been ordered to ensure complete security for the VIPs." The adviser also dispelled any threat on the former prime ministers, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. "This year, voting will be carried out in 35,500 voting centres with 1 lakh 22 thousand booths," said the home secretary, Abdul Karim, in a press briefing. He said the number may increase for the Upazila election. The home secretary did not comment on the number of risky centres but said, "Their numbers are increasing and the exact number can be detected at the final moment." He added each polling station would have a security team of 13 members with a 19-member team for high-risk centres. "Four days before the election, control rooms will be established at the offices of returning officers and assistant returning officers of all districts." Drive to retrieve illegal arms and arrest listed criminals will be intensified in a bid to keep the election free of terrorism and black money, Karim said. Police chief Noor Mohammad, director general of RAB Hasan Mahmud Khandakar, BDR chief major general Shakil Ahmed and the Election Commission officials were also present at the meeting. b
