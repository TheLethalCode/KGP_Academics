 MOSCOW, Wed Nov 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The mayor of the main city in Russia's North Ossetia region died from gunshot wounds after his car was attacked early on Wednesday, Interfax news agency reported. The mayor of Vladikavkaz, Vitaly Karayev, was taken to hospital after his car came under fire at around 9:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) and was later pronounced dead, Interfax quoted North Ossetian regional leader Taimuraz Mamsurov as saying. "Yes, as a result of the attack, Karayev has died," Interfax quoted Mamsurov as saying. Twelve people were killed in a suicide attack on a bus in Vladikavkaz on Nov. 6. North Ossetia is part of Russia's turbulent North Caucasus region, where violence -- some of it blamed on Islamist militants -- has increased in the past few months. Moscow's forces have been struggling to contain an insurgency in the patchwork of mainly Muslim regions in the North Caucasus, which are among the poorest in Russia. North Ossetia's inhabitants are mainly Christian.

North Ossetia lies just across the border from Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia, which was the focus of a brief war in August
