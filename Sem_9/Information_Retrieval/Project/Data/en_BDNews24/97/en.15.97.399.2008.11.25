<TITLE> Internal resources key in crisis: Aziz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has stressed utilisation of internal resources in the face of the global economic crisis, fearing flow of foreign aid to Bangladesh may dip in coming days. "Historically, developed countries have given 0.7 per cent of their GDP as aid to Least Developed Countries, but for the last few years only a handful of small but developed countries have given aid in that ratio," he said. He made the remarks at the launch of a workshop on the Mid-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Centre Tuesday. "Now we have a global economic meltdown for which the bigger developed countries will automatically reduce aid." With foreign aid to Bangladesh not expected to rise in coming days, the adviser suggested that efforts must get underway to harness and utilise internal resources and assets. He also voiced concern that due to falling fuel and food prices, revenue from duty for the fiscal year 2008-2009 may also fall. "In the 2007-2008 fiscal year, revenue earning exceeded the set target but there is uncertainty if that trend will be maintained this year," observed Mirza Aziz. "Our economy is dependent on imports and as prices in the world market are falling, revenue from import duty may be affected." The tax net should be extended to increase revenue from VAT and income tax, suggested the adviser. The past and present years' budgets were formulated under a three-year (2007-08 to 2009-10) MTBF. Fourteen ministries of the government constructed their annual budgets following the same framework, expenditure of these 14 ministries being 60 per cent of the total national budget. The ministries are: education, primary and mass education, social welfare, women and children affairs, agriculture and fisheries, health and family planning, local government, rural development and cooperative, water resources, communication, food and disaster management, forest and environment and science, information and technology. bdnews
