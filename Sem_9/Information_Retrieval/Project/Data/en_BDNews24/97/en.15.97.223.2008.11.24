<TITLE> Air India mulls fuel surcharge cut as ATF cools </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Mon Nov 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Air India on Monday said it would consider reducing its fuel surcharge to pass on the benefits of a recent decline in jet fuel prices, a senior official said. "We will take a call as to what kind of relief or reduction in fuel surcharge we can give, keeping in mind the recent decline in ATF (aviation turbine fuel) prices," Jitender Bhargava, executive director at the airline told Reuters. The development follows federal aviation minister Praful Patel's comments that India's airlines should cut fares on easing jet fuel prices. ATF prices, which account for nearly half of an airline's operating costs, have dropped almost 40 percent since hitting a high of 73,673.56 rupees a kilolitre in August. "But you also cannot overlook the fact that in April-August fuel prices had shot up in a big way, making Air India and others impose the fuel surcharge to recover part of the liabilities," Bhargava said. Air India had in June upped the surcharge by 300 rupees on sectors less than 750 kilometres and 550 rupees for longer flights. The airline had in August said it expected to report a loss of 20 billion rupees for the financial year to end-March as rising fares and competition hurt demand. But Air India's plans to induct more aircraft into its fleet were on track and the airline has received six bids from domestic and foreign banks to provide loans for aircraft financing, Bhargava said. The carrier plans to raise $1 billion to buy 21 Airbus aircraft by 2011. National Aviation Corp of India Ltd, which controls Air India, had in 2005 placed an order for 111 aircraft, 68 from Boeing and 43 from Airbus, at a list price of $15 billion. It has so far raised more than $3 billion to add 38 new generation aircraft to up its fleet to 147. "We are evaluating the bids, whoever has given us the best offer gets the deal", Bhargava said. The airline had in September inked a $550 million financing agreement with US-based Exim Bank to buy three 777 and five 737-800 Boeing aircraft
