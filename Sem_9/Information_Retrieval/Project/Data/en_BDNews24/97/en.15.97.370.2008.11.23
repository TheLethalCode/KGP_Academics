<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, less than an hour before the Election Commission rescheduled the parliamentary vote for Dec. 29, voiced concern about "efforts to foil" the general election. "Efforts are underway to foil the election. But the people want election and therefore, it must take place," she said to a team of representatives from the University of Dhaka on Sunday at her office. "Let the people vote and get an elected government. We want a free, fair and transparent election, and a reflection of the will of the people." Hasina said the re-scheduling of the election had put her party in a quandary. "We have already given nomination to our candidates, now there will be efforts to buy our candidates out." "They (AL's rivals) are not short of cash and this will be used to foil the election," said Hasina. She maintained that the anticorruption crackdown was on politicians and not graft and pointed to the fact that those who had been detained on corruption charges were now free on bail. The former prime minister said she was not fully fit as her hearing aid had not arrived yet and that she had brought three months' medicine from her doctor for glucoma. Protesting the arrest of teachers after the campus unrest in August last year, a week before her own arrest, she said, "This is a gross violation of human rights. I said it then and I am saying it now." "I was completely isolated in prison," Hasina said and expressed her shock that the lawyers, who had surrounded her before the Jan. 11, 2007 changeover, had gone underground after her arrest. She thanked the teachers who had demanded her release after her detention. Former vice chancellor of Dhaka University professor A K Azad Chowdhury, Prof. AAMS Arefin Siddiqui, Dr Harun-ur-Rashid, Dr Anwar Hossain, Prof. Akhtaruzzaman and others attended the meeting. bdnews
