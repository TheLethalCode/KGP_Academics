The approval was given at an advisory council meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in the chair, said the press aide. The new ordinance allowing birth of the economic zones to function concurrently with the export processing zones aims at boosting industrialisation, commercial activities, service products, employment generation and poverty alleviation, Fahim said. He said public, private and public-private enterprises, local and foreign joint ventures and solely owned ventures can be set up in the economic zones in four categories. The categories are non-governmental organisations (local-foreign or NRB invested), public-private enterprises (partnership/joint ventures), public enterprises (government initiative and ownership) and specialised. The draft proposal for the Ombudsman Amendment Ordinance 2008 was withdrawn at the meeting.
