 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission is set to press charges in court against seven people including two former lawmakers, an official said Monday. ACC director general colonel Hanif Iqbal told a regular press briefing that the graftbusters had also exacted plenty of evidence in the warehouse and factory of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited. Hanif said cases had been filed against Feni customs, excise & VAT superintendent Golamur Rahman and inspector GM Shahjahan, who had been caught while accepting bribe. The accused persons against whom the ACC will file charge-sheet are former MPs from Netrakona Abdul Karim Abbasi, Mohammad Ali and his wife Rabeya Khatun, principal of Rabeya Ali Women's College, former manager of Sonali Bank Faridpur Bhanga branch Gulzar Hossain, assistant land officer of Gopalgonj M Anisur Rahman, former BIWTA chairman Riaz Hasan Khandaker, Titas Gas deputy manager (suspended) SM Hafizur Rahman. Iqbal said a bribery case was filed against customs officers Golam Rahman and GM Shahjahan on Nov. 20. They demanded extortion of Tk 20 lakh from Chittagong businessman Haji Mohammad Selim. They had later settled for Tk 60,000. Acting on a tip-off, the ACC officials caught them in the act and seized Tk 1.50 lakh from them. "The special team found ample evidence of anomalies with the BTCL`s yearly budget for the warehouse and factory. The factory remained closed since 2001 but expenses never fell, specially spending in conveyance and maintenance heads was unusually high," Iqbal said. As many as 268 cases have been sent to the Truth Commission with 23 more in the pipeline, he added. The time to seek clemency from the mercy commission ended on Nov. 23, officials said. b
