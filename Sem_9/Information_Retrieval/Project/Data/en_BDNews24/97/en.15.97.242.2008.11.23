 Dhaka, November 23 (bdnews24.com)Rights watchdog Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed an application to the High Court Sunday seeking a direction to stop 'false advertisements' by 'melamine-tainted' milk powder brands. "Eight brands of powder milk have tested positive for melamine. Among them five brands published advertisements in different newspapers on November 15 and 18 and misled the public without mentioning the presence of melamine," said advocate Manzil Murshid, who filed the petition. Advocate Manzil told bdnews24.com, after submitting it to a HC division bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddique, that hearing on the application will be held on Nov 25. The HC, upon a writ petition of HRPB, ordered government on Oct 23 to stop sale and display of milk powder brands Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashli-1, Yashli-2, Sweet Baby, Nido and Anlene till the court received the lab test reports. On receiving the initial test reports, HC directed the government on Nov 10 to collect fresh samples and retest them at BSTI, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission and the chemistry department of Dhaka University for laboratory test. The court, however, withdraw the ban on 5 brands for 21 days. The Appellate Division on Nov 17, modifying the HC order asked the government to send samples to for testing in Europe under the World Health Orginisation, but permitted to sale and display of five brands powder milk till Jan 3.
