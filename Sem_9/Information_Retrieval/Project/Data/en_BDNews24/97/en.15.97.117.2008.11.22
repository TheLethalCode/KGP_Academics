 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)The government has no immediate plans to further reduce fuel prices, though oil prices have slumped to a 3.5 year low under $50 per barrel in the world market, a special aide said on Saturday. "The existing formula to determine oil prices requires us to watch the market for three months," special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of energy and mineral resources M Tamim told bdnews24.com. Oil prices fluctuate everyday, Tamim said, and nothing can be ascertained in the short term. The international crude oil price was recorded at under $49 a barrel on Saturday. "Domestic prices could be readjusted with the international market if our market were open," the chief adviser's special assistant said. "But the government sets fuel prices." A senior official at the energy ministry, however, pointed out the government worked on the principle of readjustments within one month if the fuel price gap between international and local markets extends to 15 per cent. The official also said the situation will be reviewed by month-end if the oil price fall continues. The government reduced fuel prices on Oct 26, as the international oil price fell to $60. Prices of diesel, octane and kerosene were cut to Tk 48, Tk 80 and Tk 78 from Tk 55, Tk 90 and Tk 87 respectively. Before that, the government had raised them in June as oil prices shot up to $142 per barrel in the world market. The domestic demand for petroleum products amounts to nearly 40 lakh metric tonnes annually, according to government figures. Over 36 lakh tonnes were consumed by the local market in FY2007-8. The estimated demand for the FY 2008-9 stands at around 38 lakh tonnes. bdnews
