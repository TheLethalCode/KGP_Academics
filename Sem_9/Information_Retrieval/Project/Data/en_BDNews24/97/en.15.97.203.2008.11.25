 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  Uncertainties over the upcoming elections still remain, said Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday. "A game is being played," said the former prime minister, while exchanging views with professionals and AL supporters at her political affairs office in Dhanmondi. She wondered what was "the motive behind pushing elections into uncertainty and creating crisis". "I hope nobody will meddle with the polls process, people won't accept any such act," said Hasina. She said if some party "unwilling to go to polls, fearing defeat, plays tricks with the elections, the people will not forgive them." She asked all to stay alert against any ploy to foil the free and fair election. The AL chief also said she did not believe in grudge and revenge but in peaceful co-existence. "Peace is a key to development," Hasina said, also expressing her hopes for Bangladesh to emerge as a peaceful country in South Asia. People will vote for the Awami League, if the polling is free and fair, the AL chief said. She cautioned those present to keep a watch against rigging. Hasina expressed the hope that if voted to power, her government would establish a terror and corruption free Bangladesh. bd
