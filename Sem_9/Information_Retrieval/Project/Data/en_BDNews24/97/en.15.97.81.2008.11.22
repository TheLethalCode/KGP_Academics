<TEXT>
 Bogra, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad on Saturday argued for elections under emergency rule because the vote would be free of terrorism. "Terrorists will appear again if emergency is lifted," Ershad said while exchanging views with journalists at Bogra Parjatan Hotel on the way to Rangpur. The former president has consistently backed elections "keeping emergency in place", though his electoral partner Awami League has until recently voiced opposition to polls under emergency. On the possibility of becoming president if the AL-led alliance, including JP, came to power, Ershad said: "I want to be president. I discussed the possibility with the 'grand alliance' formed before the forestalled election of Jan. 22 in 2007." "Discussion on the matter is on-going." On seat-sharing among alliance members, the JP chairman said: "We will decide about these after concluding the discussions." Ershad also said he would file nomination forms for three constituencies in Rangpur, Kurigram and Lalmonirhat. Jatiya Party leader GM Quader and local JP stalwarts were among those present during the views exchange with newsmen. bd
