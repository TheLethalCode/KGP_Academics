 Panchagarh, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  A case has been lodged at a Panchagarh court against members of the Indian Border Security Force for killing three Bangladeshis near the Tetulia border earlier this month. Abdus Salam, brother of Golam Mostafa who was one of those shot dead on Nov 16, lodged the case with legal aid from the Bangladesh Human Rights Commission. The case names Indian border guard RP Singh as the main accused. BSF company commander SK Singh and commandant of the 10th battalion Dibakar Kumar are named as accomplices. Members of Noyabari BSF outpost intruded into Moynakuri village on the country's northernmost border of Tetulia in Panchgarh district on the night of Nov 16. They shot dead three people: an infant, his mother Majeda Begum and neighbour Golam Mostafa. The villagers captured RP Singh and handed him over to the Bangladesh Rifles. He was handed over to the Indian authorities the next day, when BSF also apologised for the incident. After taking the statement of the plaintiff on Tuesday, Judge Abdul Malik ordered the officer in charge of Tetulia to register the case. "The ruthless killing of the three Bangladeshis is a blatant violation of human rights," said HRC upazila secretary, A Rahman Mukul at a press conference. He demanded exemplary punishment for the guilty BSF members, adequate compensation for the families of the dead and improved treatment for Majeda's husband Shahidul Islam, who was wounded in the BSF firing. bdnews24.
