 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division on Monday upheld its earlier stay order on the High Court bail granted to former BNP lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu in a relief scam case. The full five-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, also warned Falu's lawyers for presenting a false medical board report during the bail petition. Falu's counsel Moulavi Wahidullah apologised to the Supreme Court for presenting the medical reports of nine individual doctors as a recommendation of a medical board. The apex court stayed Falu's bail on Nov 3 on the grounds that he obtained the order from the HC by submitting a fake medical board report. He secured three months' bail from the High Court on Oct 23, in the case which accuses him of misappropriating relief materials while he was an MP. A special court had sentenced Falu to five years imprisonment in the case in June this year. He was arrested on charges of corruption on Feb 6 last year.
