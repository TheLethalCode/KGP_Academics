 MOSCOW, Fri Nov 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's lower house of parliament approved on Friday a constitutional amendment extending the presidential term of office to six years from four. The amendment was passed on final reading by the State Duma lower house by 392 votes to 57. Kremlin critics say the change could be part of a plan for ex-president Vladimir Putin to return to his old job, although officials have denied this. The chamber, dominated by Putin's ruling United Russia party, also voted overwhelmingly to extend its own term to five years from four. The amendments, proposed by President Dmitry Medvedev, must be approved by three quarters of the upper chamber of parliament and two thirds of regional legislatures across Russia to become law. Both the upper house and almost all regional legislatures are dominated by Kremlin loyalists, so passage of the amendments is widely expected to be a formality. A survey by VTsIOM pollsters published on Friday showed 56 percent of Russians supported a longer presidency and extended term of parliament, while 29 percent were against and 15 percent undecided. The longer Kremlin term will not apply to Medvedev's present mandate, and Putin's spokesman has said there is no plan for an early presidential election
