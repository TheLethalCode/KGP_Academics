<TITLE> Govt retreat deals big blow to Thai protest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Tue Nov 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It was billed as a "final battle" to unseat Thailand's government but, unfortunately for the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), it now looks as though the government, not it, could be the last one standing. By some yardsticks, Monday's marches were "mission accomplished" for the PAD, the monarchist street movement that has occupied Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat's offices for three months and paralysed his government for six. Its siege of parliament forced the postponement of a debate on some international treaties, and its occupation of the elected administration's temporary headquarters at Bangkok's old airport caused several ministers to beat a hasty retreat. But by other measures, the day was a washout for a protest movement that has relied on the oxygen of publicity and openly courted anarchy and bloodshed on the streets of the capital in the hope of triggering a military coup. Determined to avoid confrontation, unarmed riot police at parliament simply walked away or climbed over locked gates into Bangkok zoo at the approach of the PAD vanguard, a phalanx of masked heavies wielding clubs and iron bars. A threatened nationwide strike on Tuesday by the PAD's public sector union allies, who also accuse Somchai of being a puppet of his brother-in-law, ousted and exiled leader Thaksin Shinawatra, failed to materialise. "Thaksin's provocations will give them some energy, but the PAD simply cannot mobilise sufficient mass support to maintain a drawn-out campaign," Thailand researcher Andrew Walker of Australian National University said. "There is every chance that, left to their own devices, the PAD will degenerate into a rather eccentric political cult with a bankrupt and self-absorbed leadership," he said. MOOD SWING Such views had little traction six weeks ago amid widespread public anger in Bangkok at alleged brutality by the police in breaking up an identical PAD protest at parliament. Two people were killed and hundreds, including scores of police, injured in a day of running street battles, the worst unrest in Bangkok in 16 years. Since then, however, two things have changed. First, the PAD has become ever more bellicose and erratic -- six of its "guards" were arrested on Monday for hijacking a bus with a sawn-off shotgun -- making it hard for establishment supporters ranking as high as Queen Sirikit to stay on board. "The people who've been backing PAD in the background have got frightened that it's getting out of control. It's a threat to public order and even the structure of the state itself," said historian Chris Baker. "There has been a change of mood." Second, the threat to Thailand's export-driven economy from a major global slowdown has suddenly got very serious, and the businessmen and middle classes who have been bankrolling the PAD are worried about its impact on their wallets. Data released on Monday, as thousands of PAD faithful chanted victory slogans outside parliament, showed the economy on track to grow just 4.5 percent this year, its slowest since 2001. In the last week, foreign investors from General Motors (GM.N: Quote, Profile, Research) to Nikon (7731.T: Quote, Profile, Research) have revealed Thai production cuts. DOWN IN THE POLLS Even before Monday, opinion polls showed waning support among a Bangkok public weary of months of disruption to traffic, schools and businesses, suggesting the PAD's cries for people's unpaid time and energy is starting to fall on deaf ears. "We are recruiting non-stop for supporters to oust the tyrants," core PAD leader Somsak Kosaisuk told a rally on Tuesday. "The job does not carry any pay, but you are defending the nation, religion and the monarchy." In the three years since it started as an anti-corruption drive against Thaksin, the PAD has been in the doldrums several times but has always shown an uncanny ability to engineer a new flashpoint or yet another headline-grabbing "final push". But if the police and the disarmingly uncharismatic Somchai continue to refuse to rise to the bait, and Thaksin keeps his mouth shut from exile -- admittedly, a big if -- the powers that be could well tell the movement's leadership to pack its bags. "I would guess that, away from all of our eyes, people will start talking to the leaders and say: 'Come on, own up to reality,'" Baker said. "And if that doesn't work, there will be a kind of clean sweep. They will try and decapitate them.
