 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Former law minister Moudud Ahmed has secured bail in the Niko corruption case from the High Court, removing the last barriers to his release from prison, his lawyer says. The bench of justices Md Anwarul Huq and Md Abdus Samad granted his appeal for bail after hearing on Wednesday. "[Moudud] had got bail in five cases out of a total of six and this is the last one," said Moudud's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokon said. "Now there will not be any obstacle to his release from jail." Meanwhile, the High Court bench of justices Araesuddin and Abu Tariq has granted bail to former BNP state minister Amanullah Aman in an extortion case. Rafique-ul-Huq and Khokon presented the case in the hearing for Aman, who had been sentenced to seven years in jail by the trial court. "Aman can now come out as a free man," said Khokon. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, upheld the High Court order that stayed proceedings of Barapukuria coalmine graft case and granted bail to former ministers Matiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed. It also stayed the bail order of Naser Rahman, son of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, in an illegal wealth accumulation and corruption case. Justice MA Matin gave the orders based on plea made by the Anticorruption Commission. MA Aziz Khan represented the Anticorruption Commission, barrister Abdur Razzak stood for Nizami and Mojaheed and Rafiqul Islam Mian for Naser. The lower court had sentenced Naser to 13 years in prison but the High Court gave him three months bail in the same case. bdne
