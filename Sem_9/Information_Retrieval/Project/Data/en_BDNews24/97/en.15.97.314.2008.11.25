<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has stayed the Election Commission's bar on Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka, clearing the way for him to contest for parliament, says his lawyer. The court issued a four-week stay order on Tuesday after hearing a petition filed by mayor Khoka. A HC division bench of justices Tarique-ul-Hakim and Farah Mahbub also asked the EC to explain in four weeks why the commission's embargo on mayors contesting parliamentary polls should not be declared illegal. "The HC stay order is applicable only for [Khoka] since he filed the petition challenging the EC decision," Khoka's senior counsel Khandakar Mahbubuddin Ahmad said after the hearing. "There is no bar now for [Khoka] to contest the parliamentary election," claimed the lawyer. The EC's lawyer Dr Shahdin Malik told bdnews24.com that the court issued a rule and passed an order of stay so far as it relates to Khoka. "But the Election Commission has not taken any particular decision against Khoka," he said. Dr Malik pointed out that according to Section 12 of the Representation of the People Ordinance, anyone holding any office of profit in the service of the republic or of a statutory public authority will be disqualified for running any other election until three years from the date of their resignation. Another of Khoka's lawyers barrister Ruhul Quddus Kajol submitted before the court that the city corporation is a body corporate, not a statutory public authority. Kajol argued, "The post of mayor is an elected post. They are not holding any office profit. So, there should not be any disqualification." Malik countered that the post of a city corporation mayor is an 'office of profit'. So, they cannot run for the parliamentary election even after resigning their office. Khoka filed a petition with the High Court on Nov 23, citing media reports on the EC's decision that mayors will not be eligible to run the polls until three years after stepping down from office. The petition said Khoka had in the past been elected thrice to parliament, served the nation as a minister, and since 2002 has been discharging his responsibilities as Dhaka mayor, an office which equals a minister's in status. The petition claimed the EC's bar was a violation of the existing law and was made only to deter incumbent mayors from participating in the forthcoming polls.
