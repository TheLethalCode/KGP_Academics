<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 24(bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Jukta Front, an electoral alliance, is angry that the Election Commission rescheduled the election dates without discussion with it. "They should discuss with other alliances beyond the BNP-led and AL-led alliances as well as there are others in the other alliance," said Abdul Mannan, secretary general of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. "So the Election Commission had options to seek consensus on rescheduling of the elections out of the two alliances." "Efforts are on to introduce a bi-party system in the country as in the UK and USA," Pankaj Bhattacharya, a leader of Gono Forum, said. Asked about the EC`s rejection of Mannan`s nomination papers, he said, "It happened because of misinterpretation of a law." The EC did not accept Mannan's nomination papers on Sunday on charges of breach of electoral laws. Anti-liberation and autocratic forces are there in the alliances, he said, referring to two major political alliances. Jamaat-e-Islami collaborated with Pakistani invaders in the liberation war in 1971 and Jatiya Parrty chairman military strongman HM Ershad was an autocrat until 1991, he said. Questioned about the possibility of elections taking place fairly under the EC, Mannan said, "I hope elections will be neutral." "We are well prepared. We hope we can give you good news. Our alliance's candidates may be announced in one or two days." Gono Forum's acting general secretary Subrata Chowdhury was also present at the conference. The media was told that Bangladesh Kalyan Party, National Awami Party, Labour Party, Forward Party, Bangladesh People's Party have joined the alliance. On Nov. 18, the Jatiya Jukta Front composed of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Gano Forum and other lesser-known parties was formally floated. b
