<TEXT>
 BRISBANE, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)- Simon Katich's unbeaten century put Australia on course for a probable victory in the first Test against New Zealand in Brisbane. Katich hit an unbeaten 131, his sixth Test century, to see his side to a second innings total of 268. It left the Kiwis a target of 327 but Brett Lee claimed his 300th Test wicket as they slumped to 49-4. Only Ross Taylor was able to combat the home side's attack and his 67 not out saw New Zealand to 143-6 at the close. The loss of both Daniel Flynn and Grant Elliott in the final five overs of play were crucial blows for New Zealand. Flynn was bowled by Mitchell Johnson for 29 after helping Taylor add 84 for the fifth wicket and Elliott went to Stuart Clark for nought, giving Clark figures of 3-23. The tourists ended play 184 away from their target and their hopes of an unlikely win almost entirely dependent on Taylor and skipper Daniel Vettori. The day began with Australia only 189 ahead on 131-6, but the tail provided Katich with the support he required to tip the balance in their favour. The left-hander's century arrived off 179 balls but he had two slices of luck on 70 and 86, with Iain O'Brien failing to hold a return catch and Jesse Ryder dropping a chance at short leg off Vettori's left-arm spin. Vettori was rewarded for an excellent spell when he bowled Brad Haddin (19) and Brett Lee (seven). But Johnson outscored Katich in a stand of 53, contributing 31 to Australia's cause before he was caught by Vettori off Elliott's medium-pace. Katich ran out of partners when Tim Southee accounted for last man Clark, who hit four boundaries in his 18 off 12 balls, but had the satisfaction of becoming only the 10th Australian to carry his bat through a Test innings - and the first to do so for 10 years. "When we started losing wickets yesterday, I had to knuckle down and try to get a big score. Thankfully I was able to do that," said Katich. "I just tried to break it down ball by ball, the basics of batting, and get through each over. I had some good partnerships with the tail which helps." The eyes of home supporters were on Lee at the start of New Zealand's second innings and it only took him three deliveries to claim his 300th Test wicket when Jamie How edged an attempted drive to second slip. He was expensive thereafter, conceding 53 from nine overs, but Clark was his usual tidy self at the other end and struck a second blow with a juggling caught and bowled to send Aaron Redmond on his way for 10. New Zealand suffered another double blow following the tea interval with Ryder (24) and Brendon McCullum (three) leg-before to Johnson and Clark. But Taylor and Flynn, New Zealand's leading scorers in the first innings with 40 and 39 not out, continued their good form in a partnership which occupied 23 overs. Taylor hit six fours in a 79-ball half century but Flynn was unable to keep him company to stumps and the New Zealand's disappointment at his dismissal was compounded by Elliott's exit, bowled offering no shot to the final ball of the day. Australia, however, were taking nothing for granted after play had concluded. "The game is well and truly not over yet. Vettori has made runs in the past, Taylor's batting beautifully at the moment, so they're both danger men," said Katich. "Hopefully we can get through that partnership and then chip away at the tail." New Zealand have called off-spinner Jeetan Patel into their squad for the second Test in Adelaide. He replaces seam bowler Kyle Mills, who will be returning home. Courtesy : BB
