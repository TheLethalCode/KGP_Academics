 WASHINGTON, Sun Nov 23,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert began on Sunday a visit to Washington to bid farewell to President George W Bush before the two lame duck leaders leave office without the Palestinian statehood deal they had sought. The United States, Israel and the Palestinians have all acknowledged they will not have a peace accord in place before Bush vacates the White House in January, missing a target date set at the Annapolis peace conference a year ago this week. Bush and Olmert meet on Monday. Olmert, who resigned in September in a corruption scandal but remains prime minister until a new government is formed after Israel's February 1O election, also will meet US Jewish leaders before departing on Tuesday. A spokesman for Olmert said that besides taking stock of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, Monday's talks in the White House will also focus on Iran's nuclear program. No major announcements are expected after the meeting, but the spokesman said: "When the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel get together, they always have serious matters to discuss.
