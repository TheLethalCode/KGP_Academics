Home adviser MA Matin and inspector general of police Noor Mohammad made the comment at an inauguration ceremony of Bangladesh Police Women's Network at a hotel in the city. "The list of criminals is being updated every moment on information from police intelligence and drives are being conducted accordingly to ensure a fair election," Mohammad said. About the a number of "sensitive" constituencies, the police chief said intensified drives were going on in those areas. He said they had information that religious extremists were no more "so powerful", indicating that the militants would not have stronger role in the election.
