 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League-led alliance will make known its reaction after the Election Commission announces fresh schedules for the elections, party leaders said Saturday. After a final meeting of the alliance on Saturday night, AL office secretary MA Mannan told reporters: "We've got nothing to say right now, our spokesman (Syed Ashraful Islam) will not comment today." "We'll disclose our stance tomorrow after the EC announces new schedules." A six-member delegation of Awami League and alliance members had talks with the Election Commission Saturday afternoon. Emerging from the meeting, Syed Ashraful Islam said AL and its allies would give their reaction after the EC announces fresh schedules for the elections. Syed Ashraful urged the authorities to hold elections involving all parties, adding: "We have been pressing for it and emergency must go for the sake of a free and acceptable election." The AL leader said the candidates of the AL-led electoral alliance were busy preparing election programmes and strategies. Ashraful also criticised commerce adviser and government spokesman Hossain Zillur Rahman, however, for "deliberate lies or mistakes" about a failure in reaching a consensus with the AL and BNP led alliances on fresh election dates. "Talks between the government and BNP had failed and the advisers met with the AL president without any agenda," Ashraf claimed. "We asked them why they came to us, since the issue of the fresh schedules had nothing to do with us. There were only three parties  the BNP, the EC and the government involved in fixing a new schedule. Schedules have been changed twice and the nation accepted them." "We'll not take part in any announcement regarding any more fresh schedules  which concerns the three parties only," said Ashraf. Soon after Ashraful's statement, the chief election commissioner said that the general election would be deferred, the new date likely to fall between Dec 27 and 29. Upazila polls would also be deferred said the CEC. "Fresh schedules will be announced on Sunday," the CEC said. The AL-led delegation comprised acting secretary and spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam, office secretary Abdul Mannan and election affairs committee chairman HT Imam, Jatiya Party presidium member Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu, JSD general secretary Syed Zafar Sajjad and Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua. The EC was represented by the chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, commissioners Mohammed Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain and EC secretary Humayun Kabir. The AL delegation also had two rounds of talks chaired by AL president Sheikh Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home, prior to and after the EC meeting. bdnews24.com/aum
