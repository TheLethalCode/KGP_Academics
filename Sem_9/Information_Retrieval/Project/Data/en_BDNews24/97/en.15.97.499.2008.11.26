<TEXT>
 ISTANBUL, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two goals from Lisandro earned Porto a 2-1 victory against Fenerbahce on Tuesday and a place in the Champions League last 16, with a late goal from Kazim Kazim not enough to rescue the home side. Lisandro put the visitors ahead in the 19th minute in the Group G match after Fenerbahce failed to clear a corner, hooking in a shot from close range through the home side's defence. He doubled the Portuguese side's lead after a throw-in nine minutes later. Fenerbahce goalkeeper Volkan Demirel blocked his first shot on goal only for Lisandro to score with his second effort, despite claims of handball from Fenerbahce players. Half-time substitute Kazim pulled a goal back for Fenerbahce in the 63rd minute with a long-range shot which deflected off Bruno Alves and beyond the reach of Porto goalkeeper Helton. "The first 10 minutes were difficult for us and Fenerbahce gave us problems. We have a young side but we came through in the end so we are happy," said Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira. The result lifted Porto to nine points, second behind Arsenal on 11 points after their defeat of Dynamo Kiev. Fenerbahce, fourth on two points, retain hopes of a UEFA Cup place but need to beat Kiev away in their final game on Dec. 10. "All I want to say is we didn't manage to convert our chances. Their second goal was a clear handball. The first one was Volkan's fault," said Fenerbahce coach Luis Aragones. KIEV MATCH The Turkish side, quarter-finalists last season, made a confident start to the game, pinning back Porto in front of their own goal for the first quarter of an hour. "We started well and exerted pressure and if we (had) scored then the game could have been different but they scored instead. We now have to focus and work hard and win the Kiev game," said Fenerbahce defender Roberto Carlos. The visitors slowly began to impose their authority after an initial effort in the 13th minute from Raul Meireles which Demirel tipped over the bar. Tomas Costa nearly made it 3-0 in the 34th minute when he was picked out by a superb long pass and sent a lob to the left of Demirel, only for it to rebound off the left post. The introduction of Kazim injected some energy into Fenerbahce's game at the start of the second half and he created a danger along the right wing which resulted in his goal. But the Turkish side's hopes petered out as the half advanced
