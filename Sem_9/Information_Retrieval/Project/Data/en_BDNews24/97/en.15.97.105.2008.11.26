<TEXT>
 MUNICH, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Miroslav Klose scored two and set up a third for Luca Toni to ease Bayern Munich through to the last 16 of the Champions League with a 3-0 win over Steaua Bucharest in Group F on Tuesday. Bayern created and missed chances galore against the overwhelmed visitors before Klose pounced to put them ahead early in the second half. Klose then set up Italian striker Toni to score his first Champions League goal with a diving header and the Germany striker took advantage of a great run and pass from the peerless Franck Ribery to seal a commanding victory a few minutes later. Bayern, slowly finding form in their first season under Juergen Klinsmann, secure qualification along with Olympique Lyon. The two leaders have 11 points apiece and will fight it out for top spot when they meet in France next month. Steaua remain bottom of the group with a single point, two behind Fiorentina and with a UEFA Cup place still to play for in their final game in Bucharest. "We're delighted," Klinsmann told reporters.

Bayern set the tone for a one-sided first half when first Klose and then Ribery easily found space behind the defence and set up chances for Toni. MESSY OPENER Bayern continued to make chances at a frantic rate before settling their nerves 12 minutes into the second half with a messy opener. Massimo Oddo retrieved the ball, after Toni had missed an attempted overhead kick, and crossed back into the middle. Ribery headed the ball up and on and Klose stuck out a foot to poke in. Klose's deft header set up Toni for a chance he could not miss four minutes later, although he did have to go off briefly after injuring himself in the process. The third goal was beautifully made by Ribery, who brought the ball forward at his usual breakneck speed and took out the last defender with a pass Klose converted simply
