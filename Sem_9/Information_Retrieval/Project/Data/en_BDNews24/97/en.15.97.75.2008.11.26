 KARACHI, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's cricketers have stepped up efforts to establish a professional association similar to ones in Australia, England and South Africa. Pakistan vice-captain Misbah-ul-Haq submitted a proposal with the constitution committee of the Pakistan cricket board and sports ministry last week calling for cricketers to have their association. Misbah asked for it to be recognized by the board and necessary amendments to be made in the constitution. Captain Shoaib Malik added his support on Tuesday: "There is nothing wrong with having a cricketers association which can look after the welfare and rights of the players," he told reporters. Senior batsman Younis Khan said the association could ensure players were consulted in all important decisions. Previous attempts to constitute a recognized cricketers association in Pakistan have failed, however. The latest demand comes at a time when the PCB has indicated it could revise players' central contracts to cope with the financial hardships it is facing due to foreign teams not touring Pakistan for security reasons
