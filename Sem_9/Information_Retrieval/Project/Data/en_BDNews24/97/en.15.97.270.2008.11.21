<TEXT>
 BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa spinner Paul Harris is to see a specialist after fracturing his thumb and will take no further part in the first test against Bangladesh in Bloemfontein, a team spokesman announced on Friday. Harris is flying to Cape Town on Friday, the third day of the match, to see a specialist after fracturing the base of his left thumb in fielding practice on the first morning. South Africa media officer Michael Owen-Smith told reporters Harris would have a cast put on his hand and would be out of action for three to four weeks. The left-arm spinner will miss the second test next week and will not travel to India to take part in a Twenty20 tournament. However, Harris will be available for the tour to Australia next month. South Africa need nine Bangladesh wickets to win the first test, while the visitors need to score another 268 runs to avoid an innings defeat
