 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will give its take on the BNP's latest polls proposal after reviewing the responses anticipated from the government and the Election Commission, a spokesperson said. "We are waiting to learn about the outcome of BNP's dialogue with the government on the issue first, and then will come our turn to respond," Syed Ashraful Islam said to reporters on Friday. "BNP chief Khaleda Zia on Thursday proposed that BNP will be running the election if the polls date is shifted to December 28. "But we would like them to join us for the polls on December 18 as has been announced by the Election Commission," he said to the media at party chief Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi . Ashraful said the EC had made changes to the schedule "on more than one occasion and that too unilaterally, without consulting us". "Such changes have certainly hampered our preparations, as we have been working keeping in view the December 18 date for the national polls." bdn
