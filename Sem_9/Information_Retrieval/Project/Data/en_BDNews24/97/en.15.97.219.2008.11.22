 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  At least seven people were injured as clashes erupted between Dhaka College students and Chandrima supermarket staff in New Market over a trifling issue of prices on Saturday. The angry students went on the rampage for over two hours, from 11am to 1.30pm, vandalising a number of shops and damaging vehicles, witnesses said. Students and market staff ended up pelting brickbats at each other turning the New Market-Mirpur Road into a battlefield, until police intervened and eventually quelled the situation. Manager of 'Shefali Enterprise' furniture shop Mohammad Dulal told bdnews24.com some 20 to 25 students of Dhaka College swooped on the market over a disagreement over prices between a Dhaka College student and a shop assistant the previous day. Talking to bdnews24.com, Dhaka College student Tarek Mahmud Sajib said reports had circulated on campus that a fellow student had been "kept hostage by the market staff", whereupon a group of students went to "rescue the student". Clashes erupted when the shopkeepers resisted, he said. Sajib, however, could not name the student. New Market police officer in-charge Mohammad Anisur Rahman told bdnews24.com that a dispute over prices between the shopkeepers and the students was the cause behind the incident. Police were posted at the college gate and in the market, he said. b
