 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission wants to finalise dates for the parliamentary and Upazila Parishad elections after concluding talks with the Awami League-led 14-party alliance on Saturday, the chief election commissioner said. "As time is short we want to announce (any new) schedule for elections today," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters. "We are set to hold discussions with Awami League in the afternoon. We want to announce the dates after the discussions," he said. "According to the previously revised schedule, today is the last date for submission of nomination papers," he said. The EC concluded talks with BNP-led four-party alliance on Friday. According to the original schedule declared on Nov. 2 the general election was to be held on Dec. 18 and Upazila polls on Dec. 28. After intense negotiations in the face of BNP's demand to push back the election date last week, the CEC said they were ready to reschedule the national election for Dec. 28 if all parties agreed. bdnews
