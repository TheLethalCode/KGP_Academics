 Chittagong, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  A court on Tuesday jailed four militants, including a commander of banned Islamist outfit Jama`atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, each for 20 years for trying to bomb a court in 2005. Shafiqul Karim, judge of the Chittagong Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal delivered the verdict, based on the testament of nine witnesses. On Oct. 3, 2005, the militants carried out a bomb attack at the court of second joint divisional and assistant magistrate presided over by judge Abu Syed Dildar Hossain. But there were no casualties as the bomb failed to detonate. The sentenced criminals are JMB commander Javed Iqbal alias Mohammad, Abdul Malek alias Laltu, Md Shahadat Ali and Mizan, better known as 'Bomber Mizan'. "With this, JMB commander Javed Iqbal has been given 164 years in a total of nine cases. Though he was acquitted in one case from the eight other cases against him, he received 144 years in the remaining seven cases," said state prosecutor Kamrul Islam Chowdhury Sazzad to bdnews24.com. JMB leaders Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Ataur Rahman Sunny, also accused in this case, were excused as they had been executed. The case stated the militants had tried to enter the court premises around midday and when they were blocked by the police, tossed the bomb which landed near the table of the judge.
