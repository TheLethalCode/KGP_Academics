 MILAN, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini was again overlooked on Tuesday when nominations were announced for the 2007/2008 Italian players' association awards. Mancini, who helped Inter to retain their Italian title in May before being sacked after falling out with president Massimo Moratti, failed to be nominated in the best manager category for the second year in a row. AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti, Fiorentina's Cesare Prandelli and AS Roma's Luciano Spalletti are up for the award. Unemployed Mancini did win the golden bench award last week after being voted last term's top coach by his fellow Italian managers. Milan's Brazilian playmaker Kaka, who was named players' player of the year and foreign player of the year last season, has again been nominated in the foreign category, alongside Inter striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Fiorentina's Adrian Mutu. Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero, AS Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi and Milan's Andrea Pirlo will battle it out for the Italian player award with the winner then going against the foreign player of the year for the overall prize. The awards, known in Italy as the soccer 'Oscars', will be handed out in Milan on Jan. 19 following votes from Italy's top-flight players
