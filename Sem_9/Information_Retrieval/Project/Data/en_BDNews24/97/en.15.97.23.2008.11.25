<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Public Service Commission on Tuesday asked the missed-out applicants of the 28th batch of Bangladesh Civil Service to collect admit cards for the preliminary examinations on Nov. 28. They have to collect the cards on condition that they will deposit the requisite documents with the PSC within Dec. 15, Ehsan Shameem, a PSC member said at a press conference at the PSC office. "Each and every case will be examined separately and conditional admit cards will be issued to those who had not received the same because they failed to attach all required documents." The examinees who have not received admit cards because they had failed to enclose all required documents and papers along with their applications have been asked to collect their admit cards prior to the Friday exams. But the required papers, however, must be deposited by December 15, the PSC said. Those who made wrong entries in the forms in the slots meant for the 'applicant's name or the applicant's father's' or forgot to sign the same, will not be considered and hence 'no admit card', Shameem calrified. "Of the 1,20,946 applicants seeking permission to take the 28th BCS preliminary exams, 1,15,163 could post their applications correctly," said Shameem. Candidatures of 5,783 applicants stood cancelled due to various faults. PSC chairman Dr Sa'dat Husain said the 27th BCS results will not be changed and 28 BCS exams test papers will not leak. Replying to a query about the 27th BCS exams, he said, "We'll not tamper with the exam results under any circumstances." Multiple sets of test papers have been prepared and the particular set will be selected only minutes before the exams in the presence of all the members of the commission. The 28th BCS preliminary exams will be held in 103 examination centres of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet at 10:30am. On whether those candidates of the 27th BCS batch who had qualified first for recruitment but eventually were left out should be employed through creating vacant posts, the PSC chairman said, "It's up to the government to do so. PSC cannot decide about that." bd
