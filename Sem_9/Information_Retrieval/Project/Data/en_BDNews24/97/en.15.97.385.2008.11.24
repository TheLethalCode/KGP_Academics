<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seydou Keita grabbed a second-half equaliser for Barcelona as the leaders were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Getafe in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Getafe successfully shut out Barca in the first half and hit them on the break in the 20th minute when Manu del Moral curled a low shot into the corner from outside the area. Samuel Eto'o hit the crossbar before the break but Barca missed the cutting edge of Lionel Messi, who was rested with a thigh muscle strain. Victor Valdes fumbled Juan Albin's shot on to his post in the 71st but Barca levelled a minute later when Mali midfielder Keita headed in Daniel Alves's cross from close range. Keeper Roberto Abbondanzieri pushed Gerard Pique's header onto the crossbar from a corner soon after as Barca laid siege to the visitors' goal, but they failed to register a 10th successive victory in the league. Barca have 29 points from 12 games, three points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid and four in front of Villarreal, who both played on Saturday. Real beat Recreativo Huelva 1-0 at the Bernabeu and Villarreal were beaten 3-0 at home by Real Valladolid. Fourth-placed Valencia are ahead of Sevilla on goal difference with 24 points after drawing 0-0 at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday. LATE PENALTY Sixth-placed Atletico Madrid missed out on the chance to narrow the gap when they conceded a penalty deep into stoppage time to draw 1-1 at Numancia. Simao Sabrosa sped down the right flank and threaded a ball through for Diego Forlan to give them the lead in the 35th minute, but Javier Aguirre's side lived dangerously on their narrow lead in the second half. Numancia hit the woodwork and had a header controversially cleared from under the bar by Leo Franco which looked like it might have crossed the line, before they were awarded a last-minute penalty which Jose Barkero put away. Atletico are on 18 points, ahead of Deportivo Coruna on goal difference after they beat Athletic Bilbao 3-1 at home in Sunday's late game Osasuna finally registered their first win of the season beating Almeria 3-1 at home to move off the foot of the standings into 19th place above Recreativo. Alvaro Negredo gave the visitors an early lead from the penalty spot, but they had defender Guilherme sent off in the eighth minute. Walter Pandiani, Hernan Pellerano in his own net and Krisztian Vadocz turned the game round as Osasuna doubled the number of goals they have scored this season
