 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Two miscreants died in an encounter with the Rapid Action Battalion at Jatrabari early Wednesday, a police official said. Acting on a tip-off the RAB went inside Underpass Bridge at Shonir Akhra at around 4:30am where the miscreants had met to plan a criminal activity, Jatrabari Police Station sub-inspector Shaheen Uddin told bdnews.com. Sensing RAB men, the miscreants opened fire and the elite anticrime force retaliated. The miscreants ultimately fled the scene and RAB found two people dead with two revolvers on the spot, Shaheen claimed. The dead were identified as Rosen, 35 and his associate Bidyut, 33. There are a number of cases on charges of murder and extortion against Rosen and Bidyut is one of his main associates, the police official said.
