 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government spokesman, adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, says he does not know when emergency rule will end, pouring cold waters on speculations after the general election was rescheduled. When reporters asked him about the next step of the government after the declaration of the new schedule, he said Monday: "Now everything is in the hands of the Election Commission." The EC does not have the powers to lift the emergency. His cabinet colleague home adviser MA Matin reignited speculations on Sunday when he said he did not see a decline in security if the state of emergency was lifted. It has been one of the key demands of the BNP while the other major political party Awami League have been asking the interim administration to lift emergency rule to facilitate a fair, credible election. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said he would ask the emergency government to lift the state of emergency on the last day for the withdrawal of nomination after declaring the new schedule on Sunday. After talks with the alliances led by BNP and AL over the polls rescheduling, adviser Hossain Zillur said on Nov. 19 that the two parties were given four conditions. One of the conditions was the end to the emergency after an assessment of the law and order situation. Elections of four city corporations and nine municipalities were held in August after president Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency on Jan. 11, 2007. Foreign diplomats have been saying that the emergency rule had better go, but the European Union said last week it would send observers even if the general election was held amid emergency. bdne
