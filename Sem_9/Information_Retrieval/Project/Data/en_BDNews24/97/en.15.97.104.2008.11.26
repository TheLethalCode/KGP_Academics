<TEXT>
 TEHRAN,Wed Nov 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has successfully launched a rocket called "Kavosh 2," which means "Explorer 2," Iran's state television reported on Wednesday. The report follows an announcement earlier this month that Iran had test-fired a new generation of surface-to-surface missile. The news comes amid tension between Iran and Israel and the West over Tehran's disputed nuclear work. Television did not give any further details, saying they would be announced later. Iran caused international concern in February by testing a domestically made Explorer 1 rocket as part of its satellite program. Tehran said it needed two more similar tests before putting a domestically made satellite into orbit. On August 17, Iran said it had put a dummy satellite into orbit on a domestically made rocket for the first time. US officials said the attempted launch was a failure. The long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into space can also be used for launching weapons. The West believes Tehran is seeking to develop more advanced missile technology so it can launch atomic warheads. Iran denies any such intention and says its nuclear program is peaceful
