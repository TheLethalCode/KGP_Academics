 MADRID, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wesley Sneijder earned champions Real Madrid a 1-0 home victory over Recreativo Huelva on Saturday, easing the pressure on coach Bernd Schuster. The win took Real second above Villarreal whose 17-match unbeaten run in the Primera Liga ended with a surprise 3-0 home defeat by Valladolid.

Villarreal started their unbeaten run with a 2-0 home win over Valladolid in April but were always second best at the Madrigal. Jonathan Sesma scored twice and Pedro Leon made it 3-0 from a free kick just before the interval to earn Valladolid their first away points this season. "It had to happen some time," Villarreal coach Manuel Pellegrini said. "We needed to be focused to beat Valladolid and we weren't. They beat us comfortably. It's been bad day
