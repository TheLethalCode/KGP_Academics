 KOLKATA, Tue Nov 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least seven policemen were killed when suspected Maoist insurgents blew up a bridge in Chhattisgarh on Tuesday, police said. The policemen were crossing the bridge near Jagdalpur town in a Maoist stronghold in Chhattisgarh state when the insurgents triggered a landmine. "All the policemen died, buried under the debris of the bridge which collapsed," senior police official Giridhari Nayak told Reuters by phone. Jagdalpur in the Maoist-dominated Bastar district is about 300 kilometres south of Raipur. Landmine blasts triggered by suspected Maoist insurgents during state assembly elections on Nov. 14 in Chhattisgarh killed a policeman and an air force official. The Maoists in the state had called for a poll boycott. Maoist rebels, who say they are fighting for the rights of poor farmers and landless labourers, regularly attack government property and policemen. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoist insurgency as the gravest threat to India's internal security. Thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, which began in the late 1960s and stretches throughout rural areas in east, central and southern India
