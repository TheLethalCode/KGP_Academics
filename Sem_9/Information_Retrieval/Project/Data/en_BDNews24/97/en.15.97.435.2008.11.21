 CHICAGO, Nov 21(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President-elect Barack Obama is on track to nominate his former rival, New York Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state after the November 27 Thanksgiving holiday, a Democratic official said. Clinton moved closer to taking the job after her husband, former President Bill Clinton, offered to allow ethics reviews of future business and charitable activities should she be picked by Obama as the country's top diplomat. Bill Clinton and the Obama team have also worked out financial disclosure issues involving the former president, the official said.
