<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board has ruled out Rawalpindi as a venue for next year's India's test tour because of building work, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt told reporters after meeting the Indian high commissioner. "The construction work will not be completed before the Indian tour so we will be shifting the test and one-day international to some other venue," Butt said on Tuesday after talks with commissioner Satya Tal in Islamabad. Rawalpindi was also dropped as a venue for the Champions Trophy this year because of the construction work, although the International Cricket Council (ICC) later said its security consultants had issues with the ground. India are due to arrive in Pakistan on Jan. 4 but there are doubts over whether the tour will take place because of India's concerns over the security situation. Butt said his meeting with Tal aimed to remove concerns about the security arrangements. "I have briefed the Indian high commissioner about the steps we are taking for the tour to be held successfully. He will report back to his government," Butt said. The Indian cricket board has said it would only tour if its government gives security clearance. Butt is due to visit India early next month to meet BCCI officials to discuss the tour arrangements and convince them to go ahead with a series of three tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match from Jan. 13 to Feb. 19
