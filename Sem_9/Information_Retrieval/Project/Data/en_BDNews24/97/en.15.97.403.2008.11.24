<TEXT>
 Dhaka, November 24 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet has approved the guidelines on public-private partnership to feed an increasingly power-hungry national grid, an government aide said on Monday. Special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of power, energy and mineral resources M Tamim told bdnews24.com the guidelines aimed to encourage new plants and rehabilitate old, inefficient ones. According to the guidelines, private investors can establish and operate private power plants commercially subject to the licence from Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. The investors will find their own buyer to sell the electricity but have to sell 20 percent of the generation to the public power utilities. They will be free to negotiate the applicable tariff with the `large consumers`. Distribution licencees may purchase power from private power plants, as needed, but the government will not provide any guarantee in their favour. The new power plants will preferably rely on coal or any imported fuel and any fuel supply or source of energy has to be arranged by developers for private power plants, the guidelines further say. The government will not supply fuels or provide guarantee in favour of any fuel supplier to supply fuels to private power plants, who will pay surcharge. Public sector power utilities may allow the private investors to overhaul their old and inefficient power plants. The private investors may choose to operate or transfer the plant as per provisions of the power purchase agreement after the rehabilitation. Qualified existing staff of the old and inefficient power plants will have priority in recruitment. The public sector utilities can form joint venture with the private investors to develop new power plants on a build-own-operate basis. Special project vehicle with at least 51 percent shares owned by local investors will be established to implement and operate such projects. The Power Grid Company of Bangladesh will act as market operator until the wheeled power under these guidelines reaches 500 MW. An independent market operator will be established later. Private investors may build their dedicated transmission line from their power stations to `large consumers` according to provisions under the Grid Code, the guidelines say. bdn
