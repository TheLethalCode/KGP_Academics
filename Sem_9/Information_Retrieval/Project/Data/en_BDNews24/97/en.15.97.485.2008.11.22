<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Nov (bdnews24.com)  Awami League candidates in Chittagong are actively trying to prevent seat allocation to alliance members, claim local leaders. Local AL figures are trying to convince central leaders as well as the party president against allocating seats to members of the alliance, they say. Chittagong city AL president and mayor, ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is expected to come to Dhaka on Sunday to discuss the conflict over seat distribution with party president Sheikh Hasina. Infighting over nominations and handing over seats to 14 party-alliance candidates has resulted in a crisis within local AL units, according to reports. Meanwhile, electoral allies Liberal Democratic Party, Jatiya Party and JSD have demanded six seats in the district, out of a total 16, including one in the city. It is alleged that AL leaders in the port city, including the mayor, are trying to minimise the allocation of seats to their 'allies'. Candidates with central nomination are already 'lobbying' for votes, say rival aspirants. However, mayor Mohiuddin said Saturday: "The alliance was formed to save the country from the misdeeds of the BNP-led four-party alliance, and for that reason we must hand over seats to our allies." But, he said a maximum of three seats could be given to the allies. "If the tested AL candidates are left out, then the party may be affected," he commented. He also claimed that many of the candidates from the allied parties may not have enough supporters, but added: "Irrespective of that, for the interest of the alliance, everything will be done to ensure their victory." Of the 15 constituencies in the 2001 election, AL won only two in Chittagong. This time, with the help of their allies, they are trying to win the majority. Leaders of the AL-led electoral alliance have said that LDP president Oli Ahmed JP presidium member Barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud, JP central leader Ziauddin Bablu, JSD central leader Moinuddin Khan Badal and others have demanded Chittagong-4,-5, -7, -11, -13 and -14 constituencies. bdnews24.
