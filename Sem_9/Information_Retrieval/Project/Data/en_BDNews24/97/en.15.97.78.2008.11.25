 Dhaka. November 24 (dbnews24.com) -- Abdullah A. Ferdous, Senior Consultant of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has won this year's ID People Award at the ID World International Congress 2008. BTRC said in press release on Monday that the winners of the ID People Awards were revealed on November 18th during the seventh ID World International Congress, held in Milan, Italy. At the annual ceremony, awards were presented in recognition of the contribution made by thought leaders, innovators and pioneering adopters who distinguished themselves by their achievements during the past year. Earlier, in October, Ferdous was announced as one of the 25 final nominees for the ID People Awards 2008. Based on votes from the industry and global enthusiasts, 5 awards are given each year to outstanding professionals for their roles in 5 different categories. Maj Gen Shafiqul Islam of Bangladesh Army has also won the award in another category  a recognition of Bangladesh Army's contribution in completing National ID Card project. 2 of the 5 global awards are bagged by Bangladesh. Abdullah Ferdous presented a paper at the first global symposium on Registered Traveler Forum, held in Paris on February 2007. As an invited speaker, Ferdous presented a concept for the developed countries to launch a Registered Traveler Program which could be efficiently run in developing countries. A Registered Traveler (RT) or Trusted Traveler program segregates travelers into high and low risk categories enabling security officials to allocate greater attention and resources to "unknown" or high-risk travelers. It would require travelers to submit to a security threat assessment by providing biographical and biometric data for background checks. For his innovative concept and for his contribution to the global ID community, Abdullah Ferdous has been declared a final nominee for ID People Award 2008. Abdullah A. Ferdous is a Senior Consultant on Telecommunication Regulation at BTRC.
