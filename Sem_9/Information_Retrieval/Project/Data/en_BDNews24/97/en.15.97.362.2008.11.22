 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Commonwealth gold medalist Asif Hossain Khan celebrated his return to the international arena on Saturday with a gold medal in his pet event of 10m Air Rifles (individual) in the fourth South Asian Shooting Championship in Islamabad, Pakistan. Dropped from the Bangladesh contingent for Beijing Olympic Games after a string of poor performance, Asif fired his best-ever score of 694.3 out of 700 to finish first. His teammate Imam Hossain was a distant second with a score of 689.8 to bag the silver medal. Asif's previous best was 691 in 2003 SAFF Games in Islamabad in Pakistan where he had taken the gold medal in the same event. It was Asif's second international medal since he paired with Anjan Kumar Singh to win the silver medal in the men's 10m Air Rifles pairs event in the 18th Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006. Asif shot into fame when he fetched gold in the 10m air rifles event in 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester with a score of 687 out of 700. He followed the silverware with the gold medal in the same event in Islamabad SAFF Games. Asif skipped shooting practices after he was assaulted by the police in November 2006 and failed to qualify for the final round in 10m Air Rifles event of Doha Asian Games in December in 2007. Subsequently the Beijing Olympic Committee revoked his scholarship for advance training in China ahead of the Olympics. His dismal performance continued when he finished third in National Shooting Championship this year. Imam Hossain and Azizur Rahman struck gold and silver respectively. Bangladesh also bagged the gold medal in the men's 10m Air Rifles event on the opening day of the South Asian Shooting Championship. The Bangladesh men's team comprised of Asif, Iman and Saiful Islam Rinki. Sabrina Sultana settled for bronze medal in the individual 50m prone event scoring 581 out of 600. Bangladesh's women team of Sabrina, Tripti Datta and Sharmin Sultana also finished third in the women's 50m prone event
