 NAIROBI, Wed Nov 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Representatives for the Somali government and the moderate wing of an Islamist-led opposition movement committed on Wednesday to power-sharing and an expansion of parliament as a way of bringing peace. In the latest round of UN-brokered talks in Djibouti, which are rejected by Islamist insurgents and have done little to end violence, the parties agreed to seek a two-year extension of the government's mandate. It expires next year. The failed Horn of Africa state, which Western security services say could become a base for Islamist militants, has been in conflict since 1991 and gone through 14 attempted peace processes in that time. The chaos has fueled piracy offshore. Islamist insurgents have led a two-year fight against the weak, Western-backed government and have taken towns across the south up to nine miles (six miles) away from the capital Mogadishu. They denounce the government as a coalition of warlords bereft of popular support, and want to introduce sharia law. With hardline Islamist insurgents rejecting the Djibouti process, and the prime minister also accusing the president of blocking it, the Djibouti talks have so far had little impact. But they have created a theoretical framework for power-sharing, between the government and moderates in the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS), that is the only model regional politicians diplomats are considering at the moment. "The parties have agreed on a number of guiding principles as a framework to strengthen their commitments on political cooperation -- particularly the establishment of a Unity Government and an inclusive Parliament," said the agreement signed in Djibouti and released by the United Nations. Parliament would be enlarged by 200 seats, which would be filled by ARS, the statement said. An extra 75 seats will be set aside for members of civil society "including women and the business community." The legislature, based in the provincial town of Baidoa, has 275 members now. Always upbeat, UN envoy Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah hailed the agreement in Djibouti as a major sign of progress. "These are important steps to create sustainable peace in Somalia and demonstrate the parties' commitment," he said. "We hope that the concerted efforts made here and the momentum gained in these last few days continue so that the New Year sees Somali leaders working together, wholeheartedly.
