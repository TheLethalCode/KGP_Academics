 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)Sudha Sadan, home to Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, witnessed rounds of skirmishes since Sunday morning between supporters of leaders who received party tickets and those who were rejected. Angry supporters of former army chief KM Safiullah, who sought the AL ticket for Narayanganj-1 (Rupganj) but failed to get it, assaulted followers Gazi Golam Dastgir, who got the nomination for the constituency. Supporters of Hannan Firoze, another failed nominee for Jhalokathhi-1, later clashed with Safiullah's supporters at the scene. The two groups scuffled and hurled brickbats at each other until police were forced to baton-charge the crowd to disperse them. Hasina's Dhanmondi home has seen protests build since AL began finalising nominations last week ahead of the scheduled parliamentary polls. bdn
