 COLOMBO, Mon Nov 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The battle for the Sri Lankan rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi raged on Monday under torrential monsoon rains, with both sides saying they had killed scores of their enemy in three days of fighting. The military, emboldened by the capture two weeks ago of the entire western coast for the first time since 1993, is fighting its way toward the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam's (LTTE)'s self-declared capital of Kilinochchi on three fronts. The pro-rebel www.TamilNet.com web site, quoting LTTE officials it did not identify, said the rebels killed 78 soldiers over the weekend including 43 in a battle a few kilometers (miles) west of the strategic Paranthan junction on Sunday. "The stiff fighting by the Tigers pushed back the Sri Lankan troops," TamilNet wrote of the battle on Sunday. "Meanwhile, heavy rain has led to floods." The military on Monday said troops killed 120 LTTE fighters on the southern edge of Kilinochchi, at Paranthan and on the eastern coast near the other major Tiger-held town, Mullaittivu. Twenty-seven soldiers died, the military said. "Heavy fighting is going on in the three locations. The rain has started, but it will not affect the troops. But the hazards faced by everybody will also be faced by troops," military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. Both sides routinely inflate casualty figures to suit their advantage, and independent verification is nearly impossible because the military bars most independent journalists from the war zone and the Tigers rarely allow them into areas they hold. Talk is swirling that President Mahinda Rajapaksa will use the battlefield success -- the most by any government in the 25-year war -- to call early elections to consolidate power while circumventing criticism about Sri Lanka's ailing economy. Tiger leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran is due on Thursday to give his annual "Heroes' Day" speech, which in the past has been a worldwide call to arms to supporters including those in the worldwide Tamil-speaking diaspora, who have funded the LTTE. Since 1983 the Tigers have been fighting to establish a separate homeland for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils, who have complained of decades of sidelining by successive governments led by the ethnic Sinhalese majority. The LTTE is on US, E.U. and Indian terrorism lists for its use of suicide bombings and assassinations in the war, which began in earnest after anti-Tamil riots followed the fatal ambush of 13 Sinhalese soldiers
