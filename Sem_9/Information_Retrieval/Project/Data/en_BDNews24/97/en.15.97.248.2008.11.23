 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)The European Commission has praised the caretaker government for its efforts to reform Bangladesh's political and electoral systems and to ensure participation of all parties in the December elections. The commission also reiterated its support for full withdrawal of the state of emergency before the general election. In a written message to the government from Brussels, the EC's external affairs commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said, "I have followed closely the efforts which have been made by the authorities to reform the political and electoral system and to secure particiaption by all major parties in the parliamentary elections in December 2008". EC ambassador to Bangladesh Stefan Frowein, with French ambassador Charley Causeret and Swedish envoy Britt F Hogstrom, handed over Ferrero-Waldner's letter Sunday to foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. "The relaxation of the state of emergency has taken place for which the commissioner has sent a full-fledged team," Frowein after seeing the foreign adviser. "It does not mean that we are now happy with the state of emergency still in place." "Emergency is something which is not easy for us to accept as a situation," said the EC mission head. "Of course, we want full lifting of the state of emergency before the election," Frowein said. "The EU polls observer mission is in town, in the sense that the core team is here, but the long term observers will be coming in a few days". He said the chief of the EU's observation mission would arrive in the capital in a few days.
