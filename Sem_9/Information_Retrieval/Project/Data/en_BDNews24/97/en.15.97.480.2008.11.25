<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The government will lift emergency rule sometime before the the general election in consultation with the Election Commission, an adviser said on Tuesday. "The government has always said there will be no emergency during the elections. We'll consult with the EC before the withdrawal and the elections will not be held under emergency," commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said at a press briefing at the Secretariat. "We've passed the test of time and patience and we surely will be able to transit to democracy." "Government and the politicians are no rivals and we have to prove ourselves responsible," he said after a meeting at the housing and public works ministry. Communications adviser Gulam Quader, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and law adviser AFM Hassan Ariff were also present at the briefing at the housing and public works ministry. Before the briefing, the four advisers met with the UN delegation visiting Dhaka to observe the pre-election preparations and environment. The UN delegation headed by Francis Vendrell also included Nepal's chief election commissioner Bhusraj Pokhrel and UN political wing chief Arakeli Nastana. Emerging from the meeting, the delegation chief said, "The UN wants to see free atmospheres for all political parties and we hardly found problems in our primary observations." Vendrell hailed the media freedom and conducive atmosphere for political meetings. Asked if there was any assurance of lifting the state of emergency, he said, "We are not here to ask for that." But the emergency would go if nothing serious happened and "all parties will get equal opportunities", he added. Francis said proper electoral atmospheres were there in the country. "The UN will not send a separate team to monitor polls and we'll evaluate the decisions by the US-based NDI and other international agencies," the UN representative said. bdne
