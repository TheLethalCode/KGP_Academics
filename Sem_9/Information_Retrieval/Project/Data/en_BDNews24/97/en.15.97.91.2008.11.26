 BORDEAUX, France, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea may have romped to a 4-0 win over Girondins Bordeaux at Stamford Bridge but Nicolas Anelka is expecting the French hosts to provide stiff opposition in Wednesday's Champions League return. "This will be a very tough match because both teams need points," striker Anelka told a news conference on Tuesday. "This game will be different from the first one (in September), it will be much tighter." Chelsea lead Group A with seven points from four matches, one ahead of Bordeaux and AS Roma, and will qualify for the knockout phase if they win in France. Bordeaux lost their first two games before beating Romania's CFR Cluj home and away to revive their chances. "They got off to a bad start in the Champions League but are much better now," said Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Counterpart Laurent Blanc said Bordeaux would tread carefully at the Stade Chaban-Dalmas. "There will be no revenge to take because there was not even a game in the first leg, we just watched them play," said Blanc. "We do not intend to play in their half for 90 minutes. Good defending does not mean we will all play in front of our goal but we will have to be compact and not get caught on the break.
