 LIMA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Any efforts by the United States to be transparent about plans to deploy pieces of its missile defense shield in Eastern Europe would not entirely placate Russia, the country's foreign minister said on Sunday. Russia has interpreted US plans, which would include deploying a radar system in the Czech Republic and interceptor missiles in Poland to repel possible attack from Iran, as a direct threat to its security. The dispute over the US missile shield has become one of the key factors behind a chill in relations between Moscow and Washington to post-Cold War lows. "It would be better if the Americans gave up the idea," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in the Peruvian capital Lima, where President Dmitry Medvedev was attending a summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC. "If, despite all, the United States carries out its plans, it will need to provide transparency measures to reduce Russian concerns," he added. "But our concerns would be fully removed only if Washington gives up its plan and starts working on a joint missile defense system from scratch." At times, the two countries have considered building a joint system, and the United States has suggested "transparency" measures to build mutual trust. But earlier this month, Medvedev announced that Russia will deploy its own missiles in the westernmost enclave of Kaliningrad, bordering NATO members Poland and Lithuania. Medvedev also said the Russian military will electronically suppress US radars. However, the Russian leaders have said they did not want the missile shield disagreement to become a trigger for a long-term deterioration of US-Russian relations or even worse, of a new Cold War accompanied by an arms race. Medvedev, who pins hopes for improving bilateral relations on US President-elect Barack Obama, said in Washington last week that Russia will not be the first to deploy its missiles. Russian officials have said they hoped Obama will be less interested in forging the missile shield plans, especially in the middle of a global economic crisis. "While the position of the current (Bush) administration on the issue is extremely inflexible, the position of the US president-elect is more accurate," Medvedev told reporters on Sunday in Lima. Medvedev's chief foreign policy advisor, Sergei Prikhodko, said Medvedev and outgoing US President George W. Bush did not discuss missile defense at their last meeting in Lima on Saturday. Lavrov has said he and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have agreed to hold another round of talks on the thorny issue in late December. Russian officials say they have not been impressed by US proposals aimed at easing Russia's opposition to the project
