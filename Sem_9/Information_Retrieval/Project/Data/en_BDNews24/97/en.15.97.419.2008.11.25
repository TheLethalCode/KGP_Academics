 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  The UN pre-polls observers have hailed army chief General Moeen U Ahmed's call for withdrawal of the emergency before the national elections. "We welcome the army chief's call for the withdrawal of emergency," UN delegation leader Francis Vendrell said to reporters on Tuesday. The delegation met with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at her Gulshan office in the city in the evening. The UN wanted a free, fair and credible election participated by all parties, he said. "We are not an election observers' team. We are here to assess pre-polls preparations and whether equal opportunities are provided to all parties," the former UN assistant secretary general said Vendrell said the UN after studying his report will send an election observers' team. The delegation had also met with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and Jamaat-e-Islami leaders. BNP leaders Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Riaz Rahman, Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury and Fazle Elahi Akbar were present during the meeting with Khaleda. Shamsher Mobin later told newsmen Khaleda told the UN delegation her party was willing and ready to go to the polls. "She also reminded the delegation of the BNP demand for suspension of section 91 (E) of the RPO to help ensure an all-party election," he said. bdne
