 Jonathan Stempel and Dan Wilchins NEW YORK, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Citigroup Inc lost as much as a quarter of its market value Thursday as mushrooming worries about whether the bank has enough capital to withstand billions of dollars of additional loan losses outweighed new support from its largest individual investor. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said he plans to increase his stake to 5 percent from less than 4 percent and called the bank's shares "dramatically undervalued" following a nearly 90 percent plunge since late 2006. He also expressed "full and complete support to Citi management," including embattled Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who earlier this week announced a plan to eliminate 52,000 jobs as part of a program to cut expenses 20 percent. But investors were unimpressed, and many questioned the bank's ability to handle what are expected to be billions in additional credit losses and writedowns in 2009 as the global economy slumps into recession. "Citigroup's biggest problem is that they didn't raise money early, and now they're in trouble because they don't have the sufficient cash," said Saj Karim, investment adviser at Cannacord Capital in Waterloo, Ontario. Citigroup, which has lost more than half of its market value this month alone, was the top decliner among large U.S. banks, but others plunged, too. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp fell as much as 13 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Citigroup, once the largest U.S. bank, was overtaken in market value this week by both US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon, despite dwarfing both in assets. And in a year that has seen the rescue of giant insurer American International Group Inc and mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, some speculated about the possibility of government intervention. "As a company, (Citigroup) can't go bankrupt because they're too big," Karim said. "They will get bailed out, and that's another unfortunate strain on the U.S. government." Citigroup shares fell as low as $4.77, a nearly 14-year low, in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They were down 13 percent to $5.57 in early-afternoon dealings. Separately, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Citigroup was one of three final bidders for Chevy Chase Bank, a Bethesda, Maryland, lender, along with JPMorgan Chase and Capital One Financial Corp. CDS RISE The cost of insuring Citigroup's debt jumped. Five-year credit default swaps rose to 395 basis points, meaning it would cost $395,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group. The swaps closed at 357 basis points on Wednesday, or $357,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to Markit. "Spreads are widening on pretty much everything," said Keith Davis, a bank analyst at Farr, Miller & Washington. "Given that backdrop, how much capital is Citi going to need to shore up their balance sheet? I don't think anyone knows, and so the knee-jerk reaction is to sell first and ask questions later." Citigroup's market value was $34.9 billion on Wednesday, meaning that Alwaleed plans to invest at least $349 million, based on Wednesday's closing price. Alwaleed said the bank is "taking all the necessary steps to position the company to withstand the challenges facing the banking industry and the global economy." Alwaleed, a nephew of Saudi King Abdullah, added that he is "fully confident that Citigroup's universal banking model and global franchise will make it a long-term winner in the financial services industry." The prince's percentage stake in the bank was reduced in late 2007 and early 2008 as Citigroup raised some $50 billion of capital from sovereign wealth funds and other investors, including Alwaleed, to shore up its balance sheet. It recently received another $25 billion under the U.S. government's $700 billion financial bailout package. The Saudi billionaire last came to the bank's aid in 1991, when he invested $590 million in Citigroup predecessor Citicorp, which needed cash as it struggled with Latin American loan losses and a collapse in U.S. real estate prices. TOUGH YEAR Shares of Citigroup have fallen 82 percent this year. They lost one-third of their value in the first three days of this week as investors worried that Pandit's cost-cutting plans won't restore the bank to health. Citigroup has lost $20.3 billion in the last year and taken tens of billions of dollars of writedowns on mortgage and other toxic debt. Analysts expect it to lose money in the fourth quarter, and some don't expect it to be profitable in 2009. Citi could face losses of $20 billion or more next year on loans in commercial real estate, emerging markets and credit cards, analysts have said. Pandit suffered a major setback last month when Wells Fargo & Co agreed to buy Wachovia Corp, trumping Citigroup's bid to buy much of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank and add its $418.8 billion of deposits.
