<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The ICL Bangladesh XI kept their hopes of playing the Twenty20 World Series final alive with a comprehensive five-wicket win over ICL India XI in their second match at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium on Tuesday. Left-handed Shahriar Nafees, who played as one-down batsman instead of opening the innings, struck an unbeaten 70 off 54 balls to guide the Bangladesh side to 165 for five in 19.3 overs after India posted 164 for nine in the stipulated 20 overs. With 11 runs needed on the final over, Nafees sent Ali Murtaza outside through the deep mid-wicket in the first delivery and then struck a six over the long-off to level the score and the third ball was driven to mid-on, and the batsmen crossed to give the visitors a deserved win. Nafees, who had earlier struck two fifties in the previous tournament, slammed four sixes and as many fours and was named man of the match. Bangladesh, who suffered a shock 12-defeat to ICL World XI in the tournament opener, will face ICL Pakistan XI on Thursday. Aftab Ahmed and Nazimuddin opened the innings, but the latter fell to Rajamani Jesuraj for two in the very fourth delivery before Nafees came in to take charge with slapping 10 runs in two balls from Rakesh Patel. They together added 52 runs for the second wicket before Aftab missed a slog-sweep and was bowled by Inder Shekhar Reddy for 26 from 18 balls, leaving the side at 54 for two in 7.2 overs. Nafees along with Alok Kapali for the third wicket contributed 48 runs, of which Alok made 44 runs off 23 balls studded with four sixes and two fours before he was caught by Jesuraj off Reddy, leaving the side at 112 for three in 13.2 overs. The former Bangladesh opener Nafees looked a bit slow before completing his fifty as he refused to respond to Mohammad Rafique's callings at least four to five times, which apparently pressured the side through the later part of the match. Rafique, however, quickfired 16 off 13 balls before being bowled by Murtaza and Nafees finally eased the tension in the final over, scoring 11 runs in three deliveries. After being invited to bat first under the floodlight by Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar, India made 164 for nine with Rajagopal Sathish top-scoring 44 off 33 balls that included two fours and four sixes. Left-arm spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel was the pick of the attack with three for 48 while pacer Tapash Kumar Baisya grabbed two wickets for 33. Mohammad Rafique and Alok Kapali took one wicket apiece. bd
