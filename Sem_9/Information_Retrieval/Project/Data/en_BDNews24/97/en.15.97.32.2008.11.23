 BANGALORE, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England skipper Kevin Pietersen won the toss and elected to bowl against India in the fourth one-day international on Sunday. England must win the day-nighter to keep their hopes alive in the seven-match series after losing the first three games. The tourists retained the same team from the weather-hit third game in Kanpur, which they lost by 16 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method. India were boosted by the return of Sachin Tendulkar, the prolific batsman recalled to the side after being rested for the first three games following India's 2-0 home test series victory over Australia. Tendulkar, who last played limited-overs cricket in March when India won a tri-series in Australia, replaced Rohit Sharma as the only change in the starting eleven. Teams: England: Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Kevin Pietersen (captain), Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Owais Shah, Samit Patel, Matt Prior, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson. India: Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Ishant Sharm
