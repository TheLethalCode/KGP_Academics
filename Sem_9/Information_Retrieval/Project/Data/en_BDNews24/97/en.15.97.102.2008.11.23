 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission began hearings Sunday on objections from political parties, Awami League and BNP in the main, against prospective election observer agencies. The commission has also formed 80 electoral investigation committees to prevent and control irregularities and violations of the electoral code of conduct during the upcoming elections, EC public relations officer S Asaduzzaman said. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and his fellow commissioners M Sakhwat Hossain and Sohul Hossain heard the first objections against seven aspiring agencies, with the EC to give final decisions after concluding proceedings on Monday. The agencies present at the first-day hearings are BCDJC, Democracy Watch, Brave, Jagarani Chakra Foundation, Khan Foundation, Light House and Srijani Bangladesh. AL, also represented at Sunday's hearings, lodged complaints against 20 such agencies but later withdrew their allegations against four: NRDS, SDS, Coast Trust and Dope. The EC has listed 138 election observers and 23 of them faced objections from AL and BNP alone. bdnews
