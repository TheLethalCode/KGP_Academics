<TEXT>
 Bangalore, India, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England bowler Ryan Sidebottom has been ruled out of the remainder of the one-day series in India with a back injury. "Ryan Sidebottom has been ruled out of ODI series with a small tear in right side of lower trunk," an England statement said on Saturday. A replacement has not been named, and the bowler will remain in India with the England Performance Programme team currently on tour of the country. "England will not be sending for a replacement for Sidebottom at this stage. Selectors will review the position over the next 48 hours," the statement said. The tourists are hopeful that the swing bowler will recover in time for next month's two test matches. "Ryan will remain in India with the EPP and will undergo intensive rehabilitation. His injury will be reviewed at the end of the ODI series." The left-armer, who missed the first three games, underwent a further scan on his lower back problem ahead of Sunday's fourth one-dayer to determine the extent of his injury. Sidebottom missed the first two matches due to an Achilles injury he picked up at the start of the Stanford Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean last month and underwent a scan for a back problem before the third match. The tourists trail 3-0 in the seven-match series. "From now every game is a final. We have to win each and every game," England coach Peter Moores told a news conference.
