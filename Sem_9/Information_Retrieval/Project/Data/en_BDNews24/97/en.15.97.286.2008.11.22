 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  A high level UN panel will arrive in the city on Sunday to gauge the ongoing preparations for the ensuing elections in Bangladesh. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has formed a high-level UN panel to monitor the preparation for the upcoming general elections, says a UN press release on Saturday. "In response to a request from the caretaker government of Bangladesh, the Secretary-General has established a high-level panel for the forthcoming parliamentary elections slated for December," said the statement issued by the UN headquarters in New York. The three-member panel headed by Francesc Vendrell, former personal representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan, would report to the Secretary-General with its key findings and recommendations, according to the statement released by the local UNDP office. Other two members are: Bhojraj Pokharel, chief election commissioner of Nepal, and Aracelly Santana, former deputy director of the UN's electoral assistance division, it said. "It will undertake its first visit during 23-29 November, and will return for about a week at the time of the elections," the statement said. "The Panel is tasked with assessing the preparations and conduct of the elections through visits to Bangladesh before and during the elections," it said. Ban Ki-moon during his Dhaka visit last month announced the UN would send a polls observation mission to monitor the country's ninth parliamentary polls. bn
