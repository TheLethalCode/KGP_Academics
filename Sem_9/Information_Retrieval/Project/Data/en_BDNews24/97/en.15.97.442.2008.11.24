 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina has expressed the fear that the upcoming parliamentary election might be engineered. "We have campaigned for a free and fair election and I have suspicion that the voting results might be turned around." The former prime minister called for strict vigilance on the possibilities of vote rigging. "Let the people be freed from the conspiracies surrounding the polls and allowed to get back their right to vote," she said to the newly-elected office-bearers of the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh at her political office in Dhanmondi on Monday. Hasina also said if the AL came to power " breaking the web of conspiracy ", then all development work would be carried out efficiently. "Our main task will be to bring down the price of essentials and we believe that we will be able to attain that, " she observed. "A farce is going on with election and schedules are being changed regularly. The people have to be alert to the results of the elections," she said. "A game is also being played with voting." She also expressed indignation that AL had been unjustly branded with corrupt people. "The blame of one was put on someone else." "If Awami League comes to power then production of export items will be increased, rail and waterways will be extended. To ease traffic jams elevated roads, underground rail will be constructed and power production will be increased," Hasina said. She also promised water-powered electric station and wind mills. "By 2020, Bangladesh will be turned into a self-reliant country." bdnew
