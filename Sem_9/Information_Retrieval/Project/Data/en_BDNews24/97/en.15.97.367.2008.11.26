 Centurion, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh battled their way back against South Africa on the opening day of the second and final Test at SuperSport Park in Centurion, on Wednesday. Pace spearhead pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza dismissed opener Neil McKenzie to reduce the hosts to 20 for one at stumps after Junaed Siddique and Mushfiqur Rahim guided Bangladesh to 250 all out in the first innings. Junaed and Mushfiqur struck their third Test fifty to take Bangladesh beyond the 200-mark for the third time on South African soil. The performance was a contrast to Bangladesh's dismal show in the first Test in Bloemfontein, where the visitors barely survived 88.3 overs in their two innings. Bangladesh made 153 and 159 in two innings before suffering an innings and 129-run defeat to the hosts. Left-handed batsman Junaed struck a fraught but significant 67 off 144 balls studded with 11 boundaries on Wednesday, while Mushfiqur Rahim braved the South African pace attack to slam 65 off 86 balls. Keeper Mushfiqur's rousing innings included nine fours and two sixes off fiery fast bowler Dale Steyn. Last man Mahbubul Alam survived for an hour scoring one not out in a 56-partnership with Mushfiqur, for the last-wicket record stand against South Africa. Opener Tamim Iqbal (31) and Shakib Al Hasan (30), debutant Roqibul Hasan (15) were remarkable scorers. Pacer Morne Morkel rattled the visitors' top order to return with four for 72 while Makhaya Ntini wrecked up the middle and tail also taking four for 32. Steyn and Monde Zondeki chipped in with one wicket apiece. bdn
