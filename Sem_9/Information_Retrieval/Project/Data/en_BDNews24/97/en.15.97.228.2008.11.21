 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James Moriarty said Thursday he believed all major political parties would eventually participate in polls and ruled out chances of a full-scale military takeover even if the vote did not take place by year-end. "Every time I have talked to the military, they indicated that they have no desire to do that," Moriarty told bdnews24.com at Hotel Agrabad in Chittagong. He said he hoped that all political parties would take part in the elections. The US envoy said Washington would examine whether the upcoming elections were held in a free, fair and credible way in case of a boycott by any major political party. "The parties and the government have three more days to try and achieve a compromise that makes a good, in other words, a free, fair and credible election possible," said the US ambassador, on his way back from a three-day trip to the CHT. "I hope that all the major political parties will participate," the ambassador said at a Chittagong hotel in the evening. A couple of hours later, in Dhaka, BNP chief Khaleda Zia announced her party was ready for the elections if the polling day was pushed back to Dec 28. "If one or more of the major parties decides to boycott for its own reasons, we will first of all look at the reasons why they are boycotting and in the course look at the elections itself. "That's why we have broadened our election observers so that we will have independent eyes on the elections," Moriarty said. bd
