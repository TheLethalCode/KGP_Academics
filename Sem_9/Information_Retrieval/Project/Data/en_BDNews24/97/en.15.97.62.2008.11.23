 Abdur Rahim Harmachi Senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  The economy is showing signs of recovery with the commodity prices falling in the world markets and it will regain a firm footing if the global crisis does not linger on and post-elections politics gets back to normal, the finance adviser says. The economists and business leaders agreed. "The global crisis if prolongs might leave an impact on the exports and remittance slightly," Mirza AB Azizul Islam said to bdnews24.com on Sunday. He predicted slide in export growth to 12-14 percent in the current fiscal year against more than 20 percent in the previous year. Remittance inflow too would fall from last year's growth of more than 30 percent. "Our economy enjoys some relief as the prices in the world markets are showing a downtrend," the adviser said adding the foreign exchange reserves would be unhurt. Asked about the price spiral, he said, "Our rate is still lower than in the neighbouring countries." The trend would subside in coming days, he hoped. All indices except those of food prices were positive as the economy gained speed after the overheating world oil markets, unusual price hikes, and drives against corruption and hoarding after the interim government took office in January last year. Bangladesh Bank's latest statistics show the first quarter (July-Sept) of the current 2008-9 fiscal year recorded a sharp 45.74 percent drop in food import costs against the corresponding period of the previous financial year, a time when imports edged a record 270.25 percent up. Fuel import costs declined 38.54 percent in September from the previous month though the costs rose in the first two months of FY2008-9, the statistics further showed. October witnessed a further 41 percent fall. Capital machinery imports in the first quarter of the ongoing financial year jumped 15.50 percent though the sector saw 8.86 percent slide in the same period of the preceding fiscal year, according to the BB statistical data. There was a 40.36 percent rise in the costs of industrial raw materials import in July-September quarter and the growth was 17.89 pc in the same quarter last fiscal year. Credit flow in the private sector climbed 26.55 percent in September, according to the statistics. The country's foreign exchange reserves stood at $509.58 until Nov. 20, which could cater to four months' import costs, the data further showed. Foreign remittance flow remained strong in July-October period with $299.28 crore pouring in, a 36.80 percent rise against the corresponding period of the previous year. Export earnings recorded a 41 percent jump with $435 crore in July-Sept period this year. Experts, however, apprehended a decline in the exports and foreign remittance as a result of the global crisis. Price inflation still remains a cause for concern as it clocked 10.19 percent in September. Inflation rate edged over two digits in October last year and reached 11.59 percent in December, then started receding but never below 10 percent. Senior research director at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies Zayed Bakht told bdnews24.com that all other indices except the inflation were positive. But things would depend largely on the international market and the December elections, he added. Annisul Huq, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex body of the business community, said, "The growth in the imports of capital machinery and industrial raw materials and credit flow in the private sectors is a positive sign. "A free, fair and credible election and post-election business-friendly environment will clear ways for uninterrupted development of Bangladesh." He called upon the political parties to meet the FBCCI's 52-point charter of proposals after assuming power. bd
