 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The ICL Bangladesh XI will begin their Indian Cricket League Twenty20 World Series campaign against ICL World XI in the curtain-raiser on Sunday in Ahmedabad, India. Before leaving for India, captain Habibul Bashar, a former Bangladesh skipper, had said they were aiming the final of the four-team series also comprising Pakistan XI and Indian XI. The Bangladesh XI have reasons to be upbeat about their World Series prospects if their showing in the breakaway Indian Cricket League was anything to go by. They won four of their eight matches and missed out on a semifinal spot to finish the fifth among nine teams. The fact that the players gelled together in that league might gibe the Bangladeshis a slight edge in Sunday's match. The players of the World XI, who played for different ICL franchises, may need more time to develop good understandings among them. However, all of World XI players like Chris Harris, Maravan Atapattu, Nicky Boje, Jason Gillespie, Andrew Hall, Justin Kemp, Lance Klusner and Damien Martyn have had the experience in top-flight cricket and the lack of time should not bother them too much. Some 14 rebel Bangladesh cricketers branded as Dhaka Warriors did not have the best of starts in the ICL due to lack of practice facilities. But they bounced back in some style in the later part of the tournament with Alok Kapali, Shahriar Nafees, Nazimuddin, Aftab Ahmed, Mosharraf Hossain Rubel and Mohammad Rafique all contributing to the wins. "After the ICL, the spirits of the players are high and they are dreaming of playing the final," Bashar had earlier said. Bangladesh XI will face ICL India XI on Nov. 25 before playing their last group match against ICL Pakistan XI on Nov. 27. Bangladesh XI: Habibul Bashar (captain) , Aftab Ahmed, Alok Kapali, Dhiman Ghosh, Farhad Reza, Golam Mabud, Mahbubul Karim, Manjural Islam, Mohammad Rafique, Mohammad Sharif, Mosharraf Hossain, Nazimuddin, Shahriar Nafees and Tapash Baisya. World XI: Chris Harris (captain), Andre Adams, Marvan Atapattu, Nicky Boje, Jason Gillespie, Murray Goodwin, Avishka Gunawardene, Andrew Hall, Ian Harvey, Nantie Hayward, Justin Kemp, Lance Klusener, Damien Martyn and Paul Nixon
