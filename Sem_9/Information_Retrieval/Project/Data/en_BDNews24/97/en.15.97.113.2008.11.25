<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party has said it will not compromise on HM Ershad being the president if the Awami League-led electoral alliance wins the upcoming elections. JP presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed after a meeting of the AL policymakers and the JP leaders on Tuesday night told reporters his party was bent upon its stance on Ershad being the president should the grand alliance wins. "Yes and yes" was his reply to a question by the journalists at the AL chief's Dhanmondi office. Kazi Zafar said only deserving candidates will get nominations from the alliance. AL leaders Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Abdul Jalil, Suranjit SenGupta, and Syed Ashraful Islam were present at the meeting, while Kazi Zafar was accompanied by fellow JP leaders Ruhul Amin Hawlader, Anisul Islam Mahmud and Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu. The JP asked for 74 seats from the alliance. The Liberal Democratic Party and the Anwar Hossain Manju-led JP also gave separate lists of individual party contenders. LDP secretary general Jahanara Begum and presidium member Redwan Ahmed gave a list of 30 aspirants from their party while JP (Manju) secretary general Sheikh Shahidul Islam handed a list of 12 nomination seekers. AL's Amu said, "The alliance has been forged to win the polls so only deserving candidates will get tickets." "So the seat-sharing ratio among the allies may fluctuate," he said. He also said alliance chief Sheikh Hasina would announce the election manifesto for the alliance, not just for Awami League. bdnews
