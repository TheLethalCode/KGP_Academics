 WELLINGTON, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand named Englishman Andy Moles as their new coach on Tuesday. Moles, coach of the Northern Districts provincial side for the past two years, will replace John Bracewell next week before the team's tour of West Indies. Moles had a 12 year-career as an opening batsman with English county Warwickshire from 1986 to 1998. He also coached the England Under-19 team and has worked in South Africa, Kenya and Scotland. "Andy will be well placed to develop this Blackcaps side which has tremendous potential and is still growing in experience," NZ Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said in a statement. New Zealand are currently in Australia preparing for the second test, which starts in Adelaide later this week
