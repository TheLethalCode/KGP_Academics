<TEXT>
 Dhaka, November 23 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday deferred hearings on petitions by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to quash two graft cases for the fourth time to Jan 7. The court also ordered authorities not to arrest or harass the former premier in a Tk 3 crore bribery case and the Niko graft case until that date. Hasina's lawyer Barrister Shafique Ahmed told the court: "Since the Supreme Court will go for winter vacation in December, the hearing on my client's petitions may be deferred." Shafique also appealed to the court to extend the HC's earlier 'no arrest or harassment' order. Assistant attorney general Khandaker Diliruzzaman did not challenge barrister Shafique's motion. After the court order, barrister Shafique told bdnews24.com, "The HC has deferred the hearing of Hasina's appeal to cancel the two cases till January 7. The court also ordered authorities not to arrest or harass Hasina till that day." "The HC on Oct 27 extended a stay order with regard to the two cases." The Supreme Court on Aug 13 upheld a HC order staying the trial of the two cases in the lower court. The HC had halted their trial on July 7 for two months and ordered the government and the Anticorruption Commission to show cause as to why the two cases should not be ruled illegal. The ACC filed a case against Sheikh Hasina and six others on Sept 2 2007, on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in exchange for contracts to set up three barge-mounted power plants. The ACC filed a case against Sheikh Hasina and six others on Dec 9, for causing state losses of some Tk 13,600 crore through awarding contracts without tender to Canadian oil-gas exploration company Niko Resources Ltd for developing three gas fields at Chhattack, Kamta and Feni. Charges were later pressed against nine people in all. bdnews
