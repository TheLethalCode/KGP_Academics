<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka filed a petition with the High Court Sunday challenging the Election Commission's embargo on mayors contesting parliamentary polls for three years after quitting office. Barrister Ruhul Quddus Kajol filed the petition on Khoka's behalf Sunday with the HC bench of justices Tarique Ul Islam and Farah Mahbub. After filing, barrister Kajol told bdnews24.com, "The petition demands cancellation of the EC's embargo on mayors running in the Jatiya Sangsad election." The petitioner cited media reports saying that mayors will not be eligible to run the polls until three years after stepping down from office. The petition said the decision affected not only Khoka, but other incumbent mayors too who were aspiring to contest the JS polls. Mayor Khoka had in the past been elected thrice to parliament, the petition pointed out. He served the nation as a minister, and since 2002 he has been discharging his responsibilities as the Dhaka mayor, an office which equals a minister's in status, Khoka said. The petitioner claimed the EC's bar was a violation of the existing law and was made only to deter incumbent mayors from participating in the forthcoming polls. Mayor Khoka also sent a legal notice to the EC Thursday protesting the bar. City and municipality mayors cannot run for the parliament even after resigning their office, election officials say. According to the Section 12 of the Representation of the People Order, anyone holding any 'office of profit' in the service of the republic or of a statutory public authority will be disqualified for running any other election until three years from the date of their resignation. Mayors and councillors of city corporations and municipalities will be considered 'offices of profit', the EC has said. Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and Khulna mayor Sheikh Tayebur Rahman have announced their intention to run for parliament in the upcoming election. bdnews
