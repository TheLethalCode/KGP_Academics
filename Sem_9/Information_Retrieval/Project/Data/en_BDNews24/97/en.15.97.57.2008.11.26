 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League and its allies asked the caretaker government on Wednesday to specify the date of lifting emergency rule, in response to the remarks made on Tuesday by the army chief and an adviser, a leader said. "Well, let the caretaker government give us the exact date, or how do we know when they will lift the emergency?" Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu told reporters after attending a 14-party alliance meeting held at the AL president's political office. Army chief Geeral Moeen U Ahmed said on Tuesday that he would request the government to lift the emergency before the general elections slated for Dec. 29. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had said earlier in the day that the interim administration would withdraw the emergency sometime before the polls in consultation with the Election Commission. Amu said the meeting demanded a) no further shifting of the parliamentary election date, b) lifting of the emergency, c) deferring the Upazila election by a month and d) scrapping section 91 (E) of the RPO. "The [government] has been shifting the polls dates time and again, which has given rise to suspicions in the public minds. We are concerned," said Amu. "The 14-party nominations will very soon be made public. This important matter may be finalised in the AL presidium meeting scheduled for Wednesday afternoon." Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Suranjit Sengupta and Syed Ashraful Islam of Awami League, Rashed Khan Menon and Bimal Biswas of the Workers' Party of Bangladesh, Hasanul Huq Inu, Syed Jafar Sajjad, Moinuddin Khan Badal and Shireen Akhter of JSD, Nurul Islam of Ganotontree Party, Dilip Barua of Sammyabadi Dal, Abdus Salam of Gano Ajadi League and Asit Baran Roy of Communist Kendro were present at the 14-party meeting. bdn
