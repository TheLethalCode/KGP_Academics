 Rangpur, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Badarganj upazila Jatiya Party leaders resigned en masse Saturday, declaring party chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad 'persona non grata' in the area, in protest at the party's nomination being denied to their preferred candidate Mohammad Ali Sarker. "Ershad is an autocrat in the true sense. He sacrificed the values of party workers for the two crore taka he got from Anis (Mandal),' said local JP leader Akmal Hossain, in the presence of tens of thousands of supporters. The decision was taken in a meeting at the JP Badargonj office, after the party nominated Anis Mandal, an expatriate living in the USA, for the constituency. Another local leader Aminul Islam complained that Ershad had demeaned "the spirit of the party workers". Mohammad Ali Sarker, meanwhile, announced his resignation from the party at the meeting, through a phone call aired live through loudspeakers. bdnews
