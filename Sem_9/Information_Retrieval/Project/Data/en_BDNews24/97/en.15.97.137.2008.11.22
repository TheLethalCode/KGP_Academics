<TITLE> Section 91E 'indispensable': TIB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)Section 91E of the Representation of People Ordinance 2008 giving the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy is "indispensable" and cannot be annulled, as demanded by BNP, says Transparency International Bangladesh. In a statement issued Saturday, TIB said: "If it is annulled, there will not remain any institutional process to effectively enforce the electoral code of conduct on candidates." The path to the EC's empowerment would be obstructed, TIB said, adding: "In order to pave the way for healthy politics that will debar the corrupt, black money holders and terrorists from being elected and to bring about qualitative change in politics as desired by the people, this clause is indispensable". The present caretaker government incorporated section 91E by amending the Representation of People Order 1972. Under this clause, the EC can cancel the candidature of anyone who, on investigation, is found violating the electoral code of conduct. "In the past, no nomination papers of any candidate have been cancelled for violation of the code of conduct and no candidate has faced penalisation for failing to furnish accounts of election expenditure," the TIB statement pointed out. "This clause is very important to ensure application of other clauses ranging from election expenditures to other sections of the RPO." The four-party alliance led by BNP had demanded cancellation of the clause as a precondition for participation in the election. bdnews
