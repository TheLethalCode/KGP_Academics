 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com) - The government in a travel advisory issued Wednesday night asked Bangladeshis to be "extremely cautious" if travelling to the Thail capital of Bangkok. "I urge Bangladeshis traveling Thailand to exercise extreme caution due to the ongoing disturbances in the country," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com earlier in the afternoon. "In case of any emergency, Bangladeshis can contact our embassy in Bankok," the adviser said. Governments around the world advised their nationals to cancel or postpone travel to Thailand as anti-government protesters tightened their grip over Bangkok's international airport on Wednesday, causing chaos and triggering speculation of imminent intervention by the military. Bangladeshi citizens can contact their embassy in Bangkok at House No.727 Sukhumvit Soi 55 (Thong Lo), Bangkok 10110, Tel: 0-2185-1340; 0-2185-1341. Police in Bangkok have so far gone out of their way not to escalate the tension by confronting the People's Alliance for Democracy, which began a "final push" on Monday after months of protests to unseat the government. Gunfire broke out on the streets Tuesday, however, as armed PAD members took on government. Thai authorities began evacuating some 3,000-plus travellers - many of them foreign tourists - trapped at Suvarnabhumi International Airport since demonstrators stormed the terminal on Tuesday night. In Bangkok, authorities have advised foreigners to avoid areas where there is a risk of disturbance, for example, the Government House, and to take the necessary precautions for their personal safety. Tourists are also urged to check with airport officials and police China, France, New Zealand, Singapore, Britain, the United States, Australia and Japan on Wednesday warned travellers planning to head to Bangkok to steer clear, or to act with caution if already in Thailand, according to media reports. Foreign tourism is vital to Thailand's economy, with 14.8 million visits last year, according to the country's tourism authority, topped by visitors from Japan, Britain and the US. Britain's foreign office issued an updated travel advisory telling Britons to keep abreast of a 'very uncertain' political situation. The United States warned its citizens to check with their airlines if they were due to fly into or out of Bangkok. The Japanese foreign ministry urged its nationals to be cautious. In an alert posted on the ministry's website, it said people planning to visit or to stay in Thailand were advised to check flight information well beforehand. The Australian government, which has a long-standing warning of possible terrorist attacks in the country, told its citizens Wednesday to take extra precautions if they were planning to visit Thailand. The New Zealand foreign affairs ministry advised travellers stranded at Suvarnabhumi to stay with other tourists, remain close to information counters and follow instructions issued by local authorities. In a statement posted on its website, France's foreign affairs ministry advised French people due to fly through Bangkok to make alternative arrangements. China advised its citizens currently in Thailand to pay attention to their safety and stay away from areas of protest marches and demonstrations.' For those who cannot avoid travel to the troubled nation, the Singapore government has advised its citizens to register with their foreign ministry to enable the ministry and their embassies in Bangkok to render them the necessary consular assistance in case of emergencies. Most airlines have halted service to the Thai capital, a regional hub with 125,000 passengers passing through Suvarnabhumi daily. The airport was expected to remain closed for all of Wednesday.
