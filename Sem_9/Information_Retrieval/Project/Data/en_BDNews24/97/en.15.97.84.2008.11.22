 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)A tense situation prevails in the Chittagong Hill Tracts with land disputes on the rise as waters of the Kaptai Lake recede. The emerging fertile shoals, prized for their cultivation, have sparked fierce tussles between indigenous communities and 'Bengali settlers' in the hill region. Feuding broke out last week when the indigenous Chakma community and plains-land settlers became embroiled in a fight to occupy shoals in Kolabonia village of Borkol upzila in Rangamati district. Local police say they can do very little to defuse the tensions as the indigenous people rarely go to law enforcers to register complaints. They claim the Adivasis are reluctant to settle disputes except through traditional laws and mediation by the elders of their respective communities. "A few days ago, Bengalis and Chakmas became involved in clashes over the ownership of a shoal in Kolabonia village," 45 year-old Abdul Mannan, a Bengali who settled in Kolabonia 25 years ago, told bdnews24.com. Jogeshwar Chakma, another local resident, told bdnews24.com: "All the land under the lake belongs to us and we have valid papers." "We cultivate paddy on the shoals to meet our annual rice needs." He also asserted the right of the Adivasi people on the land, saying: "We will carry on cultivating." Jahangir Alam, another Bengali settler from Patuakhali, told bdnews24.com: "Shoals have emerged in Bogachhari in Borkol upzilla and the hill people have prevented Bengalis from cultivating those shoals." He feared that if this situation persisted, there were possibilities of more serious clashes. He also pointed out that though most of the shoals belonged to the indigenous people some were also Khas (public) land. Meanwhile, Krishna Kumar Chakma, a resident of Bogachhari, told bdnews24.com that the police never took any measures to settle the disputes. He also alleged that the law enforcers show bias and usually take the side of Bengalis. When this allegation was presented before the police, however, Borkol assistant sub-inspector Anwar Hossain told bdews24.com that the Adivasis "do not accept the involvement of the police in local matters". "The hill people don't come to the police to file the complaints. Instead, they turn to the headmen who only have authority over the tribes," said Anwar. But Monindralal Chakma, headman of Jagannathchhara in Borkol upzila, told bdnews24.com: "We do go to the police when we cannot resolve any problem ourselves." Local officials said that the water level in Kaptai lake dropped significantly this year. "The lake's depth should be around 150 feet at this time of year. But now it is only around 79 feet," one official told bdnews24.com. Kaptai Lake, with an area of 220 square kilometres, was created by the Pakistan government in 1956-62, with financial support from the US government. The lake inundated tribal lands, including the palace of the Chakma king, and displaced some 100,000 people. The region has seen tensions between the hill tracts' 33 indigenous tribes and Bengali settlers since the mid-1970s. bdnews
