 DHARAMSALA, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dalai Lama reaffirmed on Sunday the support of Tibetan exiles for his "Middle Way" approach to China, and ruled out any question of his retirement. His statements came a day after Tibetan exiles decided to stick to the "Middle Way" approach to China in a six-day meeting, after a lack of progress in autonomy talks frustrated the Dalai Lama and led him to call for a review of his stand.

"There is no point, or question of retirement," he said. Tibetan exiles held a six-day meeting this week in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is based.
