 Bloemfontein, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh suffered an innings and 129-run defeat to South Africa with five sessions to go in the first Test at OUTsurance on Saturday. Resuming the fourth day on 67 for three, the visitors collapsed at 159 all out just before lunch, just six runs more than their first innings total of 153 after South Africa declared at 441 for nine. Mehrab Hossain Junior topscored with an unbeaten 43 off 69 balls putting on 44 runs for the ninth wicket with Shahadat Hossain, who made 16 off 25 balls before being the fifth scalp off Dale Steyn who gave away 63 runs in 18 overs. After two sessions of the third day were called off due to a thunderstorm in Bloemfontein on Friday, the fierce paceman was the main wrecker on the fourth day's morning destroying the visitors' batting line-up. New ball partner Makhaya Ntini made the inroad having Mohammad Ashraful caught by Neil McKenzie for 13, leaving the side at 80 for four, and then Bangladesh slipped to 108 for eight in the face of Steyn's pace. Jacques Kallis picked off Mahbubul Alam (duck) to wrap Bangladesh's second innings. Kallis and Ntini chipped in with two wickets each for 17 and 63 respectively. It was the 32nd innings defeat in 56 Test matches Bangladesh had played. The Tigers will take on Proteas in the second and final Test on Nov 26-30 in Centurion. bd
