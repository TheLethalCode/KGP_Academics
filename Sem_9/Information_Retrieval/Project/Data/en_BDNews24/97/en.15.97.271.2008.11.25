 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Tuesday has backed lifting of emergency ahead of the general election scheduled for Dec. 29. "I would particularly request the government to withdraw emergency before the elections," he told a ceremony at the China-Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre. "The government needs to do this," general Moeen said. The Council of Chamber Presidents (CCP), a body of chamber presidents from across the country, accorded the army chief a reception for his contributions towards the country, especially in the last two years. CCP president Abul Kashem Ahmed in his welcome note thanked the armed forces for their efforts during natural calamities and food price shock. "But above all, we appreciate the joint forces' measures to distribute fertiliser, seeds and pesticides among the farmers as there is no alternative for the country to be self reliant on food," he said. The presidents of the 64 chambers separately presented the army chief with souvenirs. In his speech, General Moeen focused on developing Bangladesh's manpower to skilled workforce through training and development programmes. On army's role during the 1/11 affair, he said the forces were reluctant to step in. "The president had declared emergency then and requested the army to maintain law and order." He also said they were focused to curb corruption during the last two years. "We may not have fully succeeded but were able to give the general people an idea of the level of corruption happening in the country." Former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo, FBCCI president Annisul Huq, MCCI president Latifur Rahman, BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury, BKMEA president Fazlul Haque also spoke among others. bdn
