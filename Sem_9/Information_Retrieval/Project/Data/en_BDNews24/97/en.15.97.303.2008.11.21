 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami on Friday asked authorities to reschedule the general election in line with BNP chief Khaleda Zia's demand to reschedule the polls for Dec. 28. Khaleda announced in a televised media briefing on Thursday that BNP-led four-party alliance would go to the vote on Dec. 28, if conditions are met. Jamaat-e-Islami is a key component of the combine. "The country's people have become free from a suffocating situation through the announcement. They are now looking forward to a free and acceptable election," Nizami said at a press briefing at the party's central office in the Maghbazar. He pointed out that the Election Commission has termed Khaleda's announcement as positive. "As the present interim government has been patronised by the patriotic armed forces, so it must not end in vain," adding " We must not bring the armed forces face-to-face with the people." "We want the government does its main constitutional duty by transferring power to an elected government by holding a free, fair, and acceptable election for the development of a healthy and stable democracy in the country." Amid emergency rule, he said, a fair election was not possible. About their demand for a delayed Upazilla election, Nizami said, " We have demanded that the government push back Upazila election at least by one month. People may get confused if electioneering for Upazila and general elections go on together." He accused the government of dragging its heels to accept their demand. Asked whether Jamaat would take part in the general election scheduled for Dec. 18, he said, "We will see how the election is held on Dec. 18." Nizami left the press conference without answering when he was asked why they had not pointed it out to the Election Commission that hajj pilgrims would not be able to vote if the forestalled Jan. 22, 2007had gone ahead. The Eid-ul-Ajha was held on Jan. 1, 2007 and the general election was supposed to be held on Jan. 22 the same year. The alliance has demanded the election day be delayed by 10 days on the ground that the pilgrims who are now in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj would not be able to vote if the polls were held on Dec. 18. b
