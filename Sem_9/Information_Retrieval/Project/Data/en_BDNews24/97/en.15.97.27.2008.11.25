<TITLE> English coach Moles to rebuild New Zealand team </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Englishman Andy Moles pledged to develop a young and inexperienced New Zealand team after being named as coach on Tuesday. Moles, coach of the Northern Districts provincial side for the past two years, will replace John Bracewell next week before the team's tour of West Indies. "We've lost a lot of senior players over the last two years and it is a rebuilding phase," Moles told Television NZ. He said he would not accept excuses for underperformance. "We've got to get a plan, move forward, set our goals, become number four or five in test cricket in a year's time, and move on from there." New Zealand are seventh in the ICC test rankings and need at least a draw in the second test against Australia in Adelaide this week to retain that position after losing the first match of the series. Moles had a 12-year playing career as an opening batsman with English county Warwickshire from 1986 to 1998. He has also coached the England Under-19 team and worked in South Africa, Kenya and Scotland. "Andy will be well placed to develop this Blackcaps side which has tremendous potential and is still growing in experience," NZ Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said in a statement. Bracewell, 50, is returning to coach English county side Gloucestershire next year
