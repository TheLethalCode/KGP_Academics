 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com) Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said the UK-sponsored Hotel Management and Catering Institute in Sylhet would be "world class", as the foundation stone was laid Tuesday. The institute is aimed at producing skilled chefs and workers for the British restaurant industry among others, said Iftekhar. The foreign adviser unveiled the institute's foundation plaque at a simple ceremony. "This is terrific news for Bangladesh and for Sylhet especially, a region with such close ties with the UK," said acting British high commissioner Duncan Norman at the launching ceremony. "We hope this institute can provide a model for future skills development for young people in Bangladesh, and that it can help Bangladesh to expand the hospitality and catering sectors in which the country has such a fine tradition of success," DFID's country representative Chris Austin said. The institute will provide practical training in food preparation and cooking, beverages, reception and accommodation services in hotels and restaurants. Britain's Department for International Development (DFID) is providing  400,000 to build and equip the institute. The government chose Sylhet for the project as a large number of expatriate Bangladeshis in the UK are from the region, many of them employed in the 12,000 Bangladeshi restaurants across Britain. Since the British government introduced a strict points-based system (PBS) for entry into the UK, entrepreneurs in the curry industry fear the collapse of the sector owing to paucity of manpower. The curry industry, now, has a deficit of around 30,000 workers, according to industry insiders. To fill the possible vacuum in the curry industry, the British government offered Bangladesh assistance to set up a catering institute to train chefs and restaurant workers. According to the primary estimates, around 300 skilled workers would be produced in the first five years, who will have the chance to migrate to the UK meeting the conditions under the PBS. bdn
