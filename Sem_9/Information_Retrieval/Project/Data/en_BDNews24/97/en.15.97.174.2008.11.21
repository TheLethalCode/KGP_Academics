<TITLE> 4-party pushing polls to uncertainty: Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP-led four-party alliance's demand for pushing back the elections is leading to "risk and uncertainty," Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury warned on Thursday. Asked for a reaction to BNP chief Khaleda Zia's official plea on Thursday night to defer the polls, she said: "BNP is pushing the elections into risk and uncertainty at this last point in time, whereas they had previously demanded elections in October." On the government's responsibility, the AL presidium member said, "It is for the government to decide, but if the elections are pushed back 10 days people will have to brave the state of emergency for 10 more days." bdnews
