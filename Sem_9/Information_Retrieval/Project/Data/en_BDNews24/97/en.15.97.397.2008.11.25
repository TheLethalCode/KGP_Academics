<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The ongoing global economic crisis will not hit the readymade garment industry, the country`s main export earner, exporters and bankers on Monday said. At a meeting on the global turmoil at the BGMEA office at Kawran Bazar they said there was no reason to panic despite buyers in the USA and Europe postponed a number of Christmas Day orders. The prices and the quality that Bangladesh offers are unique and the western buyers have no other choice, they asserted. There could be a slight downward trend over the next two to three months but growth will continue as before, the speakers said. "The present problem is common everywhere in the world. The buyers don't favour us by purchasing our products, they rather choose our quality and prices. So no need to panic," Mutual Trust Bank chairman Syed Manzur Elahi said. "Our biggest rival China has turned to the high-tech and is gradually withdrawing from the readymade apparels sectors. The factories growing in the neighbouring India are not as big as ours. Buyers have to come to us." "The RMG sector contributes 78 percent to our export earnings attracting bulk of investments from the banks," Elahi said. BGMEA president Anwarul Alam Chowdhury said, "The exporters here are wary as the western buyers have suspended a lot of big Christmas orders, which does not usually happen." "They also fear the orders might fall in future, but it is not true there are big orders waiting." Janata Bank chief executive SM Aminur Rahman said, "For the sake of their own interests the banks must protect the RMG sector." Present at the meeting among others were Bangladesh Association of Banks chairman Nazrul Islam, Islami Bank managing director Farid Uddin Ahmed, Dhaka Bank managing director Abu Musa, UCCBL managing director Shahjada Bhuiyan. bd
