 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Representatives of BNP and its allies and the Election Commission officials Friday evening discussed the conditions for the four-party alliance to contest in the general election. "We've elaborately discussed the proposals our leader [Khaleda Zia] made on Thursday," BNP vice-president MK Anwar said to reporters after the meeting held at the EC Secretariat. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Thursday announced the 4-party alliance was prepared to go to election on Dec. 28 if their other conditions were met. Total withdrawal of the emergency rule, repeal of section 91E of the Representation of the People Ordinance that gives the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy, and deferment of Upazila polls are the other demands. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said, "The discussion was friendly and the commission will act fast to decide on the polls schedule." He refused to comment further "in the interest of the discussion". Huda said they would sit with the Awami League, which has confirmed their participation on Dec. 18, as well, "maybe tomorrow (Saturday)". BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, Jamaat-e-Islam assistant secretary general Md Quamaruzzaman and the other election commissioners Md Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain also attended the meeting. bdnews24.
