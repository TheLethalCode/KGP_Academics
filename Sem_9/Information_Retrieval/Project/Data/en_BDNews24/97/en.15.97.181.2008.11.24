 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government is planning to construct 4,256 flats at a cost of Tk 3,324 crore in Dhaka's Mohakhali and Mirpur areas, according to an ambitious new project to address the capital's housing crisis. "The flats will be constructed in a first of its kind joint collaboration between the government and private construction firms," finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters Monday after an ECNEC meeting okayed the project. The project includes civic and community facilities such as mosques, clubhouses, swimming pools, health centres, shopping centres and security services. "The project is aimed at helping rid Dhaka of the housing crisis through planned development, and creating a capital city featuring modern amenities," said the adviser. The project plan for the construction of the flats estimates the city's population to stand at around 1.25 crore, growing by 1.6 lakh annually. The plan further reveals that the number of houses being built yearly by different government and non-government organisations is around 10,000, which meets only a fraction of the demand. The new public-private venture has been taken by amending the National Housing Policy 2003. According to the approved plans, construction work will begin in January 2009 and finish in December 2011. Of the total expenditure, Tk 1303.95 crore will be financed by the government, with partner firms shouldering the remaining Tk 2020.24 crore. The mega-project aims at 38 seventeen-storey buildings with different-sized apartments of 2000, 1700, 1400 and 1200 sq ft. Additional features such as roads, boundary walls, pedestrian pathways, playing fields and footbridges are included in the budget. The plan also mentions that the main aim of this project is to provide accommodation to middle and low-income government officials. The government flats will be offered to officials on an installment plan. Buyers will have to pay 25 per cent of the total price within the first five years; the rest will have to be paid, in interest free monthly sums, over a period of 20 years. Flats under the construction firms' quota will be offer to private buyers under a system formulated by authorities. The buildings will be constructed over an area of 42.37 acres in Mohakhali and 7.18 acres in Mirpur. In Mirpur, one Katha of land is priced at Tk 50 lakh while in Mirpur the rate per Katha is Tk 5 lakh. bdnews24.
