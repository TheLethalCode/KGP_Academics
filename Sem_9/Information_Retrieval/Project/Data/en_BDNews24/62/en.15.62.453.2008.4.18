 BELGRADE, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's top politicians, facing a crucial general election in three weeks, are blurring traditional party lines to court a nationalist vote that has grown stronger since the secession of Kosovo. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, a moderate nationalist who beat autocratic Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 in the mantle of a pro-Western reformer, has for months been the main torchbearer for Serbia's claim to its former province. But President Boris Tadic, who has combined a pro-European stance with support for Kosovo staying in Serbia, shifted his ground on Friday, saying he would put Serbia's territorial integrity before EU membership if forced to choose. Kostunica has bitterly criticised the United States and the European Union for backing the Albanian-majority territory, and says that closer ties with the EU at this point would be tantamount to recognition of Kosovo's "illegal independence". "Serbia will never enter the EU or anything else if it gives up a part of its territory," he told the daily Danas in an interview to be published at the weekend. "If we give up Kosovo today, we would under the same principle... give up (northern province) Vojvodina tomorrow, and a day later some third part of our country. At the end, there would be nothing left of Serbia, nothing left to join anything." Kostunica's fragile coalition with the pro-Western Democratic Party collapsed in March over whether Serbia should pursue EU ties despite the bloc's backing for Kosovo. Polls show the May 11 vote will be a tight race between a bloc of pro-Western parties and the nationalist Radicals, already Serbia's strongest single party, which is also getting a boost from public bitterness at the loss of Kosovo. The southern province, seen by Serbs as the heartland of their medieval kingdom and Orthodox faith, had been a United Nations protectorate since 1999, when NATO bombs drove out Serb forces accused of killing civilians in a counter-insurgency war. The emotional impact of Kosovo's secession has not been lost on Tadic, the Democrats' leader and the main figure in a campaign that emphasises a 'European Serbia'. For months he has tried to combine a pro-Europe stance with a firm line on Kosovo, and was seen by Western capitals as their interlocutor of choice, a moderate who could one day strike a compromise. On Friday he signalled a shift, saying that although he was in favour of both EU membership and keeping Kosovo as part of Serbia, his loyalties were clear. "If I faced that question at the end of my presidential mandate, to decide between the country's European future and the country's integrity, I'd choose the latter," he told the Belgrade weekly Standard in an interview. He said he had given his liberal party's ideology "a strong national component". "I insisted on having party interests subordinated to the state ones, that nothing can be more important than the state," he said. "That is a responsible national policy."
