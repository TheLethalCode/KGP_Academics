 LONDON, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top shares clung to early gains on Monday as the Bank of England (BoE) said it would lend banks more money, while Royal Bank of Scotland considered a rights issue and bid talk buoyed ITV. At 0823 GMT, the FTSE 100 was 14.2 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 6,070.7 after touching a high of 6,089.5. The blue-chip index has added almost 7 percent this month but is down more than 5 percent in 2008. Volatile banks were negative after dipping in and out of positive territory, with Barclays, HSBC and HBOS down 0.5-1.5 percent. The BoE detailed a ground-breaking plan to lend banks up to 50 billion pounds ($99.8 billion) to help them operate during the credit squeeze. It said it would allow banks to swap mortgage-backed bonds, which have become hard to trade, for specially-issued Treasury bills. "One shouldn't be too cynical about it because we've got a very nasty credit crisis," said David Buik of Cantor Index. "This shows absolute willing. The terms strike me as being extremely sensible -- for three years makes a lot of sense." "Initially, the banks will be cynical because they have credit issues among themselves but once the ability and flexibility of the collateral is realised, it should be embraced with open arms. "Most banks will want to look at the small print and see exactly what it's all about, but I'll be very surprised if there wasn't a positive response. I'd be hopeful that, by the end of the week, LIBOR might be down by 25 basis points," Buik added. RBS dipped in and out of negative territory, and was last up 0.9 percent as it was set to announce Europe's biggest rights issue and some $10 billion of losses on investments this week. It is also considering selling assets, including a train leasing business, and possibly its insurance arm. But, with little on the UK corporate calendar, investors will look across the Atlantic as the session progresses to first-quarter earnings from Bank of America. "We've got a very quiet couple of days in terms of macro figures and they tend to tick things over... a lot of U.S. stocks are reporting and it depends what is going to come out over there -- the potential drive may come from anything more consumerist, or retail," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. Among other UK sectors, heavyweight oil shares featured as U.S. crude held below $117 a barrel. BP added 1.3 percent and rival Shell gained 1.8 percent. Shell was also boosted by a report in the Financial Times which said it has sufficient oil reserves to provide 55 years of production at current levels, citing Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer. Mining stocks rose as metal prices firmed, with BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio Tinto adding between 1.6 and 2.7 percent. ITV SETS THE PACE Among individual stocks, ITV climbed 5.3 percent after the Sunday Telegraph reported British pay-TV firm BSkyB has received expressions of interest in its stake in ITV from European broadcaster RTL and US billionaire Haim Saban. BSkyB, whose shares slipped 0.8 percent, was not immediately available for comment, while ITV declined to comment. Imperial Tobacco tacked on 1.5 percent after Citigroup raised its rating on the stock to "buy" from "hold". Persimmon added 2.3 percent after Panmure raised its rating on the housebuilder's shares to "buy" from "hold". British Energy advanced 1.1 percent after the Sunday Times reported French utility Suez is one of seven firms conducting due diligence on the British nuclear power operator and could bid. Further on the downside, Friends Provident shed 1.6 percent after US buyout group J.C. Flowers formally withdrew from its 3.5 billion pound pursuit of the UK life insurer late on Frid
