<TITLE> Lonely Planet says claims about books incorrect </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Melbourne, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guidebook publisher Lonely Planet said it is reviewing the work of one of its former authors who claimed he made up parts of books, but some of his reported claims were incorrect. Author Thomas Kohnstamm was quoted in Australian newspapers as saying he made up large sections of his books, and in one case he had not even visited the country he wrote about because he was not paid enough. But Lonely Planet, in a response published on its website, said Kohnstamm was never hired to write reviews for its Colombia guide, and was not expected to visit the country. "His contribution was to the introductory chapter covering history, culture, food and drink and environment," Lonely Planet said. The publisher said Kohnstamm did not write any reviews for the guide, but rather two on-the-ground authors. Lonely Planet said three titles were still in print to which Kohnstamm had contributed research, and authors in those countries were conducting a full review of his text. Kohnstamm, who has written a memoir "Do Travel Writers Go To Hell?" and lives in Seattle, told the Associated Press his comments to the Australian newspapers Sunday Telegraph and Herald Sun had been taken out of context. "I did not make up sections. I did not plagiarise," Kohnstamm was quoted as saying.
