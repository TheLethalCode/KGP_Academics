 Karachi, April 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh ended their Pakistan tour with an unbroken losing streak as they suffered a huge 102-run defeat to the hosts in the lone Twenty20 match at Karachi National Stadium Sunday. Bangladesh, whitewashed in the five-ODI series, ended up at 101 all out in 16 overs after Pakistan racked up a huge 203 for five in their 20 overs. Leg-spinner Mansoor Amjad claimed three wickets in just one over to force Bangladesh to end their innings with four more to go.
