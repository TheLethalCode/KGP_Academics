<TITLE> Zimbabwe begins partial recount of March 29 vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Harare, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe began a partial recount of votes from the March 29 elections on Saturday, an electoral official said, despite opposition protests and widespread fears political stalemate could erupt in violence. The recount in 23 of 210 constituencies, which is expected to last three days, could overturn the results of the parliamentary election, which showed President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF losing its majority to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change for the first time. Results of a parallel presidential election have not been released. Zimbabwe's electoral commission has said some foreign observers will be allowed to monitor the recount. There have been concerns in the West and among the opposition that Mugabe's government is planning to rig the outcome.
