 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Friday sent former secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam to jail, a day after he was arrested in connection with the Niko corruption case. Metropolitan magistrate M Emran Hossain Chowdhury of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka made the order and asked the authorities of Dhaka Central Jail to ensure Shahidul's medical treatment and a division status in line with the jail code. Shahidul's lawyers Asaduzzaman, Faez Ahmed and Shamsuzzaman appealed to the court seeking bail for him but the court did not make any order on the appeal. The lawyers also submitted medical certificates of Shahidul to the court. They argued in court that there was no specific allegation against the former secretary to the Prime Minister's Office. "Besides, he is ill," the bail appeal said. Court inspector Munshi Ruhul Quddus opposed the bail appeal. Officials of the Anticorruption Commission Thursday arrested Shahidul and handed him to Dhanmondi police. The ACC filed the case against five people including former prime minister Khaleda Zia on Dec 9, 2007. bdnews24
