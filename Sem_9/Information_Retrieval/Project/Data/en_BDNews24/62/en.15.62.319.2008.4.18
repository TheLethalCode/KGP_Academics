 JAKARTA, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's president said late on Friday that police have arrested three East Timorese in relation to attacks on East Timor's president and prime minister two months ago. East Timor's President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao were attacked in Dili on Feb. 11. Ramos-Horta was critically wounded, while Gusmao escaped unharmed. Rebel soldiers in East Timor were blamed for the attacks, but Ramos Horta, who returned to East Timor on Thursday after being treated in Australia for his wounds, said the investigation into the attacks found that the rebels had had contact with elements in Indonesia. Indonesia's President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said Indonesia's police arrested three East Timorese soldiers, Egidio Lay Carvalho, Jose Gomes, and Ismail Moniz Soares, who had entered Indonesia illegally. Details of the arrest were unclear. Yudhoyono added that East Timor should stop hinting that Indonesia was involved in the attacks as this could hurt relations between the two countries. "I also asked the government of Timor Leste to not issue statements which may seem like Indonesia is involved (in the attacks), because it can disrupt the good relationship," Yudhoyono said. East Timor gained full independence from Indonesia in 2002. As Asia's youngest nation, East Timor has been unable to achieve stability since its hard-won independence from Indonesia, despite its oil and gas resources.
