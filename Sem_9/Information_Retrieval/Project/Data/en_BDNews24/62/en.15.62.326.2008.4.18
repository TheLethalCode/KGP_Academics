 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)Religious hardliners Friday called off a public rally in the Baitul Mukarram Mosque area, a few hours before its scheduled start. Some Islamist outfits had earlier set the rally to take place after Friday prayers in protest against the women's development policy, prompting tight security around the national mosque. The decision came after the government assured them that the policy would be reviewed, said a leader of an Islamist outfit that demands changes to the policy. "We called off the rally after the government assured us of meeting our demand," Maulana Abdur Rob Yusufi, chief of Khelafat Majlish, told bdnews24.com. After a meeting at Islami Shashantantra Andolon office in Purana Paltan, Yusufi said: "We don't want violence. We believe the women's development policy should be formulated in line with the principles of the Quran." Shaikhul Hadith Azizul Haque presided over the meeting. Khelafat Majlish is one of the organisations demanding amendments to the women's development policy that prescribes equal rights to property. Azizul Haque said that they had made some recommendations and sent them to the law adviser. "I hope the government will accept our recommendations," he said. Asked if they would issue any ultimatum, he said: "We want to give the government some time. We will sit later to take a decision if the government delays implementation of our recommendations." He demanded the release of the people arrested in connection with the Baitul Mukarram clashes last Friday and withdrawal of cases against them. The government took strict measures ahead of Friday prayers at the national mosque where hardliners had earlier announced protests. Every devotee had to undergo security checks before entering the mosque for Friday prayers. Metal detectors were installed at every entrance to the mosque. In the pre-prayer sermon, khatib of the Baitul Mukarram Mufti Mohammad Nuruddin called upon all to maintain peace. "The government has given assurances to consider the matter. So there should not be any chaos," the khatib said. He said: "Islam is a religion of peace. Islam does not support hostilities. You have to be patient. You please be patient and see what the government does." Home adviser MA Matin said Thursday the government would not tolerate any activity that would violate emergency powers rules. About 200 people were injured in two-day clashes between police and bigots on April 10-11. bdnews24
