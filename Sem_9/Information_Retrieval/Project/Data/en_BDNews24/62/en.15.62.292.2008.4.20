 Narayanganj, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  The wife of a man, held in remand in a mugging case, alleged Saturday that her husband Fakir Chan, aged 28, had died after being tortured in police custody. Rahela Begum said police had arrested her husband on Apr 12 in connection with a mugging and her repeated appeals to produce her husband in court went in vain. In tears, she told reporters that she had not been able to see him once up to the time she heard he was dead and came to Narayanganj Hospital with her three children. Refuting the allegations, police said Saturday the suspect was produced in court on Apr 17 and placed in remand for four days for police questioning, during which time he collapsed and was rushed to hospital where he died. Narayanganj emergency room's Dr Choudhury Mohammad Iqbal Bahar, however, said Saturday that Fakir's dead body had been brought to the hospital after midnight Friday. The doctor added that there were suspicious markings on the body. Narayanganj police super Md Sibgatullah said Fakir was arrested on Apr 16 along with four others in connection with the Tk 10 lakh theft that took place in front of the Godnail branch of Sonali Bank on Apr 6. Sibgatullah said that on Friday Fakir had led police to the handgun used in the mugging. "After recovering the weapon, we were taking Fakir Chan back in handcuffs to the DB (Detective Branch) office for further interrogation." "But the suspect attempted to escape and fell to the ground, injuring himself," the police super claimed. Back at the DB office that night, while being questioned by police Fakir collapsed of the injuries he himself sustained while trying to flee, Sibgatullah said. "We took him to hospital, where he died," the police official said. Wife Rahela told newsmen: "On Friday night I went with food for my husband to the DB office, where he was being questioned, but was not allowed to see him or deliver the food to him." She claimed a police sub inspector demanded as a bribe. "I could not pay it. I waited till 9 at night and returned home in frustration." The dead man's brother Alam Chan, a shop owner, squarely blamed the police for torturing Fakir to death and demanded a fair inquiry. Locals said Fakir Chan was once believed to be involved in shady activities in the area. bdnews24.co
