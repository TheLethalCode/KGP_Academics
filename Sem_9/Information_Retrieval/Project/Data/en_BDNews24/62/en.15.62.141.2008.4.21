 TBILISI, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ex-Soviet Georgia on Monday accused a Russian air force jet of shooting down an unmanned Georgian reconnaissance plane in an "unprovoked act of aggression", but Moscow said the allegation was nonsense. Officials in Tbilisi released video footage they said came from the drone's on-board camera and which they said showed a Russian military MiG-29 jet launching a missile at the Georgian plane as it flew over Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region. The allegation is likely to aggravate tensions between Moscow and Tbilisi, which are locked in a standoff over Georgia's ambitions to join NATO and Moscow's support for separatist regions of Georgia. "The government of Georgia strongly condemns the unprovoked act of aggression that took place on April 20, 2008 in Georgia," the Georgian foreign ministry said in a statement. A spokesman for Russia's air force, when asked about the Georgian allegation, said: "Nonsense. What would a Russian jet fighter be doing over Georgian territory?" The video footage supplied to Reuters by Georgia's air force showed a jet aircraft banking to face the drone. A bright flash could be seen as a missile was launched and headed toward the drone. A few seconds later the screen goes blank. No identification markings are visible on the aircraft that fired the missile. "On April 20 a Russian MiG-29 fighter jet shot down an unarmed, unmanned air vehicle which was performing basic reconnaissance over Georgian territory," Colonel David Nairashvili, commander of Georgia's air force, told Reuters. "It's absolutely illegal for a Russian MiG-29 to be there," he said. DISTINCTIVE SILHOUETTE "The MiG-29 has a distinctive twin-tail marking. It's a Russian aircraft. Georgia does not possess it, nor do Abkhaz separatists," said the air force chief. Abkhazia, on the Black Sea coast, is internationally recognised as part of Georgia. It has been controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since a war in the early 1990s. Russia has peacekeeping forces in the region. Abkhazia's separatist administration said on Sunday its own forces had shot down the drone because it was violating Abkhaz air space and breaching ceasefire agreements. Georgia's pro-Western government is sensitive about any Russian involvement in the region. Tbilisi last week accused Moscow of a de facto annexation of Abkhazia, and a second breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia, after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his government to establish closer ties with the separatists. NATO -- which has angered Russia by telling Georgia it will one day become an alliance member -- urged Putin to revoke his order for closer ties. The Georgian air force said radar records showed the aircraft took off from the Gudauta base in Abkhazia, and crossed into neighbouring Russia after the attack. Georgia's foreign ministry said the presence of a Russian fighter jet at Gudauta was a violation of the 1999 Istanbul commitments, under which Moscow agreed to withdraw its military from the base. Russia's military stayed on at the base in the 1990s, in a hangover from the Soviet Union. Moscow says the only forces it now has in Abkhazia are peacekeeping troops. "The presence of fighter aircraft ... contradicts repeated statements of the Russian Federation that the base is closed. The Russian Federation has therefore begun an alarming military build-up in the conflict zone," the statement sa
