"It (the lifting of restrictions) is a convincing confirmation of Moscow's constructive policy towards Georgia, its constant striving to restore traditional, good neighbourly ties with Georgia," the ministry said in a statement. Ties between the two former Soviet states plummeted to an all-time low in late 2006 after Georgia arrested four Russian servicemen on spying charges. Moscow retaliated by cutting all rail, aviation and postal links with the country. It also imposed restrictions on issuing entry visas to the hundreds of thousands of Georgians who work in Russia.
