 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University authorities formed a six-strong committee Saturday to investigate allegations of political science department professor Hasanuzzaman's pressure on students to read his book on 'Islamic dress codes' even though it does not feature on their course's required reading list, a faculty member said. Second year political science students earlier this month demanded Hasanuzzaman's removal accusing him of promoting "fatwa teachings" by forcing them to read his book Islame Poshak: Prathomik Sutra o Shartasamuha (Islamic Dress: fundamental rules and conditions). The book states among its 'rules and conditions' that no article of Hindu dress, including teep , may be worn by Muslims. The book also condemns as anti-Islamic, the celebration of non-Muslim occasions such as Pahela Baishakh by wearing animal masks or marking Valentine's Day by giving flowers and such like"even in fun". The students alleged that Hasanuzzam forced even non-Muslim students to read his book in the second year's 'Oriental Political Thought' course although it was not mentioned on the course list. The decision to form the probe committee, headed by DU treasurer Syed Abul Kalam Azad, was made at a university syndicate meeting Saturday evening, Prof Azad told bdnews24.com. In the face of the students' allegations, the academic committee of the political science department made a recommendation on Wednesday to the acting chief of the social science faculty Prof Farid Uddin Ahmed to give Hasanuzzaman a one-year forced leave. Other members of the probe committee are: dean of social sciences Prof Harun-or-Rashid, dean of arts Prof Sadrul Amin, dean of science Prof Tajmeri SA Islam, history department professor Kazi Shahidullah and philosophy department professor Aminul Islam. bdnews24
