 LISBON, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer and Nikolay Davydenko shrugged off the rain to reach the semi-finals of the Estoril Open clay court tournament on Friday. Despite a series of unforced errors, Federer took advantage of two match interruptions caused by rain to improve his game and beat Portuguese player Frederico Gil 6-4 6-1 under the gaze of his new coach and clay court expert Jose Higueras. "Gil played an excellent set and a half," said Federer. "Thank God I could use the rain delays to improve my level of play." The 26-year-old Swiss will meet unseeded Denis Gremelmayr of Germany on Saturday. A visibly irritated and tired Davydenko struggled to overcome Frenchman Marc Gicquel's powerful baseline game 6-4 5-7 6-3 in a gruelling two and a half hour match. "I was tired and really nervous because of the weather. Every point that I missed, every easy mistake, I was feeling more crazy," said Davydenko, the world number four and a winner in Estoril in 2003. "But I was fighting until the end and I won the match." The Russian said his mental strength helped him overcome his exhaustion and the adverse weather conditions. "I think it's the biggest strength I have," said Davydenko, who won the Miami title two weeks against over world number two Rafael Nadal. He will play Florent Serra of France in Saturday's other semi-final
