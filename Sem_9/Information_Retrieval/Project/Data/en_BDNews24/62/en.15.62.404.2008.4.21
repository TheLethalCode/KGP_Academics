<TITLE> BNP unity seems far off: CEC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday doubted reconciliation between the two BNP factions. "Harmony in the BNP seems unlikely," the CEC told reporters after a meeting with the leaders of the reformist faction of the divided party at the Election Commission Secretariat. On which faction the EC would invite to electoral reforms dialogue, Huda said: "We are waiting for a copy of the court verdict. As soon as it comes, we will take a decision on it." "I hope to get the verdict copy in a day or two." Earlier, 54 former lawmakers led by BNP chairperson's adviser Mofazzal Karim sent a letter to the CEC requesting him to invite acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, nominated by the standing committee, known as the reformist faction. The previous day, five members of the other BNP faction sent a letter to the CEC requesting that Khandaker Delwar Hossain be invited to the electoral reforms dialogue as the party's "legal secretary general". The commission invited Hafizuddin to reforms dialogue last year, but BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia filed a writ petition challenging the letter. The court on Apr 10 delivered a verdict in favour of Hafizuddin. The EC had earlier wrapped up two rounds of talks with the political parties except for the BNP. The EC on Apr 16 invited both factions of the BNP to separate meetings. In its letter, the EC described Delwar and Hafizuddin only as 'BNP leaders', but did not address them as secretaries general, acting or otherwise. The talks were meant to find ways to ease the deadlock over the EC's planned dialogue with the BNP that had stalled the process of finalising election reforms laws. The CEC said at the time: "The two factions will have to join dialogue united. The commission does not wish to see two factions." bdnews24.
