 Yala, Thailand, April 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb hidden in a rubbish bin exploded in a busy market in Thailand's rebellious Muslim south on Sunday, wounding seven people, police said. The bomb, weighing 3-5 kgs (6-11 lbs), exploded near the street market in Yala province, one of the three southmost provinces where than 2,300 people have been killed in a separatist insurgency that erupted in January 2004. The blast also destroyed the fronts of nearby houses, police said. Four officers were among those injured and taken to hospital. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks in the region, where most people speak a Malay dialect and where the government has stationed several thousand troops in a so far unsuccessful attempt to quell the unrest.
