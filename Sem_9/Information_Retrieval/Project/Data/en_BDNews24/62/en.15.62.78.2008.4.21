 ISLAMABAD, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's army test-fired a long-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile on Monday, the military said, the second test since the weekend. The launch marked the culmination of a field training exercise for the Hatf-VI (Shaheen-II), which included a test firing on Saturday. "It validated the operational readiness of a strategic missile group equipped with (the) Shaheen-II missile," the military said in a statement, referring to Monday's test. The missile, with a range of 2000 km (1,200 miles), is a two-stage solid fuel weapon which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, the military said. Nuclear-armed Pakistan and India routinely carry out missile tests despite a peace process they launched in early 2004. The South Asian neighbours, who conducted tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests in 1998, inform each other of missile tests in advance. Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee is due to visit Pakistan next month for a review of the peace process. Pakistan and India have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, and came close to a fourth in 2002
