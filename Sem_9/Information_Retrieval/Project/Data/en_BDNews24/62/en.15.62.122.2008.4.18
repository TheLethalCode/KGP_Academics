 DAMASCUS, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter met Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Damascus on Friday for talks expected to focus on ways to include the Islamist group in efforts for Palestinian-Israeli peace. A Hamas official said high-level Hamas members also attended the meeting, which started at 1430 GMT at the group's headquarters in the Syrian capital. A source familiar with the meeting said Carter would also raise with Meshaal the fate of an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas.
