 London, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland is considering a multi-billion-pounds rights issue that could spark a wave of similar moves by other banks, newspapers said on Friday. The Daily Telegraph cited unnamed City sources as saying Britain's second-biggest bank was in the advanced stages of planning a rights issue that analysts believe will be for at least 5 billion pounds ($10 billion). The Financial Times cited people familiar with the matter as saying a rights issue was one of a number of options being considered by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). RBS said it noted speculation about a "possible rights issue," but said only that "RBS confirms that its Interim Management Statement covering trading performance and capital will be made next week." The statement is due on Wednesday. A rights issue would represent an about-turn from RBS, which has previously insisted it did not need to raise more capital, and could put pressure on Chief Executive Fred Goodwin to go. The Daily Telegraph said the move was believed to have been prompted by further subprime provisions on top of the 2.4 billion pounds already reported and government pressure for banks to strengthen their balance sheets in return for an offer of much-needed liquidity. A source close to the situation told Reuters on Thursday that the government and Bank of England are working on a plan to allow banks to temporarily swap mortgage-based securities for government bonds that could be announced as soon as next week. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are arranging the RBS rights issue, the Daily Telegraph said. RBS's balance sheet has been stretched by its leading role in the 71 billion euro ($113.3 billion) takeover and break-up of Dutch bank ABN Am
