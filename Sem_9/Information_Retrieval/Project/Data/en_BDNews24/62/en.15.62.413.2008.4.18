 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  Police rearrested former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury in Panthapath area Friday, hours after he was freed on bail in the barge-mounted power plant case, a police officer said. Tejgaon police rearrested him on charges of making an anti-government statement after his release from Dhaka Central Jail. Tejgaon police chief Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com that police had arrested Chowdhury as he assembled people in Panthapath area and spoke against the government. He was taken to court. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of prisons, told bdnews24.com that Chowdhury had been freed in the morning but the court sent him back to jail later in the day after his arrest at 10am. Chowdhury, the former power secretary, is an accused in the much-talked-about barge-mounted power plant scam case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and seven others. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year. bdnews
