 JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of members of South Africa's powerful labour federation Cosatu marched through the country's business hub Johannesburg on Thursday, to protest against higher food and electricity prices. Around 5,000 members of Cosatu marched from central Johannesburg to state power utility Eskom [ESC.UL] and retailer Pick n Pay's offices in the suburb of Braamfontein. Protesters danced through the streets, carrying placards reading "We call for a moratorium on the increase of food prices" and "The cost of power cuts must not be borne by the poorest in society." Cosatu, which represents more than a million workers in key sectors including mining and manufacturing, has warned that anger over soaring food prices could lead to disturbances like those in Haiti, Cameroon, Niger and Burkina Fasso. Rice prices on world markets have climbed some 75 percent in about two months and the cost of wheat has rocketed by 120 percent in the past year. The price of maize, an African staple, has more than doubled since the beginning of 2006. South Africa's food price inflation accelerated to 14.1 percent in February, helping to drive overall inflation to a 5-year high that has prompted a series of interest rate hikes. Electricity prices in Africa's biggest economy are also set to rise as the country struggles with an ongoing power crisis which has forced Eskom to implement nationwide power cuts. Eskom has said electricity prices need to double in the next two years and the government has backed the utility's bid to increase electricity prices by 53 percent this year.
