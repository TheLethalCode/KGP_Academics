<TITLE> Eurostar train reaches Paris 10 hours late </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Eurostar train from London to Paris arrived in the French capital on Saturday almost 10 hours late after passengers were forced to change trains twice during an overnight journey that normally takes just over two hours. "There was a whole series of technical problems and mix-ups but the situation is completely unacceptable," Mireille Faugere, director of passenger services for French rail operator SNCF told a small crowd of reporters waiting for the train to arrive at the Gare du Nord in Paris. She said an inquiry had been ordered to identify the causes. After an initial technical problem forced some 640 passengers to change trains in the northern town of Lille at around 11:00 p.m., a second breakdown in the replacement train left them stranded in the middle of the countryside north of Paris. "They didn't say anything for hours and eventually the police turned up and said 'right everyone off'," said Jonathan Childs from London. "We had to walk all the way through in the pitch black, then off that train, along the tracks onto the next train and all the way through that. So, you can imagine, it was a long night." When the Eurostar finally pulled into the station at around 9:15 a.m., almost 10 hours after its scheduled time, passengers were greeted by rail staff offering compensation vouchers and breakfast. Many laughed at the novelty of being greeted by a crowd of reporters and cameramen but others were less amused. "It's pathetic but it's symptomatic of the situation in France at the moment. It's incapable of taking care of even an ordinary situation like this," said one French passenger, too exasperated to give his name.
