<TITLE> Drop in Dhaka groundwater hikes landslide risks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  The groundwater level in Dhaka is dipping because of a massive extraction of water from underground, according to a recent study. Experts said that the groundwater level was declining by up to three metres every year, posing a threat of landslide. According to a report, "The declining groundwater level and aquifer dewatering in Dhaka metropolitan area, Bangladesh: causes and quantification," the contribution of the aquifer storage to abstraction was estimated to be more than 15 percent in 2002. The extraction caused a sharp drop leading to two cones of depression in water level, the study says. Upper parts of the aquifer are already dewatered throughout the area, except for swathes of northeast and southeast corners. MA Haque of the Department of Petroleum and Geo Resources Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, M Mozammel Hoque of the Institute of Water and Flood Management of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed of the Department of Geology of Dhaka University conducted the study. About 4.1 crore cubic metres of the aquifer dewatered until 1988, which increased to 227.2 crore cubic metres in 2002. Speaking to bdnews24.com Friday, Matin said: "The groundwater level was declining at an alarming rate. Dewatering was spreading to neighbouring areas too." Dewatering widened by 55 times in 20 years. Matin stressed increasing the use of surface water to cut pressure on groundwater. Information available on the website of the Water and Sewerage Authority for Dhaka shows that up to 180 crore litres of water is pumped out in Dhaka and Narayanganj a day. Demand for water is even higher. Rayhanul Abedin, managing director of the Dhaka WASA, told bdnews24.com that 86 percent of the water or 152 crore litres is groundwater. He said that the use of surface water had begun and hoped that up 100 crore litres of surface water would be supplied a day by 2015. MA Karim, director of the Water Development Board, said the board had 1,250 deep tubewells in the country for observation. There are a total of 11 lakh shallow tubewells across the country. He said water was not available at some points in Dhaka in the dry season. bdnews
