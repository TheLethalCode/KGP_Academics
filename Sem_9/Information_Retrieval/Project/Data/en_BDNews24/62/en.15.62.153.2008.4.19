<TITLE> No scope to disclose undeclared income in next budget: Mirza Aziz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Khulna, April 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam warned on Saturday that there would be no scope in the upcoming budget for disclosing previously undeclared income as there was in the previous budget. "There will not be provisions to whiten legal but undeclared earnings," the adviser told a pre-budget discussion at Khulna Circuit House, adding that the government would make it much harder to evade tax in the future. "If anyone fails to pay their tax on time they will have to pay the tax and face an additional fine in the future." On a separate issue, Azizul said the upcoming budget would be regionally balanced and avoid disparities in development activities throughout the country. "However, it is not possible for the government to solve long-standing problems within one or two budgets," Azizul said. The adviser observed that it was essential to revive Khulna's economy in the face of continued stagnation, saying that the situation would be considered sympathetically although Khulna's dependence on state funds had to be reduced. He pointed to the injection of $950 million in funds earmarked for the construction of the Padma Bridge. "The rest of the required money will have to be collected from internal sources," he said. Earlier, organisations from the Khulna area outlined a series of demands to the finance adviser including improved gas supply and building an airport for the divisional city. Further demands called for strengthening the tourist sector in the region, with a particular eye on the Sundarbans, a World Heritage site, setting up a modern rail station and building a new children's hospital in the city. bdnews24.c
