 BISSAU, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senegal and Guinea-Bissau signed a fisheries deal late on Friday in a bid to present a united front to the European Union, whose trawlers are blamed for decimating West African fish stocks. The accord allows Senegalese fishermen to work in Guinea-Bissau's waters under license, providing the government in Bissau with much needed cash and allowing the two countries more control over the sustainability of fish stocks. "Fishing is a vital sector which for years, in Senegal as in other countries, has been worrying as we see our stocks being depleted," Senegalese Fisheries Minister Souleymane Ndene Ndiaye said after meeting his Gambian and Bissau-Guinean counterparts. "We've agreed together ... to hold a meeting of our heads of state so that we can form a common base for negotiations and stand up to the European Union bloc," he told reporters in Guinea-Bissau's capital Bissau. Countries along West Africa's coast sign fishing deals with the European Union every few years allowing hundreds of vessels into their waters, many of them able to process fish at sea before taking it off to consumers back in Europe. Local fishermen's canoe-like boats and simple nets, mostly operating close to the coastline, are no match for the sophisticated vessels and they complain that the foreign trawlers do not respect their regulated zones, coming too close to the shore and effectively stealing their livelihoods. Senegal, like other countries in impoverished West Africa and around the world, is already suffering from high prices for other food including rice, maize, manioc and cereals, driven by poor harvests, record fuel prices and tight global supply. Ndiaye said other forms of co-operation would also be included in the deal, such as maritime security, of vital importance in waters which carry boatloads of illegal immigrants bound for Europe and drugs arriving from Latin America.
