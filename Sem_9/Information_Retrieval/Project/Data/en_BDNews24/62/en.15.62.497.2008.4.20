 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)The trade deficit in the first eight months of the current fiscal year stands at Tk 25,600 crore, Tk 2,126 crore over last year's total deficit, according to Bangladesh Bank figures. The government has decided to take $ 220 million or Tk 1,518 crore in loans from the International Monetary Fund to cope with the deficit. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam blamed the rising trade deficit on the global price hikes in oil, food and other commodities in the international market. Azizul Islam told bdnews24.com Saturday: "A barrel of fuel cost $62 dollar in April last year. Since then, fuel price has almost doubled in one year to $115 a barrel." "Besides, prices of all imported commodities, including rice, wheat and edible oil, went up." "We had to import large quantities of rice as floods and cyclone Sidr wreaked havoc," the adviser said. He stressed that the export income also rose, however. According to Bangladesh Bank and the Export Promotion Bureau statistics, the country imported commodities worth Tk 87,000 crore in eight months and exported goods worth Tk 61,617 crore. Central bank figures show a trade deficit of Tk 23,474 crore for fiscal 2006-07 and Tk 19,941 crore for fiscal 2005-06. Bangladesh spent $ 1.48 billion in imports in the first month of the current fiscal and $ 1.68 billion in February. Import spending rose to $ 1.99 billion in March. It could not be known how much money came in export earnings in the month. But the import income marked a rise during the period. Export income in the eight months was $ 8.93 billion, 11.33 percent up from $ 8.02 billion of the first eight months of last fiscal year. The finance adviser hoped the trade deficit would decrease over the rest of the year. bdnews
