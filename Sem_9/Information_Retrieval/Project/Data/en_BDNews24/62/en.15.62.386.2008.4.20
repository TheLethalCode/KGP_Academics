<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman said Sunday his party would not participate in the upcoming election if it were held under the state of emergency. "Holding election is not possible keeping the Awami League president in jail," he said, speaking to reporters at his Gulshan home. On whether the government has given any assurance regarding the former prime minister's freedom, Zillur said: "There is no specific assurance. However, the discussion is on." When reporters asked whether Awami League would go to election under the state of emergency he replied: "No, we will not." Asked further whether the party was saying it would boycott the election out of fear that Hasina might be convicted, the AL leader said: "As a lawyer I can say that the case against the party president is no case at all. It is a baseless case." Regarding uncertainty over the holding of elections, Zillur said: "Doubts have crossed our mind. The government spoke of three months, but has been in power for one and a half years. Now who can believe whom?" When asked whether the party would sit in formal dialogue with the government without Hasina's release, he said: "It will be decided at the presidium meeting after discussion." The acting party president said Sunday's presidium meeting had been suspended due to an eye ailment of acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. He also told reporters a decision would be taken within a week as to when the countrywide hunger strike programme for AL chief Sheikh Hasina's release would be held. "Before that Awami League's district level presidents and general secretaries will be called to Dhaka and consulted." bdnews24.
