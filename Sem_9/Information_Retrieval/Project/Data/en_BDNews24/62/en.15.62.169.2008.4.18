<TITLE> Oil buyers and sellers to talk, not act on $115 oil </TITLE>

 ROME, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sky-high oil prices and a bruised world economy ought to focus minds, but there is little prospect some 60 energy ministers meeting from Sunday will agree any meaningful action to control fuel costs. Representatives of producer and consumer countries meet every two years at the International Energy Forum. They include members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps about a third of the world's oil. Previous events have been dismissed as a talking shop and few expect the 2008 talks to be any different. "Dialogue is a misnomer," said Sadad al-Husseini, a former top executive at state-run Saudi Aramco. "What producers and consumers need is a coordinated energy strategy. That requires intense negotiations and it hasn't happened because of their different economic and geopolitical agendas." So far, energy's buyers and sellers have tended to blame each other for oil's run to records above $115 a barrel. Consumers have called for more oil, while OPEC has made clear it will not review output at the Sunday to Tuesday talks. "I'm not going to dump crude on the market," OPEC's leading oil minister Ali al-Naimi of Saudi Arabia said this month. "In my perspective, the market is well-supplied." At previous IEF meetings, as in Amsterdam in 2004, when oil prices were only around two years into the current bull run, OPEC voiced concern about the damage expensive oil could do. Since then, the global economy has faltered, but bad debt and a credit squeeze, rather than expensive fuel, are at the root of the economic malaise. OPEC ministers have argued the U.S. slowdown has helped to drive oil prices because it has pushed the dollar to record lows against major currencies, making dollar-denominated oil attractive as an inflation hedge. "What's happening in the oil market is due to the mismanagement of the U.S. economy, which is probably affecting the rest of the world," OPEC President Chakib Khelil said at the group's last formal meeting in March. Although originally expected to speak at the IEF, Khelil is no longer scheduled to attend. U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman, representative of the world's biggest consumer, will also stay away, sources said. POSTURING The United States, which faces presidential elections later this year as well as economic slowdown, has been at the forefront of the clamour for crude. Many analysts dismiss the cries as empty political gestures. In any case, OPEC has little room for manoeuvre. "My view is OPEC is producing as much as they can give or take a couple of million barrels.... The underlying issue is they don't have a lot of spare capacity," said Hussein Allidina of Morgan Stanley. Equally, OPEC's call for consumers to regulate markets that it says are driven by speculation is a red herring. A weak U.S. dollar could have lured some new money, but Allidina said prices were supported by strong fundamentals and would stay high, citing oil contracts for delivery as far out as 2016 that are valued at well over $100. "In the short term, speculators have an influence, but in any period longer than the short term, fundamentals must prevail," said Allidina. "If the price of a commodity is trading above its theoretical fair value, producers will have an incentive to produce and consumers will have an incentive to reduce their consumption. Net, we would see inventories building." While some consumers have curbed demand, there is little evidence of rising supply and regardless of any U.S. recession, emerging economies, led by China and India, are expected to continue to use huge amounts of oil. "Consumers in emerging markets generally are protected by subsidised prices -- the cries of pain from governments are not as loud as you would expect," said Mike Wittner of Societe Generale. In theory, costly oil should help to bring on new production, which eventually could soften prices. But a far-reaching rally on commodities, such as steel, together with a tight labour market, has forced up project costs and shifted the balance of power further away from consumers. They have also thrown the spotlight on alternative energy sources, including biofuels, although conventional oil in many cases remains the most viable solution. Representatives of major oil companies, who will also attend the Rome talks, will have little bargaining power if they seek to gain access to untapped reserves of gas and oil. "No, it won't be a dialogue," said John Mitchell of think-tank Chatham House. "The differences are too bi
