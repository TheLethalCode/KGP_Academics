 JERUSALEM, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel has agreed to a Palestinian request to reopen 20 police stations in the occupied West Bank as part of a security drive aimed at bolstering US-sponsored peace negotiations, officials said on Friday. But in a separate move reflecting continued disputes over the contours of any final accord, Israel drew protests from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's administration by announcing plans to build new homes in Jewish settlements. Abbas revived peace talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after losing control of the Gaza Strip to rival Hamas Islamists last year, and, with international help, has been trying to prove his ability to rein in West Bank militants. Progress has been slow. Palestinians blame Israeli army raids and checkpoints in the West Bank, as well as Israel's hold-up of some security equipment supplied by European and Arab donors. Israel says it is exercising caution because of threats to its own security. Senior Palestinian civil affairs official Hussein al-Sheikh said he secured Israeli agreement to reopen 20 police stations which were abandoned after clashes erupted in September 2000. "This aims to enhance security and impose law and order under the Abbas security plan," al-Sheikh told Reuters. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Ministry's civil affairs wing, said officials from both sides would begin meeting next week to schedule the reopenings. The stations would eventually be staffed by 500 new police personnel, Lerner added. The stations are located in areas of the West Bank where, under 1993 interim peace accords, Israel retains the right to deploy troops against suspected militants. Lerner said the new police forces would be expected to focus on crime-fighting. Israeli troops killed a militant from al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed wing of Abbas's Fatah faction, near the West Bank city of Nablus on Friday. Another militant was arrested. U.S. PRESSURE Under U.S. pressure to push along talks in hope of achieving some kind of accord on Palestinian statehood before President George W. Bush leaves office next January, Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak has eased some West Bank restrictions. Dozens of military roadblocks have been removed, though hundreds remain. Some security equipment, such as armoured cars, has been allowed through. Another Palestinian grievance has been the continued growth of Jewish settlements in the West Bank in defiance of a 2003 peace "road map" which demands such construction ceases. The road map also requires a crackdown on Palestinian militants. Israel's Housing Ministry published a tender on Friday inviting bids for construction of 48 homes in Ariel, a major West Bank settlement, and 52 homes in nearby Elkana settlement. "We condemn these plans and resolutions, which really undermine the peace process," said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, adding that Abbas would discuss the issue during White House talks with Bush next week. Olmert has vowed Israel will hold on to West Bank settlement blocs, including Ariel and Elkana, under any future peace deal. His government argues that this warrants the continued building of homes within the settlement blocs, though US officials have consistently demanded a freeze. "The current government never undertook not to build within settlement blocs," Israeli Housing Minister Zeev Boim said. Bush signalled tacit US consent in 2004 to Israel's proposed annexation of settlement blocs, calling them "new realities on the ground" that had to be taken into consideration when drawing the border of a future Palestinian state. Olmert, a centrist, is under pressure from nationalist members of his coalition government to keep up construction in West Bank settlements. But Israel Radio reported that the tenders could be challenged by the centre-left Labour party, Olmert's biggest coalition partner, given concern they undermined peace tal
