 PORTO ROTONDO, Sardinia, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's Vladimir Putin visited Italian prime minister-elect Silvio Berlusconi at his luxury villa in Sardinia on Thursday for a meeting likely to touch on energy and Alitalia. The Russian president, who quits on May 7 to become prime minister under his protege Dimitry Medvedev, was the first foreign leader to meet Berlusconi after the media mogul won the election on Sunday and Monday for a third term as premier. "Putin's visit underlines the importance of our relationship, which has never been interrupted; a very important rapport, if you consider that 30 percent of the gas and oil we import is Russian," Berlusconi said ahead of their meeting. "We have good chances of cooperating in projects with Russia via Enel, Eni and other companies," he said. The pair forged a warm relationship during Berlusconi's last term in office from 2001-2006, when his focus on Russia, Israel and the United States isolated Italy within the European Union. Trade also flourished under centre-left leader Romano Prodi, who beat Berlusconi in the 2006 election but quit in January. He and Putin oversaw a major strategic partnership in 2006 in oil and gas between Gazprom and Eni. The two leaders were scheduled to have dinner together at Berlusconi's Villa Certosa on the Costa Esmeralda, where he has built an artificial volcano to entertain his guests, and to talk to reporters on Friday at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT). "We'll talk about relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation and the contrasts and differences with the West," said Berlusconi. "We'll also discuss the development of Russia, which has reached 10th place in the world economy." A Gazprom source said the Russian firm was considering assets in Libya in its swap deal with Eni. The source gave no details but Eni owns a number of energy assets in Libya. Putin arrived in Sardinia straight from a short visit to Libya to discuss energy and arms. Putin's visit has raised speculation that Berlusconi might seek his help in reviving Aeroflot's interest in the loss-making airline Alitalia, following local unions' rejection of a takeover offer by Air France-KLM. Aeroflot had shown interest in the Italian government's 49.9 percent stake in the flag carrier, but withdrew last year. It has since expressed interest in buying European airlines. Italian papers quoted Aeroflot executive Lev Koshlyakov as saying the Russian airline could consider taking part in a bid for Alitalia "with new bidding terms and a new proposal". Berlusconi, asked by reporters whether he would broach the subject of Alitaia and Aeroflot with Putin, said only: "There is no fixed agenda, it will be a relaxed meeting." Asked if Aeroflot could rescue the airline, Berlusconi said: "All options remain open as long as Alitalia remains a national carrier and the decisions are taken in Italy." Berlusconi had opposed the Air France-KLM bid, saying the airline should stay in Italian hands. He has repeatedly talked of a home-grown rescue bid but no such offer has yet emerged. But since the election, his stance seems to have softened. He said he would be happy to speak to French President Nicolas Sarkozy if a deal with Air France-KLM guaranteed "equal dignity" for the airlines. The media tycoon said on Wednesday he had coined the new slogan for the airline: "I love Italy, I fly Alitalia". He arrived in Sardinia on his personal jet with the logo of his holding company Fininvest on the tail, accompanied by his favourite Neapolitan singer carrying a guitar. Putin stayed at the villa in 2003, and his two daughters have holidayed there. Other foreign leaders to have stayed there include former British premier Tony Blair.
