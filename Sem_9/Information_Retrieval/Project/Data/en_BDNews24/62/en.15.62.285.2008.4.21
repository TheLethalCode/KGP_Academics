 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League front organisations said Monday that AL chief Sheikh Hasina's freedom could only be ensured through widespread protest programmes. "No member of any AL front organisation believes that Hasina will gain her freedom through legal battle," Krishak League president Mirza Abdul Jalil told bdnews24.com, after a meeting at the AL office on Bangabandhu Avenue. "We think the freedom of our leader is possible only through protest movements, and for that we have asked AL to announce such a programme," said Jalil, who presided over the meeting. Leaders of the AL-associated organisations including Krishak League, Jubo League, Swechchhasebok League, Bangladesh Chhatra League, Mohila League, Sromik League, Jubo Mohila League and Tanti League gathered at the meeting. "We hope AL will break its silence to announce new moves for the release of our leader," the Krishak League president said. "We also hope the dialogue with the government will be held under her leadership after her release." "AL said it had decided on a mass hunger protest for Sheikh Hasina's release. We, the associate organisations, hope it will be announced shortly," he added. bdnews
