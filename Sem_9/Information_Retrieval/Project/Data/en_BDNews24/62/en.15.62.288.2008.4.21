 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)  Sixty candidates from two groups Sunday submitted their nominations for 21 posts in the Bangladesh Football Federation's election, scheduled for April 28. Sammilito Parisad, headed by retired Major-General Amin Ahmed Chowdhury, submitted their nominations at the same time as their unnamed rival group, led by legendary footballer Kazi Salahuddin. However, the final shape of both panels will not be known until Tuesday, when extra nominations from both groups will be withdrawn. Sammilito Parisad has almost settled on six key nominations: for president, senior vice president and four vice presidents. Meanwhile, the 'Salahuddin Parisad' is yet to select its nominations for four vice presidents. Amin Ahmed will fight for the president's post, while his colleague and former footballer Salam Murshidi will contest for senior vice president beside Badal Roy, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Nurul Alam Chowdhury, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir and Anwar Hossain Ujjal, who will stand as vice presidents candidates. However, reports claim the immediate-past BFF joint secretary, Anwar Hossain Ujjal, is unlikely to contest in the election on personal grounds. Meanwhile, Salahuddin and Monir Ahmed will be fight for the president and vice president posts, although they remain in trouble deciding on the four vice presidents. Six vice president candidates remain in the field: Anwarul Haq Helal, Golam Rasul Mollah, Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu, Manzoor Hossain Malu, Sirajul Islam Bachchu and Abdur Rahim. Except for Golam Rasul Mollah, the other five vice president candidates have submitted their nominations for the general member along with the vice presidents. Both groups have negotiated the representatives from the District and Divisional Football Associations to keep a major part of the member posts for them. bd
