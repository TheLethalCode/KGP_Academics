 NEW YORK, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks dipped on Monday, following the Dow's best week in two months, dragged down by bank stocks after disappointing results from Bank of America Corp and National City Corp. Bank of America, the second-largest US bank, said first-quarter profit fell 77 percent, hurt by write-downs and rising credit losses, sending its shares down 2.2 percent to $37.73. Adding to the negative tone, the bank's chief executive said U.S. economic growth is expected to be minimal at best in the second quarter. Also hurting financial stocks, shares of National City, a large US Midwest regional bank, sank 24.4 percent to $6.30 after it posted a quarterly loss and reduced its dividend. Earnings disappointments were not limited to the financial sector. Eli Lilly and Co posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings, due to disappointing sales of its Byetta diabetes drug, sending its shares down 3.8 percent to $50.10. "The markets have had a pretty good run, but we are going through the healing process, and we need patience," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut. "But what we really need to see is the financial companies leading the market higher." The Dow Jones industrial average was down 47.47 points, or 0.37 percent, at 12,801.89. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 4.64 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,385.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.95 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,400.02. The trend of commodities companies doing well continued, however, keeping stock indexes' losses in check. Arch Coal Inc posted a jump in first-quarter profit thanks to strong demand and higher prices. Arch Coal shares rose 4.4 percent to $60.95. Energy companies gained as the price of crude hit another intraday record of $117.60 per barrel. Schlumberger shares rose 1.9 percent to $103.78. In other earnings news, Mattel Inc, the largest US toy company, posted a quarterly loss on Monday, hurt by lower sales of its Fisher-Price products and by legal expenses and higher costs. Shares fell 7.25 percent to $20.20. But Hasbro Inc, the second-largest US toy company, posted a higher quarterly profit, helped by strong demand for its Transformers and Littlest Pet Shop lines. Hasbro's shares rose 8.9 percent to $34.
