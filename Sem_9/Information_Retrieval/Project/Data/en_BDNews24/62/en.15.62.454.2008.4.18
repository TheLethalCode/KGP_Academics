 HARARE, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of cheering supporters gave President Robert Mugabe a rousing welcome on Friday at his first major public appearance since a controversial election three weeks ago. About 15,000 people, many wearing T-shirts decorated with Mugabe's portrait, packed into a sports stadium in Highfield township on the outskirts of Harare in a celebration of independence from Britain 28 years ago. Mugabe is under heavy international pressure to release the result of a presidential election on March 29, which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says it won, ending the veteran leader's long rule. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party lost control of parliament for the first time in the election, but no results have been issued yet for the presidential poll. A partial recount of both votes is scheduled for Saturday. After a few days when he seemed badly wounded by the election, Mugabe -- backed by his military and hardliners in the cabinet -- has returned to his normal defiant self. The MDC accuses him of ordering militia violence around the country to intimidate the opposition and ensure victory in an expected runoff against his rival Morgan Tsvangirai. Mugabe's loyal police and military paraded in the small Gwanzura stadium in Highfield, a restive opposition stronghold. Large posters denounced the opposition and Britain. "Zimbabwe no place for sell-out," and "Defending our land from imperialists", the posters said. One poster mocked British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and echoed Mugabe's recent jibe calling him a "dot" in the world. Dancers in traditional loin cloths and feather hats danced and sang while songs dating from the liberation war led by Mugabe blared from large speakers. CARNIVAL ATMOSPHERE The carnival atmosphere contrasted with the poverty outside the stadium where the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy has forced residents to contend with shortages of water, food and electricity as well as piles of uncollected garbage. Security forces have patrolled the city's poor townships since the elections to head off any trouble. Both U.S. President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Thursday called for more action from Africa to end the post-election deadlock in Zimbabwe, which has stoked fears of major violence. "More leaders in the region need to speak out and the United Nations and the AU (African Union) must play an active role in resolving the situation in Zimbabwe," Bush told reporters after meeting Brown in Washington. African reaction has been subdued to events in Zimbabwe, although regional leaders called last weekend for the outcome to be announced quickly. The continent has largely taken its cue from South African President Thabo Mbeki, who has been criticised both at home and abroad for insisting on a softly softly diplomatic approach to Mugabe, despite the catastrophic collapse of Zimbabwe's economy. Zimbabwe's economy is in ruins, with hyper-inflation, shortages of food and fuel and 80 percent unemployment. Millions of people have fled to South Africa. The Zimbabwean leader, 84, has accused the MDC of being a puppet of Britain. He warned on Thursday that imperialist forces were infiltrating the country and that it was in danger of being re-colonised. "As long as I am still on this earth, as long as I am still breathing, the country shall never be a colony again. Never shall this country be a British colony again," Mugabe said. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has called for Mbeki to be sacked as chief regional mediator on Zimbabwe and make way for a new initiative. The MDC said on Thursday hundreds of supporters had been seriously injured in attacks by ZANU-PF since the electi
