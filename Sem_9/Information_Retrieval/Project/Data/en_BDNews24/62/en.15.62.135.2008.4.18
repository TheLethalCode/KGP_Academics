 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)--Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Friday that there was a clear lack of professional management practice in Bangladeshi corporations. "In this highly competitive global environment, there is no alternative to professional management practices to bring about competitiveness in our endeavours," the adviser said in his speech as the chief guest at the inaugural ceremony of Alumni Day 2008 of the IBA (Institute of Business Administration) Alumni Association. Aziz asked the country's top business school alumni to be committed to bringing about a fundamental change in the Bangladeshi corporate arena. "Most of the enterprises of this country started as family businesses and till this day they operate like that, which is a major hindrance to competitiveness. I would ask IBA graduates to work for developing the corporate culture," he said. The adviser asked them to address areas like human resources development, efficiency in manufacturing and service delivery and corporate social responsibility. Speaking on corporate social responsibility, Mirza Aziz cited a recent incident of some business leaders asking to provide their workers rations. "Now the government cannot be discriminatory to provide rations to industry workers only. What I failed to understand was their reluctance to provide rations to workers from their profits," he said. IBA Alumni Association (IBAA) gave away scholarships to five IBA students and as many awards for distinguished work in an attempt to recognise outstanding contributions in the business and management arena. IBAA awarded Prof M Alimullah Miyan, vice chancellor of IUBAT, in management education, Waliur Rahman Bhuiyan, MD of BOC Bangladesh in corporate management, Salim Akhter Khan, chairman of Asset Development, in entrepreneurship, Fazlul Hoque, BKMEA president, in business development and Standard Chartered as the best employer of IBA graduates. IBA director Muhammad Ziaul Haq Mamun, IBAA president Syed Abu Naser Bukhtear Ahmed and Rafiqul Islam, general secretary of the association also spoke. bdn
