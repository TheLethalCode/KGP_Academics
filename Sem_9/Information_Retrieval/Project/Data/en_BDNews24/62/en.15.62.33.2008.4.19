 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has been readmitted to Square Hospital, officials said Saturday. Head of the hospital's physicians' panel Prof Sanwar Hossain told bdnews24.com: "After her check up this morning, it was found that Sheikh Hasina's blood pressure was fluctuating." "She was readmitted to the hospital around noon," Prof Sanwar said. Hasina was taken to the hospital from special jail in the morning for a routine check-up, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said. Emerging from the hospital, Siddiqui told reporters: "Hasina underwent a number of medical tests, particularly ear tests. She has been kept at the hospital for observation by the suggestion of doctors." Hasina might be taken back to special jail today if doctors say, Siddiqui added. The AL president's personal assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud rushed to the hospital hearing that she had been readmitted. "Authorities are dragging her to and from the the special jail and hospital," he told reporters. Mahmud demanded Hasina be released for her proper treatment. The former prime minister and Awami League president was previously admitted to Square Hospital on Mar 11 and discharged on Mar 30. She was last taken to the hospital for a check-up on Apr 13. AL leaders have been demanding that the government send their party chief abroad for proper medical treatment, claiming Square Hospital's treatment has not been effective. Home affairs adviser MA Matin told reporters Thursday the government did not have any such plan to send Hasina abroad. The detained former prime minister was arrested on July 16 last year. She is facing a number of graft charges pending trial. Hasina appeared in court on Apr 15 to face charges in a graft case involving awarding of 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. The proceedings were adjourned for two days after she fell ill in court. The hearing on charge framing is set to resume on Apr 21. bdnews24.co
