 KOLKATA, India, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strike over rising prices shut schools, offices and businesses in eastern India on Monday as nationwide protests against inflation continued, police said. Protesters stopped trains by throwing banana leaves on overhead wires and blocked roads in West Bengal's state capital, Kolkata, as a dawn-to-dusk strike called by the state's main opposition party took hold, witnesses and police said.
