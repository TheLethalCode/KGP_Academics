<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)Police have wrapped up the investigation into the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack and a charge sheet is soon to be submitted, said a top home ministry official Monday following a meeting of the ministry's sensational cases monitoring cell. "The charge sheet in the case will be submitted after thoroughly scrutinising the investigation report on the August 21 grenade attack," additional home secretary Sheikh Abdur Rashid told reporters after the meeting. "Another 10 cases have been included for scrutiny by the monitoring cell in its 59th meeting today," he said. "The cases to be included in the next meeting have also been identified." "Of the 13 cases included for monitoring in the previous meeting of the cell, charge sheet have been submitted in five and investigation into the other eight is still ongoing." The last meeting of the monitoring cell was held on Feb 28. Asked to name some other 'sensational cases', Rashid said: "The Banani twin murders, death of an accused in DB custody and some other sensational cases may be included for monitoring under the purview of the cell." At the meeting, the police officers expressed their disappointment over trial of cases in general and raised a number of related issues before the additional secretary. For example, they said, after officers make efforts in investigating and processing the cases appeal courts do not usually uphold the judgments delivered in the lower courts. The additional secretary assured the police officers that the law would proceed along its true course. He, however, directed the police officers present to be rigorous and stringent in their investigations. Presided over by the home affairs adviser, Monday's meeting was attended by the home secretary, additional home secretary, Detective Branch, RAB and police officials. bdnews24.com/a
