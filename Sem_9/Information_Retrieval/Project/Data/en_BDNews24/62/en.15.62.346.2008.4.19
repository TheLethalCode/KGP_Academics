 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com) - Women leaders and leftist parties have come down hard against recommendations by a committee of Islamic clerics formed to review the proposed women's development policy. Hamida Hossain, founder of Ain O Shalish Kendra, told bdnews24.com Saturday the recommendations of the Ulama Review Committee were ridiculous. "Such recommendations cannot be supported by any means." The government last month formed an 18-member committee, headed by the acting Khatib of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque Maulana Nuruddin, to review the proposed policy. Nuruddin submitted the committee's recommendations to the government Thursday. Hamida Hossain questioned how a committee like this could be formed. "An evaluation committee needs representation of all people concerned, which has not happened in this case." The human rights lawyer said the government formulated the policy in discussion with all and it should now think of how the policy could be implemented. "We don't support the so-called evaluation committee. It is not a good effort by the government," said Ayesha Khanam, president of Mahila Parishad. She said the quarter opposing the policy has been against the development of women for 50 years. Ayesha Khanam called the proposed women's policy "a good effort", saying it would go a long way to establish equal rights in society. She said the recommendations of the Ulama Review Committee were politically motivated. "If the government accepts the recommendations, the country will lag behind. Oppression on women will rise." She demanded politics in religious institutions be banned, and asked the government to make its stand on the proposed policy clear to the people of the country. Shirin Akhter, president of the Karmajibi Nari Sangathan, demanded the review committee be dissolved. "A committee of this kind is not acceptable; the recommendations of such a committee cannot be considered," she told bdnews24.com. "If a review committee is needed, it must be formed consisting of women because it is an issue concerning women." "Women will decide their strategy to development," she said. Women's activist Hazera Sultana, at a roundtable on the "national women development policy" held Saturday, said the Ulama Review Committee was illegal. "We have to break the hands of those who want to run the country by 1,400-year-old laws," she added. Leftist party leaders also called the recommendations of the Ulama Review Committee unconstitutional. Communist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim alleged Saturday that the hardliners and war criminals were opposed to the proposed women's development policy in a bid to "protect their interests". "The 15 recommendations given by the Ulama Review Committee are unconstitutional. They are conspiring to bring the country into the dark ages, worse than the Pakistani regime," Selim said while addressing the roundtable meeting. The Left Democratic Front organised the discussion at Comrade Moni Singh Mukti Bhaban in Purana Paltan. Samyabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua told the meeting: "The government has fallen prey to the fundamentalists. It has to escape from the trap." Workers Party of Bangladesh politburo member Haider Akbar Khan Rano said: "The fundamentalists want the country to lag behind by creating confusion among people. The public should be aware of that." Sammilito Islami Oikyojote president Maulana Ziaul Hassan said: "We cannot keep women behind by giving wrong explanations of religion." Members of Islamist organisations have clashed with police on several occasions since the government's announcement of the proposed women's policy on Mar 8, International Women's Day. On Mar 27, the caretaker administration formed the 18-member committee of Islamic clerics headed by Maulana Nuruddin to review the policy. Nuriddin submitted the committee's recommendations to law and religious affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff on Thursday. The acting chief cleric of the national mosque told reporters on the day that equal rights should be based on equal responsibilities, although he pointed to certain sections within the women policy that remained problematic. On the inheritance law, Nuruddin cautioned: "The Quran is specific about inheritance law and the guidance of the Quran cannot be changed." "Those who prepared the policy failed to understand the point we are objecting to. The inheritance law cannot change the guidelines of the Quran." After receiving the committee's recommendations Thursday, the religious affairs adviser said that they would be considered in consultation with the women and children affairs ministry and others concerned bodies. bdnews24.
