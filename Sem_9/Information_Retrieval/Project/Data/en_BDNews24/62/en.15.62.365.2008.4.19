 Gaza, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas militants rammed bomb-laden cars into an Israeli border crossing with the Gaza Strip on Saturday, killing three of the militants and wounding 13 Israeli soldiers, the Islamists group and the Israeli army said. The bombing at Kerem Shalom was the third major Palestinian attack in less than two weeks on Israeli border crossings used to transfer limited supplies of humanitarian goods and fuel to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, home to 1.5 million people. Another Palestinian was killed later in an Israeli air strike on a car in southern Gaza near the Kerem Shalom crossing, medical workers said. An Israeli army spokeswoman confirmed the air strike on what she described as a "suspicious" vehicle. Israel tightened its economic and military blockade of the coastal enclave after Hamas seized control in June from secular Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas's armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said four cars packed with explosives attacked Kerem Shalom and that three of them exploded. An Israeli army spokeswoman said three cars attacked the crossing under the cover of heavy fog. She said two of them exploded in the attack. Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Ubaida said the attack marked the start of a campaign by the group to "break the siege". He said Israel "should be ready for more surprises and what is coming may be stronger and more painful" than what took place at Kerem Shalom, which lies at the border of Israel, southern Gaza and Egypt. Dozens of Hamas supporters later took part in anti-Israel demonstrations near the border crossings of Erez and Karni but no violence was reported. Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said the attack on the crossing showed Hamas's "nihilistic agenda" and its "total and complete disregard for the welfare of the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip". The Israeli army spokeswoman said 13 soldiers had been wounded, two moderately and the rest lightly. "The attacker approached the crossing through the heavy early morning mist. The bombing was probably intended as part of a wider attack," the army spokeswoman said. She said the militants may have been trying to abduct Israeli soldiers. In June 2006, Gaza militants abducted an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, near the Kerem Shalom crossing. Hamas and other militant groups want to swap Shalit for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. SUPPLY LINE Israel uses the Kerem Shalom crossing point, along with three others, to transfer limited supplies of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and fuel to impoverished Gazans. The army says Kerem Shalom has been a frequent target of shooting and mortar attacks, and that two Palestinian militants were wounded on Thursday when they tried to infiltrate the crossing. Abu Ubaida said Saturday's attack targeted the army base at Kerem Shalom, rather than the crossing for goods. Violence along the Israel-Gaza border has increased in recent days. Early on Saturday, the Israeli army killed one Hamas militant near the border fence in central Gaza, the Islamist group said. The Israeli army confirmed that a militant had been hit in an air strike near the border. On Wednesday, 17 Palestinians, most of them civilians, including a Reuters cameraman, and three Israeli soldiers were killed in the bloodiest day in more than a month. Two Israeli civilians were killed on April 9 in an attack by militants on the Israeli border crossing at Nahal Oz, the only terminal for piping fuel to the Gaza Strip. Two Palestinian militants and two civilians were also killed when Israeli troops responded.
