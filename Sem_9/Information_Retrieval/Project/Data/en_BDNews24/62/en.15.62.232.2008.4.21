 HONG KONG, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rose to their highest in more than seven weeks on Monday as financial firms gained on hopes for a turning point in the credit crisis, which also boosted the dollar. The US currency was near its highest level to the yen since early March, providing relief for the region's exporters, with the sector further comforted by stronger-than-expected quarterly results from US firms such as Caterpillar But oil prices hovered near a record $117 a barrel hit on Friday amid concerns of supply disruptions in Nigeria and comments by OPEC that it saw no need to increase production. Gold rebounded after the previous session's sell-off. "The market is clearly trying to say that the worst of all these subprime and credit issues are now out, so we can move on," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO. "But it remains to be seen whether that is really the case. It's hard to be conclusive that there aren't further write-offs out there in the financial sector." The MSCI measure of Asian stocks excluding Japan rose 2.5 percent by 0420 GMT, earlier hitting its highest level since Feb. 29. That marked a substantial recovery for an index that just last month hit its lowest since August 2007, when credit concerns first began surfacing. The turnaround came as forecast-beating earnings from Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase last week sparked hope the worst of the credit crisis may soon be over. Citigroup Inc on Friday posted a $5.1 billion quarterly loss and said it will cut another 9,000 jobs, but its shares still gained amid expectations that the top US lender was taking steps to move past its credit problems. Also on Friday, results from diversified US manufacturer Honeywell International Inc and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar beat expectations. BANKS' HOUSECLEANING Tokyo's Nikkei average rose 1.5 percent, led by financials such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and exporters such as Honda Motor Co Ltd, which stand to benefit from a weaker yen. Indexes in Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore gained over 2 percent each, while stocks in South Korea and Shanghai gained more than 1 percent each. "Although big losses were reported from US banks, investors are taking them more as cleaning up the subprime mess, and expect the banks to improve from there," said Lee Sun-yeob, a market analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in Seoul. The improving confidence in the financial sector also lifted the dollar by 0.2 percent to 103.93 near a seven-week high of 104.66 hit on electronic trade platform EBS on Friday. The euro was steady at $1.5815 off a record high of $1.5985 hit last week. The euro zone currency has jumped over 8 percent against the dollar this year as investors have been attracted by its yield appeal on expectations European interest rates will stay put, while the Federal Reserve is seen cutting U.S. rates further. Oil prices steadied at $116.64 a barrel, near the prior session's record $117, after a Nigerian rebel group said on Friday it had sabotaged a major oil pipeline operated by Royal Dutch Shell. Crude was also supported after the president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) told reporters the group saw no need to raise oil production. But spot gold rebounded to around $922 an ounce, after falling on Friday to as low as $904.35 when investors dumped safe-haven assets to add riskier assets such as stocks. Asian bonds eased, with Japanese June 10-year futures dipping 0.15 point to 138.45, touching earlier a seven-week low of 138.26
