<TITLE> PDP threatens court action if EPR not relaxed in time </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The Progressive Democratic Party announced Saturday that it would pursue the matter in the country's courts if emergency powers rules were not relaxed at least four months in advance of any upcoming elections. PDP convenor Dr Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi outlined his party's position at a press conference at the PDP central office in the city. Quarishi specifically criticised the caretaker administration's plan to hold four city corporation elections and 10 municipal elections in May. "Any attempt to hold any of the elections before the rainy season would be senseless," said the PDP convenor. "We contend that holding city corporation and municipal elections in phases during October would be more logical, with the upazila elections in November and the Jatiya Sangsad election being held in December," he said. The PDP leader said holding city corporation and municipal elections in May, under the state of emergency, would mean new parties or individuals would have great difficulty taking part in the elections. He said established parties, unlike the newer ones, had already selected their candidates, and that an election without indoor politics and party access to voters would be undemocratic. Quarishi claimed the caretaker government and the Election Commission was 'hell bent' on holding dialogue with the leaders of the two main political parties at the expense of more recent arrivals on the political scene. "This ill conceived attitude is pushing our national politics into a deep stalemate. It is in this context that the bad politics of pre-1/11 is trying to raise its head again," he said. bdnew
