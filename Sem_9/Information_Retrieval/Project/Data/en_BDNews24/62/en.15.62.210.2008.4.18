 PORTO ROTONDO, Sardinia, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi returned to the world diplomatic stage on Friday by hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin, flagging a friendship he said was beneficial to Italy and the world. But the event lost some of its lustre when Putin was forced, before the glare of television cameras, to deny reports he had secretly divorced his wife and planned to marry an Olympic gymnast. Berlusconi, elected to a third term as Italian prime minister on Monday, welcomed the Russian leader to his holiday villa on the island of Sardinia, an informal setting meant to underscore the personal nature of their relationship. After an evening of festivities on Thursday that included a comedy cabaret show, Berlusconi and Putin held a joint press conference and spoke of cooperation in the energy sector and possibly between their national airlines. After months of speculation involving Aeroflot, Putin said the Russian airline could restart talks about bidding for near-bankrupt Italian flag carrier Alitalia. "Everything is made easier if there is a relationship of esteem, a relationship of confidence, a relationship of respect, a relationship of friendship," Berlusconi, who is expected to take office in early May, told reporters.

Berlusconi said he wanted to expand ties that took a major step forward in 2006 when, under outgoing Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Italy and Russia struck an oil and gas partnership between Gazprom and Eni. But the polished event took an unexpected turn at the beginning when a Russian newspaper journalist asked Putin about media reports he had divorced his wife, Lyudmila, and would marry 24-year-old Russian Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva. "In what you said, there is not one word of truth," the 55-year-old Putin said. "I have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others' lives." The former KGB spy has kept his private life out of the media and reports about his family life are very rare in the mainstream Russian media, which is careful to follow Kremlin guidance on their coverage. "I think no one will get offended if I say that I personally consider that our Russian women are the most talented and most beautiful. And if anyone can be competition for them then it is only Italian women," he sa
