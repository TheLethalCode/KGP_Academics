 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)Religious hardliners Friday called off a public rally, easing fears of violence at Baitul Mukarram Mosque, said a leader of an Islamist outfit that demands changes to the women's development policy. The decision came after the police tightened security around the national mosque. Maulana Abdur Rob Yusufi, chief of Khelafat Majlish, told bdnews24.com: "We don't want violence. We called off the rally after the government assured us of meeting our demand. We believe the women's development policy would be made in line with the principles of Quran." Khelafat Majlish is one of the organisations that demand amendments to the women's development policy that prescribes equal rights to property. The government took strict measures ahead of Friday prayers at the national mosque where the hardliners are expected to launch a protest programme. Home adviser MA Matin said Thursday the government would not tolerate any activity that would violate emergency powers rules. bd
