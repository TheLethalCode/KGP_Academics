 Karachi, April 19 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan Saturday completed a clean sweep against Bangladesh, handing a comprehensive 150-run defeat to the visitors in the fifth and final one-day international at Karachi National Stadium. The Tigers were bundled out for 179 in 40.4 overs after Pakistan racked up their highest total of 329 for nine against Bangladesh. The fifth consecutive win meant captain Shoaib Malik has snatched a record of 11 successive victories -- five each against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and one against India -- surpassing former Pakistan captain Imran Khan's record 10 ODI wins in a row. Bangladesh, invited to play the ODI series after Australia pulled out of their tour citing security reasons, never seemed to attain their form during the series except for the third match that saw Bangladesh post their highest total of 285/7 against Pakistan in reply to the hosts' 308 for eight. Pakistan pace spearhead Mohammad Asif (3/35) rattled the visitors' top order Saturday removing Junaed Siddique (6), Aftab Ahmed (first-ball duck) and Shakib Al Hasan (5), who struck a fine 108 in the previous match, while Umar Gul (2/40) dismissed opener Tamim Iqbal (8) to leave Bangladesh in tatters. The visitors failed to restore their innings, with spinner Shahid Afridi wrecking the middle order by dismissing Mohammad Ashraful (30), Dhiman Ghosh (29) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (two) to return three for 40. However, Mahmudullah and Dhiman together added 57 runs for the seventh wicket, after Bangladesh were struggling at 71 for six in 16.2 overs, but Dhiman's dismissal triggered another collapse of the tail though Abdur Razzak held on with a career-best 33. Mahmudullah was the ninth Bangladesh batsman out for the team's highest of 37, before Wahab Riaz (2/23) had Razzak caught by Younis Khan to wrap up the visitors' innings with 9.1 overs to go. Earlier, on-form opener Salman Butt struck his career best knock to take Pakistan beyond the 300-mark for the third time in the five-match series. Butt smashed a scintillating 136, his sixth ODI century and second in the series, facing 124 balls before being caught by Shakib Al Hasan off Abdur Razzak in the 38th over. The left-handed opener, survived a catch scare on 57, clubbed 14 fours and one six, and set a new record for the second wicket partnership against Bangladesh along with Younis Khan. The pair added 179 runs for the second wicket after Mashrafee Bin Mortaza sent Kamran Akmal (10) back in the fifth over. Pacer Shahadat Hossain broke the second wicket, having Younis caught by Farhad Hossain, but by then Pakistan had crossed the 200-mark and was fast heading for 300. Younis, who pulled himself out of the previous two matches due to poor performance, returned with his 32nd half-century with 69 off 80 balls featuring four fours and one six. Butt returned to the dressing room after Younis, leaving the side at 251 for four in 40.5 overs, and some quickfires from Misbah-ul-haq (35), Shoaib Malik (27) and Mohammad Yousuf (20) helped the hosts post their highest total against Bangladesh. Pakistan's previous highest against Bangladesh was 323 for three in Multan in 2003. Despite losing the last four wickets in quick succession, Pakistan chalked up 51 runs in the last five overs. Mashrafee led the Bangladesh attack with four for 65, followed by Shahdat's three for 76 in his 10-over spell. Razzak chipped in with two for 56. Bangladesh made no change to the squad that played the fourth match. Hosts Pakistan brought in three changes with Younis, Nomanullah and Wahab Raiz coming in for Fawad Alam, Bazid Khan and Sohail Khan respectively. bdnew
