 LONDON, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British bomb disposal experts have carried out two controlled explosions in the south western city of Bristol as part of a terrorism investigation, Avon and Somerset police said on Saturday. A first controlled blast was conducted on Friday following the arrest of a 19-year-old man on Thursday, who has been named in media reports as Andrew Ibrahim. "A suspicious substance was discovered and it was deemed the most appropriate course of action was to carry out these controlled explosions," an Avon and Somerset police spokesman told Reuters. Over 20 houses had to be evacuated prior to the explosions, with residents housed in a hotel in the city centre. On Friday police were granted a further seven days to question Ibrahim.
