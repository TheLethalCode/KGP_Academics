 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)Home adviser MA Matin said Thursday the government would not tolerate any activity that would violate emergency powers rules. The vow for tough action came a day before Friday prayers at the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque, where Islamic outfits are expected to protest the women's development policy. "It's not the shortcoming of the government that it was tolerant last Friday. The government will not tolerate any further move that violates emergency rules," the adviser told reporters after a meeting on law and order at the home ministry. "The government will resist." Matin also said the government would not do anything that runs counter to the Quran and Sunnah and hoped the Islami Ain Bastabayan Parishad would not violate the emergency rules. The Islamist outfit announced a rally and a procession for Friday. Matin said security measures would be beefed up around the Baitul Mukarram ahead of the jumma prayers on Friday. The government took all-out preparation to resist any move to repeat last Friday's incident, said the adviser, adding: "Any move to breach emergency rules will be dealt with strictly." Quoting religious affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff, Matin said the committee tasked with re-evaluating the women' development policy made some recommendations. "The government will consider the recommendations." Asked if last Friday's incident was an act of sabotage, the adviser said: "It seems like that." He said intelligence agents were trying to identify those involved in the clashes. On why the government had not gone tough on the protesters, Matin said: "It's a matter of religious feelings. That's why the government behaved so, but legal action will be taken if anything like that happens tomorrow. Law will take its own course." He said the devotees were requested not to allow any unruly people to sit next to them. "There will be an announcement by loudspeaker if necessary," Matin added. bdnew
