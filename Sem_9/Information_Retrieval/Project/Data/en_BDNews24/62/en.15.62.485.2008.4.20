 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday issued a suo moto notice on three government officials over alleged assaults on a British national at Zia International Airport by immigration officials. The bench of justices Md Iman Ali and AFM Abdur Rahman asked the home secretary, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh and director general of the Department of Immigration to explain in 10 days why legal action would not be taken against them. The court rule came after Supreme Court lawyer advocate Manzil Morshed presented a newspaper report on the assaults to the court. Immigration officials reportedly manhandled Barrister Rezoan, a British citizen of Bangladesh origin, at the airport on April 14. Advocate Manzil told the court that such an incident had tarnished the image of the country abroad. The court asked the lawyer to present a list of the people involved with the incident to the court. bdnew
