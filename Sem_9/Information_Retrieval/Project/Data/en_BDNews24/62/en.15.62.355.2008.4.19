 Jakarta, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An undersea quake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale struck off the East Timor coast on Saturday, shaking buildings in the capital, Dili, but there were no reports of damage, an Indonesian meteorological agency official said. The epicentre of the quake was about 80 km (50 miles) northeast of Dili at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles), but there was no tsunami warning. "There is no report of damage and casualties so far," said the official at the Indonesian agency in Jakarta. East Timor lies in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire where earthquakes are frequent.
