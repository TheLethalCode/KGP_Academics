<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnew24.com)Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday the next budget would not include ambitious projects in the annual development programme, but would widen the social safety net. "In the new ADP, we will take up the projects which are pragmatic and easy to implement, taking into account the resources we have," the adviser told reporters after a pre-budget meeting at the finance ministry with secretaries of different ministries which are outside the mid-term budget framework. "Because of overambitious projects in the ADP, expenses go up and implementation gets delayed," Mirza Aziz said. "If the number of projects is fewer in the new ADP than before, there will be no problem," he said. The secretaries have been directed to prepare projects keeping the setbacks in mind, the adviser said. On why the ministries want to take up more projects, the adviser said: "Maybe the ministries and divisions want development for the country. But the problem is, a one-year project takes three years to be implemented." In fiscal 2007-08, ADP implementation is facing difficulty due to a rise in the prices of construction materials. A three-member committee headed by a Planning Commission member has been set up to solve the problems. Planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "I have met the adviser immediately after the meeting (with secretaries) and submitted the report to him." According to the latest statistics, the rate of ADP implementation in the first nine months (July-March) of the current fiscal year was 36 percent. In the current budget, the main ADP outlay was Tk 26,500 crore, which was cut down to Tk 22,500 crore last month due to slow implementation. In the news briefing, the finance adviser said, "During the meeting with the secretaries a proposal for increasing allowances for freedom fighters came up. I have told them that the allowances will be increased not only for freedom fighters but for other beneficiaries as well." bdnews2
