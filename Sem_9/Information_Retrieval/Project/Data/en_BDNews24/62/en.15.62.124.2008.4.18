 LONDON, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British government comfortably met its borrowing target for the last financial year, data showed on Friday, but analysts warned tougher times lay ahead. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing for fiscal 2007/08 came in at 35.56 billion pounds, below the 36.4 billion forecast by Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling in last month's Budget. However, borrowing last month alone was more than 10 billion pounds, the highest March figure on record. Worse may be to come. A slowing economy is likely to boost social security spending just as receipts from corporation tax, value-added tax and stamp duty on house purchases are falling. In last month's Budget, Darling revised up borrowing for the next four years by 20 billion pounds, blaming the impact of the global credit squeeze. Many economists are sceptical whether even these new forecasts will be met. "The Chancellor met his full-year borrowing forecast for the last year but that is where the good news ends," said Paul Dales at Capital Economics. "We think that a sharper slowdown in economic activity than the Chancellor expects will mean that borrowing overshoots Mr Darling's forecast of 43 billion pounds for 2008/09 by at least two billion pounds." TOUGH TIMES AHEAD The Institute for Fiscal Studies has criticised the government for leaving itself no room for manoeuvre should the slowdown prove steeper or more prolonged than expected. The government is currently banking on a short-lived economic slowdown. Its forecasts hinge on growth of around 2 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2009. Most independent forecasters are more gloomy. The International Monetary Fund reckons the economy will grow just 1.6 percent both this year and next. This would be the weakest rate for well over a decade and have serious repercussions for the public finances. With the liabilities of the newly-nationalised Northern Rock bank coming onto the government's books in May, the government is bound to fail to meet its target of keeping net debt below 40 percent of gross domestic product. Even excluding the impact of Northern Rock, the Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the government has a 50:50 chance of breaking its fiscal rules over the forecast period. Michael Hume at Lehman Brothers noted the public finance figures had yet to show any sign of a slowing economy impairing tax revenue, but he predicted this would change. "We expect that the Chancellor will find it increasingly difficult to stick to the golden rule of borrowing only to invest as economic activity slows further," he said. On a brighter note, Friday's figures showed the cash measure of borrowing -- the public sector net cash requirement -- came in much lower than expected in March at 12.66 billion pounds. Reflecting the lower financing need, Britain's Debt Management Office said it would cut Treasury bill sales by 6.7 billion pounds this ye
