 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party of Bangladesh has asked the government to erase doubts about national polls by December, a party leader said Monday. At an informal meeting with advisers, to prepare for forthcoming formal dialogue with the government, CPB called for the election be held by year-end as per the roadmap laid out by the Election Commission. The party's general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim told reporters after the meeting that they had also suggested an 'election countdown' through public billboards in a bid to prevent confusion or doubt in the minds of people. "If something like this can be done, there will not be any doubt among the public about the election," he commented. Selim told reporters: "We raised a number of proposals to the government including lifting the state of emergency, curbing spiralling prices, maintaining the anti-graft campaign, implementation of national women's policy and holding national elections by December." "We have also asked the government to set up a special tribunal for the trial of war criminals and barring them from contesting in the elections," he said. Four advisers to the caretaker government met with the Communist Party of Bangladesh and the Workers Party of Bangladesh Monday, as part of ongoing sessions meant to prepare for forthcoming formal dialogue between the government and political parties. The CPB meeting, starting at noon and ending at 12.45 pm, took place at state guest house Meghna. The party's central committee member Ahsan Habib Lablu told bdnews24.com before the meeting that he, alongside acting president Shahidullah Chowdhury, general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim and fellow central committee members Morshed Ali and Ruhin Hossain Prince, were attending Monday's talks at the invitation of an adviser. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman subsequently sat with representatives of the Workers Party around 1.00 pm.
