<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnew24.com)--A widespread movement to press home the demand for BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's release is being considered, Khandaker Delwar Hossain assured party members Saturday. As more than 100 former Chhatra Dal leaders gathered at his home, Delwar told them that such a movement would be organised as soon as a decision was reached by BNP leaders. 'Chhatra Dal leaders of the 80s' marked their first anniversary Saturday with a conference at the NAM flat residence of the Khaleda-nominated secretary general. Delear stated unequivocally that people would not accept any election without Khaleda Zia, and accused the present administration of "a complete failure of government". He demanded the release of both former prime ministers and immediate elections. "BNP wants a fair election with participation by all parties. We will accept people's verdict in a fair and participatory election. But BNP will not participate in any arranged election keeping Khaleda Zia out of it," Delwar said. "People will not accept an election held only to give legitimacy to an administration's work." Most of the speakers at the meeting demanded the announcement of a programme for Khaleda Zia's release, and protested any bid to forge unity with the party's 'reformist' faction. Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah also said, addressing his comment to the secretary general: "The workers want a programme. You must hold a programme. Time is running out fast. Our political opponents are gaining ground. We have to keep this in mind." On the unity with the opposing faction, Hannan Shah said: "The party's unity will be decided as per Khaleda Zia's directive, not to please anybody or to make room for anybody." President of 'Chhatra Dal leaders of the 80s' Khandaker Babul Chowdhury presided over Saturday's meeting. BNP standing committee member Dr RA Gani, joint secretaries general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan, acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, and former student leaders Shamsuzzaman Khan, Kazi Asaduzzaman, Shirin Sultana and Noor Alam Helal were among those who attended. bdnew
