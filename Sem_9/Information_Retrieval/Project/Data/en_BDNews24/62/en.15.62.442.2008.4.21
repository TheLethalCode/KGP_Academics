<TITLE> UN official in Iran to press for nuclear answers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN atomic watchdog's top investigator arrived in Tehran on Monday to press Iran to explain Western intelligence which suggested it covertly studied how to design nuclear bombs. Iran's official IRNA news agency said Olli Heinonen would meet Javad Vaeedi, deputy head of the Islamic Republic's Supreme National Security Council, during his two-day visit. It quoted an unnamed Iranian official as saying his visit was intended to "advance cooperation" between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN body trying to clear up suspicions about Iran's disputed nuclear ambitions. The talks will get under way in the afternoon, the ISNA news agency said. Last week, US President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged a united effort to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, possibly by expanding sanctions. Iran says its nuclear programme is a peaceful drive to produce electricity so that the world's fourth-largest crude exporter can sell more of its oil and gas abroad. It has been hit by three rounds of limited UN sanctions since 2006 because of its inadequate cooperation with IAEA investigations. Heinonen raised a diplomatic stir in February with a presentation that indicated links in Iran between projects to process uranium, to test explosives and to modify a missile cone in a way suitable for a nuclear warhead. Iran has dismissed the intelligence as baseless, forged or irrelevant. But the IAEA wants substantive explanations to enable it to wind up a long inquiry into Iran's secretive quest for nuclear power. IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei has said the world "needs to make sure Iran did not have a weapons programme". The Iranian official quoted by IRNA said Tehran had presented its "evaluation" of the issue to the UN agency but did not rule out discussion of the subject with Heinonen. "Since there are differences between Iran and the agency (over the Western intelligence) the meeting ... will deal with finding a solution to this problem," ISNA quoted an official from Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation as saying. IAEA officials stress that the intelligence details about weapons studies, many of them from a laptop computer spirited out of Iran by a defector in 2004 and handed to the United States, remain unverified but warrant thorough investigation. World powers are considering improving a package of trade and other incentives for Iran if it stops enriching uranium, which can be used as nuclear fuel or provide material for bombs. But Iran has refused to halt its nuclear drive and says it is working on its own proposals to help defuse the row
