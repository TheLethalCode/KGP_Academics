<TITLE> 37 years to find his father's grave </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)He stared at the multi-storied buildings under construction, the son who now knew for sure that his father was lying beneath them. On 17th April 1971, the Pakistani Army arrested Lt Col Mohammad Abdul Qadir from his home in Panchlaish, Chittagong. He was shot dead that noon and buried with others in a nearby mass grave unbeknownst to his family. Nearly four decades later the son finally traced his father's last resting place. He was there on the 37th death anniversary of his father. Writer and journalist Nadeem Qadir told bdnews24.com on Thursday that all he wanted was due honour to his father for his role in the war of independence. Nadeem applied to the Bangladesh Army to protect the gravesite where one of their officers lies as a martyr. "The matter is a bit complicated since two six-storied buildings are being constructed over the mass grave. You can't just ask to demolish them. But we are hoping for a solution acceptable to all." "A four-member committee has submitted a final report to the Army Headquarters. The Army Chief will give his decision on it within weeks," Nadeem said. The journalist and television presenter wrote about his experiences in tracing his father's grave. bdnews24.com reproduces extracts of the account with the author's permission: It was 15 April 1971. I woke up as the Fazr Azan called the faithful to prayers. Most of them had either fled or been killed by the Pakistani army. I saw my father, wearing a lungi and vest, quietly going out through the backdoor of our house. I asked: "Papa, where are you going?" He looked at me, stopped and came back. He held me tight and said: "Your Papa is not going anywhere." Then came 17 April 1971. The doorbell rang and boots kicked at our door. A Pakistani army captain along with a large number of soldiers entered our home. "Where is your father?" he asked me as I opened the door. They followed me to the bedroom and told my father: "You are a traitor. You are under arrest ... get dressed." Then the captain told my father to say anything important he had to say to his pregnant wife who stood silent next to him. As he was led away in a jeep, I rushed up the stairs to wave to him. He waved back. I never realised it was the final goodbye and that I would only find his last resting place after decades but never again see him in person. I just wanted to know the truth about the whereabouts of my father, Lt Col Mohammad Abdul Qadir of the Army Engineers Corps, who went missing after his arrest by the Pakistani army that day. His wife Hasna Hena Qadir passed away in 1999, still waiting for his return. I also wanted to believe he would return along with my brother and sister. At the same time, I wanted to confront the truth knowing quite well that it would not be pleasant. Finding his last address was very important to me. Then at long last, I stumbled on a clue that finally led me to a mass grave in Chittagong's Panchlaish area. The grave is very close to our Panchlaish residence in 1971. A building was being constructed on the site and the developers or construction workers would not speak about finding any remains there as they dug or whether they had reburied them with concrete. I stood there mute. I wanted to yell out "Papa, I have finally found you. Your 'Antu Baba' is here." I could not cry aloud, but wiped my tears so that no one noticed. I prayed silently standing outside the gate of the under-construction building. I was lost for a moment and started to feel sick. No, I could not afford that either. I prayed to Allah to give me strength, as I had to somehow restore this place with the help of my father's comrades. The effort is now underway and I hope that not only his grave will be protected but his role in the war of independence will also become clear with due honour given to him. I worry for my sister the most because I am unsure how strong she can remain and without the grave being protected she cannot even go near to pray. But we all have to face the reality. The tracing agency of the Red Cross had first said in 1974 that he was "missing believed killed" on April 17, 1971. That did not satisfy his family. Queries were made but nobody could say where he had been killed. Some reported initially that he was killed in the Foy's Lake area of Chittagong, where I subsequently went every year to pray and place flowers. I started to search for him seriously in 1991, when I had to go to Chittagong for professional reasons. I went around with my father's picture in the Panchlaish area several times to ask people who might have known him and were in Chittagong during or soon after the warbut with no result. Then in 2004, somebody said he was killed in some hills near the city, but again there was no proof. As I was almost giving up the search, Allah Almighty took me to Chittagong to deliver a lecture to a team going on a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sudan, to share my experience of the visit I undertook to the African country in 2007. I told the officers that I lost my father in this city in 1971, and he remained untraced. Then came a big clue. Lt Col Bayezid of the Chittagong Brigade showed me a book called "Bangalir Jatiyabadi Sangram, Muktijuddhe Chattagram" by Dr Mahfuzur Rahman, a well-known researcher as well as a physician. There he mentions (on page 371) that Lt Col Qadir was killed along with 35 others in Panchlaish behind the Apollo Poly Clinic located in front of the Chittagong Medical College. I tracked down Dr Rahman, who took me to the main witness, businessman Nurul Islam, who was a member of the Chittagong chapter's Awami League working committee in 1971. The moment I was introduced to him, he broke down. He confirmed that he knew my father and had buried him along with at least 18 others killed by the Pakistani army in a vacant plot in Panchlaish on April 17, 1971. Col Qadir lay on his back and took at least five bullets, he said. He also confirmed that my father gave explosives from the store of his office (at the Oil and Gas Development Corporation, now Petrobangla), and raised the Bangladesh flag there in March, 1971. Mr Islam said that on 17 April, he heard shots around 2.00 pm. Guards and servants in different houses nearby informed him that many people were killed including Col Qadir. "I went to see later taking a great risk ... there were a few others ... we called in the Imam of the local Makkhi Masjid." "It was to be done quickly, quietly and ensuring that the dead received their last rites as much as possible," Islam said. "The janaza was offered and they were buried close to the major drain flowing through the area on the plot, which was vacant at that time." Then I came across Rokeya Chowdhury, a teacher of Cantonment Public School and College, who also indicated the same place as the area of the mass grave. She too heard a Bengali military officer was buried there. "Since the construction started I came almost everyday to ask the workers if they have found the remains ... but they always kept quite or they denied any finding," she said pointing at the caretaker of the building. She added: "The ground where these people were buried was little higher than the rest." I tracked down a retired businessman residing very close to the burial ground. He confirmed his boy servant was among those who buried the dead and pinpointed the place. The number of dead was between 14 and 18, he said. He also said some people used to come and pray at the grave, but they stopped coming. His son also backed him and said they had asked the landlord to make a garden on the grave, but they did not want to meddle too much. During my investigation I also came across people who wanted to divert my effort, and found that they had controversial roles during the war. Construction of the house was stopped for a week on Jan 10, 2008, after I made a request to the local taskforce. They took speedy action on learning that Col Qadir was among the victims in that mass grave. We urgently need to protect the area to honour those killed there for the cause of our dear Bangladesh. This is the time their families can expect such a move. Maybe that is why Allah finally led me there after 37 years to end a long and painful mission. bdn
