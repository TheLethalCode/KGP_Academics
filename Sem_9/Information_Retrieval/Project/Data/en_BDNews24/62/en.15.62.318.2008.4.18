<TITLE> Spain plans pipeline to avert Catalan water crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BARCELONA, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain unveiled plans on Friday to build a pipeline to relieve drought-stricken Catalonia and prevent Barcelona running out of drinking water, but other regions are up in arms in what media have dubbed a water war. The pipeline will take water from the mouth of the Ebro River to Barcelona, the Catalan regional capital. A hosepipe ban has already been in force for weeks and picturesque fountains have run dry in the city, a popular tourist venue. The government said on Friday the situation in Barcelona was an emergency. "If we don't act, the citizens of Barcelona will be without drinking water in October," said First Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, speaking at the maiden weekly press conference of the newly re-elected Socialist government. Reservoirs in northeast Catalonia are just 20.1 percent full after four years of drought, according to the latest official data, or just 0.1 percent above emergency levels. One Catalan reservoir is so dry that a village has reappeared after being under water since the river flowing through it was dammed. Catalonia's department of the environment on Thursday said recent rainfall after a dry winter would only be enough to postpone emergency measures for some weeks. WATER IMPORTS The new pipeline is not due to be completed until October, however, and Catalonia already has plans to import water to Barcelona by sea beginning in May and by rail in August. The plan ends weeks of wrangling between the central government in Madrid and authorities in Catalonia. But it has angered the heads of regional governments further down the Mediterranean coast in Valencia and Murcia, who say they will demand equal access to the Ebro in the Constitutional Court. The Socialist government denies favouring Catalonia -- whose regional parties are its allies in parliament -- over conservative Popular Party-led governments in Murcia and Valencia. It says the new pipeline will not deplete the Ebro because it will channel surplus water recovered by installing more efficient irrigation pipes used by farmers. "People from Barcelona have the same rights as every other citizen -- not more but not less," said de la Vega. "It's the responsibility of the government to make sure the whole of Spain fairly shares resources that belong to everyone." Adding to the government's headaches are protests from farmers in the Ebro delta on whom the plan hinges. Many say they cannot stop irrigating to lay new pipes now that the growing season is under way. The delta is known for growing rice, an essential ingredient in renowned dishes from Spain's Mediterranean coast like paella. "We don't want to be selfish, but rice is life itself in the delta. The government has had years to act, and now they have acted late and badly," said Rosa Pruna, head of the influential ASAJA farmers' union in Catalonia.
