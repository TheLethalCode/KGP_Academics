 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  Central leaders of the Awami League Friday asked party workers to turn demand for the release of detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina into an international issue. Speaking at a signature campaign programme on Bangabandhu Avenue, the AL leaders said the movement for the party chief would broaden into a mass upsurge if the government delayed her release. Jubo League, a front organisation of the AL, organised the signature campaign where senior leaders Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury spoke. "The government is not taking action against the leaders of the four-party coalition who are really responsible for the 1/11 changeover. But the government is pressing false charges against Sheikh Hasina only to keep her behind bars," Amu alleged in his speech. Amu backed the signature campaign with calls for turning demand for Hasina's freedom into an international issue. Speaking on the rising food costs in Bangladesh, AL presidium member Abdur Razzak said: "The country is affected by open famine and people are starving, but the government is sitting idle." Razzak said the people would no longer tolerate the government's dithering over the release of the former prime minister, who was arrested on corruption charges last year. "The sooner Sheikh Hasina is released from prison, the more the nation will benefit from it," he said. Tofail Ahmed, another presidium member, said there was no alternative to the freedom of Hasina. "We are keeping our programmes indoors for now. But they will broaden outdoors if the government doesn't release her soon." bdn
