 MILAN, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will spend at least 10 days in his native Sweden trying to shrug off a knee problem, the Serie A leaders said on Thursday. Ibrahimovic has missed the last three games because of the injury and will now skip Sunday's trip to Torino and the home game with Cagliari on April 27. The striker, Inter's top scorer with 15 goals in the league this term, may also be doubtful for the derby with AC Milan on May 4. "Zlatan Ibrahimovic trained in the gym this morning. As agreed with (coach Roberto) Mancini and the club, the striker will return tomorrow to Sweden, where he will spend at least 10 days following a specific training programme to make a complete recovery from his left knee problem," an Inter statement said. Champions Inter are four points clear of second-placed AS Roma with five games left. Inter also said that Portuguese midfielder Luis Figo sprained the medial calf muscle of his right leg in Wednesday's 0-0 home draw with Lazio in their Italian Cup semi-final first leg.
