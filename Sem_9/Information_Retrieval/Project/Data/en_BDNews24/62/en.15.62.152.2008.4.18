<TEXT>
 Khulna, April 18 (bdnews24.com)A 40-megawatt rental power plant, set up by Glasgow-based company Aggreko in Khulna, will start production in May, a special assistant to the chief adviser said Friday. "If everything goes as planned, production will begin on May 28," Professor M Tamim told a discussion meeting with officials of the West Zone Power Distribution Company in Khulna city. He said the procedure of inviting bids for a 210-megawatt power plant in Goalpara in Khulna started. "The projects, if implemented will reduce the power shortage in Khulna," Tamim said. He stressed coal-based power plants to resolve the crisis of power in the southwestern part of the country. "There is no scope to set up power plants to run on gas. Khulna and Rauzan in Chittagong are the best places for coal-based power plants," he added. Asked about the closure of a 110-megawatt plant in the district four days after it started operation, Tamim said the boiler tube of the plant had split due to saline water in the tube. A system will be built to supply saline-free water to the 210-megawatt plant. The country needs about 5,000 megawatt of electricity a day on average, but only 3,900 MW is produced. Prof Tamim said the caretaker government had raised the production of electricity by 1000 megawatts. "If anybody wants to produce power and sell to other districts, he will be allowed to use the transmission line of the Power Development Board. They will have to pay charges for it," Tamim said. bdnews2
