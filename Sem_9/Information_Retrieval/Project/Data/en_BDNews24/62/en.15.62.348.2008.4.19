 Khulna, April 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Jute and textiles adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal Saturday said the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation had been incurring steady losses since 1972 while some officials of the corporation amassed personal fortunes. Speaking at a function to mark the retirement of employees from seven state-run jute mills in the Khulna region the adviser said the organisation had to be immediately reformed. He said the amended Labour Law of 2006 had lowered the retirement age of workers from 60 to 57. "This increased pressure on the government, and they were obliged to make arrangements to pay out Tk 86 crore in wages, provident funds and gratuities to the retiring workers," said the adviser. Anwarul said the caretaker government was now making arrangements to pay the amount, with the lion's share, Tk 54.75 crore, going to 1,117 workers in the Khulna region. The adviser directed the BJMC and jute mill officials to pay the amount within the next two days. Anwarul pointed out the many challenges facing the sector in returning to competitiveness after so many years of stagnation, and stressed the need for massively increased productivity from all levels of the industry. The adviser said jute farmers had already received Tk 1.64 crore in loans through the Bangladesh Rural Development Board in a bid to revive the ailing sector. "The government is now considering a package of Tk 200 to 250 crore in loans for the farmers," Anwarul said. bdnews2
