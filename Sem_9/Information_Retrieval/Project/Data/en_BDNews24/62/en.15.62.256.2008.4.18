 OSLO, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One miner has been found dead and rescuers are searching for another after a fire in a Russian coal mine in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard off northern Norway, Norwegian police said on Friday. Twenty-nine of the 31 miners who were deep below ground when the fire broke out at the Barentsburg mine early on Thursday were evacuated unhurt. Russian rescue workers recovered the body of a 47-year old Russian on Thursday evening and continued to search on Friday for a 57-year-old Ukrainian man, the Svalbard police said. "The mine rescue corps are still down there, and they are struggling to get control over the fire," chief detective Petter Braaten said. The cause of the fire 450 metres (1,476 feet) below ground is not known, he added. The mine is owned and operated by Russian mining company Trust Arctikugol in Barentsburg, a Russian town of about 500 people on Spitsbergen, the main island of the Svalbard archipelago in the Barents Sea. Svalbard is under Norwegian sovereignty but Russia and a number of other countries are entitled to establish settlements there under a 1920 treaty. A fire at the same mine in 1997 killed 23 mine
