 New York, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo pledged that much delayed presidential elections in his divided country would take place on the scheduled date of Nov. 30 but declined to say if he would be a candidate. A presidential poll in the world's top cocoa grower, split in half since a 2002-03 civil war, was initially due in October 2005 but has been repeatedly delayed because the southern-based government said it could not organize it in the rebel north. The Nov. 30 date was announced on Monday after a cabinet session. Guillaume Soro, a former rebel leader appointed prime minister under a year-old peace deal, said there was agreement across the political spectrum that the vote should go ahead. Asked in an interview with Reuters what guarantee he could give that the date would be respected, Gbagbo said this was the first time an exact day had been scheduled. "Today we are saying November 30," he said in the interview late on Thursday. "Sunday November 30 there will be the elections, it's a date. ... So that's the guarantee." Gbagbo was in New York for a summit on Wednesday of the U.N. Security Council and African Union. In his speech to the summit, he said "the crisis is ending in Ivory Coast. ... The peace process is now irreversible." Gbagbo, elected in 2000, is widely expected to seek another term and to face competition from former president Henri Konan Bedie, ousted in a 1999 coup, and former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, who has support among northern Muslims. But in the interview, he declined to confirm he would be a candidate, saying he would make an announcement "when the moment comes" on whether he would stand for office. MUCH TO DO A former French colony, Ivory Coast was for years a bastion of stability in West Africa but was divided when rebels seized its northern half in 2002 after a failed bid to oust Gbagbo. Gbagbo said the distribution of identity papers to thousands of people lacking them to enable them to vote, as well as the disarmament of former fighters, were under way, but he could give no figures. "That's why we said November 30," he said. "It's because we know there are a lot of things to do and we've made a schedule." Gbagbo said measures in Ivory Coast to cut taxes on key food imports at the beginning of the month after protests over rising prices had been "enough to stop the demonstrations." "But they are not enough to solve the problem, because the problem is a world problem," he said. "What is needed is to better control world commodity markets." The Ivory Coast leader said the problem of cocoa and coffee smuggling out of the rebel-held north to avoid taxes imposed by the south was due to a lack of customs posts. "Now that we are going to reestablish the customs officers, there will be no more illegal traffic, whether of exports or imports," he said. Analysts have suggested profits to be made from smuggling have been one of the main factors behind the continued division of the country.
