 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnew24.com)  Leading economists Saturday accused the caretaker administration, like previous governments, of failing to protect the country's oil, gas and coal resources. Speaking at a seminar on the national coal policy and oil-gas exploration issues, noted economist Prof Anu Muhammad claimed the energy ministry was functioning as a corporate lobbyist for foreign interests. Prof Anu said questionable agreements were currently being signed in the sector, although he readily admitted that previous administrations had also failed to protect the public's interests in the area. Bangladesh Economic Association president Dr Qazi Khaliquzzaman Ahmad said though the present administration had taken inititiatives in different areas, the creation of a coordinated energy policy was essential to protect national gas, oil and coal resources. He stressed the need, however, for an elected government to make any future policies and deals in the sector. BEA general secretary Prof Abul Barakat urged the caretaker government not to proceed with any further Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)special agreements between the government and foreign contractorsduring the present state of emergency. He also demanded the immediate abolition of the post of chief adviser's special assistant in charge of energy, to be replaced by two separate posts: one in charge of reducing the cost of energy and another tasked with increasing employment in the sector. Member of the citizen's committee on gas, oil and coal Golam Mortuza was also of the view that the energy resources of the country were "not safe in the hands of the chief adviser's special assistant". Prof Badrul Imam, of Dhaka University's geology department, presented the key-note paper at the BEA-organised seminar. He said gas worth millions of dollars had been wasted due to the irresponsibility of foreign companies. "Presently 10-15 lakh cubic feet of gas is being wasted every day from the country's biggest gas field - Titas. There is a foreign conspiracy to destroy the country's gas resources," said Prof Badrul. The DU professor went on to say that no local expertise had been involved in the oil-gas exploration agreement under the present PSC system, adding: "It is illogical to sign agreements in a hurry by October. An elected government should sign such agreements." bdnews
