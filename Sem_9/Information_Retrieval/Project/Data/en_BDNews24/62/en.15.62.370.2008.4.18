 MANILA, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank is willing to provide budgetary support to countries struggling with high food prices, its president, Haruhiko Kuroda, said on Friday. He told reporters that a global surge in food prices had disproportionately affected the poor in Asia but added that the bank was against protectionism or trade restrictions being resorted to by some countries to keep prices in check. "The way to help is to provide targeted income support for the needy poor, particularly in South Asia and some parts of Southeast Asia," Kuroda said at the ADB's Manila headquarters. "That is the most effective and efficent way to support, rather than price controls or trade measures." In Asia, the surge in prices of rice, a staple in most nations in the region, has governments worried about the prospect of hoarding and social unrest. Major exporters have started to cut back on sales to ring-fence supplies. Governments are struggling to deal with the situation and many are stepping up subsidising food. But across-the-board subsidies carry an enormous cost and the ADB has recommended giving targeted cash handouts to the poor instead. Countries which do this would nevertheless incur larger than programmed fiscal deficits, Kuroda said. "They may need some help from ADB. Of course ADB is prepared to provide such financial assistance to governments which need such assistance, to provide assistance to the poor." No country had yet asked the ADB for help, but a country such as Bangladesh, where street clashes have broken out over rising food prices, would qualify, Kuroda said. He gave no estimate on how much money could be made available but said soft loans could be given through the ADB's Asian Development Fund (ADF), a window for concessional financing. SENSITIVITY Longer-term, Kuroda said nations must liberalise their agricultural sectors, including trade restrictions and price controls. But he accepted this would be difficult to implement, because of the sensitivity of the issue. "Trade measures, price control measures, are not efficient or effective in the long run and in the short run they can intensify or exacerbate the situation in the world or in the region as a whole. But it's a difficult decision to be made by governments." Agriculture is not among the five core focus sectors identified by the ADB in its long-term strategy, but Kuroda said funds would be made available to support rural finance, irrigation and rural infrastructure. The long-term strategy, unveiled by the ADB last week, focuses on infrastructure, the environment, regional cooperation, the finance sector and education. The United States, one of the major donors of the multilateral agency, voted against the plan at least partly because of what it called an excessive focus on nations such as China and India at the expense of poorer nations, according to newspaper reports. Kuroda said the United States did not oppose the basic thrust of the strategic plan, which was drawn up after discussions lasting more than a year. He said China and India did not have access to concessional loans under the ADF but were given loans at market-linked rates under the Ordinary Capital Resources window. Last year, the ADB lent out $10.1 billion, of which soft loans comprised $1.89 billion while the rest were on non-concessional ter
