 KARACHI, April 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand will play three one-day internationals in Pakistan later this year, a senior Pakistan Cricket Board official said on Sunday. Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of the board, told reporters that New Zealand would be coming to Pakistan ahead of September's ICC Champions Trophy to play the short series. "They have confirmed they want to play the three games but they want to do it closer to the Champions Trophy so an itinerary is now being worked out," Naghmi said. Pakistan, who are hosting the Champions Trophy, have invited New Zealand as part of their efforts to arrange international games following Australia's decision to postpone their tour to Pakistan in March-April for security reasons.

He said Pakistan had also invited West Indies for a one-day series in August but they had declined because of commitments in Canada
