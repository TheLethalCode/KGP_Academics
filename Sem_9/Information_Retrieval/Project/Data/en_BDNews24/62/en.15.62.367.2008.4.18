 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will look to avert a clean sweep over them whey they face hosts Pakistan Saturday in the fifth and final one-day international at the National Stadium in Karachi. Bangladesh are now four matches down against Pakistan, who hardly faced any challenge from the visitors except in the third match, and Shoaib Malik's side are on the verge of a new record of winning 11 ODIs in a row. Despite showing some fight in the third match in Karachi, all hoped that Bangladesh would put up another fight in Multan, but the top order batsmen, including captain Mohammad Ashraful, drowned their side playing reckless shots before Shakib Al Hasan stood tall. Junaed Siddique substituted opener off-form Shahriar Nafees, but he frustrated all by playing a three-ball duck while Tamim Iqbal threw away his wicket despite a brilliant start. Besides, Aftab Ahmed and Ashraful also walked the same path of both the openers, leaving the side at 16 for four before Shakib struck a timely 108 to take the visitors to a respectable position. The team management will hope the batsmen have learnt quickly from their mistakes, and will also hope the spinners get back to their best against Pakistan. On the other hand, Pakistan want to make a new record to win eleven ODIs at a stretch by winning Saturday's match and skipper Shoaib Malik is looking forward to breaking Imran Khan's record. "It will be good if this record is improved with a clean sweep in the five-match ODI series against Bangladesh," Shoaib said after leveling the record with an emphatic 7-wicket win over Bangladesh in the fourth match. He said that it was good to see Pakistan adopting the habit of winning and hope it will help his boys in the forthcoming Asia Cup. The hosts are also set to introduce new blood in the form of a few more youngsters in the dead rubber series with Naumanullah likely to make his ODI debut in front of his home crowd. Younis Khan is back after missing the previous two matches while pacer Wahab Riaz is expected to pair with Mohammad Asif in the attack. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Junaed Siddique, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Raqibul Hasan, Nazimuddin, Mahmudullah, Farhad Reza, Dhiman Ghosh, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shahadat Hossain and Syed Rasel. Pakistan squad: Shoaib Malik, Salman Butt, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Muhammad Asif, Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Rao Iftikhar, Wahab Riaz, Fawad Alam, Bazid Khan and Naumanullah and Sarfra
