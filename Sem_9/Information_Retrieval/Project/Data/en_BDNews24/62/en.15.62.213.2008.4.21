<TITLE> French rail blames UK driver for Eurostar delay </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French state rail operator SNCF said on Monday that a British driver was to blame for a nearly 10-hour delay suffered by passengers on a Eurostar train that normally links London and Paris in 2-1/4 hours. The delay affected some 640 travellers whose train left London at 8.00 p.m. (1900 GMT) last Friday. The British driver was actually taking a train from Paris to London the same evening when a signal went off indicating a technical fault, the SNCF said in a statement after holding an inquiry into the reasons for the delay. "The investigation found one main cause: a diagnostic error by the driver of the faulty Eurostar," it said. When the driver reached Lille, his passengers were swapped with those on the Paris-bound Eurostar from London at around 11 p.m. so that his faulty train could make the shorter journey to Paris rather than risk breaking down in the Channel Tunnel. He should have gone further in his analysis of the technical problem, which would have shown that his train could not go as far as Paris because of a computer failure, the SNCF said. "If this analysis had been carried out on board the train, a decision would have been taken to send a replacement Eurostar train from Paris," it said. "In those circumstances, the customers would have been able to arrive in Paris around 2 o'clock on Saturday morning." The train broke down in the countryside north of Paris, stranding travellers from London until a third train arrived. This train was forced to crawl to Paris at less than 60 km per hour (40 mph) because of what the SNCF said were safety considerations, and reached its destination at 9.13 a.m., almost 10 hours late. At a news conference in Paris from which television cameras were banned, SNCF chief Guillaume Pepy reiterated that the driver was to blame, adding: "the driver did not follow the procedures in the repair manual to the end." The SNCF said the decision to switch the trains around was the right one, but other factors also contributed to the delay. The last replacement train should have been sent more quickly, and when it did arrive it couldn't be connected properly, which forced it to drive slowly. To make matters worse, the public address system was not working, so passengers could not be kept informed properly. The SNCF said it would increase its training for drivers on how to diagnose technical problems properly, and improve its training and procedures for attaching trains to each other. "SNCF and Eurostar take full responsibility and I express my personal regrets to each of the travellers. It is a very serious but very rare incident," Pepy said. He did not rule out further compensation for the passengers beyond the reimbursement and free return tickets on offe
