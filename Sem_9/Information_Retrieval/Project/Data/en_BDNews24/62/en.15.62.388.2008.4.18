<TITLE> USTR urges Pelosi set date for Colombia trade vote </TITLE>

 Washington, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The only way to salvage a free trade deal with Colombia is for US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to schedule a vote on the pact, the Bush administration's top trade official said on Thursday. "It is important for American workers and farmers and entrepreneurs that the Speaker of the House schedule a vote on the merits of the agreement," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said in a speech. "That and only that has the potential of reviving the Colombia free trade agreement," Schwab said at the U.S. Export-Import Bank's annual trade conference. Last week, President George W. Bush sparked a fight with Pelosi over the pact when he submitted it to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote within 90 days under long-standing "fast track" rules for considering trade agreements. The White House said it took that step only after Pelosi rebuffed months of efforts to work out a bipartisan process for bringing the pact to the floor. Pelosi responded to Bush's move by pushing through a rule change that removes the 90-day deadline and lets Democratic leaders decide when Congress votes on the pact. The Bush administration now accuses Pelosi of killing the Colombia agreement and destroying a key trade policy tool used by both Democratic and Republican presidents since 1974 to get trade agreements through Congress. On Wednesday, Pelosi said Democrats "stand ready" to talk with the Bush administration about conditions for bringing the Colombia agreement to the floor for a vote. She said it would fail if Bush tries to "jam it" down Congress' throat. "Before we can do too much more (on trade) we have to put forth an economic agenda that gives some sense of security to American workers and businesses across the country that somebody is looking out for them," Pelosi said. U.S. labor groups, a core base of support for Democrats, strongly oppose the trade pact on the grounds Colombia has not done enough to stop murders of trade unionists and put their killers in jail. In Bogota, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said Colombia wanted positive relations with both U.S. Republicans and Democrats and urged Pelosi to visit to see the progress the country has already made. "We don't hide our problems and we recognize where we need to do more ... I hope we get a visit from the leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, so she can take an objective look at what is happening in Colombia," Uribe said. John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, urged the administration and Congress to begin talks aimed at bringing the agreement to the floor. "I think the fact of the matter is Colombia has the votes to pass if it comes up in the House," Engler told reporters. But he criticized Pelosi for "ripping up" a 34-year-old procedure for approving trade deals and putting the Colombia free trade agreement "in the icebox." "She's led her party into a box canyon they've got to get out. From the administration's standpoint, they shouldn't be gloating over it. They should be willing to help. We'd certainly be willing to help," Engler said. In her speech, Schwab said the Colombia agreement made good economic and national security sense. The pact would open a market "of 44 million potential customers to U.S. exports, while at the same time supporting one of our strongest allies," she said. More than 100 bilateral trade deals are being negotiated around the world and "we risk being left in the dust" because of the House action last week, she said.
