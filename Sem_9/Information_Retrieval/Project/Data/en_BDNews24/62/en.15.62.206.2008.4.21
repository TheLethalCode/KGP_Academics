 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks Monday witnessed investors' continued trend of buying and selling in major issues rather than opting for specific sectors. Bashir Ahmed, an investment consultant with brokerage house Stock & Bonds, told bdnews24.com that the market had been witnessing the trend for the last couple of trading days as retail investors chose to trade in market majors. "Investors, especially the retail ones, usually go for specific sectors in this market," Ahmed said. Indices on the country's twin bourses however fell after gaining the previous day with the total turnover slightly increasing. The benchmark DGEN or general index rose during the first one and a half hours of trade before witnessing a continuous fall throughout the day. It went down 10.08 points or 0.32 percent to close at 3081.36. The DSI or all share price index finished at 2596.16, falling 8.28 points, or 0.31 percent from the previous day. The bourse's blue-chip DSE-20 also finished 5.48 points, or 0.22 percent lower at 2398.65. Market watchers termed the day's trading flat as buying and selling occurred in a balanced manner. "In a nutshell, today's trading was flat with indices declining very little as well the turnover going up a bit. The continued trend of even buying and selling led the market to end almost where it was on Sunday," DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Turnover crept up to Tk 4.01 billion from Sunday's Tk 3.90 billion, with 22,982,758 shares changing hands. Of the traded issues 104 advanced, 140 declined and nine remained unchanged. Investors sold off issues that rose on Sunday, an official of brokerage house IDLC Securities told bdnews24.com. "However, majors in banks, oil companies, cement and footwear finished higher on buying pressure," he added. Jamuna Oil topped the turnover board, rising 7.33 percent to Tk 307.40. AB Bank followed it to end on Tk 3771.25, up 0.49 percent. Square Textile fell on profit-taking after Sunday's gains. It closed 7.01 percent down at Tk 135.10.
