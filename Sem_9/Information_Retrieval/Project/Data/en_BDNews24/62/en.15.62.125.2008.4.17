<TITLE> AFC Vision Asia set for fresh start in Bangladesh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com) - The Vision Bangladesh project under the Vision Asia plan taken up by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is being revived in Bangladesh after a one-year break because of the Bangladesh Football Federation's lack of necessary steps. A three-member AFC delegation passed a busy time Thursday presenting the Vision Asia project before army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, also chairman of the National Sports Council (NSC) and president of the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA). Vision Asia is the AFC's grand plan for a continent-wide programme to raise the standard of Asian football at all levels, be it on the field of play, administration or sports science. The BFF officials, BOA senior officials and some club representatives from the professional football league exchanged views on different perspectives of the project that has now reached 10 countries. AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam has sent the delegation to brief General Moeen as he (Hammam) promised during his last month's tour of Bangladesh. The delegation comprises Dato Paul Moni, AFC general secretary, Brendan John Menton, Vision Asia director for national associations and clubs, and Imtiaz Rehman, development officer for national associations and clubs. Moeen, in his concluding speech, emphasised the need of having coaches at the grassroots level as Vision Bangladesh focuses on school football and youth competitions. "We need coaches if we want to develop football at school and village levels," said Moeen hoping that the AFC would continue to help train up the local coaches. He also assured the AFC officials that assistance of the local administration would be given to them. Moeen hoped that Bangladesh would come up to the prescribed standard after 10 years. Later at a press conference, AFC secretary Moni said, "It is important for all the stakeholders including the government, the NSC, the BOA and the BFF to cooperate with each other and work together to develop football in Bangladesh and make the Vision Asia project a success here." When asked from where the money would come, the AFC general-secretary, emphasising that money was not a big issue said, "If you can show that you are prepared to do something, there are people ready to come and help you." "We under the Vision Bangladesh will launch two pilot projects in two selected districts for 12 months within two or three months so that they can work at the grassroots level," said Brendon. Naryanganj and Chandpur districts have been selected primarily. When asked what the criteria to choose Chandpur, that has no football heritage apart from being the home of BFF president SA Sultan was, the AFC general-secretary said that they did not want to be biased as it would be a pilot project. He also added that they would bring more districts under the project if they succeeded in the first two districts. "Chandpur has been included in the project as some other districts were not interested because of some financial obligations," the BFF president said defending selection of his district. Naryanganj and Chandpur were initially selected two years ago when the Vision Asia project was initiated. But, the project was apparently suspended for one year as the AFC was more interested in giving the BFF a structural change and did not pressure it to implement the project. "The BFF is now on the verge of restructuring. So we have no problem to restart the Vision Asia project,' said Menton.
