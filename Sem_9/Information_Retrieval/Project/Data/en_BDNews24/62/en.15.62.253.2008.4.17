<TEXT>
 BERLIN, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew has told Kevin Kuranyi he has no need to worry about his place in the squad for Euro 2008 after the striker returned to form with four goals in one game for Schalke 04 this week. "If nothing unforeseen happens, Kevin will be at Euro 2008," Loew said in an interview with the Koelner Express newspaper on Thursday. "He did go through a weaker phase but over the last few years he's been convincing for us and always scored goals. He's a valuable player." The 26-year-old striker's four goals in the 5-0 win over Energie Cottbus on Tuesday were a timely reminder of his worth. Kuranyi missed the 2006 World Cup after losing form just before the tournament and there had been speculation in the media that history might repeat itself. Germany are in Group B at Euro 2008 with co-hosts Austria, Croatia and Poland
