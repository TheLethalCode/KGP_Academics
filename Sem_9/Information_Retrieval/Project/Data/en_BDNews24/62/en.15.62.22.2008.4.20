 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)The government Sunday approved Tk 1,000 crore in loan for Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation to help meet its immediate crisis worsened by the rising costs of oil imports, an official said. But the troubled state-owned entity missed out on Tk 7,000 crore in "rolling funds" as Bangladesh Bank refused to release the funds from its reserves. BPC chairman Anwarul Karim told bdnews24.com: "The government has given us Tk 1,000 crore in loan. As a result, we will be able to open L/Cs for oil imports." With the money, the BPC can tide through May, the official said. A Finance Division official said the BPC would take the loan at a 3 percent interest rate. Previously, loans had been ensured by issuing bonds with a 5 percent interest rate. The Tk 1,000 crore loan had been demanded from the Finance Division for the BPC, Prof M Tamim, special assistant to the chief adviser, told reporters. Earlier in the day, a meeting, presided over by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, decided that the government would take a $200 million loan from the Islamic Development Bank to fund the BPC's oil imports. The finance adviser said: "The IDB has insisted the interest rate should not be less than 5.5 percent, whereas we offered to pay 1.75 percent on top of the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)." Karim told bdnews24.com: "The crisis can be overcome for the time being if we get loans from the Islamic Development Bank." The BPC chairman said: "BPC owes Tk 3,200 crore to local banks. At present, the BPC has a reserve of oil for one month." Tamim said: "We have to re-evaluate fuel subsidy. If that is not done, the situation may turn worse." Costly oil imports pushed the BPC into a deeper crisis. The amount of oil subsidy goes up due to a rise in oil prices on the international market. On Saturday, oil sold at $117 a barrel on the international market. bdnews
