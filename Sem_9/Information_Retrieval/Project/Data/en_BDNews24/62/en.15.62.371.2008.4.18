<TEXT>
 PARIS, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained ground on Friday, reaching a 10-day high, led by rallying banks as Citigroup's results were not as bad as some had expected, adding to optimism about the sector's recovery. BNP Paribas rose 4 percent, UBS gained 4.4 percent and UniCredit added 3.3 percent. Societe Generale was up 5.5 percent, also lifted by speculation that a top management reshuffle could open the door to a takeover bid on the bank, hit earlier this year by a massive trading fraud scandal. At 1148 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 2 percent at 1,320.40 points. Pharmaceuticals also rose, with Novartis up 2.9 percent after a Morgan Stanley upgrade, while Roche gained 3.5 percent, bouncing back from recent weakness. The market got a boost from Citigroup in afternoon trading. The largest U.S. bank, reported its second straight quarterly loss, hurt by more than $15 billion in writedowns and increased reserves for credit losses, but analysts said that the numbers would ease investor worries. "That's not bad at all, compared with what we were expecting," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, investment director at 7 Investment Management, in London. Citi's results included $6 billion in writedowns and credit costs tied to subprime mortgages, $3.1 billion in writedowns for loans to fund corporate buyouts, and a $3.1 billion increase in credit costs related to consumer lending. The company also wrote down $1.5 billion of its exposure to bond insurers and $1.5 billion for auction-rate securities. "We are moving into a phase now where the banks are identifying the quantum of the losses. The reason the Royal Bank of Scotland will be looking to increase their cushion of support, is that they know they can only come to the well once to draw water. If banks can draw a line under this then you're okay," Urquhart Stewart said. Royal Bank of Scotland was up 2.5 percent. An industry source told Reuters the bank was set to announce a rights issue next week, in a move which analysts believe could raise over $20 billion and lead to similar action by other UK banks. "All the announcement of capital increases are obviously good news and it reassures the market that there will be no other Bear Stearns, which is the only message that counts. Earnings are not really important for banks at this point," said Arthur van Slooten, strategist at Societe Generale, in Paris. Energy shares rose as oil prices dipped after reaching record highs but remained buoyant. Total was up 1.4 percent and BP was up 1.7 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 1.9 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 1.1 percent and France's CAC 40 up 1.8 percent. But despite Friday's rally, analysts said risks remain for stocks as the U.S. economic downturn will prompt companies to lower their outlooks. "Profit warnings in non-financial sectors are not yet integrated in the market. And that is why there are such sharp corrections like Nokia yesterday," van Slooten said. "When profit warnings kick in, industrial stocks could react much more negatively than for the financials when they report bad results and writedowns. Just look at General Electric and Noki
