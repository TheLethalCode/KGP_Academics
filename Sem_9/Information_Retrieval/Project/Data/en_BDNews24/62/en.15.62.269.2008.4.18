 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Friday underlined the need for rural development. "People are heading towards towns because rural areas are not developed," the governor said at a reunion of Ratanpur Parishad at the national museum. "Our development is centralised. It is now time to develop villages and remote areas." He stressed increasing amenities in villages. He asked those who came from villages and became rich to be part of the development of villages. "Those who do not love their roots do not actually love the country," Salehuddin said. bdnews
