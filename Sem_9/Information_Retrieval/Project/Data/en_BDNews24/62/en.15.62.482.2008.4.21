 MADRID, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid moved closer to retaining their Primera Liga title with a 2-0 win away at Racing Santander on Sunday. Raul tapped in Robinho's cross early on and Bernd Schuster's men withstood some sustained pressure from Champions League-chasing Racing, before Gonzalo Higuain stroked in a second in injury time. Real's players swamped the Argentine to celebrate as the victory put them 10 points clear at the top of the standings with five matches left to play.

A Daniel Guiza hat-trick helped condemn second-bottom Real Murcia to a 4-1 home defeat against Real Mallorca that leaves them eight points adrift. Recreativo Huelva are 18th, level on 37 points with 17th-placed Real Zaragoza, who have the edge over them in head-to-heads after Saturday's 3-0 hom
