 HARARE, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said it rejected the partial recount of votes from March 29 elections which began on Saturday, and said it would not accept the outcome. The recount in 23 of 210 constituencies, which is due to take three days, could overturn the results of the parliamentary election, which showed President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF losing its majority to the MDC for the first time. Results of a parallel presidential election have not been released. "We reject the process. We reject the outcome of this flawed process," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa told Reuters. "The position of the party is we have nothing to do with the process." "It's not a recount, it's a discount of the will and the vote of the people," he said by telephone from the Midlands city of Gweru, where the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is recounting votes from seven of the 23 constituencies.
