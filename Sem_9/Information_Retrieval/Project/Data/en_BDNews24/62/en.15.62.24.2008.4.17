<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - African neighbors need to step up and help deal with the crisis in Zimbabwe caused by chronic food shortages and violence after recent elections, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Thursday. "It's time for Africa to step up," Rice told a news conference. "Where is the concern from the African Union and from Zimbabwe's neighbors about what is going on Zimbabwe?" She said it was up to Zimbabweans whether President Robert Mugabe steps down, but said the last few years of his rule had been an "abomination."
