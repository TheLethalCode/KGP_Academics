 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)  Last year's joint champions Usha Krira Chakra and Abahani Limited both moved into the semi-finals of the Club Cup Hockey tournament Saturday following comfortable wins at the Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. Usha thrashed Bangladesh Sporting Club 6-1, while Abahani cruised home to a 2-0 victory over Ajax Sporting Club. Both Usha and Abahani, from Group B, raised their point tally to nine from three outings, and are now set to face each other in their last group match. Old Dhaka outfit Usha went into the second half with a commanding 3-0 lead, after former national striker Rafiqul Islam Kamal found the back of the net twice in the first and ninth minutes of the game. Maksudul Alam Habul added the third goal in the 27th minute. Building on the commanding lead, Imran Ahmed Rubel made it 5-0, scoring in the 38th and 40th minutes. Jahidul Islam Rajon put the icing on the cake for the winners in the 52nd minute, before Abdur Rahman scored a consolation goal for a lacklustre Bangladesh Sporting Club squad five minutes from full time. In the second match, Moududur Rahman Shuvo gave Abahani a 28-minute lead before sealing the victory in the 57th minute. bd
