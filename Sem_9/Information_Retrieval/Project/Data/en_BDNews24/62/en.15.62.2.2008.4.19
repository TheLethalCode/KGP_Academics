 Canberra, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aborigines with didgeridoos and wearing loin cloths opened a summit of Australia's brightest minds on Saturday, with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd urging fresh ideas to solve indigenous inequality and ease climate change. "Today we are throwing open the windows of our democracy to let a little bit of fresh air in," Rudd told the gathering of corporate chiefs, scientists, unionists and central bankers, as well as Hollywood actors Cate Blanchett and Hugh Jackman. The two-day summit at parliament aims to throw up at least 10 big ideas to improve Australia's future by 2020, including governance, lifting creativity and how to narrow a 17-year life expectancy gap between black and white Australians. Other issues for the 1,000 attendees include tackling drought, how to spend billions of dollars from the country's China-driven resource export boom and keep economic growth rolling at near 3.9 percent a year. "We need to anticipate change ahead or else we'll be swamped by it," Rudd said, pointing to the rise of China and India fast re-shaping the world's future, before appearing to doze off in one televised session on climate change. Power participants included the chief executive of mining giant BHP Billiton, Marius Kloppers, and Australia's richest man and Fortescue Metals mining head Andrew Forrest, who mingled with military commanders and welfare workers. Treasurer Wayne Swan told economic thinkers, including Reserve Bank chief Glenn Stevens, they had "a hunting licence for new ideas" on dealing with an ageing population, inflation touching 3.6 percent and not squandering the resource boom. "Our terms of trade are likely to increase more in the coming year than they have in any year since the boom began," Swan said, just weeks from an austere May 13 Budget delivering a expected surplus of around A$20 billion to combat rising inflation. MAD, BAD -- OR BOTH Aboriginal Ngambri tribe elder Matilda House-Williams, wearing a cape of possum fur, opened the summit with a challenge to improve the lives of indigenous people, who often live in remote settlements with poor access to health and education. "I want to see our people healthy, living in this lucky country. That's a target," House-Williams said, urging Rudd and others to be open to ideas "mad or bad, or both". Rudd, whose centre-left Labor government ended almost 12 years of conservative rule in November, said he would respond to summit suggestions by the end of the year. "I say it's worth having a go through this summit, even if we fail. What is there to be lost from trying?" Rudd said. Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett, chairing a creativity brainstorming panel, brought her third son Ignatius, born only six days earlier. "Cate Blanchett is a superwoman. I think she is flawless as a person and I am thrilled that she is leading our stream," said fellow participant Hugh Jackman, who starred as "Wolverine" in the X-Men cinema franchise. ($1=A$1.07)
