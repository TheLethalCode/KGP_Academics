<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff on Sunday dismissed any doubt about the year-end national election. After attending an awards ceremony, the adviser told reporters that the government would ask the Election Commission to make preparations to hold the local government elections ahead of national polls. "The Canadian Awards for Excellence in Bangladesh Journalism", an initiative of the High Commission of Canada in partnership with Bangladesh Centre for Development, Journalism and Communication (BCDJC) were meant to recognise outstanding contributions in good governance, public awareness and democratic development. The award winners are columnists Haider Akbar Khan Rono and Iffat Zarin, Shaptahik 2000 reporter Jharna Roy and PROBE news magazine's special correspondent Anwar Parvez Halim. Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain, Canadian high commissioner Barbara Richardson and BCDJC president Nayeemul Islam Khan were present at the ceremony. Richardson spoke of the role of journalism, challenges journalists face and importance of "quality journalism". "Quality journalism has made major contributions to the growth of democracy and freedom. It supports the simple idea that people can govern themselves. As journalists, you inform the public about the issues so that they can make the right decisions for their lives," she said. Speaking on the national polls, the Canadian diplomat said the year-end election represents a critical moment in Bangladesh's history. "It is an opportunity for an historic return to sustainable democracy. Journalism is democracy's best friend and Bangladesh needs good friends today," she added. In his speech as chief guest, adviser Hassan Ariff said the media were like another parliament formed by "real representatives". "Media speak about people and raise public issues which help people make their decisions. The government gets feedback as well. So I would say it is a parliament of real representatives," he said. Speaking afterwards with the press, Ariff said that there was no doubt about the national polls by December. He also referred to a meeting with the Union Parishad Oikyajot, an organisation of local government leaders. "They urged local government elections prior to the national polls. And the government will ask the Election Commission to prepare for that," he added. The adviser, however, declined to comment on the dialogue with political parties. "I am not alone in the whole thing. There are others as well," he said. bdn
