<TITLE> Chile copper strike day 6: 2 Codelco divisions shut </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SANTIAGO, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chilean state copper giant Codelco's Salvador and Andina divisions will remain closed for a sixth day due to a strike by subcontractors, a company source said Monday, further denting the top world producer's output. State-owned Codelco said its Teniente division was operating on Monday morning after a series of disruptions over the weekend that forced it to operate on a skeleton staff. Subcontractors from the Confederation of Copper Workers, which groups more than 30,000 workers at state-owned Codelco, began a new Codelco-wide strike on Wednesday to demand a bigger share of windfall revenues given record copper prices and better work conditions. It is the latest in a series of sometimes violent strikes. "Salvador and Andina will not work during the day," a Codelco source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Workers scuffled with police last week, pelting buses with stones and erecting roadblocks. Codelco in turn lodged legal complaints accusing some subcontractors of holding its staff hostage. Andina, situated about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of the Chilean capital Santiago, produced 218,000 tonnes of copper in 2007. Salvador lies 685 miles (1,100 km) north of Santiago and produced 64,000 tonnes of copper last year. Teniente is Codelco's second biggest division, located 50 miles (80 km) south of Santiago. "If the violence continues as it is at Andina and Salvador, then the divisions will continue to halt their operations, because we are not going to expose our people (to danger)," Raimundo Espinoza, president of the powerful Federation of Copper Workers union which represents Codelco's permanent staff, told local radio. The Confederation of Copper Workers, which represents subcontractors, demands that Codelco fulfill agreements reached in July 2007 that ended a long, sometimes violent, strike for improved benefits and pay -- and has vowed to continue striking until those demands are met. Subcontracted workers want pay and benefits in line with those of Codelco's unionized employees who do the same jobs across its five divisions. Espinoza says there are 17,000 permanent Codelco mining staff. They also want the company to absorb 5,000 subcontract workers into its full-time ranks. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, has annual output of about 1.7 million tonn
