 CAMP DAVID, Md., April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush said on Saturday North Korea may try to stall providing a full declaration of its nuclear activities, but he and South Korea's leader urged Pyongyang to provide a full accounting of its program. "Now North Korea must fulfill its other obligations to provide a full declaration of its nuclear programs and proliferation activities in a verifiable way," Bush said at a news conference with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. North Korea, which tested a nuclear device in 2006, failed to meet a Dec. 31, 2007, deadline to reveal the extent of its nuclear weapons programs in a deal with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. If Pyongyang makes the declaration, the United States is expected to ease sanctions. A team of experts plans to go to the reclusive country next week to see if inroads can be made on finishing the report about its nuclear program. "They may be trying to stall," Bush said. "One thing about a nontransparent society where there is not a lot of free press, for example, or a lot of opposition voices, it's hard to tell what's going on." But Bush said the countries in the six-party talks with North Korea were waiting to see whether Pyongyang complies, and that he was "hopeful." Lee, the first South Korean president invited to Camp David, the U.S. presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, also expressed concerns about North Korea's nuclear program. "It's difficult to convince North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons program but it's not impossible," Lee said through a translator. Lee's predecessor, Roh Moo-hyun, sometimes frustrated U.S. efforts with his accommodating policies toward Pyongyang. North Korea was also supposed to reveal by the end of last year whether it had provided nuclear technology to other countries, a key concern of the United States. Lee said that temporary measures by North Korea were not acceptable.
