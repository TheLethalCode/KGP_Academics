 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was readmitted to Square Hospital Saturday for observation, officials said. Emerging from the hospital shortly after her admission, deputy inspector general of prisons Maj Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters that Hasina was taken to the hospital from the special jail in the morning for a routine check-up. "Hasina underwent a number of medical tests, particularly ear tests. She has been kept at the hospital for observation on the suggestion of doctors," the prisons inspector said. Prof Sanwar Hossain, head of the hospital's physicians' panel formed to treat Hasina, told bdnews24.com: "After her check up this morning, it was found that Sheikh Hasina's blood pressure was fluctuating." "She was readmitted to the hospital around noon." Later in the day, the DIG of prisons expressed doubt that the former prime minister would be able to appear in court Sunday for a hearing in the MiG-29 graft case. Siddiqui said that Hasina was doing well, but that it could not be said for sure whether she would make it to court the following day for the proceedings of a graft case involving the controversial purchase of MiG-29 planes during her term as prime minister. Dhaka Divisional Judge Golam Mortuza Majumder ordered proceedings of the case to be transferred on Apr 16 to the special courtroom at Sangsad Bhaban for security purposes. The hearing on charge framing was set to start Apr 20 (Sunday) in the presence of all accused. On hearing of Hasina's hospitalisation Saturday, the AL president's personal assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud told reporters: "Authorities are dragging her to and from the special jail and hospital." Mahmud demanded Hasina be released for proper treatment. The former prime minister and Awami League president was previously admitted to Square Hospital on Mar 11 and discharged on Mar 30. She was last taken to the hospital for a check-up on Apr 13. AL leaders have been demanding that the government send their party chief abroad for proper medical treatment, claiming Square Hospital's treatment has not been effective. Home affairs adviser MA Matin told reporters Thursday the government did not have any such plan to send Hasina abroad. The detained former prime minister was arrested on July 16 last year. She is facing a number of graft charges pending trial. Hasina appeared in court on Apr 15 to face charges in a graft case involving awarding of 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. The proceedings were adjourned for two days after she fell ill in court. bdnews24.com/l
