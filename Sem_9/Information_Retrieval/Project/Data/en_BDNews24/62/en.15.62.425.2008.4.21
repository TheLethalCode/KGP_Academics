<TITLE> Saudi `guardianship' key to women rights abuse: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIYADH, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's system of male "guardianship" or wide-ranging control over women lies at the heart of rights abuse in the conservative Islamic state, US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Monday. Saudi women must usually obtain permission from a "guardian" -- father, husband, or son -- to work, travel, study, marry, or get access to healthcare, the group said. "The Saudi government sacrifices basic human rights to maintain male control over women," Farida Deif, Human Rights Watch women's rights researcher for the Middle East, said in a statement sent to Reuters. "Saudi women won't make any progress until the government ends the abuses that stem from these misguided policies," she said. Saudi Arabia is one of the most conservative countries in the world, where tradition and the Islamic clerical establishment restrict women's movement, even preventing them from driving cars. Since King Abdullah came to power in 2005, the government has said it supports a reform agenda but that it cannot enforce changes if significant sections of society continue to resist. The government has allowed Human Rights Watch unprecedented access over the past two years, and more women have been able to enter the workforce. This year new regulations allow women to stay in hotels without a guardian. But clerics of the state-sanctioned school of Islamic law, a strict form of Sunni Islam often termed Wahhabism, see the "muhrim", or guardian of women's honour, as central to the system of social and moral control in place in the country. The rules -- the subject of heated national debate -- are enforced by the judiciary and a morals police body, both of which are run by Wahhabi clerics. "The authorities essentially treat adult women like legal minors who are not entitled to authority over their lives and well-being," the HRW report says, citing a list of complaints based on interviews with about 100 women. It says women cannot open bank accounts for children, enrol them in school, obtain school files, or travel with their children without written permission from the child's father. Women are also prevented from accessing government agencies that have not established female sections unless they have a male representative, and the need to establish separate office space discourages firms from hiring women, it said. Deif said the authorities had placed women in an impossible situation by holding them criminally responsible for their actions from puberty at the same time as imposing legal guardianship upon them.
