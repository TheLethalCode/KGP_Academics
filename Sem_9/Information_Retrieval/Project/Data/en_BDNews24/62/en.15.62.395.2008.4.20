 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)  The South Africa Academy team Sunday tasted its first win in the Grameenphone Academy Cup, when they handed a slim six-run defeat to the Pakistan Academy squad in their last group match in Chittagong. South Africa restricted Pakistan to 210 for nine in 50 overs after scoring a modest 216 all-out in 49.2 overs at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Naeem topped the score board with 80, although it was not enough for the Pakistan side to avert defeat as Shadley claimed five for 53. Earlier, Reeza Hendricks hammered out a respectable 84 to carry South Africa over the 200-mark. Meanwhile, Pakistan and hosts Bangladesh have already booked their berths in the final of the Cup, winning two matches each from their three outings. Pakistan and Bangladesh will face each other Monday in the group's last match. bd
