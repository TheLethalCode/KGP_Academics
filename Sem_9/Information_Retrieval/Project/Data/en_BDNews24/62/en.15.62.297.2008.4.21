 LIEGE, Belgium, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Standard Liege dethroned Anderlecht 2-0 on Sunday to claim their first Belgian first division title in 25 years.

If Liege avoid defeat in their final three matches, they will become the first side in 42 years to stay unbeaten for the whole season. After 31 games, unbeaten Liege top the table on 71 points with three games remaining with both Bruges and Brussels 10 points behind. Anderlecht and Bruges have shared Belgian soccer's top prize for the past six years. Mbokani put Liege, champions in 1982 and 1983, on the road to the title in the 54th minute when he latched on to a curling pass from Reginal Goreux and slotted the ball home. The Congolese striker doubled his side's lead and sealed the league crown in the 77th minute after racing on to a through-ball from Costa Santos Bonfim Dante and lobbing it over the Anderlecht goalkeeper. At the opposite end of the table, FC Brussels were relegated after a 2-0 defeat at home to Excelsior Mouscron.
