 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Officials warn that power generation in the country is unlikely to improve before the boro season comes to an end. With many parts of Bangladesh experiencing a heat wave, demand is set to remain high. The Met Office has warned the 'mild-to-moderate heat wave' is likely to continue for some time as temperatures reached 40 degrees Celsius in Chuadanga, the country's highest for Sunday. M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of the power, energy and mineral resources ministry, told reporters Sunday that the power situation may improve by the end of April. He said an idea had been floated to reduce power allocations for irrigation and increase the supply to the capital city, although it had been rejected in favour of maintaining irrigation needs. Sunday saw widespread power cuts throughout the country as increased temperatures heighten demand for electricity. The day's peak demand for power was 4600 MW, with an estimated maximum production of 3820 MW. Peak-hour load shedding was fixed at 658 MW. Power Development Board officials said the daytime load shortage on Sunday stood at 275 MW, while demand for the period crossed 4,000 MW from eight in the morning. Some areas of Dhaka experienced power outages up to six times over the day, with outages continuing for up to one-and-a-half hours. Various government efforts to save power have so far proved ineffective: including advice to households to rely more on their own generators during peak hours. The city corporation also considered shutting down the street lights on one side of certain roads in the city in addition to advising limited use of air conditioning systems. PDB officials said up to 400 MW could be saved if the use of air conditioning could be limited. Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company has asked certain industrial units to minimise their use of power by 40 percent during peak hours to increase the gas supply to power plants. However, none of the business owners has responded to the ministry directive. WASA's managing director for Dhaka, Raihanul Abedin, told bdnews24.com that the government's request to close water tank pumps during peak hours was impractical. "There is not a water crisis in the WASA area. There are problems in one or two areas but it will be OK. We are attempting to solve any problems using generators in certain areas," said Abedin. Meanwhile, the Met Office's chief meteorologist, Sujit Kumar Deb Sharma, told bdnews24.com that the elevated temperatures were likely to continue, although possible storms at the end of the month would bring the temperature down. The weather forecast until 6pm Monday said a mild-to-medium heat wave would continue through Dhaka, Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal divisions. A temporary gusty wind may blow over Tangail, Mymensingh and Comilla regions in addition to one or two places over Rajshahi and Sylhet divisions. Partial cloud cover will remain, although it is unlikely to rain. Temperatures will remain steady. bdnews
