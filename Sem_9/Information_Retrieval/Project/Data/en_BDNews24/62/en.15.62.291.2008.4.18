 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club Friday tasted their first win in the Club Cup Hockey Tournament when they handed a 2-0 defeat to Sonali Bank SRC at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. After the barren first half, Syed Al Masum put Mohammedan ahead four minutes into the second half while Jahid Bin Talib sealed the victory for the Motijheel-based outfit, who formed a mediocre team this season. Mohammedan, who played a goalless draw against Sadharan Bima, raised their point tally to four from two outings while Sonali Bank remained three from two outings. The day's other match between Dhaka Mariner Youngs and Sadharan Bima ended in a goalless draw.
