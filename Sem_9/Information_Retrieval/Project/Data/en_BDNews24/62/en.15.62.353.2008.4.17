 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP faction led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain did not sit in pre-dialogue talks with caretaker government advisers at state guesthouse Meghna Thursday. After a meeting with senior BNP leaders on his NAM flat near Sangsad Bhaban, Delwar told reporters: "I spoke to the commerce adviser (Hossain Zillur Rahman) a while ago and let him know we can't sit today." He said they would join talks if the government invited them again. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman went to the state guesthouse at 5.30pm. But they left Meghna shortly before 8.00pm without holding talks. Earlier in the day, Hossain Zillur sent an SMS to Delwar, inviting him to informal pre-dialogue talks, set for Thursday evening. BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy told bdnews24.com: "Hossain Zillur Rahman sent the sms to the secretary general." Earlier, the Awami League, a BNP faction led by disputed secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami held similar meetings with advisers. bdnews24
