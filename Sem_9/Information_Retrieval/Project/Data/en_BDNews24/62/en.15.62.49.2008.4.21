 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court deferred proceedings of a graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina as she could not appear in court Monday. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters: "The doctors at Square Hospital have said Sheikh Hasina needs rest, so she was not taken to court." On Sunday a hearing in a separate case against Hasina, involving MiG-29 warplane purchases, was deferred for the same reason. Judge Md Feroz Khan of Special Judges' Court -1 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, set the next hearing date on Apr 24 for charge-framing proceedings to continue in the case, involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge mounted power plants during Hasina's term as prime minister. The detained Awami League president was admitted to Square Hospital on Saturday suffering high blood pressure and pain in her ears. Siddiqui said Monday: "Hasina's blood pressure is now under control, but fluctuates sometimes after she takes certain medication. It becomes alright after she rests for a while." The court was set to continue hearing of a motion Monday by Hasina's lawyers to cancel all charges against her in the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people including the former prime minister. The anti-graft body accused Hasina and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdnews24
