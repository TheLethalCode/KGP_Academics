 Moscow, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian space capsule landed about 420 kms (260 miles) off course in Kazakhstan on Saturday but the three-member crew was safe, an official at the mission control centre told Reuters. "The capsule landed with an overshoot. Such things happen," said mission control spokesman Valery Lyndin. It landed about 20 minutes past its scheduled time. He said the crew had begun leaving the capsule, which carried South Korea's first female astronaut Yi So-yeon, U.S. commander Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko.
