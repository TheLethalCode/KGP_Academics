 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)--The country's prime bourse rallied Sunday on heavy buying, after the previous week's losses. Total turnover and trading volume witnessed slight declines from the last trading day. Brokers said heavy buying in banks, oil companies and pharmaceuticals among other sectors pushed indices up, while most mutual funds fell due to profit taking. "Almost every sector saw buying and selling today," an official of brokerage house IDLC Securities said. Investors did not opt for any specific sectors, instead choosing to trade on major issues in banks, oil companies, pharmaceuticals, footwear and cement, he said. "But selling outpaced buying in mutual funds," the broker added. Bashir Ahmed, an investment consultant with brokerage house Stock & Bonds, told bdnews24.com the market was acting quite rationally with investors exhibiting sensible behaviour in buying and selling for profit. The DSE general index maintained an upward curve during the first three hours. It remained more or less stable in midday trades before falling again towards the closing bell. The benchmark DGEN or general index gained 20.33 points, or 0.66 percent, to close at 3091.44. The DSI or all share price index finished at 2604.45, up 15.60 points, or 0.60 percent. The bourse's blue-chip DSE-20 also finished up 20.63 points, or 0.86 percent at 2404.13. Turnover fell slightly to Tk 3.90 billion from Thursday's Tk 4 billion from 24,671,241 traded shares. Losers outnumbered gainers 144 to 100, with seven issues holding steady. Banking major AB Bank topped the turnover board, closing at Tk 3600, up 4.48 percent. State run oil entity, Jamuna Oil followed, gaining 4.79 percent to Tk 286.40. ACI rose 8.09 percent to Tk 309.90. Meghna Petroleum also advanced to Tk 274.50, up 2.54 percent.
