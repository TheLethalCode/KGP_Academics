<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Saturday said Bangladeshis had to become more disciplined before a democratic social system could truly be realised in the country. The chief justice spoke as chief guest at a discussion in observance of Mar 21's Eid-e-Miladunnabi, organised by lawyers at the Supreme Court Bar Association. He stressed the overall importance of Islam at the gathering, saying the ideals of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) should be followed by those wishing to create a disciplined state. "Practising such ideals would enable us to remain free of any disharmony, alien cultures and corruption in our individual, family and social life as well as at the state level," said Ruhul Amin. "It would also rid us of the mentality to deprive others. So we must all take a vow to lead more disciplined lives," said the chief justice. Senior judge of the Appellate Division Mohammad Fazlul Karim also emphasised the importance of religion on the occasion. "Truth is the foundation of the judicial system, and if truth is established the life of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) would be reflected," said Karim. Voicing similar sentiments, Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury said: "Some people from America come here and speak of human rights and equality." "But the prophet and rightly guided caliphs established a bright example of human rights and equality 1,400 years ago," he said. bdnew
