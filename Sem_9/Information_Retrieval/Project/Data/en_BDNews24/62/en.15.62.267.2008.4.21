 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)Writer Momena Ahmed, the wife of the late chairman of Dhaka University's Applied Physics Department Sultan Ahmed, was knifed to death Monday, police and witnesses said. The police arrested a youth, named Faruq, on charges of being involved in the killing. Investigators are chasing the leads to the killing of the 65-year-old woman, who had also worked for Udayan School as a librarian. Security guards held and handed Faruq over to the police. A housemaid claimed that Faruq was held when he was fleeing the scene after slaughtering Momena at her Dhanmondi home at about 1.30pm. Quoting Momena's relatives, the police said the killing might have stemmed from her row with a publishing house. Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that the police would investigate the alleged links of the publisher in the killing. Momen's husband Prof Sultan Ahmed died in 1994. bdnews24.
