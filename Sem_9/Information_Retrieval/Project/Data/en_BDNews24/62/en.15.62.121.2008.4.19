<TITLE> High food prices could boost poverty: UN commission </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Santiago, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Surging world food prices could push millions of people in the region into extreme poverty, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) warned on Friday. Jose Luis Machinea, the head of ECLAC, said in a statement that the rise in prices for corn, wheat, rice and food oils, the diet mainstays of millions of Latin Americans, has accelerated and that the region's governments need to take steps to avoid big increases in extreme poverty. "The situation is dramatic for a vast quantity of people," Machinea said. ECLAC estimates that an increase of 15 percent in food prices would raise the index of indigence by about 3 percentage points, from 12.7 percent to 15.9 percent. It would mean an additional 15.7 million people in the region would fall into extreme poverty. ECLAC recommended public policies aimed at reducing increases in food prices or raising income levels for the poorest sectors, including reductions in taxes on consumption and income subsidies.
