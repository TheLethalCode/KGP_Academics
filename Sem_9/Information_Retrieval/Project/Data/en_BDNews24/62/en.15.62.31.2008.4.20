<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)The Jubo Mohila League Sunday demanded the unconditional release of detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. A group of party representatives submitted a memorandum with a copy of two lakh signatures demanding Hasina's freedom to the Chief Adviser's Office. Abdul Khalek, director (administration) of the Chief Adviser's Office, received the memorandum, but the delegates were not allowed to see chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury told reporters: "The country can get over the crisis if Sheikh Hasina is freed." The mass signature campaign proves that ordinary people also want her release, Motia said. On the chief adviser not meeting the representative group, she said: "The government is afraid of the humble programme." "We don't want the government's mercy for the treatment of our leader. Release her and we will make an arrangement for her treatment." Jubo Mohila League president Nazma Akhter claimed: "The chief adviser did not meet us although he approved an appointment. This is unfortunate." She also demanded that the 'baseless' cases against Hasina be withdrawn. Jubo Mohila League general secretary Apu Ukil said: "The government should release Sheikh Hasina immediately on humanitarian grounds, considering her physical condition." On the party's next move, Motia said: "We will announce the next move in discussion with the Awami League and other front organisations." bdnews24.
