 Maruf Mallick Energy Correspondent Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)Power generation in the country is becoming increasingly dependent on the private sector, according to the data of the Power Development Board. The private sector produces 28 percent of electricity, with the figure expected to be up to 34 percent if production goes up in line with the target. The government allocated a great deal of money in subsidy to attract private entrepreneurs to invest in the sector, power experts said. According to the PDB, power plants can produce 5,232 megawatts of power and those run by the PDB produce 3,778 megawatts. The Power Division set a target to add 1000 megawatts of power to the national grid by year-end. Of the 1000 megawatts, 330 MW will be generated by state-run plants and 630 MW by privately-owned ones. Two power plants in the public sectorone 90-megawatt combined cycle power station in Fenchuganj and two units with a capacity of 120-megawatt in Siddhirganjare set to come on stream in November. Six rental power plants with a capacity of 250 megawatts will start production by June. A 20-megawatt unit in Bogra started production on an experimental basis. Besides, up to 220 megawatts electricity will be produced in the small power plants expected to start operation in December. The plants rented for 15 years will produce 140 megawatts. A 40-megawatt unit of Westmont in Baghabhari is expected to start output in December. The government plans to set up four independent power plants, with a capacity of 450 megawatts each, by 2012: Meghnaghat power plants 2 and 3, Sirajganj power plant and Bibiana power plant. All the power plants in the private sector, if in operation, would be able to produce 3090 megawatts. The government gave the private sector permission to generate power in 1999. The government at the time formulated a policy in this regard. According to the PDB, the government buys electricity from the privately-owned power plants at Tk 2.41 per unit on average. The government paid Tk 800 crore in subsidy in the last fiscal year as it buys electricity at higher prices and sells at lower prices. The government assured the private entrepreneurs of gas supply gas to encourage investment in the sector. bdnews
