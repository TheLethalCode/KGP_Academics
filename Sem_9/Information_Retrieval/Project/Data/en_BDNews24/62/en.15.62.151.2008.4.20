 LONDON, April 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British police have arrested 15 people in an operation to break up an internet prostitution and sex-trafficking gang, the Metropolitan Police said on Sunday. Codenamed Gib, the operation, which began on Saturday, raided 19 addresses in central London, which police believed had been operating as brothels. Thirty women were taken from the addresses and are being looked after at a specialist centre, staffed with health workers and interpreters. The police estimate some of the women were being forced to work to pay back a debt bond of 28,000 pounds. "My officers are working with specialist support staff to speak to all of the women we've recovered to find out how they have come to this country and what they understood before they arrived," said chief superintendent Ian Dyson in a statement. "What is notable about this gang is the level of exploitation that the women had to work under - their debt bond are the highest we have ever come across - in the region of 28,000 pounds. Clearly we had to act. "We believe this gang have been running women of their own but also acting on behalf of other pimps selling on their women. This operation was designed to breakdown the criminal network exploiting these women." The 15 people were arrested on various charges of suspicion of trafficking into and within Britain, controlling prostitution for gain and money laundering, while a large quantity of cash was removed from the addresses. Conducted in conjunction with Norfolk and Surrey police, the operation is ongoing and London police expected to make further arrests.
