<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government is set to advertise for applicants to vacant vice-chancellor posts in selected public universities around the country, an official said Thursday. A search committee, formed to facilitate the appointments of vice chancellors, pro-vice chancellors and treasurers in public universities, took the decision in a meeting at the education ministry Thursday. Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud, who co-chairs the committee, has said the advertisements will not resemble those typically seen in publications. "It was very important to fill the vacant posts of vice chancellor in seven universities," said Prof Wahiduddin. A member of the committee said a decision was taken to collect the names of interested candidates to the posts. The committee will select the most qualified candidates before making its recommendations to the chancellor of the concerned institution. The education ministry formed the search committee on July 29 last year. Dhaka University, Rajshahi University, Jahangirnagar University and Chittagong University, which are run under University Ordinance 1973, have been kept outside the purview of the committee. The education secretary chaired the committee. bdnews
