<TITLE> Rentokil shrugs off profit warning, shares rise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A management overhaul at British rat-catching firm Rentokil provided breathing space for the support services company, which issued a profit warning for its struggling parcel delivery arm on Monday. Rentokil shares were up 4.2 percent at 99 pence at 1320 GMT, despite the warning on its parcel business, City Link. "The market appears to have been impressed by the candid nature of the newly-elected CEO and their approach to managing this business," Credit Suisse analyst George Gregory said. "Clearly the shares are commanding a premium for this very highly regarded management team," he said. Last month Rentokil hired the management team that reversed the fortunes of British chemicals group ICI. The new chief executive is Alan Brown, formerly ICI's finance chief. In May he will be joined by John McAdam, ICI's former CEO, who will become chairman, and Andy Ransom, another former ICI staffer, who will be responsible for corporate development. Rentokil acquired Target Express last year and has since struggled to integrate that business with its core City Link parcel delivery business. "The return of City Link to its former levels of profitability is likely to take some time," Brown said on a conference call with journalists, adding the performance from its other five divisions had been in line with expectations. The company said City Link had made a bigger-than-expected adjusted operating loss of 16.9 million pounds ($33.7 million) in the first quarter of 2008. "Although the full year outcome remains unclear, in light of first quarter trading and the current trends in revenue and costs, it now appears likely that the division will incur a significant full year loss," the company said in a statement. The company is expected to post an adjusted pretax profit for 2008 of 199.75 million pounds, according to Reuters Estimates. Rentokil, whose services also include cleaning, workwear and tropical plants, warned on profits for a second time in as many months at the end of February. Its shares have bounced almost 16 percent since March 20, when the company hired the ex-ICI management team. The new team will present its first quarterly update on May 2. Analysts at Merrill Lynch expected the new management to "bring a much clearer strategy for value creation" and "focus upon optimising capital allocation" rather than looking to quickly sell off assets. Some of that strategy was unveiled in conference calls with analysts and reporters, when the company said it will announce the opening of a City Link satellite hub near Heathrow in the next few weeks. Currently, all parcels are sent to Coventry for redistribution nationwide. "We do not need 94 depots, that is clear. We do not have an ideal hub configuration either," Brown told reporters, noting the hubs inherited from City Link and Target Express were 35 miles apart. City Link's headline costs in the first quarter rose to 112 million pounds from 84 million a year earlier. The company attributed 13 million pounds of the increase to acquiring franchises, 10 million to non-recurring costs and 5 million to underlying cost increases, including rising petrol costs. Rentokil had previously said City Link might not trade better than break-even for 2008, and it did not give an expected date for City Link to return to profitability. Some analysts are expecting a break-up of the group. McAdam sold off several ICI businesses before selling the whole business to Akzo Nobel for 8 billion pounds last year. "It is clearly too expensive but for the fact that we believe there is value in the partial break-up of the group," Seymour Pierce analyst Kevin Lapwood wrote in a note. "The new management has denied that this is its intention, but that seems to be posturing at this stage," he wrote. Seymour Pierce said a full break-up could achieve a valuation of 125p a share, and it kept a target price of 11
