 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation needs an immediate injection of funds to stave off acute fuel oil shortages in the country, the chairman of the state-owned entity, Anwarul Karim, said Sunday. Karim spoke to bdnews24.com by phone after an emergency meeting at the planning ministry, which sought to identify solutions to the crises. The BPC chairman said current fuel stocks would last another month at the most, which meant the caretaker government had to take out loans to fund imports of petroleum within the period. "Standing diesel stocks in the country will meet our needs for a month, although petrol and octane stocks may last a little longer," said Karim. The meeting, presided over by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, decided that the government would take a $200 million loan from the Islamic Development Bank to fund the BPC's oil imports. The finance adviser said: "The IDB has insisted the interest rate should not be less than 5.5 percent, whereas we offered to pay 1.75 percent on top of the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)." "We have no alternative to borrowing from the IDB regardless of the rate, we must import oil as soon as possible," said Azizul. On March 31, the BPC chairman said the government had decided to borrow $300 million from the Standard Chartered bank to fund petroleum imports, although no final agreement was ever made regarding the move. Karim said the caretaker government now needed both the IDB loan and the Standard Chartered loan to build sustainable oil stocks for the country. The BPC chief added that the central bank had already supplied the government with a $300 million fund for petroleum imports through nationalised banks, and further funds were not possible from the institution. "That is why we have had no alternative to borrowing funds from foreign banks at high interest rates," said Karim. Asked if fuel prices would rise under the circumstances, the finance adviser said the caretaker administration was doing everything in its power to subsidise fuel costs in view of the needs of farmers and last years natural disasters. Azizul, however, pointed out that it would not be possible for the administration to subsidise fuel prices indefinitely. bd
