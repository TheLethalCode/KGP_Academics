 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)  The GP-BCB Academy team Saturday confirmed their berth in the final of the Grameenphone Academy Cup after handing a massive 119-run defeat to their South African counterparts. The hosts bundled South Africa out for 127 in 42 overs at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, after posting a fighting total of 246 for four in 50 overs. The home side's total rode on two fifties from Mehrab Hossain Junior and Nasir Hossian. Pacer Nazmul Hossain (1/27) and Delwar Hossain (2/15) rattled through the top-order, reducing South Africa to 26 for three in two overs. The visitors never looked like recovering from the damage and were ultimately skittled out for a paltry 127. The defeat marked their third consecutive loss  two against Bangladesh and one against Pakistan. Mathew Arnold topped the score board with 25, as spinners Suhrawardi Shuvo (2/27), Nasir Hossain (2/25), Arafat Sunny (1/17) and Farhad Hossain (1/8) wiped out the visitors innings. Deciding to bat first, Bangladesh looked shaky in the early stages with 61 for three in 15.4 overs, before Mehrab and Nasir rescued the home side. Mehrab's pairing with Mushfiqur Rahim (35) put on 58 runs for the fourth wicket and he added another 124 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket with Nasir, who scored an unbeaten 54 off 66 balls, hitting five boundaries along the way. Mehrab remained unconquered with 89 off 107 balls, a total that featured eight fours. The South Africa Academy team will play their fourth match Sunday against Pakistan, who have already confirmed their final berth after beating Bangladesh and South Africa in their first two matches. The hosts will face Pakistan Sunday in group's last match. bd
