<TITLE> Freedom for Hasina, Khaleda may figure in dialogue: Iqbal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)  Demand for the freedom of former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia is likely to figure in the agenda of formal dialogue between political parties and the government, an adviser said Sunday. "But in informal talks, we are not discussing the freedom of the two leaders. We are now setting the modality of formal dialogue," LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters at the secretariat. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader said the government hoped dialogue would be successful. But neither of the advisers said when the formal dialogue would start. "Pre-dialogue talks are almost over," Ghulam Quader said. The government held informal talks with different political parties, except for a BNP faction led by secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "The government will have discussion with the BNP faction when its leaders join us for talks," Quader said. Asked if the political parties' demand to free their leaders would hamper the dialogue, the adviser said: "Our talks were neither hampered nor went in vain." "We are receiving feedback from the political parties," he added. Five caretaker government advisers, including Ghulam Quader and Anwarul Iqbal, held informal talks with the Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami. Three others are law adviser Hassan Ariff, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. bdnews24.c
