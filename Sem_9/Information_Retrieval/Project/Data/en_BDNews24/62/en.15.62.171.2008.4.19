<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 19(bdnews24.com)--Retired Air Marshal A K Khondakar, convener of the Sector Commanders' Forum, said on Saturday that all political parties must have the trial of 'war criminals' high in their manifestoes for the forthcoming elections. "The nation can have no salvation without trial of war criminals. If the people of the country raise their voice in unison, no government can ignore it," he urged. He made the comments at the unveiling of the book 'Muktijuddho - Dalal Ainay Sajaprapta Juddhaparadi' (Liberation War - War criminals convicted under the Collaborators' Act) edited by ASM Shamsul Arefin evening. AK Khondakar said at the ceremony, organised by the Combined Youth Professional Council at the Mukitijuddho Museum: "All political parties must pledge at the top of their manifestoes that all war criminals will be tried. Our request will be that no party should have any political link with war criminals". He also said that the Sector Commanders' Forum would request the Election Commission that no war criminal be allowed to participate in the election. Also present at the book launch, Dhaka University history professor Muntasir Mamun termed the caretaker administration a 'caretaker military government', saying: "Without political parties, it will not be possible to try the war criminals." Abed Khan, editor of the Dainik Shamokal, said: "Let it be demanded that the war criminals be punished, not tried. If they are punished, democracy will be established and bad-governance will go". Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak said that there was no alternative to the trial of 'war criminals'. In his book, ASM Shamsul Arefin said: "The trial of war criminals began after 1971 and 752 war criminals were punished. But the trial process was halted after 1975. The book contains detailed discussions on the subject of war criminals". Hasanul Huq Inu also spoke at the function presided over by Zakir Ahmed, president of the Combined Youth Professional Council. The book published by Bangladesh Research and Publications has been priced at Tk 60. bdne
