 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The Citizens' Rights Movement Saturday called for more effective legislation to check the ever rising population of the country, terming the issue the number one problem of the country. The organisation, comprised of concerned citizens, presented a comprehensive set of recommendations designed to mitigate the population boom at a roundtable conference at the National Press Club. "The huge population of the country has been a critical obstacle to all development activities and a major cause of environmental pollution," said Tushar Rehman, secretary general of the organisation. He added that the issue should be prioritised by the government and non-governmental organisations, and that incentives should be provided to create more one child families. "This should be identified as the number one problem in the country and an ordinance to solve the problem should be promulgated immediately," said Tushar. The conference was told if current population growth trends continue for the next 20 years agricultural land would shrink by 50,000 hectares. bdnews
