 LONDON, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sven-Goran Eriksson has played down talk of losing his job and said he expected to still be Manchester City's manager next season. Eriksson was talking after his team beat Portsmouth 3-1 in the English Premier League on Sunday and before a meeting with the club's billionaire owner Thaksin Shinawatra next week. Eriksson's future had been questioned after the ousted former Thai prime minister last week said he was disappointed with City's form in the second half of the season and would review the Swede's position. But Eriksson told reporters after Sunday's win: "I have been round too long to be worried about things like that. Am I worried that I still have a job? No, I'm not worried at all, absolutely not. "I think I will be sitting here in this chair next season. "He (Thaksin) said something, if he means it or not I don't know. I will see him next week." Eriksson added he was delighted with the victory which keeps alive their slim chances of a European place for next season. "This was important for the team, the club, the fans and with three games to play, we still have a small possibility to play in Europe so that's good," he said. The former England coach took over at City at the start of the season but after some fine results their form dipped. Sunday's win, coupled with last week's victory at Sunderland, represented their first back-to-back league wins since last October. Eriksson added: "I remember before the first game of the season I was asked 'what's the target' and we really didn't know as we were bringing in seven players and mixing them together. "After a while people talked about the Champions League, then the UEFA Cup then it was heads down for a bit but recently we have come back and are playing rather good football
