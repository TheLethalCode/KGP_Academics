 Washington, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Thursday that verifying a North Korean nuclear declaration would take time and suggested some US sanctions on Pyongyang may be dropped before it is complete. But she also stressed that if the United States later found that North Korea had not been truthful in the declaration, there would be consequences for the secretive, communist state, which conducted a nuclear test in October 2006. Separately, a senior U.S. official said an American team would visit North Korea next week to discuss how to verify the "complete and correct" accounting of its nuclear programs that Pyongyang was due to deliver by Dec. 31. North Korea's failure to produce the declaration has bogged down a 2005 multilateral deal under which the poor, isolated state committed to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs in exchange for diplomatic and economic incentives. The declaration has been held up partly because of Pyongyang's reluctance to discuss any transfer of nuclear technology to other countries, notably Syria, as well as to account for its suspected pursuit of uranium enrichment. Uranium enrichment could provide North Korea with a second way to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons in addition to its plutonium-based program, which it used to test an atomic device in October 2006. Under the second phase of the six-party deal, once North Korea has produced its nuclear declaration, the United States is expected to relieve it of sanctions under the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list and Trading With the Enemy Act. But many other U.S. sanctions on North Korea will remain in place. In the third phase, North Korea is expected to dismantle its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon and abandon all nuclear weapons in exchange for further economic and diplomatic benefits. 'NOT LOWERING THE BAR' "Verification takes some time because these are complex programs, this is a nontransparent society, there is a history here of surprises and so it will take some time -- even past the second phase -- for verification to completely play out," Rice told reporters at a news conference. "Whatever is done in phase two, if it's demonstrated in phase three that somehow something was wrong in phase two, of course, the United States reserves the right to take whatever steps it needs to." A senior U.S. official who asked not to be identified said later that meant diplomatic or economic steps. The Bush administration appears to have been stung by criticism from some conservatives that it might be prepared to accept a declaration that was less than comprehensive. "We are not lowering the bar," said this official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the diplomacy with North Korea. "If they took any actions to deceive ... there would be consequences. There are many levers at our disposal, unilaterally or multilaterally." The agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula was reached among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States in the so-called six-party talks.
