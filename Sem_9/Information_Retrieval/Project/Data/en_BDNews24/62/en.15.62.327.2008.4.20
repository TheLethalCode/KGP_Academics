<TITLE> Most French see no improvement under Sarkozy: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, April 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A large majority of French people think President Nicolas Sarkozy has failed to improve their country's situation since his election almost a year ago, according to an opinion poll issued on Saturday. The Ifop poll, to be published in the Sunday weekly Journal du Dimanche, found 79 percent of those questioned did not think Sarkozy had improved France's situation, against 59 percent who felt the same way in November 2007. A separate survey in the same newspaper found Sarkozy's personal approval ratings down to 36 percent from 37 percent a month ago. Prime Minister Francois Fillon, whose approval scores have been well ahead of Sarkozy's in recent months, saw his rating down six points to 52 percent from 58 percent in March. After a triumphant debut following his election in May, 2007, disapproval of Sarkozy's hyperactive personal style has eroded his approval ratings steadily. Growing economic worries, notably over the rising cost of living, have added a potentially more serious threat, given the limited room for manoeuvre left to the government by France's strained public finances. Tensions in the cabinet, reflected in persistent infighting among ministers, forced Sarkozy last week to threaten to sack members of the government stepping out of line with undisciplined public comments.
