 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)  Seven prospective bidders have submitted proposals on the 450MW Bibiyana power plant project. Mohhamad Abdul Jalil, director general of the power cell, told bdnews24.com the Bibiyana independent power plant project, which is expected to be in production by 2013 or 2014, will be implemented on a build-own-operate basis. The government will make a deal with the selected company for a twenty-two year power purchase agreement. The evaluation committee headed by the power cell chief will commence its review on Sunday and qualification will be announced within two or three weeks, said Jalil. Those companies that meet the pre-qualification criteria will be allowed to participate in the final round bid by May. The name of the applicants are: Summit Industrial and Mercantile Corporation Ltd and GE energy LLC (Bangladesh); YTL Power International Berhad (Malaysia); Ranhill Berhad, (Malaysia); Independent Power Corporation PLC (England); Globeleq Advisors Limited (England); joint venture of China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMEC), Shenzen Shenwan Power Gas Turbine Engineering Technique Company and Asian Entech Power Corp Ltd and OTOBI Ltd; and the MPC Consortium of Meiya Power Company Limited (Hong Kong) and Shasha Denis Limited (Bangladesh). Re-tender The power cell invited proposals earlier, in 2007, for the same project in which six companies submitted proposals. Malaysian company Powertek was selected, but the purchase committee cancelled the proposal as the price was too high and asked the power ministry to re-tender. Power was also asked to re-tender the Sirajganj 450MW power plant at the same meeting in November last year.
