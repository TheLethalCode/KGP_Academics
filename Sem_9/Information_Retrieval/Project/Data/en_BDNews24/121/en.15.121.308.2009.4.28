 RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Tue Apr 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani forces backed by fighter jets and helicopter gunships began an offensive on Tuesday against Taliban fighters in a key valley 100 km (60 miles) northwest of the capital, Islamabad. Military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said he expected it would take up to a week to clear an estimated 500 militants from Buner district, the latest target of an operation launched on Sunday in nearby Lower Dir.

"They should mend their ways, otherwise they will be responsible for the consequences," they warned. The London-based Amnesty International said on Tuesday that around 33,000 people were reported to have left their homes in Lower Dir over the past two days. In Swat, meanwhile, militants kidnapped three policemen and later killed one of them. "The dead body of one of them was found near Swat river," police chief Danishwar Khan told Reuters. "They are still holding two others." Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Kayani last week dispelled suggestions the country was in danger of falling into the hands of Taliban, saying security forces had halted operations against the militants to give politicians the chance to negotiate a settle
