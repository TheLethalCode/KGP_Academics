<TITLE> Turkey says agrees framework for ties with Armenia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISTANBUL, April 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey and Armenia have agreed on a "framework" to normalize their bilateral relations, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. The two neighbors are engaged in high-level talks to restore ties after the border was closed in 1993. "The two parties have achieved tangible progress and mutual understanding in this process and they have agreed on a comprehensive framework for the normalization of their bilateral relations," a statement said late on Wednesday. There was no immediate comment from Armenia's government. The statement did not say how they would tackle a bitter dispute over Ottoman-era killings of ethnic Armenians nor if Ankara and Yerevan had reached an agreement to open the border. The statement comes one day before Armenia commemorates the anniversary of the 1915 killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks. Turkey strongly denies Armenian claims the killings amounted to genocide. U.S. President Barack Obama, during a visit to Turkey earlier this month, called on Turkey and Armenia to make progress on the negotiations. A breakthrough between Turkey and Armenia could help shore up stability in the volatile, oil-rich Caucasus.
