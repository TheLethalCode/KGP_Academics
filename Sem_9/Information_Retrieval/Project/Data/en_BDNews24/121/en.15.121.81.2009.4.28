<TITLE> 10-man Bangladesh lose to Myanmar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)  Ten-man Bangladesh on Tuesday went 2-1 down to Myanmar in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers, but the hosts still have a chance to qualify for the eight-team finals. Myanmar with six points have almost confirmed their berth from the Group A qualifiers and now need just a draw against Cambodia, who defeated Macau 2-1 in the day's first match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. If Bangladesh can finish Group A runners-up after beating Macau on Thursday, then they will be thrown in the eight-team finals as the best runners-up among four groups on goal difference with Maldives. There were no signs of what Bangladesh put up against Cambodia in the match as the players were always running behind the Myanmar players, who showed why they are 19 steps ahead of Bangladesh in the FIFA rankings. Bangladesh were beaten in every department with a defensive strategy of 5-4-1 and they could not survive against Myanmar's skill, speed and game-plan despite taking the lead in the 12th minute. Myanmar were awarded a penalty inside 60 seconds when defender Mamun Mia charged Yaza Win Thein down from behind inside the box. Goalkeeper Aminul Haq, however, gave Bangladesh a lifeline blocking the spot kick taken by Myanmar captain Myo Min Tun with his outstretched right hand. It should have been a wake-up call for the hosts, who never took control in the midfield throughout the 90-minute game as the Myanmar players foiled any Bangladesh attack. Despite enjoying midfield dominance, Bangladesh went ahead in the 12th minute when Enamul Haq, who also struck against Cambodia, headed an Emon Mahmud corner kick home. Bangladesh then were seemingly busy foiling the opponent attacks and thus completed the first half. It was the same story after the break with Bangladesh allowing Myanmar to control ball possession and the pressure yielded a levelling chance seven minutes into the second half. Yaza Win Thein smashed a Pyaye Phyo OO cross that beat the Bangladesh goalkeeper, but the shot came off hitting the sidebar. Myanmar coach Tun Mvint Aung sent on midfielder Pai Seo in place of BO Bo Aung after 63 minutes and the midfielder made his mark four minutes later. Myo Min Tun, who constantly broke through Bangladesh's right side defence to put threatening crosses, whipped a cross from the right and Seo rose high to head the cross past Aminul to level in the 67th minute. The visitors could have taken a lead in the 71st minute, but Aminul saved the home again thwarting another efforts from Seo, who snatched the ball from defender Ranaji to enter the danger zone, but dragged the ball straight to Aminul. Two minutes later, Seo silenced the 5000-strong home crowd striking his second after Aminul failed to grip a Yaza Min Tun shot outside the box. Seo stood inside the box and did not hesitate to tap in from close. Bangladesh almost conceded a third goal in the 79th minute, when substitute Aung Kyaw Myo headed narrowly over the Bangladesh post. Stopper Nasir added more misery to Bangladesh's woes after picking up his second yellow cards in the second half and Bangladesh were reduced to 10 men six minutes from time. bd
