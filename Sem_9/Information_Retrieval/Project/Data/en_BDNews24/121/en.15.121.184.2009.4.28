 GENEVA, April 28 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday the evolution of the swine flu outbreak into a pandemic was not inevitable but countries should prepare for the worst. "Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic," Keiji Fukuda, WHO acting assistant director-general, told reporters. Fukuda said the organisation was turning its focus more towards the needs of developing countries in fighting the outbreak, which history shows usually get hit the hardest. "They really get hit disproportionately hard," he said. The new strain of swine flu virus that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico spread to more countries on Tuesday, raising the spectre of a pandemic and hurting financial markets.
