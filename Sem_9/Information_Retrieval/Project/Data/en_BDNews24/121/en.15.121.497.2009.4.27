 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies has recommended formulation of adequate law to prevent accidents the workers face in the workplace. "Workers are dying in the workplace because of legal drawbacks and negligence of implementation of laws," BILS secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told a press conference at National Press Club on Monday. The situation is becoming menacing by the day, he said in the conference marking International Commemoration Day for dead and injured workers in workplace accidents. The day's slogan is good occupational health for all workers. In a report, BILS says as many as 3,704 workers died in the last 10 years to 2008. The survey report showed 144 workers died in workplaces in 1999, 301 in 2000, 196 in 2001, 168 in 2002, 251 in 2003, 188 in 2004, 480 in 2005, 974 in 2006, 845 in 2007 and 547 in 2008. "We want a pragmatic legal protection to put an end to the deaths," Khan said. Many workplaces do not have proper safety measures, if the legal provision is not made stringent the safety of the workers will be ensured, he added. He sought assistance from the mass media to their campaign for a safe workplace. BILS secretary Wazedul Islam Khan, adviser council members Abul Bashar, Shah Md Abu Jafar, Mesbahuddin Ahmed, Delwar Hossain and Anwar Hossain were among those present. b
