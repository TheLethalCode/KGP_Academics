 Dhaka, Apr27 (bdnews24.com)The police are preparing an updated database of criminals, the DMP chief said Monday. "We are cracking down on crime in a drive completely free of political influence. No criminals will be spared," Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner AKM Shahidul told crime reporters on Monday. He said his force had apprehended over three hundred criminal since the start of a special anti-crime drive, but recovery of arms and ammunition was not up to satisfaction. The DMP chief said it would take time to formulate the updated list, and the special drive would continue until April 30. "The drive is being stepped up in the last days," said Shahidul. He said another special drive would commence once the database was updated.

CRAB president Akhteruzzaman Lublu, deputy police commissioner of Ramna zone, Atiqul Islam and other police officials were among those present. b
