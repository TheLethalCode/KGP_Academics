<TITLE> BDR, Nasaka talks end in discord </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)A flag meeting between sector commanders of Bangladesh Rifles and Myanmer's border force Nasaka ended with discord on Thursday. Nasaka said the disputed construction of an earthern weir was beyond 50 yards of zero point, in line with a "bilateral pact", and questioned BDR's opposition. Myanmar began construction of the earthen weir or embankment last Monday within 80 yards of Border Pillar 20, opposite Palongkhali under Ukhia Upazila in Cox's Bazar, ignoring objections from BDR. BDR has protested that the structure contravenes the distance set by international law. Major Tanim Hossain of Cox's Bazar-based 17 Rifles Battalion told bdnews24.com at the time that written complaints were lodged after Nasaka ignored several verbal protests from BDR, but they continued with the work. "They are doing this to put up barbed-wire fencing," he said. On Thursday, a five-member Bangladeshi delegation, led by 17 Rifles Battalion captain Lt Col Shakhawat Hossain met with a five-strong Nasaka group led by Sector 3 commander Major Aung Zoo at the Sector 3 headquarters at Dekubunia. Returning from the meeting, Shakhawat told reporters that Nasaka claimed they were free to construct any kind of structure at 150 feet (50 yards) of zero point under a bilateral border pact signed between Dhaka and Yangon on May 12 1998. But they could not produce any copy of the agreement when asked, he said. "We don't know of any such pact, and so we objected strongly to the construction of the embankment," said Shakhawat. "But they totally ignored our objections and vowed to continue their construction work." Shakhawat said they had informed higher authorities of the latest development. "We will take the next step based on their instruction." He also said: "We will continue protesting as international law does not permit construction of such a structure within 150 yards of zero point." Another BDR official Major Tanim Hossain who also attended the flag meeting told bdnews24.com that the second agenda of the discussion was the alleged deployment of the army to back up Nasaka in its disputed border activities. "But they denied the allegation," said Major Tanim. Nasaka claimed that they were legally constructing the embankment and admitted that it would be topped by barbed wire fencing. The border force also denied reports that Rohingyas were infiltrating into Bangladesh territory but urged Bangladesh to take action against the intruders, if any. Meanwhile tension is mounting in Palongkhali. Palongkhali Union Parishad chairman Mazharul Anwar Chowdhury Sifat said the area was inhabited by around 1200 people, who were "living in fear due to Nasaka's border activities." Myanmar began the disputed fencing activities along the Bangladesh border last month. The Myanmar ambassador was summoned by the foreign ministry at the end of March to explain Yangon's move to fence along the no-man's land. Phae Thann Oo said at the time: "It's not a defence structure. It is for prevention of narcotics and human trafficking." bdnews2
