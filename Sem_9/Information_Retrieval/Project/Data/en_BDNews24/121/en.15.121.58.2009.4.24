 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)The 16-strong committee tasked with devising a national education policy has failed to meet even two weeks into its formation on Apr. 7. No-one knows either when the first meeting will take place. A member of the committee headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury said she received a letter on formation of the committee, but nothing later on. "I didn't get any letter on committee's meeting," Prof Sadeka Halim of Dhaka University told bdnews24.com Friday. Announcing the committee, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid had said the committee will act fast to introduce a new education policy modelled on Kudrat-e-Khuda Education Commission and updated in line with Dr Shamsul Alam Education Policy. The Awami league government in its 1996-2001 stint had tailored the policy. Nahid had said, "We have asked for a report within three months so that we can start putting the policy into practice by this year." "The committee will have 90 days from its first sitting [to formulate the policy]." The committee members include Bangladesh Economic Association president Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman, and Shahjalal University of Science and Technology teacher Dr Muhammed Zafar Iqbal, among others. Nine education committees have formed to introduce an education policy since independence, but none of them were fully implemented. A number of educationists told bdnews24.com the government should form a permanent commission and put in place a policy so that the permanent commission can revise it regularly. Dr Syed Manjurul Islam of Dhaka University who has been involved with government education policies said there was no need for so many education commissions. "The education commissions of our country had no idea about the changes in the global education. "Since our government and opposition stay in north and south poles, so the recommendations of the education commissions were not implemented properly," he said. The policy should be based on ground reality, Islam added. Dr Mamatajuddin Patwary of Bangladesh Open University said there should be a permanent education policy, which will be revised regularly. "This calls for a mentality of approving of good tasks of the previous government," he said. There should be an objective and permanent education policy based on which human resources will develop, said Dr Kazi Saleh Ahmed, former vice chancellor of Jahangirnagar University. "The commission will keep an eye on the changes and amendments of the education system in the university, colleges and schools," he said. bd
