<TEXT>
 Wellington, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A group of New Zealand school pupils and teachers just returned from Mexico were quarantined on Sunday after showing flu-like symptoms. Public health officials said some of a group of three teachers and 22 students from a secondary school in the country's biggest city, Auckland, had shown influenza-like symptoms a day after returning from three weeks in Mexico. They were being confined to their homes while the results of tests were awaited. "We are taking this very seriously and doing everything necessary to manage this situation," the NZ Press Association quoted Auckland public health clinical director Julia Peters as saying. Local media reported that students from a second Auckland school also just returned from a trip to Mexico but had shown no flu symptoms. The deadly swine flu strain has killed up to 81 people in Mexico and infections have also been found in the United States. New Zealand activated its national pandemic disease plan, with increased checks of incoming international flights. "It is concerning for sure," said Health Ministry spokesman Michael Flyger. "You've just got to look at the WHO's advice on this, but it has shown it reacts to treatment so it's not as bad as it could be."
