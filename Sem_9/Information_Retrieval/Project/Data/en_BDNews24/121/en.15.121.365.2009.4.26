 Buner, Pakistan, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban fighters remained in a Pakistani valley near the capital on Saturday, but many had pulled out after quitting their main base, officials said. "They have gone, but left their germs here," Abdul Rasheed Khan, the district's top police officer, told Reuters. "Now we have about 200 local Taliban who can be seen on roadsides." The Taliban's entry into the northwest district of Buner, some 100 km (60 miles) northwest of Islamabad, alarmed Washington during the past week, as fears mounted over the nuclear-armed Muslim state's stability. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking in an interview with Fox News in Baghdad, said Washington believes Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is now secure "but that's given the current configuration of power." "One of our concerns, which we've raised with the Pakistani government and military, is that if the worst, the unthinkable were to happen, and this advancing Taliban ... were to essentially topple the government for failure to beat them back, then they would have the keys to the nuclear arsenal of Pakistan," Clinton said. "We can't even contemplate that. We cannot ... let this go on any further. Which is why we're pushing so hard for the Pakistanis to come together around a strategy to take their country back." Pakistan is a country the West dares not neglect. Its support is critical to defeating al Qaeda and the West's mission to stabilize Afghanistan. On Friday, guerrilla commander Fazlullah ordered his men to pull back to the neighboring Swat valley, and his spokesman said around 100 fighters were being withdrawn. Residents saw Taliban fighters abandoning their main base at Sultan Was village in the Buner valley. A senior security official said the Taliban should lay down arms, allow the police to carry out their duties and allow new courts, known as qazi courts, to deliver justice according to sharia law. "If they do not do any of this, the state will decide to go for an operation, and this time the operation will be on a larger scale," he said. While militants from Swat had returned home, armed fighters who hailed from Buner were seen moving around as usual, despite hundreds of police militia being sent to the district. "They won't lay down their arms so quickly," said Syed Javed Shah, a senior government official in Buner. "They know they have made enemies of people living here whose relatives were killed." Fazlullah, the Taliban leader in Swat, had forced the government to submit to demands for the imposition of Islamic sharia law across the Malakand Division of North West Frontier Province, which includes Swat and Buner. While the order for the introduction of sharia in Swat was promulgated by parliament and a reluctant President Asif Ali Zardari earlier this month, it has still to be implemented. Pakistani officials say the militants' move into Buner and Shangla, another district adjoining Swat, violated terms of a deal meant to keep the peace. U.S. UNEASE Western governments, worried Pakistan is sliding into chaos, want to see coherence and action, and Zardari may want to show some steel before talks in Washington with President Barack Obama and his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai on May 6-7. The International Monetary Fund had to save Pakistan from an economic meltdown last November. Peace talks with India were suspended after Pakistani militants attacked Mumbai that month. Senior U.S. officials have strongly criticized Pakistan's appeasement of militants in Swat, with Clinton having said the state had abdicated authority. Grave problems surround the one-year-old civilian government that took over after nearly a decade of military rule. U.S. commanders have voiced suspicions that some Pakistani intelligence agents secretly help Islamist militants. Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani issued a strongly worded statement on Friday to dispel doubts about the military's capacity and will to fight the militants. Overall insecurity has worsened with high profile attacks in Islamabad and Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, and the Taliban has extended its reach across the northwest. But the army has contained militant activity in the Waziristan tribal region and defeated them last month in Bajaur, the other tribal region regarded as a militant hotspot.
