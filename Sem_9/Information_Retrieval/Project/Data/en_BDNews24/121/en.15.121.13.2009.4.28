 Rajshahi, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  The acting Rajshahi City Corporation health officer has resigned after she said she was assaulted by two BNP-backed councillors. Dr Arjumand Banu said councillors Rabiul Alam Milu and Bazlul Haque Montu summoned her to the councillor's room Monday afternoon. But she did not go. She, however, went there when she was later called in by health affairs committee chairman and councillor Abul Hasnat. As soon as Arjumand entered the room, councillors Milu and Montu scolded and assaulted her physically, she said. Arjumand said she later tendered her resignation letter to the mayor's office. RCC secretary Imdadul Haque said he had heard about the resignation letter but did not get the letter in hand. bdne
