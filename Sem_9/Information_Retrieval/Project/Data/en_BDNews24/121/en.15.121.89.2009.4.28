<TITLE> All MPs to get offices in Dhaka: Speaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)All members of parliament will soon get personal offices in Dhaka, speaker Abdul Hamid has said. He said the old MP hostels adjacent to the parliament building would be turned into offices. "I aim to provide offices in the capital to all those MPs without them at present," Hamid told bdnews24.com Monday. The huge MP hostel complex has been lying vacant since members have been allocated NAM flats for living in city. Some rooms of the vacant hostels, however, have been illegally occupied for years. Abdul Hamid, accompanied by serjeant-at-arms Kazi Emdadul Haq, visited the hostel complex Sunday night to witness the problem. He said some illegal occupants were living there with families. "But I have ordered immediate eviction of all unauthorised occupants from the rooms. If they fail to vacate, they will face strict legal action," Hamid told bdnews24.com. Parliament secretariat sources say each of the MPs will get furnished offices equipped with computers and support staff. Hamid said the leader of the opposition, ministers, chief whip, deputy leader, deputy leader of the opposition, state ministers, whips, chief whip of the opposition, and parliamentary standing committee chairmen would not be among those getting new offices.
