<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)The Seventh Pay Commission, formed last year to review pay for public servants, has submitted recommendations to raise maximum salaries to Tk 45,000 and minimum to Tk 4,000. The 13-strong commission, which began work in late October 2008 with a six-month deadline, made the recommendations in a report Thursday. The finance minister AMA Muhith and the chairman of the commission Mir Mustafizur Rahman, speaking to reporters after a meeting, did not disclose details of the recommended pay hikes. But a ministry official said the maximum recommended salary is Tk 45,000 and the minimum Tk 4,000, and the total total cost of implementing the new salary structure would amount to Tk 6,500 crore. "I didn't go through the report yet, so I don't know by how much the commission recommends increasing government salaries," said Muhith. "However, hearing from the commission members in the meeting it seems their recommendations will cost the exchequer around 10 percent of revenue." The minister said the report would be made fully public in another two weeks following inter-ministerial reviews. On a query, the minister said the recommendations would be enforced in phases, as in the past. "It would require a huge amount to implement in one go; the government's capability should also be considered," he said. Mustafiz said his commission took into account the current inflationary trends as well as the government's income and expenditure. The chairman would not divulge the details of the recommendations. He did say, however, that the commission suggested widening VAT coverage and curbing tax evasion for extra revenue. It also recommended that the government form a permanent high-powered cell, rather than forming successive pay commissions every five to six years, to review salaries and allowances of government employees more frequently, he said. bdn
