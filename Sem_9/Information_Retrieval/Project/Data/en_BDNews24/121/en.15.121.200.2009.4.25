 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)Farmers are about to benefit hugely from the positive initiatives undertaken since the present government came to power just months ago, said the agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury Saturday. "The farmers now do not need to go in search of fertiliser, rather the fertiliser is seeking out the farmers," said the minister. "This turnabout has been possible because of the smooth and fair fertiliser management system of the incumbent government," she said. She also said that a joint meeting of three ministries on Sunday would set fair prices of rice and paddy in such a way that farmers would make fair profit after meeting their production costs. "The farmers would have benefited by now from government subsidies in the agriculture sector if national polls were held one month earlier," she said. "Agricultural production has suffered a bit in recent days for power outages, but the government has taken initiatives to ensure continuous power supply for farmers," she said . "It is because of this, city dwellers are suffering power shortages," she also said The minister was speaking at the launching of a project titled ILSAFARM aiming to enhance the livelihoods of Sidr-hit paddy cultivators in Barisal. Agriculture secretary CQS Mostaq Ahmad chaired the meeting in which US ambassador to Bangladesh James F Moriarty, USAID mission chief Denis Rollins and Barisal City Corporation Mayor Shawakat Hossain Hiron also spoke Moriarty said the ILSAFARM project would benefit some 14 lakh people, or around 2.8 lakh farmers' families, in 35 southern. He also said that the use of guti (granular) urea, a more efficient form, would cut use of the chemical fertiliser in half, ie saving use of 13 thousand metric tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. b
