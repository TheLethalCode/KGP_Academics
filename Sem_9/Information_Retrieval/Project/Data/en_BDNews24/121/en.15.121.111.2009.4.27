<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)The finance minister on Monday headed off any concerns over a new central bank chief stepping into the post ahead of the new budget and in the shadow of a global recession. "A new chairman was just appointed at the National Board of Revenue, but we're not facing any problems in preparing the budget," said AMA Muhith. "Likewise, we don't foresee any problem with budget preparation or combating the global recession as the new governor takes charge at Bangladesh Bank." The new BB boss is set to take over from May 1, he told reporters after attending a book publication ceremony at the public library in the capital. Media reports on Sunday announced that Atiur Rahman, a former BIDS research fellow who teaches development studies at Dhaka University, was set to replace Salehuddin Ahmed who ends his tenure on Apr. 30. Muhith said Salehuddin, discharging his duties over the past four years, had established the central bank "as an institution". Any new governor replacing him would also work with all in service of the institution, he said. The government may announce the new central bank boss on Tuesday, he said. "Newspapers have named a possible new governor, but I won't comment on it." The government will choose the new man from among candidates picked for their experience in economics, banking and administration, said Muhith. bdne
