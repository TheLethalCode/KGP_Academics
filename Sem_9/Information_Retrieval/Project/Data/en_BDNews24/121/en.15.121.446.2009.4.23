 MINGORA, Pakistan, Thu Apr 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan on Thursday sent paramilitary troops to a district virtually taken over by the Taliban, a day after Washington said Islamabad had abdicated to the militants by agreeing to impose Islamic law in the region. Surging violence across Pakistan and the spread of Taliban influence in the country's northwest has revived concerns about the stability of the nuclear-armed state, which is crucial to US efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan.

Politicians who pushed the government to enforce sharia law in Swat have even begun expressing worries about the growing clout of the Taliban. "If the Taliban continue their advances at the current pace they will soon be knocking at the doors of Islamabad," Fazl-ur-Rehman, head of the Jamiat-e-ulema-e-Islam, the country's largest Islamic party, told parliament on Wednesday.
