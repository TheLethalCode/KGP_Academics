<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)A special desk is set to be opened at Zia International Airport to check the entrance of 'Mexico flu' into the country. The desk is likely to start operating on Wednesday or Thursday, airport director Syedul Hasan told bdnews24.com Tuesday. He said the desk would operate as part of precautionary measures against the spread of the deadly new flu strain, which had killed 149 people in Mexico, spread to North America and was confirmed to have reached Europe and possibly Asia by Tuesday. "Specialist physicians of the health ministry will take necessary steps after examining passengers from overseas and the airport authority will extend all out assistance in this regard," Hasan said. He said that the desk would subject any passenger showing symptoms of colds or coughs to medical test to detect if he might be suffering from flu. Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq said Monday that Bangladesh was on alert as fears of a global flu pandemic spread. Haq told bdnews24.com that different entry points across the country had been cautioned to watch for anyone entering the country with symptoms of the deadly new flu strain. "We have asked authorities to isolate anyone that shows signs of the flu," said the minister. "We have also asked local WHO officials to help us to detect any cases in the country." The World Health Organization has warned of a possible global pandemic triggered by the new strain, dubbed 'Mexico flu' after its place of origin. The US declared a public health emergency on Sunday as 20 people were diagnosed across the country. Cases have also been reported in New Zealand and Spain. The world's biggest drugmakers have said they are seeking ways to increase production of Relenza and Tamiflu, the two medicines that are effective against the new strain that has been found to be a combination of swine, avian and human flu. However, a vaccine would take weeks to develop, they say. Meanwhile, world stocks tumbled on Tuesday after seven weeks of gains as flu concerns intensified. Analysts fear a flu pandemic could force countries further into recession. bdnew
