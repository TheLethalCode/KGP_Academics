 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)Industries minister Dilip Barua unveiled the draft of a new industrial policy on Saturday, with a clear provision to halt privatisation of state-run businesses "Many privatised factories remain unused or non-functional under new ownership. In some cases, new owners sold off land," the minister said. "Privatisation should not mean an opportunity for looting," he said. The government will invest more in state-owned sectors, reopen closed factories and revive flagging industries, said Barua unveiling the new plan at the Sonargaon Hotel. Asked which troubled factories or industries would get preference, he said: "We will decide after reviewing the matter." The draft policy identified 16 sectors as 'controlled', that is defined as preserving national resources, national security and major infrastructure, where investment would require 'special' approval. The sectors include deep-sea fishing, private banking and non-bank financial institutions, insurance, power generation, refining crude oil and exploration, excavation and supply of natural gas and other mineral resources. They also include major infrastructure projectssuch as flyovers, elevated expressways, monorail, container depots, mobile and land phone networksairlines, seaports, satellite channels and casinos. Explaining the concept of 'controlled sectors', industries secretary Dewan Zakir Hossain said: "Investment for new projects within these sectors will need special approval from the government." The government's goal is for industry to contribute 35 to 40 percent to GDP and 45 percent to employment by 2021, says the draft policy. According to Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, industry contributed 29.7 percent to GDP in FY 2007-08, agriculture 20.9 percent and the service sector 49.4 percent. b
