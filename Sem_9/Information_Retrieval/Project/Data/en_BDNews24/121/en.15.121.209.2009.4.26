 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  First year honours classes for the 2008-09 session kicked off at Jahangirnagar University on Sunday, but, in a repeat of recent years, hundreds of new students were left without accommodation at the country's only 'fully residential' campus. The university claims to be able to house every student that gains admission, in line with its residential policy that states it is mandatory for all students to stay in halls. But this year as many as 1,400 students were attached to halls without being assigned any rooms, leaving them to face a severe accommodation crisis. Scores of students are now taking shelter in the common rooms, TV rooms, prayer rooms and guest rooms in the halls. The rest have been forced to find digs in Dhaka and areas surrounding the JU campus. The university authorities in a press release admitted that they were unable to provide room allocations for the first year students, and would arrange transport to and from Dhaka. Acting JU registrar Abu Bakar Siddique told bdnews24.com: "We have not immediately been able to provide students room in halls. The room allocations will be provided in phases. " "We have arranged five double-decker buses for their travel," he said. Construction of a new hall would also start soon, added Siddique. The university has 11 halls, six for male students and five for female students. One residential student of Shahid Salam Barkat Hall told bdnews24.com: "I applied here on the assurance of accommodation. The scenario is different now." "Why should it be called a residential university anymore?" he asked. The university has some 10,000 students enrolled in 26 departments, with accommodation for only 5,550 in the 11 halls. Most blame the crisis on the enrollment of as many as 100 additional students per department in recent years, with no new residential halls being built, as well as severe session jams. Moreover, many students of the ward quotaie, children of teachers and employeeslive in halls, against regulations. According to the university rules, students admitted under the ward quota are only to be attached to halls, they are not meant to get any room allocation. Established in 1970 in Savar, Jahangirnagar University began its academic activities as the only fully residential university in the country with just four departmentseconomics, statistics, geography and mathematics, with around 150 students. bdn
