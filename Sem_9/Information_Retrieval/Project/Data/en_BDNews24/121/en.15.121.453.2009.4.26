 Brahmanbaria, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  One of the major production units was back in action at Ashuganj Power Plant Sunday morning, after an eight-day shutdown for repairs, an official said. Unit 5, with a production capacity of 150 MW, resumed production at around 9am, managing director Abdul Khaleq told bdnews24.com. The authorities shut it down on Apr 18 with approval from the power ministry to repair a high pressure fault, said Khaleq. Another two units went offline the same day for repair work. One of these resumed last week, while a 34MW ST unit was still under repair Sunday. Seven of the power plant's eight units were now supplying 590 MW to the national grid, the official said. bdn
