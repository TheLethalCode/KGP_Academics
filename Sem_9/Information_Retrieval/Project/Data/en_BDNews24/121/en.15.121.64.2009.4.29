<TITLE> Deutsche Bank CEO pledges drive for growth </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's Josef Ackermann said his decision to stay on as chief executive has changed the dynamic of his leadership and there will be a "a new push" to expand Germany's largest lender. Ackermann's move to stay until 2013 removes uncertainty over the leadership and strategy of the bank in the wake of the worst banking crisis in decades. By keeping the bank's leadership team intact Deutsche will be better able to make an expansion push, he said. "It is obvious that if you are slowly approaching retirement, that you are not going to change a lot of things. Now I stay on for another four years...this will require some new dynamics," Ackermann told Reuters Television on Tuesday. "The setup and strategy will not change. But having said that, we will of course now sit together with the team and we will talk about what the next steps will be... We will discuss strategic and structural issues." "We will clearly have a new push, a new drive in the years to come. We want to be really much stronger in four years than we are right now." Ackermann played down the prospect of Deutsche Bank pursuing large transformational deals, saying such a move would be risky. But the 61-year-old executive said he did see potential for smaller deals. "In terms of growth potential. Yes, I see tremendous opportunities. We are operating in more than 70 countries. "Many countries have increased their global importance... China, India, Brazil many others have become so important and we are extremely well positioned in these countries. "So we should be one of the beneficiaries. And we have not exited any of these markets during the crisis.
