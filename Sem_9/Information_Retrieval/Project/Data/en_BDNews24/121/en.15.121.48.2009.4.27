<TEXT>
 BARCELONA, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Devising a strategy to thwart Barcelona forward Lionel Messi is Chelsea coach Guus Hiddink's main concern ahead of his side's Champions League semi-final first leg at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. The Argentina international is the top scorer in this season's competition with eight goals and Chelsea's task of preventing him from adding to his tally has been complicated by the suspension of left back Ashley Cole.

Midfielder Seydou Keita said the Barca players were well acquainted with their opponents and singled out Chelsea's physical presence as their main strength. "The coach is doing some great work in preparing us for the match," the Mali international said at a news conference.
