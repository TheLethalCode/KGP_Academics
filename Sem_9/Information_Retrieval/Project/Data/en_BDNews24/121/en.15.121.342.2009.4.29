 CENTURION, South Africa (Reuters) - Yusuf Pathan blazed his way to an unbeaten half-century to propel Rajasthan Royals to a five-wicket win over Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday. Pathan smashed 62 not out off 30 balls with three fours and six sixes as Rajasthan reached 147 for five to overhaul Delhi's 143 for seven with nine balls to spare. It was second-placed Delhi's first defeat in four matches in this year's tournament. Pathan and Graeme Smith shared an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 83 in 47 balls, with the South Africa captain contributing an unbeaten 44 after the Royals had slumped to 64 for five. Pathan, who was dropped on 30, brought up his half-century in 26 balls as the holders claimed their second win of the competition to go fourth in the table. Leg spinner Amit Mishra was Delhi's most successful bowler with three for 34. Earlier, Delhi won the toss and elected to bat. AB de Villiers (50) went to his half-century in 39 balls before being trapped lbw by leg spinner Shane Warne. The South African, playing on his home ground, and New Zealand's Daniel Vettori (29) rescued Delhi after they tumbled to 49 for four. Mithun Manhas also chipped in with 23 not out to give the innings late impetus. Seam bowler Munaf Patel picked up two for 14 in four overs with one maiden while Warne and England all-rounder Dmitri Mascarenhas claimed two wickets api
