<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)The BNP said Monday it would take further action if the government does not reply to the notice issued by party chief Khaleda Zia over her Dhaka Cantonment house. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters, just hours before, that the government would not respond to the notice, and the law would take its own course if Khaleda did not vacate the house within the given deadline. The former prime minister responded on Apr 23 to the government's notice to vacate her residence with a legal notice of her own. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokan sent the notice by courier and registered post giving the government five days to withdraw its notice. The directorate of military lands and cantonments had served the notice on Khaleda on Apr 20, asking the opposition leader to leave the Moinul Road mansion within 15 days. BNP leader Moudud Ahmed said they will press ahead with the issue after the party makes a decision, in case of no response from relevant authorities. He added that the BNP would also continure with its street protest programme. Moudud made the remarks at a roundtable discussion titled 'Two Months of Peelkhana Tragedy, Role of the Government and the Nation's Expectations' at the National Press Club. He was unhappy about the ongoing inquiry into the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny by BDR that left dead 57 army officers deputed to the border force, as well as seven BDR men and three civilians. The government is delaying on the probe and has decided to illegally cancel lease on the house to shift people's attention from the issue, Moudud claimed. The cabinet decided in early April to cancel the lease on the house given to Khaleda after the 1981 murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman. The cabinet decision came after days of clamour triggered by prime minister Sheikh Hasina's statement in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the February mutiny. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who later converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. b
