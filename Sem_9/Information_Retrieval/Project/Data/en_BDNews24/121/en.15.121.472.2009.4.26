 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)A development researcher is set to become head of the central bank. Atiur Rahman, a former BIDS research fellow who now runs an NGO and teaches development studies at Dhaka University, told bdnews24.com Sunday evening: "I'm on the road, returning from Nepal. I just came out of the airport and am on my way home." "I have received the news ... by phone," said Atiur, who was not scheduled to return from a seminar in Nepal until Monday. "But I have not yet received any official notice or letter." "I won't comment further today. I will speak with you all tomorrow after receiving the letter," he said. When asked to confirm, the finance minister, AMA Muhith, did not give a direct reply. "Wait until tomorrow," a smiling Muhith told bdnews24.com as he left his secretariat office earlier in the day. An aide to the finance minister, speaking anonymously, told bdnews24.com that Muhith had "already congratulated Atiur Rahman on his appointment". A finance ministry official, who declined to be named, had earlier told bdnews24.com that Atiur Rahman would be the next governor of Bangladesh Bank. The decision is to come just days before the incumbent governor, Salehuddin Ahmed, ends his four-year tenure on Apr 30. It would also put to rest speculation about an extension to Salehuddin's tenure in the context of the ongoing global recession. A professor at the recently-opened department of development studies at Dhaka University, Atiur Rahman will now have to deal with monetary economics as central bank supremo. During the 1996-2001 Awami League tenure, he served as a director of Bangladesh's largest Sonali Bank and then chairman of the state-owned Janata Bank. Atiur's research focused more on poverty, and the most acclaimed included work on char (shoal) dwellers and poverty alleviation. His appointment would create a unique situation at the central bankthe governor and all three deputy governors (DGs) coming from same class of the DU economics department. The three DGsNazrul Huda, Ziual Hasan Siddiqui and Murshid Kuli Khan are all career central bankersand their likely boss Atiur Rahman did their masters as students of the 1973-4 batch and actually came out in 1976 because of the so-called session jam. Salehuddin, a former civil service officer, was appointed to the top job by the BNP government on May 1, 2005 when his predecessor Fakhruddin Ahmed saw out his central bank contract. The twoboth also Dhaka University economics graduatesswapped their positions in 2005. Fakhruddin, who was later made head of the army-installed caretaker government in 2007, took up Salehuddin's job of managing director at Palli Karma Shayahak Foundation, the government's micro-credit lending arm. Salehuddin had earlier served as director general of NGO Bureau before landing the PKSF job. bdne
