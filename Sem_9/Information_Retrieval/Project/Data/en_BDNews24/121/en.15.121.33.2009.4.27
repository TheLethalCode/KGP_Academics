<TITLE> Parties may get more time over constitution, CEC hints </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission may extend the deadline for political parties to submit permanent constitution if they sought time, the chief election commissioner hinted Monday. "We will consider it if the parties ask for time extension to make preparations for council and other things to submit permanent constriction," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters at the EC Secretariat. The parties suffered disruptions because of many incidents including the BDR mutiny, he said. As many as 39 parties picked up their registration certificates from the commission in November last year after submitting amended constitutions. The parties said they would submit the permanent constitution by six months. The deadline for submitting permanent constitution ends on July 25. The commission is considering a change in the law on delimitation of constituencies, Huda said. "Taking into account the population growth we are thinking of bringing a change to the law to bring a balance in constituencies of the urban and rural areas." "We have spoken to the prime minister. We will provide assistance if the government asks for suggestions on the matter." The voter listing update will begin by the end of May or at the start of June, Huda said. "Updating on the voter list will begin countrywide altogether. One department of the commission will also work to give national identity cards," he said. The commission has yet to decide when the dialogue with political parties will start, Huda added. The commission had asked the caretaker government to formulate law in barring campaigns by the advertising firms for the Dhaka City Corporation polls. But the caretaker government did not do it, he said. The commission will pursue the issue with the new government, Huda said. He alleged that they would act against some prospective candidates for the DCC polls who were printing colourful campaign posters. bdnew
