 LONDON, Tue Apr 28, (Reuters) - Three Britons were cleared on Tuesday of helping to plot the deadly London suicide bombings in July 2005 in the first prosecution over the British capital's worst peacetime attack which killed 52 people. Mohammed Shakil, Sadeer Saleem and Waheed Ali were accused of scouting London for possible targets with two of the four young British Muslims who detonated homemade devices in coordinated attacks on three underground trains and a bus. Prosecutors said the three men were friends of the bombers, Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Jermaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain.

But the defendants argued their trip was to allow Ali to visit his sister and take in some tourist attractions. The court also heard how in November 2004, Khan, the ringleader of the 7/7 plot, recorded a farewell video for his baby daughter in 2004 before heading off on a mission to Afghanistan where he introduced two of the bombers and Ali as his daughter's "uncles." Police have always maintained that the 7/7 bombers had assistance from other people with links to al Qaeda as they would not have had the technical expertise to construct the hydrogen peroxide-based bombs themselves.
