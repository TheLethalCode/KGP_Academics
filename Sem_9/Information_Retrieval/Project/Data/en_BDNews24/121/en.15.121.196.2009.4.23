 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  No GMG Airlines planes took off from Zia International Airport Thursday as pilots of the private airline went into a strike over arrears in pay. "Almost two to three months' salary is in arrears," said a GMG official seeking anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Two flights were scheduled to leave for Kolkata at 7:25am and Kathmandu at 10:25am. The Dhaka-Chittagong flight scheduled for 1pm was pushed back to 8pm, said sources at the flight information wing at ZIA. GMG Airlines vice president, marketing and sales, Sadaat Rahman said the pilots did not fly 'due to some technical glitches', which were now over. "I hope next flights will go ahead on schedule but will be delayed," he said. The airline failed to get its proposed Dhaka-Bangkok flights off the ground as scheduled on Apr 10. Bangladesh's first privately-owned airline is running international flights to Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Kathmandu and Kolkata from Dhaka. It also flies to Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet and Cox's Bazar on on domestic routes. bdne
