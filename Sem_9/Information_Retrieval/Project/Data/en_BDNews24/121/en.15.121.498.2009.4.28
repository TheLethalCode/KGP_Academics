A cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister, approved the approved the Terrestrial Telecast Facilities Preservation for Bangladesh Television Act 2009 on Monday, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after the meeting. Azad said BTV would retain the facilities as a state-run institution. "The channel will broadcast parliament sessions and educational programmes when parliament is in recess," he quoted prime minister Sheikh Hasina as saying. "Bangladesh Television will launch another channel if necessary," he said. PM relinquishes chancellorships The prime minister has decided to hand over her chancellorship of seven public universities to the president, said Azad. The universities are National University, Open University, Jagannath University, Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, Islami University in Kushtia, Kazi Nazrul Islam University in Mymensingh and Agriculture University in Sylhet. The cabinet approved eight bills to transfer the post of chancellor of the universities to the president. The cabinet members thanked the prime minister for her decision but requested her to retain the post at a few universities. In reply, the prime minister said, "The prime minister cannot be the chancellor of universities as the chief executive of the government." Support for expatriates The cabinet will ask all officials of Bangladesh missions abroad to provide all support and cooperation to expatriate Bangladeshis. The prime minister informed the cabinet of the details of her Saudi Arabia trip last week. Azad said expatriates in Saudi Arabia had complained to the prime minister of misbehaviour by Bangladesh embassy officials. Hasina said she had heard of such complaints not only in Saudi Arabia but also of missions in many other countries. "The officials should be more sincere in solving the expatriates' problems," she said. The press secretary said the Saudi king had assured Hasina of allowing Bangladeshi workers flexibility with regards to their work permits, to allow them to switch their jobs. He said the prime minister had also sought land from the Saudi government to build accomodation in Mecca for Bangladeshi hajj pilgrims. She also expressed her interest to build schools for the children of expatriate Bangladeshis in Mecca and Medina. bdnews24.c
