<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  A three-member lawyers' panel appointed in the BDR mutiny case will play an advisory role for the ongoing probe to avoid any legal tangles when the case comes to trial, the law minister said Tuesday. "The lawyers will provide legal assistance for transparent investigation of the case," minister Shafiq Ahmed told a press briefing at the Secretariat. The government on Monday appointed the panel, headed by advocate Annisul Haq, with advocates Syed Haider Ali and Mosharraf Hossain as members. On whether the trial was going to be held under military or civilian laws, he said: "I have said before and say again that the decision on the trialprocess will be made after the investigation report is submitted." On the delay in war crimes trials, the minister said: "The government is advancing cautiously to ensure the trials are acceptable nationally and internationally." "That's why we are taking time," he said. Shafiq said he hoped the trials would end by December this year. "The government is not putting anybody under trial for political motives, nobody will be harassed on political grounds," he stressed. bdne
