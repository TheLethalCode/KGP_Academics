 WASHINGTON, April 26 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin received a U.S. federal court subpoena on Friday while on a visit to Washington, Kudrin's spokesman Pavel Kuznetsov said in an e-mailed statement on Saturday. "On April 24, an unidentified person handed over some papers to First Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin. Kudrin had no understanding about the content of the papers and immediately handed them over to one of his aides," Kuznetsov said in the statement, which was written in Russian. "As was established later, the papers were a notification, issued by the District of Columbia Federal Court, to testify in the criminal case against (ex-YUKOS CEO) Mikhail Khodorkovsky, which is being heard in a Russian court."
