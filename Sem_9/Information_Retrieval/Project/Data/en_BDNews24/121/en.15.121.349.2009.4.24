<TEXT>
 Durban, April 24, 2009 (bdnews24.com)----Bangalore Royal Challengers' bid to score a victory after two successive defeats was revived after a poor start by Jacques Kallis who scored an aggressive century to lead his team to 168. Kallis continued the trend of technically-correct batsmen enjoying success in South African conditions, employing a wide range of strokes on either side of the wicket to set Kings XI Punjab a challenging target under lights. Punjab, however, would have been grateful for a dry and sunny evening in Durban and could thank Yusuf Abdulla for striking at crucial moments to trip up Bangalore just as they were beginning to gather momentum. Abdulla, who had bowled three overs for 39 before this match, used a clever mix of fast and slow balls and finished with figures of 4 for 31. Bangalore's openers once again failed to put a partnership together with Robin Uthappa chasing and edging Irfan Pathan's wide delivery in the second over. It was the fourth time in as many matches that Bangalore were losing an opener for a duck (Jesse Ryder twice, Praveen Kumar and Uthappa once). Ryder, however, finally got off the mark this season, punching his third ball off Ranadeb Bose to the cover boundary. Thereafter, Ryder took a shine to Bose, pulling twice to the midwicket boundary and driving powerfully through covers to take 18 runs off the third over. Kallis started in high gear, pulling a short ball from Pathan over the long-leg boundary and lofting Abdulla's first ball over cover point for four. Ryder also hit Pathan to the point boundary and Bangalore seemed to have shrugged off their Powerplay troubles: their average in the first six overs was 36 runs for the loss of 2.33 wickets on average and today they were 48 for 1 off 5.1 overs. Abdulla, however, wrecked their momentum, bowling Ryder as he attempted to play a pull. Two balls later, he struck a tremendous blow, drawing Kevin Pietersen into spooning a catch to cover off a slower ball. Rahul Dravid once again entered with his team in trouble - 48 for 3 - but this time he failed to contribute. Tied down by the spinners - Bangalore scored only 22 between overs six and ten - Dravid attempted to smash Piyush chawla down the ground and skied a catch towards long-on. With the innings beginning to flounder at 73 for 4, Kallis took charge, making room to hit Yuvraj Singh's left-arm offerings inside out through cover. Ross Taylor also found his rhythm after edging VRV Singh for his first boundary and got going with a back-foot cover drive off the same bowler. Kallis and Taylor had added 61 in quick time before Abdulla returned to induce a mis-timed pull from Kallis with a slower short ball. Taylor continued to attack, slog-sweeping Chawla into the stands at deep midwicket, but he eventually became Adbulla's fourth wicket. Pathan picked up quick wickets towards the close and Bangalore finished about 15 runs short of what they would have aimed
