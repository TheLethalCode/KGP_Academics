<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, April 27 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Iraqi politicians on Monday demanded that Iraqi courts be allowed to try US soldiers who killed two people in a raid that the Baghdad government has called a crime. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday denounced the raid as a violation of a security pact, the first crisis in an otherwise smooth implementation of a deal that set a deadline of the end of 2011 for a full U.S. withdrawal. "What happened on Sunday shows the barbaric, brutal and criminal nature of US forces," said Ahmed al-Masoudi, a parliamentary spokesman for supporters of anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. "We must fulfil the articles of the pact by sending the personnel who committed this crime to Iraqi courts to prosecute them. The credibility of the U.S. and Iraq's so-called sovereignty are now facing a real test." The US military says the raid in Kut, 150 km (95 miles) southeast of Baghdad in Wasit province, was carried out with the approval of Iraqi forces, as required under the security pact. Under the pact, US soldiers can be tried in local courts for grave, premeditated crimes committed off base and out of uniform. Otherwise, they are subject to U.S. military justice. Close to 100,000 people have died in Iraq since the 2003 invasion, according to independent auditor Iraq Body Count. In that time, U.S. troops have killed many Iraqi civilians. But the Kut raid marked the first major outcry from the Iraqi government since the pact took effect on January 1. Analysts say Maliki may have been obliged to react strongly to shore up his image as a defender of Iraqi sovereignty. The U.S. military said the raid targeted Shi'ite militiamen supported by Iran. U.S. troops killed a man suspected of supplying arms to the fighters. A woman was shot in crossfire. Wasit saw fierce fighting during an uprising by Sadr's fighters last year, but like other parts of the south has since become largely quiet as Sadr's followers observe a ceasefire. Sunday's operation triggered an angry response from local officials and protests by mourners. A senior U.S. officer in Wasit, Colonel Richard Francey, said his unit was saddened by the outcome of the operation and expressed his deepest condolences. Two local Iraqi commanders were detained for having authorized it, the Defense Ministry said. SERIOUS CHALLENGE Iraq's protests are the most serious challenge yet to the security pact negotiated by former U.S. President George W. Bush. Its implementation has otherwise been relatively smooth even though many of its details are still being worked out. It sets 2011 as the deadline for the withdrawal of the US forces that invaded Iraq in 2003 to oust Saddam Hussein and obliges US combat forces to leave cities at the end of June. "There is no doubt that what happened is a violation not only of the security pact but also of human rights. We in the human rights committee believe an apology is absolutely not enough," said Harith al-Ubaidi, a Sunni Arab parliamentarian and deputy head of the chamber's human rights committee. "The U.S. forces must bear the whole responsibility and the lawful consequences for what happened. US forces must compensate the families of the victims." The area of the raid is part of the Shi'ite Muslim south where allies of Maliki made a strong showing in provincial elections in January, catapulting the increasingly assertive prime minister to political gains against Shi'ite rivals.
