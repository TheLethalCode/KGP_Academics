The first round will be held in seven venues (Patuakhali Stadium, Jhenidah Stadium, Mymensingh Stadium, Rajshahi Divisional Stadium, Noakhali Shaheed Bhulu Stadium, Cricket Garden Rangpur & Faridpur Stadium) across the country as the BCB tournament committee is organising the 37-team knock-out competition. "This is an initiative to bolster club cricket throughout Bangladesh. The league champion teams of the districts are participating. We have even included last season's league champions from districts that have not started their local league competition this season," tournament committee chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain said in a statement. The matches will be 50-over-a-side affair but in the case of a first round game not lasting even 20 overs the result will be decided by toss. Eight teams will advance into the quarter-finals which will be held in Dhaka. The champions and runners-up of Chittagong Division and Sylhet Division zone will join champions of other six zones in the quarter-finals. There will be reserve days from the semi-final stage. A club team will not be allowed to include players from a different district. This rule will be also applicable for registered cricketers of a local league who belong to another district. Each participating team however, will be entitled to register a maximum of four players from their respective local league clubs. BCB has introduced financial incentives for the championship.
