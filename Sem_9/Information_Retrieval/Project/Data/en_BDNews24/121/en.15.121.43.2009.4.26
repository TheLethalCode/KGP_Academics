 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain took a swipe Saturday at the ruling party's election manifesto, or 'Charter for Change', saying the opposition would not tolerate 'oppression' of in the name of 'change'. "We won't sit quietly if oppressed in the name of bringing 'change'," said Delwar, addressing a seminar at the Institute of Diploma Engineers. "It won't be endured." Delwar called on the government to take effective steps in resolving the country's water, power and gas crises. "If anyone even mentions the suffering of the people, they are threatened with 'an iron hand'," said the BNP leader. "What situation is this if we cannot even speak of the power and water crises?" He said people would undoubtedly resort to agitation if problems like power, water and gas were not solved soon. He called on political parties to be united on the issues. But, at the same time, he claimed that the ruling party had turned parliament into a 'house of rebuke'. He said, "The opposition is not allowed to talk in parliament, rather they are abused." "Parliament has been made wholly ineffective." He also called on the government to stop "clamouring" over BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's cantonment house and not to "take the issue any further". BNP ally, Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, also spoke at the seminar to mark the death of a Jamaat leader. Nizami termed the present situation in Bangladesh "critical", saying, "Madrasas are being searched for militants as a means to bring the madrasa education system to an end." "Efforts are on to establish one-party rule, BAKSAL, in the country," he said. "The forces of nationalism and Islamic values must unite to protect the country's democracy, independence and sovereignty." b
