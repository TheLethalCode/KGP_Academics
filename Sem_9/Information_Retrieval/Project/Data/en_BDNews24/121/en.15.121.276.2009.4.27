 KABUL, Mon Apr 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai confirmed on Monday that he will stand for re-election on Aug. 20, making official what had widely been expected. Karzai had long allowed it to be understood that he intended to run again, but had not formally announced his candidacy. A two-week period for candidates to register began on Saturday.

But none of his main opponents has broad backing or a strong political base. He has not yet said who will stand with him for two vice presidential posts, a delicate question in the ethnically-divided country.
