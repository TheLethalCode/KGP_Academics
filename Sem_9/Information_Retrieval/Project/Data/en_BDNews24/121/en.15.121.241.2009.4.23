 Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)  Nokia, the world's leading mobile manufacturer, has earned the right to sponsor the Bangladesh football team as well as be a youth development partner for one year. Nokia had earlier temporarily sponsored the national football team twice ahead of last year's SAFF Championship and the AFC Cup qualifiers providing Tk 26 lakh. This time, the mobile phone giant has come forward with a handsome Tk one crore deal for the national team and for the U-18 team. Officials from BFF and Nokia announced it at a press conference on Thursday, just four days before the start of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers involving hosts Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar and Macao. "We are proud that Nokia are with us and that has created a new dimension in our football history. We hope that this collaboration will enable us to bring fresh young players into the limelight," said BFF president Kazi Salahuddin. Nokia Emerging Asia general manager Prem Chand said that they were inspired by the activities of the Salahuddin-led committee during the last one year. "I am a fan of football and I saw the general people has a great interest in football and it was seen during the Federation Cup, B. League and Super Cup and it proved the present committee led by Kazi Salahuddin is very active, which was absent in the previous committee," said Chand. Chand said, "We here at Nokia are very pleased to be associated with Bangladesh football. "Nokia has always had a strong affiliation with football and we hope that through this venture we will be able to take the football scene in Bangladesh to a new level." Chand said that most of the sponsorship money would be spent on youth development and in particular at building the under-18 teams. The BFF president also said that the bulk of the sponsorship would be spent on developing the under-18 team through a talent hunting programme across the country as well as providing advanced training to selected players in a bid to prepare them for the national team. BFF vice president Kazi Nabil Ahmed, its general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi, BFF technical director Shahidur Rahman Shantu and BFF members Golam Rabbani Helal and Anwarul Haq Helal were also present. bd
