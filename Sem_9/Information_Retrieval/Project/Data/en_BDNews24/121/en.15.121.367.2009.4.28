<TITLE> Bangladesh to host two 2011 WC quarter-finals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will host eight matches including two quarter-finals of the 2011 ICC World Cup at two different venues. The decision was taken at a tournament's organising committee meeting held in Mumbai on Tuesday after the International Cricket Council recently removed Pakistan from the list of co-hosts for 'uncertain political situation.' Pakistan was supposed to host 14 matches including a semi-final, but their matches have been redistributed among co-hosts India (eight matches), Sri Lanka (three matches) and Bangladesh (three matches). Five matches including a quarter-final were allotted for Bangladesh at one venue (Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur), but now Bangladesh have got three more matches including a quarter-final and they now have to choose another venue for extra matches. "We demanded a semi-final in the meeting, and Sri Lanka then wanted to stage the opening ceremony and the first match. Afterwards, we did not stick to our demand," said BCB spokesman Jalal Younus after having talked with the BCB representatives. BCB president Sina Ibn Jamali, senior vice-president Mahbub Anam and director Shafiqur Rahman Munna attended the meeting. Younus said that the opening ceremony and the opening match would be held in separate days on February 18 and 19 respectively according to Bangladesh's demand as both had earlier been on the same day. According to cricinfo, India will host 29 matches including final and a semi-final out of 49 matches in eight venues while Sri Lanka will stage the other semi-final and 12 matches in three venues. The organising committee, headed by ICC vice-president Sharad Pawar, will include an operations and planning group comprising Bangladesh official Mahboob Alam, Indian board secretary N Srinivasan, Sri Lanka's Duleep Mendis and Shetty. The committee also decided to shift the tournament secretariat from Lahore to Mumbai. The ICC had to decide on the redistribution of Pakistan's 14 matches after it removed the country from the list of hosts because the "uncertain political situation" would have made it difficult to "deliver a safe, secure and successful event" in Pakistan. The subcontinent last hosted a World Cup in 1996, when India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka shared the games. The final was in Lahore, where Sri Lanka beat the favourites, Australia, in a famous win. bdnew
