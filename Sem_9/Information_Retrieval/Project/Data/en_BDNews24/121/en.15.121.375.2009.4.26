 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)BNP has said the foreign minister was wrong to say that prime minister Sheikh Hasina was the first Bangladeshi head of government to meet with the Saudi king in seven years. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, who accompanied the prime minister to Saudi Arabia, told reporters on return home Saturday at Zia International Airport that it was the first meeting between the Saudi king Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud and a prime minister from Bangladesh in past seven years. The foreign minister's statement is 'false and confusing', former foreign secretary and BNP chairperson's foreign affairs adviser Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury said at a media briefing Sunday at BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia met with the king during the OIC conference in Jan 2004 and the special OIC conference in Dec 2005 in Mecca, he said. She also met the king as prime minister four times between 2004 and 2006, had dinner with him and had the rare access to the Ka'ba during the OIC conference in Mecca, Chowdhury said. "Saudi Arabia has a special friendship with Bangladesh. The Saudi king plays a significant role in the Islamic world. It is not right to make such wrong information about him," he said. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan also echoed Chowdhury. Replying to a query, he said: "We will be glad if Saudi Arabia takes manpower from Bangladesh." The Saudi king assured the prime minister of solutions to the problems faced by Bangladeshi workers in the kingdom. "But we do not know whether there was any deal on the matter as there was no news in the media about it," Nazrul said. He said there was confusion of employment generation even after the solution to the problem of work permit or 'aquamah'. "If no jobs are generated how will the aquamah be implemented?" he asked. "We want Saudi Arabia take in more Bangladeshi workers. Why only 10 lakh? It can take even 20 lakh," the BNP leader said. b
