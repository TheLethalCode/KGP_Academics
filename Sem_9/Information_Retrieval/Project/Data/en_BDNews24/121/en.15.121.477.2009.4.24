 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong Hill Tracts should be freed from all intrusions by the military and the Bengalee settlers to help the indigenous hill communities preserve the pristine characteristics of the region. Retired professor Ajay Roy made the remarks Friday at a view exchange meeting titled 'A summary of the laws practised by the indigenous communities in Bangladesh' hosted by Sampreeti Mancho in collaboration with Oxfam. Chakma King Raja Devashish Roy presented the keynote paper embodying the laws that govern the indigenous people's lives and properties in Bangladesh. In his chairman's speech, professor Roy said, "The dacades-long presence of the military in the hills has given rise to diverse problems including cultural ones." It is just not understood why the army should be constantly keeping watch over the indigenous communities when inhabitants of other regions do not want any." If the characteristic flavours of the local communities' cultural expressions are to be preserved, the military and the Bangalees should move out of the hills, he observed. "A comprehensive language and cultural academy for the hills people may be established, leading to the path of founding an indigenous people's university eventually," said former justice Golam Rabbani. The law compendium developed by the Chakma king has incorporated the indigenous people's laws, the laws the government made for them as well as various charters and protocols relating to the indigenous people and their rights. Devashish Roy stressed the need for the government affording the indigenous people their constitutional rights. He said the anthology would come helpful to the judicial and administrative officials posted in the hills in discharging their everyday responsibilities. Roy criticised the law requiring governmental sanction for landownership transfer in the hills and demanded strict implementation of the indigenous people's quotas in education and employment sectors. Professor HK Arefin, women's leaders Ayesha Khanam, Rokeya Kabir, daily Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamol Dutta and indigenous people's leader Sanjeev Drang spoke in the meeting facilitated by professor Dalem Chandra Barman. bd
