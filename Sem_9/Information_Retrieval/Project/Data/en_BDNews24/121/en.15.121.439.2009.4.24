 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)Vessel movement at Chittagong port resumed after three days on Friday morning, the Chittagong Port Authority secretary told bdnews24.com. "Ship movement resumed at 10 am. By 12:30 pm, nine ships waiting in the outer anchorage zone entered the port for unloading their merchandise at different port jetties," Syed Farhaduddin said by phone. Earlier in the morning, he told bdnews24.com that 10 ships lay anchored at various port jetties and 40 ships in the outer anchorage. All vessel movement in Chittagong port channel remained suspended since Tuesday night after a cement clinker-laden barge sank in the Karnaphuli estuary zone. The CPA dredger 'Khanak' (excavator) was deployed to dredge the channel contiguous to the sunken ship, which helped in increasing the channel depth and width, Farhaduddin said. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin visited the port Friday morning and asked the authority to salvage the sunken ship and free the navigation channel. Amin told reporters that the government would soon take steps for procuring a recovery vessel and other equipment. The port officials assured the minister that the sunken ship would be salvaged and brought ashore within a week. Three private companies are carrying out the salvation work, aided by the CPA and Bangladesh Navy. bdnews24.
