<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  Injured strikers Jahid Hasan Emily, Mohammad Robin and winger Jahid Hossain have been drafted in the 23-member final squad for the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers, beginning on Sunday in Dhaka. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar and Macao will play in the qualifiers. Defender Ariful Islam and medio Pranotosh Kumar were dropped from the squad that initially included 25 players. Ariful was also dropped from the 20-member squad that toured Nepal to beat Nepal Police 1-0 in the lone preparatory game. "The inclusion of the injured trio means we have kept our options open," team manager Imtiaz Sultan Johnny told reporters during the practice session at the BUET ground. "Emily and Jahid have already been cleared for the game though they have recovered 70 to 75 percent from their injuries and Robin has been training with the team for a couple of days," said Johnny. The manager, however, said that doctor Prashanto Agarwal would let them know the final decision on Emily and Jahid on Saturday, a day before Bangladesh's first match against Cambodia. Ace striker Emily and speedy winger Jahid were seen on Friday stretching under the supervision of physio Dalilur Rahman while Robin spent a full practice session with the team. Though Emily and Jahid were cleared for the game, but they are yet to gain full fitness for a 90-minute game as both of them were out of practice for almost two weeks. Johnny also indicated that Emily and Jahid had no chance to play a full 90 minutes and the duo might be considered for 15 or 20 minutes if needed. The former national player's suggestion was also proved in the practice as Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido has been trying with new pair Enamul Haq and Mithun Chowdhury along with Robin, who was back from injury. Squad: Aminul Haq (captain), Biplob Bhattacharya, Mazharul Islam Himel, M Sujan, Wali Faisal, Mofazzal Hossain Saikat, Atiqur Rahman Mishu, Nasirul Islam Nasir, Rashedul Islam Rashed, Mamun Mia, Enamul Haq Sharif, Mamunul Islam, Jahid Hossain, Motiur Rahman Munna, Rajani Kanta Barman, Arman Aziz, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury, Imon Mahmud, Mejbabul Haq Manik, Jahid Hasan Emily, M Robin, Enamul Haq and Mithun Chowdhury. bd
