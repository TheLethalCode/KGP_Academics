 BASRA, Iraq, Sun Apr 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqis protested against US forces on Sunday after US soldiers killed a man and a woman in an overnight raid that was condemned by the provincial governor.

But Iraqi police Major Aziz al-Amara, who commands a rapid reaction force in Kut, said all of those targeted in the raid were innocent. One of those arrested was a police captain. "They were poor people. They do not cause any political or security problems," he said. The raid came just months before US combat troops are due to withdraw entirely from Iraqi cities. Such US raids are authorized under a new US-Iraq security pact but only with Iraqi approval. Kut and surrounding Wasit province were the last area south of Baghdad to be handed over to Iraqi forces last October.
