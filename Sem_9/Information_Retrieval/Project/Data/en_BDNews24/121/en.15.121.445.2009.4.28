<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)The CNG-run auto-rickshaw drivers continued with their strike through the second day Tuesday over their demands to run without meter. No three-wheelers were to be found on city streets for hire, deepening trouble for commuters short on public transport. But no unpleasant occurrence was reported. The drivers went on a wildcat strike Monday morning demanding cancellation of the Chittagong Metroplitan Police order on them to run on meter, cases and 'harassment' by the traffic police. They clashed with owners and police, damaged some 60 vehicles, leaving at least 20 people injured. Fifteen strikers were arrested Monday. The strikers vandalised other types of vehicles at a number of places in the metropolis and harassed commuters unnecessarily. Mostafizur Rahman, assistant police commissioner (traffic) said senior officers of Chittagong Metropolitan Police have convened a meeting Tuesday in view of the situation. Chittagong metropolitan CNG-run auto rickshaw workers' welfare association president Kamaluddin told bdnews24.com that they have given the administration 96 hours to meet their demands. The strikers will continue quitting the streets till their demands are met, he said. b
