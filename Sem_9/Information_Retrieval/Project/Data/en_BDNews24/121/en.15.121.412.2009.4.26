<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong port was marking its 122nd anniversary Saturday as the port authority announced six projects worth around Tk 1,500 crore to bring port activities up to speed. "We are happy at the port's development in recent years, though not completely satisfied," Chittagong Port Authority chairman, commodore RU Ahmed, told reporters at an anniversary programme. On a question from the reporters, he said, "We could offer transit facilities to other countries right now, with the port's current capacity and efficiency, if a decision was taken in this regard." Ahmed said the capacity of the port had already increased more than 100-fold since 2006, while trade volumehandling and transportation of export-import goodswas increasing ata rate of 10-12 percent every year. The port will gain even more momentum on completion of the projects next year, he said. The projects include construction of a new Tk 820 Karnaphuli Container Terminal at jetties 11-13, a new inland container terminal at Panagao for Tk 154 crore and Tk 114 crore for backward facilities at the New Mooring Container Terminal. The CPA chairman said private operators would be appointed next year to handle New Mooring Container Terminal. The other projects comprise capital dredging of the Karnaphuli river at a cost of Tk 411 crore, a computerised container terminal management system for Tk 37 crore and waste removal vessels and equipment to contain pollution at a cost of around Tk 34 crore. Highlighting the progress of various operational activities of the port, the port chairman said, "In 2006, a ship was in port for 7.1 days on average but now it takes just 2.48 days for unloading and loading." Similarly, it took on average 26.6 days to dispatch a container in 2006, which dropped to 18.28 days in 2008, he said. He said recommendations had been made for a separate pay-scale for port employees and initiatives had been taken to address the need for more skilled manpower. On another query, he said the port authority had no objection to trade union activities, which in the past had been blamed for much of the port's inefficiencies and delays. bdne
