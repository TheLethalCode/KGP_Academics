 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  Chennai Super Kings choked despite a Matthew Hayden blitz to lose by 9 runs to Delhi Daredevils who were propelled by an unbeaten century from AB de Villiers in the IPL match at Durban Thursday. Chennai required 84 from 10 overs, with eight wickets in hand after Hayden hit 57 off just 27 balls. And when Suresh Raina (41 off 27) got out, they were still the favourites with 51 required off 35 deliveries and big-hitting Andrew Flintoff and Ablie Morkel still in. They choked, though, losing wickets and imploding in the face of sensible bowling and sharp fielding by Delhi. Ashish Nehra clinched Flintoff's wicket to leave Chennai beleaguered. Earlier, Pradeep Sangwan took his third wicket for the day in the form of Suresh Raina who missed his well-deserving fifty. MS Dhoni failed to revive innings and gave away his wicket to Delhi's Daniel Vettori in their IPL match at Durban. Pradeep Sangwan struck for the second time to scalp Chennai Opener Matthew Hayden (57). Mighty opener Hayden smashed his fourth IPL half-century to lay a solid foundation for his side. Before this, Sangwan struck early to remove Chennai opener Parthiv Patel (16). South African AB De Villiers (105) hammered an unbeaten century to propel Delhi to a commanding total of 189 for fivethe highest total of the tournament so far. Tillakaratna Dilshan scored a 24-ball 50 to set the tone, while De Villiers hit a 54-ball century to propel Delhi after they were pushed to the backfoot by Chennai, removing the explosive openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir within two overs. De Villiers' innings was bejeweled with six massive sixes and five hits to the fence. Electing to bat first, Delhi Daredevils were left tottering at 8 for two with Gambhir losing his wicket in the very first ball of the innings. Gambhir (0) paid the price for being overconfident as he danced down the pitch in the very first delivery off Laxmipathy Balaji only to be caught behind by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Sehwag (6) soon joined him in the hut after he tried to pull a rising delivery of Manpreet Gony in the next over only to be caught by Albie Morkel at mid on. However, new batsmen AB De Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan joined the groove and shrugged off the early disappointment to notch up a 68-run partnership in just 38 deliveries to post 76 for two in eight overs. The duo took the attack to the swords and plundered boundaries and sixes at will with Dilshan leading the carnage with a 24-ball fifty studded with two sixes and seven fours, before being removed by Morkel in the ninth over. Dinesh Karthik then joined hands with De Villiers and the two brought up the 100 in 11.2 overs before Karthik was removed by Andrew Flintoff off Balaji in the 14th over. The South African continued the blitzkrieg sending the bowlers for the leather hunt and notched up a 74-run partnership off 34 balls with new man Manoj Tiwary contributing only nine runs. De Villiers exploded in the end overs and blasted a couple of sixes and equal number of fours in the 18th over off Flintoff to score 22 runs to score the highest total of the tournament. For Chennai, Balaji returned with the best bowling figures, scalping three wickets for 19 r
