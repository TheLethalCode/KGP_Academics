<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)The government will buy boiled rice at Tk 22 and raw Tk 21 and paddy at Tk 14 a kilogramme, the food minister said Sunday. A drive to buy some 1200,000 metric tons of rice and paddy will start from May 1 and continue until Aug. 31, Abdur Razzak told reporters after a meeting of food monitoring and planning committee under the ministry. If necessary, he said, the government may extend the procurement drive until Sept. 30. The minister said each kg of boiled rice will be bought at Tk 22, while raw rice at Tk 21. Government committees at districts and Upazilas will supervise the procurement drive at food-sufficient districts. The prices were determined after discussion with the representatives from the Department of Agricultural Extension and the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute and on considering the interests of farmers and consumers, Razzak said. The government has planned to collect 50,000 metric tons of raw rice for Chittagong and Sylhet divisions where people prefer such rice. The past caretaker government could not buy the same amount of rice despite setting a target last year. Razzak said, "The scenario is different this year. Price of rice and paddy is low in the market, but the government is buying them at higher prices." "So we are hopeful about fulfilling the target." bdnew
