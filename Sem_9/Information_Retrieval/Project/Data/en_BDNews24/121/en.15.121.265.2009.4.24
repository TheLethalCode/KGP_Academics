 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  IPS and automated generators, the last resorts during power cuts, are going haywire in these days of frequent outages, leaving the users who have spent thousands on the back-up systems grumbling. "I bought an IPS just three months ago for five lights and two fans but now it cannot run even one fan," said an exasperated Latifa Sarkar, a housewife at Lalmatia. It shuts down after 10 to 15 minutes, she added. Shafiur Rahman, a resident of Shyamoli, bought an IPS at Tk 30,000 for three lights and three fans which is now unable to power a medium-sized table fan. Like them many city dwellers bought IPS to beat power failures but the systems are failing them. IPS sellers and generator fixers blame frequent blackouts for the mess. "A battery can give full back-up support when it is charged from eight to ten hours. But now power goes out every alternate hour which hinders full charging," said SM Riazur Rahman Tamim, an IPS seller at Nurjahan Road in Mohammadpur. The performance of emergency bulbs are below par because of the same reason, he said. Every day, the sellers are facing loads of complaints from furious clients. Besides, computer, TV, fridge, air-conditioner and other electrical wares are also breaking down. "My clients are calling me up even at the dead of night when their IPSs don't work during blackouts," said Tamim. Automated generators are also going out of order due to excessive pressure. Generator vendors said scores of people are come to them with faulty machines every day. "Generator engine, battery and automated cogs are going down frequently," said Raja Mia, a repairer at Nilkhet. bdnewns
