 DUBAI, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has been reassured the International Cricket Council (ICC) will not abandon the country after it was stripped of its right to host matches at the 2011 World Cup because of security concerns. Pakistan was also barred from hosting any international cricket until 2011 due to the uncertain security situation after six Sri Lanka cricketers were injured in an armed attack on the team bus as they travelled to a test match in Lahore last month. "We did not agree on every point but I am confident the ICC is committed to making sure international cricket will flourish again in Pakistan," the country's minister of sport Pir Aftab Hussain Shah Jilani said in an ICC statement on Saturday. Jilani met with ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat on Thursday at the headquarters of cricket's world governing body to discuss the future of the sport in Pakistan following the ICC Board's decision. "Mr Lorgat has explained the decision-making process to me and the reasons why that decision was taken," Jilani said. "The ICC is a very important body and cricket cannot be revived in Pakistan without it so I am very happy that Mr Lorgat is determined to make sure the game survives and thrives in our country. "Having spoken to Mr Lorgat I now know the ICC will not let Pakistan cricket fall back during this difficult time." Pakistan is currently playing Australia in a one-day series in Dubai. Team captain Younis Khan this week appealed to the ICC to review its decision to shift the World Cup games out of Pakistan. "We all fully understand how disappointing it is for cricket fans, players and administrators in Pakistan. The decision was not taken lightly or hastily," Lorgat said. "The important thing for us now is to work out how we can prevent the game from suffering more than it has to. "Every ICC member agrees that Pakistan is an important part of the international cricket family and we are searching for ways to protect the future of the game there," he added. "We want teams to return to play cricket in Pakistan as soon as possible and we are willing to assist the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to prepare for that time."
