<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)The government is making all-out efforts to ease the power and water crises, which have mounted with the hot season, the state minister for home said Thursday. Tanjim Ahmed Sohel also renewed a stern warning against any bid to create anarchy over the over water and power shortages. "Any chaos over this crisis will not be tolerated." "Any trying to provoke trouble by taking advantage of the situation will be dealt with strictly," he said, emerging from an inter-ministerial meeting. "We are trying our best to ease the problems. It calls for patience." Following reports of protests, leading to arrests, over power and water outrages in some areas of the capital, the government has tightened security measures at power and water stations, he said. BNP protests Meanwhile, the main opposition party BNP earlier in the day announced a month-long protest programme demanding resolution of water, power and gas shortages, among other issues. Sohel alleged that the opposition was not extending any cooperation to the government or in support of the people with such a move. "The current power crisis is the outcome of the past BNP-led four-party government's corruption amounting to more than Tk 1,000 crore in the sector," he added. bdnews2
