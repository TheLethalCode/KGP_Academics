 CARACAS, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Venezuelan court ordered the arrest of opposition leader Manuel Rosales for corruption on Wednesday after he sought exile in Peru saying he was a victim of persecution by left-wing President Hugo Chavez. The move raises the stakes in Chavez's confrontation with the OPEC nation's opposition leaders, who accuse him of trying to intimidate opponents of his declared socialist revolution. Speaking for the first time since going into hiding, Rosales slammed Chavez as a "coward" and a "little dictator". "Everyone in Venezuela knows that I am victim of persecution ordered by Chavez, that all of my rights have been violated," Rosales said in a message from Peru broadcast by Venezuela's opposition-aligned TV station Globovision. Peruvian Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Garcia quickly chided Rosales for his aggressive comments, saying Peru could not be used as a "political platform" for insulting Chavez. The Venezuelan court hearing the corruption charges against Rosales issued an arrest warrant and requested his capture by Interpol after he failed to appear at a preliminary hearing. "Manuel Rosales has demonstrated that he has no intention of facing the legal proceedings against him," the state prosecutor's office said. Interpol officials in Peru did not answer calls requesting comment. Rosales filed for asylum in Peru on Tuesday after arriving several days ago with 20 relatives and allies. The government says it should have a decision on his request in two weeks. Rosales told reporters that he sought refuge in Peru, a close ally of the United States, because it has a history of granting asylum to Venezuelans. Peruvian President Alan Garcia has called a new wave of Latin American leftist presidents led by Chavez a "disaster". His right-hand man Jorge Del Castillo is helping Rosales with his case, a source close to the situation said. Venezuela authorities say Rosales has failed to explain some $60,000 in income from when he was governor of the oil-rich state of Zulia. Rosales, who was elected mayor of Maracaibo last year, says he is innocent and claims the state refused to accept evidence that the funds were legitimate. Chavez supporters say the opposition is crying foul only because prosecutors have caught up with their top leaders. They mock them for complaining about rampant corruption one minute and decrying its investigation the next. The government moved against one of its own on Wednesday, when prosecutors charged former Caracas mayor Juan Barreto with corruption in a case linked to the purchase of surveillance equipment. The move may help the government deflect criticism that it only pursues corruption cases against opponents. A strident critic of the United States, Chavez has won repeated elections during his decade in power on a platform of redistributing oil wealth to the poor, and he leads a growing bloc of left-wing presidents in Latin America. He has survived a short-lived coup and repeated national strikes. His opponents have struggled to produce a leader to rival his charisma and appeal with a poor majority who say they were abandoned for years by traditional political parties
