<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Mon Apr 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Several Indian gold jewellers said their sales on a major gold-buying festival on Monday are likely to be down 20-40 percent on year, with rising prices and an economic slowdown hitting consumers' spending capacity. Akshaya Tritiya, one of India's two biggest gold-buying festivals, is the pinnacle of sales in the first half of the year, and offers pointers to full-year demand. "This year is more difficult than last year," said T.K. Chandiran, managing director of KTM Jewellery Ltd in Coimbatore, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. "Sales could be only about 60-70 percent of last year." Demand has already been very weak in 2009, with imports at 2.7 tonnes for January to March, down 96 percent from a year earlier, data from Bombay Bullion Association (BBA) shows.

"They have a religious belief so they are buying, but the quantity is less," said Jitendra Vummidi, partner with Vummidi Bangaru Jewellers in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu. A dealer in a large state-run trading company that imports gold and sells in the wholesale market said sales were down 20 percent this month from a year earlier, showing jewellers bought less to prepare items for sales on the festival day. On Monday, India's gold price was at 14,780 rupees ($294) per 10 grams, up 1 percent from Saturday and 27 percent over the past year. In global markets, gold jumped to its highest in almost four weeks as fears of a global flu pandemic prompted investors to seek safer assets. DISCOUNTS If the early indications turn out right, sales this Akshaya Tritiya could be lower than last year, and sellers are offering incentives to win business. "I am giving gold at 50 rupees less per gram," said Princeson Jose, director of Prince Jewellery also in Chennai. "Everybody is doing it so I can't stay away from it." ICICI Bank sent emails offering 1 gram gold coins at just 1 rupee for every purchase of a 50 gram coin. In 2008, gold sales for Akshaya Tritiya were 48.99 tonnes, down 11 percent from 2007, according to the World Gold Council. "The villain is the price," said Daman Prakash, member of Tamil Nadu Bullion Forum, who also said sales was likely to be down substantially over the year. S. Ramakrishnan, head of retail liabilities product group at HDFC Bank, expected sales of gold coins to be flat on year on a per-branch basis, with sales at new branches to help push up the bank's overall sales volumes. "The price is a small deterrent," said Ramakrishnan, who noted more of the smaller 5 gram coins were being purchased this year. There were hopes of a pick-up in demand for Dhanteras, the other major auspicious day to buy gold, in October, and with more weddings in the second half of the year. "There has been a revival in April. Going forward, I think it should not be too bad. Also this year the wedding season extends till June as compared to fewer days for weddings last year," said Sandeep Kulhalli, vice president of retail and marketing at Tanishq, the jewellery division of Titan Industries Ltd, who said he did not expect his sales to fall for the fest
