 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)Markets ended almost flat on Monday with indices edging down mainly due to continued profit taking in banks. Most non-bank financial institutions and insurers also fell, though life insurers gained. Buying pressure caused mutual funds to shake-off losses. Pharmaceuticals witnessed some gains. Power shares rose, while energy shares remained almost flat. Meanwhile, turnover on the twin exchanges rose significantly. Market experts cited inflow of idle money behind the surge. "Banks are poised to lower deposit rates in the wake of lending rate cuts," Salahuddin Ahmed, a former DSE chief executive told bdnews24.com. "This has led investors to put their money on shares," he said. A central bank circular on April 19 asked banks to keep lending rates within 13 percent.
