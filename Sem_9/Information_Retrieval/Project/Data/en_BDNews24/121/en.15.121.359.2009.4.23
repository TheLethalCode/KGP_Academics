 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  A GMG Airlines Kolkata flights took off at 7.26pm Thursday, two hours behind schedule, as pilots of the private airline called off a day-long strike over pay. "We met with the pilots this afternoon and their problems have been addressed," GMG official Sadaat Rahman said. "Flights will resume as normal now." GMG's flights had been grounded from morning as the pilots called the strike over arrears in pay. "Almost two to three months' salary is in arrears," said another GMG official seeking anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Two flights were scheduled to leave for Kolkata at 7:25am and Kathmandu at 10:25am. The Dhaka-Chittagong flight scheduled for 1pm was pushed back to 8pm, said sources at the flight information wing at ZIA.
