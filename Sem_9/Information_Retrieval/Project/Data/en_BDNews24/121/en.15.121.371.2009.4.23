<TITLE> Falun Gong fights on 10 years after Chinese ban </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - From New York to Taipei, Falun Gong activists handing out pamphlets with illustrations of torture are a familiar sight -- 10 years after believers stunned China's leaders with a surprise protest in Beijing. A decade-long crackdown drove Falun Gong underground in mainland China but it has flourished abroad, where it has morphed from a spiritual movement into a vehicle against Chinese Communist Party rule. Ten years ago on Saturday, Falun Gong was a little-known Chinese group, one of many in a national craze for qigong, or breathing meditation. That changed when 10,000 members appeared at the central leadership compound in Beijing in silent protest. At the time, Falun Gong counted retirees, officials and military cadres among its 40 million to 70 million members. That threatened the then-55-million member Communist Party. Thousands have been jailed since China declared Falun Gong a "cult". Only recently have lawyers been allowed to defend accused practitioners, but are often harassed themselves in a sign that the party still considers the group a threat. "Right now, Falun Gong fulfils a need for people who don't want China to succeed. It's a political group. It has nothing to do with religion any more," said Sima Nan, who became famous for exposes of qigong groups in the 1990s and has since become a TV personality and patriotic commentator. The Falun Dafa Information Center, which documents suspected abuses against practitioners in China, says China increased harassment around last year's Olympic Games in Beijing. "The Olympic 'security concerns' were largely used as a veil or excuse to step up the then-nine-year campaign against Falun Gong," said Levi Browde, head of the New York-based centre. It estimates more than 8,000 practitioners were rounded up in China in the first half of 2008. It says 104 Falun Gong adherents died of abuse or neglect in custody last year, bringing to 3,242 the number of deaths documented over 10 years. "I feel very fortunate that I could come out alive. Many others have been destroyed and beaten," said Fu Xueying, 33, who moved to Hong Kong after three years in prison in Guangzhou. DRIVEN ABROAD At the Da'an park in Taipei, groups gather quietly at dawn, as was common in China before Falun Gong was banned. Falun Gong claims over half a million adherents in self-ruled Taiwan, an island China claims as its own, where there are no restrictions on religious practice. Many are apolitical. "If the Communists weren't around, Falun Gong would flourish in China. We are trying to persuade China peacefully to allow this," said Theresa Chu, Asia director of the Human Rights Law Foundation in Taipei, who believes it cured her of a tumour. There are occasional signs of low-key activity by practitioners in mainland China. A woman passing out Falun Gong leaflets in Japan in July said her family practises quietly at home in Shandong without trouble. Activists chant in front of graphic displays of human rights abuses at the Star Ferry pier in Hong Kong, as mainland Chinese tourists descend from buses. Falun Gong members are largely tolerated in Hong Kong, a former British colony which is now a "Special Administrative Region" of China. But hundreds of members have been banned from the city over the years, said spokeswoman Sharon Xu. "The discrimination is obvious and I think the living space for growth is very limited. For instance, it's been hard for us to find conference venues," Xu said. Even activists in the US have come under pressure, said Jason Si of California, a marketer for Falun Gong's cultural tours, whose sister is serving 18 months of forced labour. "I feel very sad about this. But I am not going to give up the practice because to me it is truth, it gives meaning to life," Si told Reuters. "Since they did this to my family, I have been less open in my activities. I did tone down for the sake of my family." Chinese opinion turned sharply against Falun Gong after five people the government identified as practitioners set fire to themselves on Tiananmen Square in 2001, an act that most Chinese viewed as incomprehensible. Falun Gong denied they were members. That view has mellowed by now, said a taxi driver surnamed Wu, who witnessed a man detained by police this month for distributing Falun Gong pamphlets in a suburb east of Beijing. "Common people don't see any real danger in it," Wu said. "They see it as a purely political struggle.
