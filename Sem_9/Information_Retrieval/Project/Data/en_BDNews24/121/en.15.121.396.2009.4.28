 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court ordered the government on Tuesday to explain the measures it has taken to implement an earlier ruling of the court for preventing pollution by red and orange category industries. A two-member High Court bench of justice ABM Khairul Haq and justice Md Mamataj Uddin Ahmed gave the environment secretary, the industries secretary and the Department of Environment (DoE) director general eight weeks to reply. It fixed July 1 for the next hearing. The High Court as far back as 2001, on a public-interest petition filed by BELA, asked the DoE director general to take steps to prevent industrial pollution in two phaseswithin one year for red category polluters and two years for orange category polluters. The same ruling also ordered the then industries secretary to ensure no industry was newly allowed to operate without adopting sufficient pollution curbing measures. The petitioner, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association, also requested reports be submitted to the court on steps taken. The judges on Tuesday said the court had not received any reports from the government on compliance with its 2001 order although eight years had elapsed. Meanwhile, Manjil Morshed, a Supreme Court lawyer of the same High Court bench filed a contempt of court case against the government for failure to report to the court or to take efffective measures to prevent pollution as ordered. bdn
