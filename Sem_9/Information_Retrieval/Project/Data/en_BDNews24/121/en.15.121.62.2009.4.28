 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)The government will build over 100,000 flats in three Dhaka suburbs to ease the capital's housing crisis, the state minister for housing said on Tuesday. State minister for housing Abdul Mannan Khan told a parliamentary watchdog Tuesday some 1,03,280 flats would be built under projects in Uttara, Purbachal and Jhilimili residential areas. Chairman of the standing committee on the housing and public works ministry ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury, quoting the minister, said 62,000 flats in Purbachal, 21,000 in Uttara and 20,280 in Jhilimili would be built to provide housing for the masses through a 'transparent' process. Neither the minister nor the chairman would specify the timeframe, but a member of the committee told bdnews24.com that Rajuk would start construction of the housing projects in 2010 and finish by 2013. Hatirjheel project Khan also told the standing committee that the government would complete the Hatirjheel-Begunbari project by June 2010 deadline "at any cost". The past caretaker government, headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, initiated the project in 2007 to clear the illegal structures in Hatirjheel and Begunbari areasthe major outlet of city's waste water. The 300-acre site had until recently been a haven for encroachers, including illegal developers as well as thousands of slum dwellers. The residents of Hatirjheel and Begunbari areas have demanded cancellation of the project. "We will finish the Hatirjheel project according to the schedule at any cost," Abdul Mannan Khan told journalists. He said the government would keep the number of people affected by the project as few as possible. The army engineers began the work of clearing the land for the project with a cost initially estimated at Tk 1000 crore, which was later revised up to Tk 1,480 crore. The Awami League government has agreed to continue with the project which includes protection of water bodies, construction of roads and beautification of the area. Land acquisition for the project is almost complete, the minister said. The government has already handed the Dhaka deputy commissioner around Tk 488 crore to compensate the people who will lose their land. Encroachment of city lakes The committee formed a three-member sub-committee to investigate the alleged encroachment on city lakes. Asaduzzaman Khan will head the sub-committee that has been asked to report to the standing committee by the next one month. bdn
