 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)Business leaders have again called for a provision to legalise undeclared income, this time suggesting that 'black' funds could be transformed into 'light' funds. FBCCI president Annisul Haq called on Saturday for formation of a Bangladesh Power Fund by allowing black money to circulate through special bonds. "The power crisis has reached alarming proportions," the head of the country's apex business body told reporters at the FBCCI office. "If the current situation continues, it will not be possible for any industry to flourish," said Annisul, just as industries minister Dilip Barua was revealing a draft of the government's new industrial policy the same day. "Our economy has begun to experience the impact of global meltdown. It will face tougher days ahead if power production is not urgently addressed." Boosting power generation needs huge investment, said the FBCCI chief. "This is possible if the government allows the release and investment of black money in the sector through formation of a power fund," he said. He said the provision should be made in the upcoming 2009-10 budget, and suggested a seven year, seven percent bond with provision to let interest be collected each year. "The government can release the proposed Bangladesh Power Fund Bond, allowing the income source of local and overseas investors to remain undeclared," he said. "In 2004, India formed a 1,00,000 crore (1 trillion) rupee fund by receiving or 'legalising' undeclared money from local and overseas investors" he said. "The fund named 'Bidhut Bikash Patra' became a huge success in India," said Annisul. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce had earlier met with representatives of various sectors hit by the global recession. The federation boss said they would see the finance minister in a day or two to ask him to reconsider the recently announced stimulus package, in particular to review the allocation of cash incentives for export sectors. Annisul said the apparel industry, facing a big crisis in the wake of global recession with export orders falling sharply, should also have received support in the same form. Business leaders have in recent months proposed various provisions to allow undeclared income to be legalised, including repeat of past facilities in which tax plus fines could be paid. bd
