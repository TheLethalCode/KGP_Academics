 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, April 25 (bdnews24.com)You don't hear much about Paraguay, a predominantly Roman Catholic country tucked away in a sleepy corner of South America. Of late, however, this country of 6 million has been much in the news. Though to be precise, it is not the country but its president Fernando Lugo, a former bishop, who has made headlines round the world - but for all the wrong reasons. Lugo first stepped into the limelight a little over a year ago when he won the presidential election, ending the 60-year reign of the Colorado Party. The priest-turned politician won overwhelming support from the nation's majority of landless peasants for championing their cause. His love for the downtrodden earned him the reputation of being "the bishop for the poor". But, just a month ago, it emerged that Lugo's love was not reserved only for the poor but also for a number of young, pretty women. In this month alone, at least three women have come forward claiming that he had fathered their kids. A single secret out-of-wedlock child by any president would make headlines. But in this heavily Roman Catholic country, the revelations about a man who had sworn chastity vows as a priest has raised questions about his ability to govern effectively. The news of Lugo's secret liaisons first broke early this month when lawyers for Viviana Carrillo, 26, said they were bringing a paternity suit against Lugo, claiming that he had indulged in unprotected sex with her resulting in the birth of her child who is now 2. Carrillo said she was 16 when their relationship began. Lugo shocked the country by publicly admitting that he was the boy's father and saying that he would "assume all responsibilities." "I recognize that I fathered the child," he said at a news conference in the capital, Asuncion. On Monday, the second woman, Benigna Leguizamn, made public that she began working at the San Pedro diocese in 2000 when she was 17 and that her son with Lugo was born in September 2002. "At the time, the monsignor gave me his support but took advantage of my great need and induced me to have relations," she told the local media. "In a year, I got pregnant by him. A midwife delivered my baby in the same house where I was living, whose rent he paid." Lugo did not confirm or deny her claim but read a statement saying he would comply with all legal procedures. Leguizamn filed a suit demanding that Lugo take a DNA test to determine whether he was the father. The latest woman to come forward was Damiana Morn. On Wednesday, the 39-year-old divorcee told the Paraguayan media that she had only compliments for Lugo, whom she met in 2006, after he left the diocese. Morn, a social activist and director of a childcare center, called him "phenomenal" and said their relationship "was driven by a great love." She said that her son, Juan Pablo, is 16 months old but that she, unlike the other women, does not plan to file suit against Lugo. She, however, said that she was forming a team to deal with these paternity cases. Moran said she has information that Lugo could have as many as six illegitimate children. Lugo has not yet responded to the most recent claim. Lugo, 57 and single, became a bishop in 1994 but resigned a decade later from the diocese in San Pedro, a province in central Paraguay. In December 2006, he said he was renouncing his bishop status to run for president, but Pope Benedict did not accept his resignation until last July -- before he took office as president. Lugo's admission of paternity has prompted widespread discussions not only about his loyalty to his vows to the Catholic Church but also about his credibility on other matters. During the campaign, he did not admit to having children. "We are in the phase of initial incredulity about these announcements," said Jos Luis Simn, a political analyst who has long opposed Lugo. "We have begun to see a process of deterioration of the popular support of this president. All this has set off very serious questions that put Paraguayan democracy at risk." Amid the scandal last week, Lugo swapped out four members of his cabinet, which some saw as an attempt to distract attention from the paternity questions. He also canceled a trip to the United States this week, but a spokesman was quoted as saying it was because he had a very busy schedule. One bishop, Rogelio Livieres, told Paraguayan radio Tuesday that the Catholic Church was aware of Lugo's relationships in 2004 but let him resign. The conference of Paraguayan bishops responded by saying that it "never received any formal written complaint" in relation to Lugo and his "supposed paternity." The group also denied that there was a cover-up or any complicity of bishops in the case
