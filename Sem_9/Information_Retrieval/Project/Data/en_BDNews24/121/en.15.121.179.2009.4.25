 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)Industries minister Dilip Barua unveiled the draft of a new industrial policy on Saturday, with a clear provision to halt privatisation of state-run businesses. "Many privatised factories remain inoperative or non-functional under new ownership. In some cases, land is sold off after take-over," said the minister. "Privatisation should not mean an opportunity for looting," said Barua. The government will invest more in state-owned sectors, reopen closed factories and revive flagging industries, said the minister unveiling the draft plan at the Sonargaon Hotel, and seeking views from industrialists, businessmen and bureaucrats present. Asked which troubled factories or industries would get preference, he said: "We will decide after reviewing the matter." The government's goal is for industry to contribute 35 to 40 percent to GDP and 45 percent to employment by 2021, states the draft policy. According to Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, industry contributed 29.7 percent to GDP in FY 2007-08, agriculture 20.9 percent and the service sector 49.4 percent. Tofail Ahmed, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on industries, present at the meeting, placed emphasis on backward linkage sectors. Controlled sectors The draft policy identifies 16 sectors as 'controlled'that is, defined as preserving national resources, national security and major infrastructurewhere new investment would require 'special' approval. The sectors include deep-sea fishing, private banking and non-bank financial institutions, insurance, power generation, refining crude oil and exploration, excavation and supply of natural gas and other mineral resources. They also include major infrastructure projectssuch as flyovers, elevated expressways, monorail, container depots, mobile and land phone networksairlines, seaports, satellite channels and casinos. Industries secretary Dewan Zakir Hossain said: "Investment for any new project within these sectors will need special approval from the government." Prioritised industries The policy also proposes sixteen prioritised sectors, among them are: agriculture and agro processing, ship building, renewable energy, tourism, computer software and ICT products, high value added readymade garments and light engineering. Also included are chemicals, active pharmaceutical ingredients and herbal medicines, plastics and polymers, jute and leather goods, hospitals and clinics, diamond cutting and polishing, cosmetics and toiletries, furniture and handicrafts. Special support Active support would also be given to develop 'ecotourism' with the assistance of government, private, NGO and different banking and training institutes. Incentives for weavers, ironsmiths, potters, bamboo and cane workers, mattress makers and silk workers are also assured help to expand small, medium and cottage industries. Financial incentives are also assured for women entrepreneurs. Zones There will be no more export processing zones, said the minister. "But special economic zones will be created so that local entrepreneurs get opportunities to compete with foreign counterparts," he said. Setting up new mills will also be encouraged for diversified and high-priced jute products and backward linkage industries will be encouraged in the textile sector. Encouraging investors One percent tax rate is proposed instead of indemnity bonds to simplify customs for imports of capital machinery and parts to attract investment in hundred percent export-focused industry. Foreign investors will be given Bangladeshi citizenship if they invest $500,000 or transfer $1 million to any recognised financial institute. Permanent residency will be given if they invest at least $75,000. For workers The government will ensure industries comply with international health, safety and environmental standards.
