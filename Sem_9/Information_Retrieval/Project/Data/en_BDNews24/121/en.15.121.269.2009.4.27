 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh was on alert, said the health minister Monday as fears of a global flu pandemic spread.

"We have asked authorities to isolate anyone that shows signs of the flu," said the minister. "We have also asked local WHO officials to help us to detect any cases in the country." The World Health Organization has warned of a possible global pandemic triggered by the new strain, dubbed 'Mexico flu' after its place of origin. The US declared a public health emergency on Sunday as 20 people were diagnosed across the country. Cases have also been reported in New Zealand and Spain. The world's biggest drugmakers have said they are seeking ways to increase production of Relenza and Tamiflu, the two medicines that are effective against the new strain that has been found to be a combination of swine, avian and human flu. However, a vaccine would take weeks to develop, they say. Meanwhile, world stocks tumbled on Monday after seven weeks of gains as flu concerns intensified. Analysts fear a flu pandemic could force countries further into recession. b
