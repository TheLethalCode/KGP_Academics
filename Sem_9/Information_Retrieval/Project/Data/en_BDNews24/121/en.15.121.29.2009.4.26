 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has overturned convictions in two arms cases, with sentences totalling 24 years, against actor and ex-ward commissioner Monwar Hossain Dipjol. A High Court bench of justice AFM Abdur Rahman and justice SM Imdadul Haq delivered the ruling on two separate petitions by Dipjol, currently behind bars. A special court, on July 26 in 2007, had sentenced him to 17 years and seven years in the two separate cases, filed in January 2007 with Mirpur police, for possession of illegal arms and ammunition. Dipjol's lawyers, senior advocate Khandakar Mahbub Hossain and barrister Hedayet Hossain, were at Sunday's High Court hearing. "The HC overturned the verdict of the lower court in the two cases," Hedayet Hossain told reporters. On whether Dipjol could be released after the High Court ruling, Mahbub Hossain said, "There are four more cases against him, of which he has secured bail in three cases." "He will be released after obtaining bail in the last case, filed by the Anticorruption Commission," he said. Rapid Action Battalion arrested the actor and alleged crime kingpin last December from a residence in the capital. b
