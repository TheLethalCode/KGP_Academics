 DUBAI, April 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia produced a disciplined all-round performance to beat Pakistan by six wickets to level the five-match series 1-1 on Friday. Led by off-spinner Nathan Hauritz's three wickets, Australia bowled out Pakistan for 207 before reaching their modest target in the 46th over at the Dubai Sports City stadium. Andrew Symonds followed his two-wicket haul with a solid 58 to swing the match Australia's way. "Full credit to our bowlers who did well to restrict the Pakistan batsmen despite a bit of sloppy fielding," stand-in captain Michael Clarke told reporters. "We batted well with James Hopes (48) giving us a good start and then Andrew doing the rest. I hope we can maintain the momentum going to Abu Dhabi (for the last three matches)." On a slow wicket with inconsistent bounce, Pakistan needed to work hard to build their innings. TOP SCORERS Opener Salman Butt and all-rounder Shahid Afridi, who was dropped by Hauritz on three, top-scored for Pakistan. Butt made a patient 57 off 112 balls while Afridi, who took six wickets in the first match, scored 41 in 40 deliveries. Shoaib Akhtar then ended the innings by slamming a quickfire 25. Australia, in reply, lost Brad Haddin cheaply before fellow opener Hopes and Shane Watson (30) put on 77 for the second wicket. Leg-spinner Afridi removed Hopes before Symonds added 90 for the fourth wicket with Clarke (39 not out). Pakistan skipper Younis Khan said his batsmen did not put enough runs on the board. "We needed some good partnerships but that never happened," he said. "We have to work hard on a batting department that is lacking fluency." The third game is on Monday.
