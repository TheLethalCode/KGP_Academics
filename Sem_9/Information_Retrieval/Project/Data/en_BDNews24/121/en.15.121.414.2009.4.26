<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong port was marking its 122nd anniversary Saturday as CPA announced six projects worth around Tk 1,500 crore to bring port activities up to speed. "We are glad at the port's development in recent years, though not completely satisfied," Chittagong Port Authority chairman, commodore RU Ahmed, told reporters at an anniversary programme. Ahmed said the capacity of the port had already increased more than 100-fold since 2006, while trade volumehandling and transportation of export-import goodswas increasing at 10-12 percent rate every year. The port will gain even more momentum on completion of the projects next year, he said. The projects include construction of a new Tk 820 Karnaphuli Container Terminal at jetties 11-13, a new inland container terminal at Panagao for Tk 154 crore and Tk 114 crore for backward facilities at the New Mooring Container Terminal. They also comprise capital dredging in the Karnaphuli river at a cost of Tk 411 crore, installation of computerised container terminal management for Tk 37 crore and procurement of waste removal ship and equipment for containing pollution at a cost of around Tk 34 crore. The CPA chairman said, "We will appoint private operators next year to handle New Mooring Container Terminal." On a question from the reporters, he said, "We could offer transit facilities to other countries right now, with the port's current capacity and efficiency, if a decision was taken in this regard." Highlighting the progress of various operational activities of the port, the port chairman said, "In 2006, a ship was in port for 7.1 days on average but now it takes just 2.48 days for unloading and loading." Similarly, it would take on average 26.6 days to dispatch a container in 2006, which dropped to 18.28 days in 2008, he said. He said recommendation had been made for a separate pay-scale for port employees and initiatives had been taken to address the need for more skilled manpower. On another query, he said the port authority had no objection to trade union activities, which in the past had been blamed for much of the port's inefficiencies and delays. bdne
