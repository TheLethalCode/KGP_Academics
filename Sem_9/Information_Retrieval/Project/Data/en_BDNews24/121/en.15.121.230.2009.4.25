<TITLE> Dido believes attack best defence against Cambodia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will look to be positive from the word go when they take on Cambodia in their AFC Challenge Cup qualifier at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. The match will start at 6:00pm with state-run Bangladesh Television telecasting the game live from the venue. "The target is to play the game forward to win against Cambodia and you know attack is the best defence and we will certainly adopt this approach," said Bangladesh's Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido at a pre-match conference at Hotel Sonargaon on Saturday. But Dido's main concern is over his ace strike pair Jahid Hasan Emily and Mohammad Robin, who have just recovered from their injuries, and may have to miss the match and he have to rely on new pair Enamul Haq and Mithun Chowdhury. "Yes, I have only a problem in the striking zone but I think others are quite prepared to negotiate the challenges of the opponents," said Dido. "It is our bad luck with the injuries three players (Emily, Robin, Jahid) and I may not be able to do what I am supposed to do." Dido informed that the trio were only cleared on Saturday for the game but he was not sure whether any of them was going to be in the starting eleven. "I can't tell you who are going to be picked for tomorrow's match but like you, we are also expecting them in the match." Robin has the best chance playing against Cambodia while the lack of practice will probably keep Emily and Jahid out of the game. Bangladesh are yet to lose against Cambodia in their two previous meetings. They beat Cambodia 2-1 in the inaugural AFC Challenge Cup at home in 2006 and played a 1-1 draw in the 2007 Nehru Cup after conceding a last gasp goal. "I last saw them when I coached Vietnam but now I know nothing about Cambodia and knowing nothing about the opponents may be an advantage for us," said a confident Dido, who, however, was not satisfied with a three-week preparation for the tournament. Whatever the results are in the AFC Challenge Cup, Dido suggested that all should stick to the Bangladesh team, which is going to be a fine team. Captain-cum-goalkeeper Aminul Haq, however, was confident to qualify for the finals. "We take all three matches as quarter-finals, semi-finals and final and we have no option but to win all three matches for qualifying for the final round and the players are ready to take the challenge." Cambodia, on the other hand, also set their sights on the finals after winning all three matches. "We are here to win against Bangladesh as well as against Myanmar and Macao and wins against all of them will take us to the finals if we don't squander the opportunities," said Cambodian coach Tep Long Sovannara at the briefing. Before coming here, Cambodia had a three-week intensive camp and their players were involved in the Prime Minister Cup back at home. Cambodia had also played four practice matches in Vietnam where they won one, lost one and drew two matches. The coach said that they were 70 percent confident to win against Bangladesh and the scorching heat would not affect them. bd
