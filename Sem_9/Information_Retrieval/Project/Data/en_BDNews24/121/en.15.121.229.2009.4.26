<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)The budget for FY 2009-10 will set aside a special fund to allow entrepreneurs to take loans on low interest and ride out the fallouts of the global financial crunch, the finance minister said Sunday. "We don't know yet what the name of the fund will be or [whether it would have the name as suggested] but it is certain that there will be a special fund in the next budget to deal with the recession ," AMA Muhith told a FBCCI delegation at his secretariat office. The Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries leaders led by its president Annisul Huq suggested the government put in place a 'Financial Crisis Mitigation Fund' to ease the pinches of the global economic downturn. Muhith said the fund will be in place "as we believe far greater affects of the downturn will be on our economy next year". "Both IMF and the World Bank will double their development assistance next year," the minister said. Muhith said the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have promised development assistance worth $600 million in FY 2009-10, which was $300 million in the current FY 2008-09. The government on Apr. 19 rolled out a Tk 3,424 crore economic support package for the last quarter of the current fiscal year to shield farm, power and export sectors from the effects of the global recession. The former finance adviser to the caretaker government, AB Mirza Azizul Islam, was first to suggest the Awami League-led government to form such a crisis management fund to provide recession-hit exporters loans at low rates. Speaking exclusively to bdnews24.com on Mar. 25, Aziz preferred the government to form the fund to a proposed recovery package. "Let's follow the directions of the budget in terms of assistance to any sector," he had said then and added he was against any extra facility for any sector in the face of the downturn. "But as an additional contingency plan for the recession, a special fund at government and private initiative can be formed." They would repay the loans once they get over the situation. The government according to its ability and well-heeled big businessmen can contribute to the fund, he had proposed. "Many traders and exporters may cite the global economic downturn as an excuse to get facilities, but the government must make its decision considering its resources instead of giving in to pressure from businessmen or business organisations," Mirza Aziz had said. bdnews24.
