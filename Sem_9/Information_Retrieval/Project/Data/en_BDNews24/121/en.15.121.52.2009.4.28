<TITLE> Laundered funds: Dhaka, DoJ talk terms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh is set to draw up an agreement with the US Department of Justice on the process by which laundered money may be repatriated, the law minister said on Monday. "We don't feel the need to go for any formal bilateral deal. We are rather discussing a Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Justice," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after talks with DoJ representatives visiting Dhaka. The law minister, home minister Sahara Khatun and finance minister AMA Muhith had earlier met with Linda Samuel, deputy chief of the asset forfeiture and money laundering section of the US Department of Justice, and senior trial attorney Jeffrey M Olson. US ambassador James F Moriarty was also among those attending the meeting. "As a policy of the US government, they also help in getting back laundered money from countries other than the United States," said Shafiq. "We have accepted their offer of help in this too." The US will help in recovering money laundered in dollars to other countries on which the US has information, finance minister Muhith further clarified. On the possible uses of the funds once they were back in Bangladesh, Muhith said, "There has not been any specific decision on this." "However, we will employ all such funds through the national budget." "I hope it will be possible to bring back all the money taken out illegally during the past BNP government," said law minister Shafiq. "The MPs, ministers and others of the then BNP government sent huge amounts abroad, which they earned through manipulation of various contracts." "For example, Arafat Rahman Coco's money laundering activities have come to light," he said. When pressed further, the minister declined to name any other suspects, or to give a figure on the amount that had made its way of the country illegally during the period. He reiterated: "The US Department of Justice has assured all out assistance in getting back the money." bd
