 NEW YORK, April 27 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Hopes for a global economic recovery took a blow on Monday as a widening outbreak of swine flu sent stocks lower in Asia, hit oil prices and sent buyers into safe investments. Oil prices fell more than 4 percent and Mexico's peso dropped over 3 percent. U.S. and European stock markets edged slightly higher as investors snapped up defensive shares and some drug stocks jumped on expectations of a windfall from the health crisis. With the swine flu death toll in Mexico at 103 and the virus spreading, the specter of a possible pandemic offset recent optimism that the global downturn could be starting to slow after trillions of dollars were committed to government interventions and stimulus. U.S. stocks fell at the open but reversed to trade higher after an analyst upgraded 3M Co and as investors bid up shares of companies that do well in recessions such as health care and utilities. Shares of General Motors Corp rose after the automaker said it would close plants, eliminate brands and exchange $27 billion of bonds for equity in a bid to cut costs. A White House task force said GM's new program showed progress and it would continue to work with the automaker as it refines the plan. European shares traded lower initially but rose after the U.S. markets rallied. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up about 3 percent at 1507 GMT. Travel and leisure-related stocks were hit by fears the outbreak would hurt travel but drugmakers rose on hopes the virus would yield strong vaccine sales. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said he did not see a global economic recovery before 2010. Speaking on CNBC, Strauss-Kahn said he hoped the worst was over but that "green shoots" in the global economy were mostly in the United States. "Financial and macroeconomic stability are still some way off and we don't yet have the foundation for a solid recovery," said Lena Komileva, chief G7 market economist at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon. HOW FAR? European Central Bank policymakers suggested further reductions in the main refinancing rate but differed as to how far they should go. Governing Council member Nout Wellink was quoted by news agency Market News International as saying the ECB should discuss cutting interest rates below 1 percent. Fellow ECB Council member and Bundesbank President Axel Weber, however, said he saw 1 percent as the lower limit for the main refinancing rate, now at 1.25 percent. "I think 1 percent is a sensible lower limit, because you can't look just at the main refinancing rate. The deposit rate also plays a role," Weber told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview. Spain became the first country in Europe to confirm a case of swine flu in a man who returned from a trip to Mexico last week. But his case, like that of 20 identified in the United States and six in Canada, was not serious. The virus, a new strain of swine flu, has killed 103 people in Mexico and spread to the United States. The World Health Organization said the outbreak was a "public health emergency of international concern" that could become a pandemic, or global outbreak of serious disease. The World Bank estimated in 2008 that a flu pandemic could cost $3 trillion and result in a nearly 5 percent drop in world gross domestic product. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which disrupted travel, trade and workplaces in 2003, cost the Asia Pacific region an estimated $40 billion. It lasted six months and killed 775 of the 8,000 people it infected in 25 countries. The delicate state of the global economy was underlined by the Japanese government, which cut its economic forecasts on Monday, saying gross domestic product would shrink 3.3 percent over the next year, and a senior ruling party official said further stimulus would be needed. The Bank of Japan is expected to keep interest rates near zero when it meets on Thursday but cut its economic forecasts and maintained a cautious view on the global outlook. BOJ Governor Masaaki Sharakawa has signaled the BOJ's monthly policy review will predict a gradual recovery toward the end of this year or early in 2010.
