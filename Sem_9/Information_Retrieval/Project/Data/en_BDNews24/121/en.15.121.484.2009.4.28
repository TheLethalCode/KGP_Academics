 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)--The government has appointed Prof Sayeedur Rahman Khan, former vice chancellor of Rajshahi University, as the next high commissioner to the United Kingdom, said a foreign ministry press statement on Monday. The post of high commissioner has been lying vacant following the retirement of Safi U Ahmed who retired in December last year. "I take it as a challenge to uphold the image of Bangladesh not only in the UK but also in other parts of Europe. "I believe I will be able to perform my duties and responsibilities honestly and sincerely so that the country's image is brightened in all respect," Prof Khan told bdnews24.com after his appointment. Prof Khan, a teacher of applied physics and electronics, had been involved in the politics of the Awami League-led teachers' block at Rajshahi University. He was detained in August 2007 by the military-installed caretaker government for his alleged role in provoking student unrest against the army. Prof Khan was held in jail from August 24 to December 4 when he was acquitted of charges by a Rajshahi court. Born in 1946, the professor completed his post-doctoral research in London.
