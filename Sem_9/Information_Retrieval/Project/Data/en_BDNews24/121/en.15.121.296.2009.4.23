 Barisal, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)RAB arrested 22 suspected militants, 21 of them women, in a raid on two houses in Barisal town on Thursday. Lt Commander AKM Mamunur Rashid of RAB-8 said during the search about 80-90 volumes of books on religion were retrieved from the burqah-clad women. Officials were studying the seized literature to see if they were related to militancy, RAB said. Rashid said they raided a house contiguous to the RAB office in Rupatali, tipped off by an informer, and arrested a man and two women on suspicion of militant links. Acting on the information provided by three arrestees, RAB raided another house on New Circular Road and arrested 19 women as they were holding "a clandestine meeting".

The suspect militants were later handed over to Barisal Kotwali Model Police Station, he added. Hayatul Islam Khan, assistant police commissioner of Barisal Metropolitan Police, said they would be placed before a Barisal court on Friday.
