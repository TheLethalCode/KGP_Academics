<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has recommended introduction of 'bluebooks' for rickshaws, vans and pushcarts to bring them under stricter regulation and thereby ease traffic jams, particularly in the capital. The parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of home affairs at a meeting Sunday also recommended making the entire length of the city's Kuril-Jatrabri road free of rickshaws. The committee, headed by retired major general Abdus Salam, discussed the role of the home ministry in creating a Dhaka free of traffic gridlock. "There is no law for regulation of non-motorised vehicles which cause the traffic jams," Salam told bdnews24.com. "So, we have recommended enacting a law for all non-motorised vehicles such as rickshaws, vans and pushcarts," he said. The bluebooks, as registration papers for motorised are termed, would also be issued to the human-powered vehicles. Salam said the communications ministry would initiate the proposed bill. "We will request it to do so and follow its lead," he said.. The committee chairman said Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, under the communications ministry, and metropolitan police, under the home ministry, would jointly issue the bluebooks. "Both the home minister and state minister are in accord with committee members". Home minister Sahara Khatun and state minister for home affairs Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, were among those who attended the meeting. The committee also recommended proper implementation of traffic law with strict fines for pedestrians not using over bridges. He said pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles were "two main causes" of traffic jam. "The pedestrians must use overbridges. There is provision for fines under the law for not using them. "We have asked the police to implement the law," said Salam. Meanwhile, a petition has been pending in the High Court challenging the provision. The petitioner has said senior citizens, cardiac patients, pregnant mothers and disabled must be given immunity from fines in this regard.
