<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will be looking to seal a place in the finals of the AFC Challenge Cup by beating Myanmar in the qualifiers on Tuesday at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Bangladesh, fresh from a 1-0 win over Cambodia on the opening day, need a win again Myanmar to ensure their place in the eight-team finals from Group A despite having a match in hands. Even if Bangladesh lose to Myanmar by a 1-0 margin in their second match, the hosts will still have a chance to qualify for the final round. In that case, Bangladesh must beat Macau on Thursday by any margin and that would leave behind Group B runners-up Maldives, who are now the best runners-up among Group B, C and D with three points. Even Bangladesh will join automatic qualifiers India, North Korea, Tajikistan along with qualifiers Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Sri Lanka in the final round, if they can finish Group A runners-up with four points. Whatever the equation, Bangladesh's Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido is looking forward to maintaining the winning run despite having no full idea about the opponents. "I want to rely on my boys," said Dido, whose players had an optional training on Monday. The Brazilian saw no reasons to break the winning combination and promised to pick the same eleven that beat Cambodia 1-0 in their first match on Sunday. Bangladesh showed rare signs of fitness throughout the match against Cambodia under the scorching heat as four players made international debuts against the South East Asia nation. "They (four new players) played well but I think they were a bit nervous and I have talked to them," said Dido. In the way Bangladesh performed, they should have won the match by at least a 4-0 margin against Cambodia but it could not achieve it due to the failure of the forwards. "It is right we missed a lot of scoring chances in the first match and it will not change overnight as the forwards need extra quality such as wit, sharpness inside the box and I think it will improve as the days progress." Without strike duo Jahid Hasan Emily and Mohammad Robin, who just recovered from injury, Bangladesh felt their absence against Cambodia. However, winger Jahid Hossain, who also recently recovered from a heel injury, changed the match after coming into pitch after the breather. Dido saw no reasons to break the winning combination against Myanmar and promised to pick the same eleven that played against Cambodia. The Bangladesh coach rates Myanmar as tough opponents that are comprised of some quality players, who have ability to change the fate of the match. Assistant coach Shafiqul Islam Manik especially identified three players Myo Min Tun, Yaza Win Thein and Aung Myo Thant, as the key players of Myanmar that defeated Macau 4-0 in their opening match. Myanmar captain Myo Min Tun however thought Bangladesh were the better side in Tuesday's match. "Bangladesh are ahead of us in terms of skill, power and fitness and with home advantage, they are favourites in Tuesday's match." said Tun, who scored one of the four goals against Macau. bd
