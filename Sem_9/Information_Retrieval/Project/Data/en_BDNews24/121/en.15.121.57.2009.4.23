 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)Ship building and renewable energy will top the government's draft industry policy to be unveiled on Saturday. Industries minister Dilip Barua said on Thursday the draft was complete. "The new policy's main goal is to industrialise the nation through the growth of local self-sustaining capital," he said. "The new policy has prioritised ship building, medicine, renewable energy and light engineering sectors," ABM Khorshed Alam, additional secretary of industries ministry told bdnews24.com. The draft policy also includes more investment in state-owned sectors, said Khorshed. It will also facilitate separate industrial areas for different sectors from pharmaceuticals to plastic ware, said Barua earlier in the day. "The government simultaneously wants economic development through industrialisation and the protection of environment," the minister told reporters after the opening session of a seminar on 'Green Initiatives' organised by Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries. bdn
