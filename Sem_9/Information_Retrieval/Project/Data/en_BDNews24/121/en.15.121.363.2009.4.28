 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com) Riding on all-round performance, Mumbai Indians crushed Kolkata Knight Riders by a huge margin of 92 runs in their IPL match at Port Elizabeth Monday. Chasing 188 runs, KKR were bundled for 95 runs. Earlier, Man of the match Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya made mockery of Twenty20 being a young man's game as both posted breezy half-centuries to guide Mumbai Indians to 187 for six against Kolkata Knight Riders in their Indian Premier League match on Monday. The 36-year-old Tendulkar scored a 45-ball 68 with the help of four sixes and six hits to the fence. His opening partner, the 39-year-old Jayasuriya scored 52 off 32 balls with four sixes and two fours as the Mumbai Indians raced to the highest total at St George's Park. The right-left combination hit the opposition bowlers all over the park and beyond before Knight Riders managed to pull back, picking the big two and restricting the Mumbai Indians when it looked like they would run away with the match. Tendulkar first started with a flick off his pads to Ishant Sharma and then dispatched Ashok Dinda over third man for a six. While Tendulkar's bat dazzled, Jayasuriya was content playing the waiting game. Failure of the frontline bowlers saw Sourav Ganguly with the ball after the fifth over. This time Jayasuriya joined in the party, hitting two huge sixes as the Mumbai Indians reached fifty inside six overs. Sri Lanka spinner Ajantha Mendis was introduced in the very next over to stem the rot but was treated with equal disdain as Tendulkar reached his half-century with a six that landed out of the park. At the half-way mark, Mumbai Indians raced to 111 without any loss. However, thereafter, Knight Riders' managed to claw their way back into the game thanks to some disciplined bowling from Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Brad Hodge. First Shukla picked up Tendulkar's wicket, the ball hitting him infront of the wicket and Russel Tiffin had no hesitation in ruling him out. Harbhajan Singh played a little cameo before he sent Brad Hodge straight down Mendis' throat at deep mid on. Harbhajan hit two sixes and one four in his eight ball 18. Shukla returned for his second over and this time picked up the dangerous Jayasuriya, as the ball hit the bottom edge and was caught by Arindam Ghosh at point. Abhishek Nayar followed soon after following a run out and from 126 for no loss inside 12 overs, Mumbai Indians were suddenly 150 for four in three more overs. Shukla was the most effective of the Knight Riders' bowlers, taking three wickets for 25 runs in his four overs while Ishant and Hodge chipped with one wicket e
