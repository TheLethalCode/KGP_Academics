She summoned the power secretary, Dhaka WASA chairman, managing directors of DESCO and DPCC at her office Sunday, a day after she came from Saudi Arabia and had a long meeting to resolve the problems crippling life across the country amid a blistering heat wave. A press release signed by her deputy press secretary, Mahbubul Haq Shakil, said she directed the authorities to inform people in advance on radio, television and in mosques about power cuts. She asked the power department to supply electricity to the WASA as necessary so that it can supply water after a certain period . Hasina also directed WASA to ensure water supply by using their own generators during peak hours and replace the damaged pipelines to stop the supply of stinking water. The prime minister ordered immediate completion of the work of the second phase of Sayedabad Water Treatment Plant and Pagla Water Treatment Plant. bdnew
