<TITLE> Shoaib takes Pakistan to fighting total </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dubai, April 24 (bdnews24.com) - On a slow track a late cameo from Shoaib Akhtar and a two-wicket over from Andrew Symonds kept the game from drifting either way at the end of the first innings. Strokeplay was difficult on this pitch, the same from the first game, and Shoaib's 14-ball 25 lifted Pakistan from 176 for 7. But just when it looked he would take Pakistan to a more competitive total, Symonds struck with two in the 46th over to limit them inside their quota of 50 overs. Until Shoaib struck, a disciplined Australia had done well to pull Pakistan back after they had threatened twice to move out of their grasp. Australia erred by offering length deliveries to Shoaib, which he got under and hit for four boundaries over cover and one into the stands behind long-on; it was clean and sensible hitting. Symonds, who cut down the pace, proved to be a smart bowling change. Shoaib and Symonds provided the innings with a final twist after it had swung either way. First it was Younis Khan who recovered from a sluggish start to get into fluent mode only to be dismissed for 28. Then Shahid Afridi played an uncharacteristically responsible innings, but when he looked set to launch Pakistan into the safe zone, James Hopes got him with seven overs to go. Following the early run-out of 17-year-old debutant Ahmed Shehzad, Pakistan made an edgy start. Salman Butt and Younis were literally edgy against Nathan Bracken and ODI debutant Doug Bollinger, both left-arm seamers. They troubled both the batsmen with their angle and movement both ways. Both Butt and Younis edged wide of the slips at catchable heights on one occasion each, and Butt got away with several other edges in the initial overs. By the end of the ninth over Pakistan had crawled to 28 for 1, having faced a maiden each from both the bowlers. With Hopes came the change of angle, and Younis helped himself to three boundaries in his first two overs. In the next seven overs Pakistan doubled their score, mainly via Younis who scored 20 off 14 during that period. The sight of Ben Laughlin lit his eyes up, a short loosener first up widened them further, and an edge resulted as he went to cut the leather off the ball. Australia were right back. Two more wickets, punctuated by an especially asphyxiating spell by Bollinger, meant Pakistan were struggling in the middle overs, five down for 122. Bollinger went for 26 in his 10 overs, including a middle spell of four overs for five runs. Nathan Hauritz reaped the benefits of the tight bowling, taking three wickets, including Butt's. Butt played a jarring and slow innings of 57 before he threw it away with a limp chip after he had faced 112 balls. But then Afridi lifted them, not looking to hit the ball out of the ground every time he faced up. The main feature of his innings was his late-cuts, and placement for quick runs. He actually faced 40 balls, the most he has since his 52-ball 85 against Zimbabwe last January. Afridi also read the game well, picking a slower ball early during the Powerplay, when Australia had both third man and fine leg up in the circle. That was his only six. How Hauritz will regret dropping him when Afridi was just 3.
