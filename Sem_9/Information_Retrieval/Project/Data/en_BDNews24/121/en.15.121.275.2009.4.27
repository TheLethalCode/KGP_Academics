 CAMP BASTION, Afghanistan, Mon Apr 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown flew to Afghanistan on Monday touting a new security strategy for the region, as international alarm has spread over Taliban advances in neighboring Pakistan. "There is a crucible of terrorism in the mountainous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan," Brown said before landing in Afghanistan to discuss his strategy with President Hamid Karzai. "Our approach to those countries is different, but must be complimentary," he said. "Our strategy for dealing with this breeding ground of terrorism will mean more security on the streets of Britain." Officials traveling with Brown said the new strategy, to be published on Wednesday, will echo a plan unveiled by the new US administration of President Barack Obama in calling for a tight focus on fighting al Qaeda and Taliban militants. Like Obama's plan, the British strategy will stress the need to train tens of thousands more Afghan soldiers and police to take over responsibility for security from foreign troops. Britain wants Afghan authorities to begin taking over responsibility for security from foreign forces province by province, similar to the process followed in Iraq. But unlike Obama, Brown has so far promised few new troops. Britain has 8,300 soldiers in Afghanistan, the second largest contingent after the United States. It has pledged to send 700 to temporarily boost security for an election in August. Obama is sending 25,000 more US troops this year to join 40,000 Americans and 30,000 other Western soldiers already there. AID TO NORTHERN PAKISTAN The document will also call for some of Britain's development aid budget for Pakistan to be diverted to the northern region adjoining Afghanistan, an official traveling with Brown said. Britain has pledged 665 million pounds ($970 million) to Pakistan and 510 million pounds to Afghanistan in aid over the next four years. Brown visited British troops and provincial officials in the southern province of Helmand where British forces are based. British troops in the province will be reinforced in coming weeks by the arrival of more than 8,000 U.S. marines, a massive influx that NATO commanders hope will reverse what they have described as a stalemate in the province. But although the Western forces are massing on the Afghan side of the border, attention in Western capitals is increasingly turning across the frontier to Pakistan, where Taliban influence has spread in recent weeks. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Sunday Washington was worried about the advancing Taliban seizing control of the Pakistani state, including "the keys to the nuclear arsenal of Pakistan." "We can't even contemplate that. We cannot ... let this go on any further. Which is why we're pushing so hard for the Pakistanis to come together around a strategy to take their country back," she told Fox News. British officials say about two thirds of terrorism plots uncovered in Britain have links to Pakistan. Ten Pakistanis were among a dozen people arrested in Britain on April 8 in what Brown said was an operation against a "very big terrorist plot." All 12 were later released, although 11 have been handed over to immigration officials and face deportation on national security gro
