 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)Educationists welcomed the prime minister's decision to relinquish chancellorship of seven public universities on Monday. A cabinet meeting, chaired by Sheikh Hasina, approved eight bills for transfer of the posts from the prime minister back to the president. The seven universities are National University, Open University, Jagannath University, Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, Islami University in Kushtia, Kazi Nazrul Islam University in Mymensingh and Agriculture University in Sylhet. Prof Nazrul Islam, chairman of the University Grants Commission, said the government had first moved away from the tradition of the president's chancellorship of public universities during the past BNP government in 1991-96. "During the period rules were introduced to allow the prime minister to be chancellor of public universities." "The prime minister's move is praiseworthy," Prof Islam said. Prof Muhammad Jafar Iqbal, of the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology also appreciated Hasina's move. "I welcome the decision," Prof Iqbal said. "We expect the president to crown the highest position of a public university." The cabinet members thanked the prime minister for the decision but requested her to remain in the post at a few universities. In reply, the prime minister said, "The prime minister cannot be the chancellor of universities as the chief executive of the government." bdnews24.c
