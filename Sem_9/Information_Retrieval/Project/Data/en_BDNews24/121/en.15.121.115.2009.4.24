 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)The opposition should not stay away from parliament over an extra-parliamentary issue, speaker Abdul Hamid said Friday in the face of a boycott threat from BNP protesting the government notice served on its chief to leave her Dhaka cantonment house. "Everything could be discussed in parliament, but it would not be right for the opposition to boycott parliament over an extra-parliamentary issue," Hamid told reporters after attending a convention of Lions Club International. BNP lawmaker Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury warned of a parliament boycott after the government served a notice on opposition leader Khaleda Zia on Apr 20 to vacate the mansion, which she got on a lease. Addressing the convention, the speaker said, "The ruling and opposition parties will have to work together to continue with the democratic process." He said the prices of daily essentials have come down to a tolerable level because the government is prioritising the interests of the people. Hamid called upon the well-off people to help the government in its development and social welfare programmes. bd
