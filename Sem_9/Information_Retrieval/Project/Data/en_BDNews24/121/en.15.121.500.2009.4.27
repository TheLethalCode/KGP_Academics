District CID police inspector Shahidul Islam said: "The accused, 45 year-old Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury, was caretaker at Bangla Bhai's Banshbaria camp torture cell." He was picked up around 12pm from Ukilpara Road, said the CID officer. Islam said the CID was looking into whether Chowdhury had been involved with the sensational murder of a man named 'Khejur'. "Khejur was cut up into pieces and buried at another local 'torture cell', Vety Camp, in Rainagar Upazila," said the inspector. Tofazzal Hossain, officer in charge of Rainagar Police Station, said there was a list of 122 people who were suspected of being involved in Khejur's murder.
