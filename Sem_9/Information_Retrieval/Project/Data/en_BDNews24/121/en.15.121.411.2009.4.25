<TITLE> South Africa's ANC wins big poll victory </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PRETORIA, April 25 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - South Africa's ruling ANC won a huge victory in the country's election but fell short of the two-thirds of votes needed to ensure a parliamentary majority big enough to make sweeping constitutional changes unchallenged. Final results of the election -- which will see African National Congress leader Jacob Zuma becoming South Africa's president -- showed on Saturday that the ruling party won 65.9 percent of the vote. The margin that would let the ANC change the constitution is largely symbolic. Despite some market concerns over whether the ANC would get the two-thirds majority, the party repeatedly has stressed that it has no intention of changing the constitution. Financial markets wary of a policy shift to the left under a Zuma presidency may welcome a limit on the party's power. Electoral officials were expected to announce a result formally later on Saturday. They will also have to calculate the number of seats each party will get. Although a newly formed party of ANC dissidents has failed to make a dramatic impact, the ruling party has seen its share of the vote fall for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994. It won nearly 70 percent in 2004. The ANC also lost control of the Western Cape province, center of the tourist industry, to the official opposition Democratic Alliance, led by Helen Zille, a white woman. But the ANC celebrated what was still an overwhelming victory under the leadership of Zuma, who just three weeks ago succeeded in getting a court to drop graft charges his supporters say were politically motivated. The party's credentials for ending white minority rule were more important for many voters than its doubtful record on fighting poverty, violent crime and AIDS. The ANC's closest rival was the Democratic Alliance (DA) with 16.66 percent. The Congress of the People (COPE), formed by politicians who broke from the ruling party, stood at just over 7.4 percent. Electoral officials said the turnout was more than 77 percent, a little higher than in 2004.
