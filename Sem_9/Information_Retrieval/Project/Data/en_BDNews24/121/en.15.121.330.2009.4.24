<TITLE> Friday hottest for Dhaka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)Capital Dhaka recorded the summer's highest temperature on Friday with no end in sight of the blistering heat wave that has been baking Bangladesh for a week. The city endured a high of 38.5 degrees Celsius, according to assistant meteorologist of Meteorological Department Rasheduzzaman. The heat wave, that started last Saturday, is likely to continue for another couple of days, the weather office said. Meteorologists have said the current heat wave is the impact of severe dry weather in India's West Bengal, though April and May are in any case some of the hottest months of the year in Bangladesh. The heat precedes the monsoon rains, inducing moisture to come in from the sea. Increasing temperatures cause particular problems for overcrowded cities like Dhaka, where buildings and roads act like a giant storage heater making it many degrees hotter than the surrounding countryside. The year's first heat wave has made it difficult for city dwellers to even walk on streets. Those who ventured outdoors on Friday were baked by the scorching sun, left parched and burned, they said. "It is so hot in morning, it's like afternoon. The heat is so unbearable that we don't even feel like eating," said Mamun Ahmed, a Dhaka resident. The capital is also reeling under acute electricity and water shortages, as the national grid struggles to cope with mounting demand to power more electric fans, air conditioners and water pumps as temperatures rise. Residents say the power crisis has reached "one hour on, one hour off" proportions. In some places, power is out for 15 to 16 hours a day, they say. bdnews24.c
