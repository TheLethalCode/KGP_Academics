<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - The Obama administration is considering asking Congress to quickly approve between $200 million and $400 million in emergency aid for Pakistan, which is conducting an offensive against the Taliban, the Senate's second-ranking Republican said on Tuesday. "It may be appropriate, and I believe the administration is looking right now at ... somewhere between two and four hundred million dollars, for both counter-insurgency and economic assistance, that we could pass really quickly, in just a matter of days," Senator Jon Kyl told a news conference when asked about the possibility of aid to Islamabad. He said he had been talking to the Obama administration about the idea, and favored it. "They are working up a proposal ... I am hoping it will be in that range." Earlier, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said congressional leaders were discussing with the administration the possibility of emergency aid to Pakistan.
