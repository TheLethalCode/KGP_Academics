 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)  A labour rights group has called for a domestic workers' wage board, to help bring bring some of the country's most vulnerable workers under the protection of labour laws. At least two million people are employed casually as domestic help in households across the country, making for an unofficial and totally unregulated sector. Basic rights, prevention of inhumane treatment, education and legal aid in cases of torture were among a five-point charter of demands made on their behalf Saturday by secretary general of the Grihosramik Odhikar Protishtha Network Dr Wajedul Islam Khan. "Some 80 percent of domestic workers are women and children, but no effective steps have been taken to protect them to date," said Dr Wajedul at a press conference in the city. Six hundred and forty incidents of torture on domestic workers were recorded between 2001-08 in a study by Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS). "Three hundred and five died due to torture during the period," said Wajedul. BILS secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said domestic workers urgently needed to be included under labour laws for their safety. "There must also be a code of conduct for employers," he said. Governments of different countries including India, South Africa and the US are working to protect rights of domestic workers through proper legislation, said Wajedul, who is also coordinator of Sramik Kormochari Oikyo Parishad (SKOP), an umbrella group of labour organisations. Among others present at the press conference were Farida Yasmin, deputy director of BLAST, Salma Ali, executive director of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association, Abul Hossain, advisor of the domestic women workers union, Hosne Ara Kashem, executive director of Shoishab Bangladesh and Abu Taher, director of Shurobhi. bdnews24.com
