<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)A timely transport policy could significantly reduce environmental pollution through, among other things, slowing green house gas emissions, the planning minister said Sunday. As a country becomes more developed, its emissions rise and a large portion of the greenhouse gases comes from the transport sector, said AK Khandker addressing a three-day workshop on the country's transportation system at a city hotel. He called for formulation of a strategic transport plan, to protect the environment, with the participation of people from all stations of life. The minister also said the government was prioritising railway and river routes to introduce a more sustainable communication system. He said a river and rail network circling the capital was being considered. The workshop, jointly organised by the Department of Environment, UNCRD and UNDP, was also attended by, among others, environment state minister Mostafizur Rahman, foreign state minister Hasan Mahmud, UNDP country director Stefan Prinesner and UNCRD director Kazunobu Onagawa.
