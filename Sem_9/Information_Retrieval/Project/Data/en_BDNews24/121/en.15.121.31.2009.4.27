<TEXT>
 April 26, Port Elizabeth (bdnews24.com)--- Delhi Daredevils' batsmen made heavy weather of a modest target, which Bangalore Royal Challengers' bowlers defended tenaciously, but an unbeaten half-century from Tillakaratne Dilshan led them to their third consecutive victory in the tournament. The six-wicket victory took Delhi level with Deccan Chargers on top of the points table with six each. Kevin Pietersen is bowled while attempting the switch-hit, Bangalore Royal Challengers v Delhi Daredevils, IPL, Port Elizabeth, April 26, 2009 Kevin Pietersen was bowled after missing a switch-hit against Daniel Vettori  AFP Bangalore Royal Challengers changed their personnel and their batting order against the Delhi Daredevils at St George's Park but the result was still the same: another poor performance from their top order, with the overseas players failing to fire, resulted in another below-par total. The absence of their highest run-scorer Rahul Dravid, who returned to India to be with his wife for the birth of their second child, added to their worries and Bangalore needed a late cameo from Mark Boucher to give their total a semblance of competitiveness. It was a heartening performance from Delhi's bowlers on a flat pitch in Port Elizabeth. Their batsmen have been the strength so far in the tournament but today their bowlers led the pursuit of a third successive victory by restricting Bangalore to 149. They were challenged by Kevin Pietersen and Ross Taylor during an aggressive partnership but the two spinners, Daniel Vettori and Amit Mishra, struck on either side of the strategic time-out to throw Bangalore off course. Delhi's dominance began with the first ball of the match. Dirk Nannes, who has been preferred ahead of Glenn McGrath, produced a perfectly pitched delivery which angled across Jacques Kallis, who replaced Jesse Ryder as opener. Kallis thought the ball could be left and shouldered arms, only to hear it clip the top of off stump. It was the fifth time in five matches that a Bangalore opener has been dismissed for a duck. Robin Uthappa had scored 32 runs in four innings at a strike-rate of 71 before today but Bangalore have almost no option but to play him. His poor form continued and his innings ended on 3 when he top-edged a pull off the front foot against Ashish Nehra, when he should have been playing back. Pietersen had said at the toss that he "had to do something today" and Bangalore desperately needed him to improve on his form - 43 runs in four innings. He and Taylor made slow starts but stepped up a gear against Nehra in the fourth over. Taylor hit the innings' first boundary - a precisely placed drive through cover point - and Pietersen lofted over long-on, hitting his first six of the tournament. Bangalore were 45 for 2 after the Powerplay overs at which point Virender Sehwag introduced spinners from both ends. Mishra was able to tie the batsmen down but Vettori wasn't. Taylor cut him deftly for four and Pietersen charged and hit him over long-on to take 13 runs off the New Zealand spinner's first over. In his second, Pietersen swept powerfully to the boundary but a moment's rashness cost him his wicket the very next delivery. Pietersen attempted to switch-hit Vettori's quicker ball through midwicket but missed and was bowled, falling for 37 in the last over before the tactical time-out. Mishra dealt Bangalore a crippling blow in the first over after the break, trapping Taylor leg before with a googly. Bangalore were struggling at 78 for 4 but managed to reach 149 largely due to Boucher's blows over the leg-side boundary in the penultimate o
