 Dhaka Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)The government is preparing an in-depth report on operations by militant oufits, the state minister for home said Friday. Tanjim Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the move came after the cabinet discussed a report the past caretaker government had made on the operations of 12 militant organisations and found the information inadequate. He said the report will dig into terror-financing, involvement of organisations with the militants, overseas links, reasons of any intelligence failure and political connections and government cover-up of any incidents, if any. He added they will share the report with all since the government believes in transparency. "The people of our country loathe militancy. RAB and police are on their tail," said Tanjim who heads a high-level 17-strong 'motivation committee' to beef up intelligence surveillance and raise public awareness in tackling militancy. The committee includes secretaries from the Prime Minister's Office, home, education, law, religion, social welfare, information and local government ministries. bdnews2
