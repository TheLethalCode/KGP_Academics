 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned home from Saudi Arabia Saturday with an assurance of solutions to the problems faced by Bangladeshi workers in the kingdom. The prime minister left for Riyadh on Apr. 20, on her first official trip since taking office in early January, at the invitation of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud. Hasina met with King Abdullah on Apr 21, in the first meeting between the Saudi king and a head of the Bangladesh government in the past seven years, said foreign minister Dipu Moni. He assured her of looking into the problems of millions of Bangladeshi workers in the oil-rich country and allowing more Bangladeshi workers to enter. The foreign minister and state minister Hasan Mahmud, overseas employment minister Khandker Musharraf Hossain and state minister Monnuzan Sufian, Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana and son Sajib Wazed Joy accompanied the prime minister on the tour. "No more Bangladeshi workers will have to return home from losing jobs in Saudi Arabia," the Dipu Moni told reporters on landing at Zia International Airport. She said that Hasina, being addressed as 'sister' by the king, made her request accordingly and gained assurance that Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia would be allowed to switch jobs on the same work permit. "The Saudi king also assured [Hasina] of taking more Bangladeshi workers if required," said Dipu Moni. She said some 2.5 million workers were at present living and working in the kingdom, making up the largest group of foreign nationals in the kingdom. In 2007, around 30 percent of Bangladesh's total $6.56 billion in remittance came from the country. In 2008, a similar percentage of the total of $9 billion came from the kingdom. Hasina also attended a views-exchange meeting with Bangladeshi expatriates and performed Umrah in Makkah during her trip. "[The prime minister] assured them their right to vote from abroad would be guaranteed, among other facilities, through setting up an Expatriates Bank," said Dipu Moni. "The government will extend all-out assistance to the Election Commission to ensure it," added the foreign minister She said the Bangladesh embassy in Saudi Arabia was also instructed to solve expatriates problems as speedily as possible. The prime minister was received by deputy leader Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury and the three chiefs of staff, among others, as her Biman Bangladesh flight touched down at Zia International Airport around 2:30pm on Saturday. bd
