<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government has appointed a three-lawyer panel, provisionally naming advocate Annisul Haq 'chief public prosecutor' in the BDR mutiny case. "The government has appointed me in the mutiny case," Haq told bdnews24.com on Monday. Advocates Syed Haidar Ali and Mosharraf Hossain will also be on the panel, he said. All three expected to get the official notifications Tuesday, said Haq. A law ministry officer, who preferred not to be named, said the government had amended the original appointments to the panel that was decided on Apr 20. He said it was also finally looking into whether the post of 'chief public prosecutor' was valid in this case, he added. The decision would be finalised and letters for the amended appointments may be sent on Tuesday, he said. Haq has acted as prosecutor in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman assassination case and the Jail Killings case, which both remain sub-judice in the Supreme Court. bdne
