<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)BNP unveiled a month-long political programme Thursday demanding resolution of such wide-ranging issues as water, power and gas shortages, deteriorating law and order, violence in educational institutions and fixing fair prices of agricultural crops. Secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain made the declaration Thursday noon at BNP chairperson's Gulshan office and said the protests will continue across the country starting May 5 through June 2. "We have been offering the government advice, recommendations and cooperation around a number of issues and subjects over the past months," said Hossain. "Instead of appreciating our help, the government has been maligning and slandering our leaders and workers. Our people are being sued, murdered, injured and attacked. "Even then, we have not declared any tough programme as it would hamper the law and order." The secretary general said BNP cannot remain non-chalant about the sufferings the people have been going through. "Demanding adequate water, power and gas supplies, we'll be staging protest rallies and processions at metropolises, districts and Upazila on May 5," Hossain said. On May 14, countrywide rallies and processions will protest the deteriorating law and order. All metropolises, districts and Upazilas will mark May 19 to demand an end to the "atrocities being committed at educational institutions and politicisation everywhere". Rallies and processions will march the streets on May 24 demanding reduced manure and diesel prices, bringing commodity prices within the reach of the people, ensuring payment of right prices for the farm produces and protection to the export-oriented industries. June 2 processions and rallies again will protest deteriorating law and order and exacerbating incidents of murders, dacoities, extortion and harassment countrywide. b
