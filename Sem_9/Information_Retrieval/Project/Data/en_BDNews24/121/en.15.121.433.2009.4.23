 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday ordered former state minister for law Shahjahan Omar to surrender to trial court within two weeks, a lawyer said. It also stayed the High Court orders that halted his conviction in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The four-member Appellate Division bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin made the orders on hearing an ACC appeal. ACC counsel Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com the ruling would impact the bail appeals at the High Court. "It is mandatory for the High Court to comply with the Appellate Division ruling. So the ruling has an impact." The High Court on Jan 14 granted the former state minister bail in a graft case that accusing him of amassing illegal wealth, in which he was jailed for 13 years. The ACC filed the case on Sept 27, 2007 with Gulshan Police Station. Omar was present in the court during the hearing. Rafique-ul-Huq and Moudud Ahmed stood for Omar, while Abdur Aziz Khan and Khurshid Alam Khan represented the ACC. bdne
