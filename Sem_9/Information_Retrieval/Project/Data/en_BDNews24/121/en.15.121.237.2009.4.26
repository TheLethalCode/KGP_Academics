<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  Myanmar blanked Macau 4-0 in the first match of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. Khin Maung Lwin, Yaza Win Thein, Pyaye Phyo OO and Myo Min Tun struck one goal apiece to send a signal to the hosts that how much strong they are. Myanmar, comprising of mostly U-23 players, dominated the entire match and took the lead in the third minute with Lwin lobbing the ball over advancing goalkeeper CK Leong. Thein headed a Myo Min Tun cross home to double the lead in the 16th minute. Despite going two goals down, Macau had actually no respite amid the heat wave that weakened the players, claimed coach Leung Sui Wing. Pyaye Phyo OO made it 3-0 in the 48th minute after shrugging off a Macau defender to place a low shot to the left hand of the advancing goalkeeper while Tun sealed the match in the 60th minute as the captain broke the offside trap to tap the ball home. "In these hot conditions the boys established their superiority and won convincingly and I am happy in the way they played," Myanmar coach Tin Myint Aung said at a post-match conference. He, however, thought that it was good preparation before facing hosts Bangladesh on Tuesday. Cambodian coach Wing said that his boys could not perform due to the high temperature but he was happy with the players' effort. "The boys tried their best against a side, which was better than us in terms of technique and physique and it is a good experience for us," said Wing. bd
