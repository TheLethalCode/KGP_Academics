 Chittagong, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)Refusing to run on meter, CNG-run autorickshaw drivers in Chittagong went on a wildcat strike Monday, clashed with owners and police, and damaged some 60 vehicles. The hourlong clashes across the port city left nearly 12 pickets and three policemen injured. The strike left stranded city commuters wait for crammed buses, sweating and cursing their luck in the sweltering heat through the day. Many hackneyed along doggedly and reached their destinations late, paying through the nose. The strikers in their hundreds vandalised other types of vehicles at a number of places in the metropolis and harassed commuters unnecessarily. The autorickshaw drivers called the strike demanding cancellation of metered plying, cases and harassment by the traffic police. They brought out small processions in some areas of the city to air their protests. The CNG Auto-rickshaw Driver-Worker Welfare Association and Owner-Worker Solidarity Council called the strike without any prior announcement. The strikers vandalised vehicles including a police van in Agrabad Access Road, Dewanhat intersection, Chittagong Press Club and port area. They clashed with owners and police at Dewanhat intersection and police nabbed 14 pickets. The drivers harassed the passengers of other vehicles and torched a police motor bike too. About 13,000 auto-rickshaws run in the city and the drivers have been defying metropolitan police orders to operate on meter. Police started seizing vehicles and filing cases against the wilful offenders, prompting the auto-rickshaw drivers to call the strike Monday morning. The drivers claim that they lose money if they accept the fares on meters. Deputy commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com that the auto-rickshaw drivers went on strike without any prior intimation to any quarters. He said the strikers have unleashed anarchy after abstaining from work in pursuance of irrational demands. The government is investigating the matter to find the masterminds behind the chaos, he added. Islam said, "We are taking legal steps against the offenders." About curbing the riotous situation, the police officer said, "We are trying to sit with the auto-rickshaw drivers and strike a deal." b
