 Boston, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An aircraft flying from New York to Israel with 206 people on board was diverted to Boston on Friday after an unruly passenger tried to break into the cockpit, Boston media reported. Delta Air Lines flight 86 landed at Logan International airport just after 10 p.m. (0200 GMT on Saturday), said Delta spokesman Anthony Black. The passenger was subdued by fellow travelers but the incident was not terrorism related, Boston's WCVB-TV reported, quoting a Massachusetts Port Authority official. Authorities at Logan airport could not immediately confirm the report. Following the September 11 attacks, U.S. airlines were ordered to install new cockpit doors to prevent intrusion and resist gunfire and explosives on commercial airplanes.
