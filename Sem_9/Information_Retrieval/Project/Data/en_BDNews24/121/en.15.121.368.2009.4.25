 Dhaka Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun has said the government has started installing fire service station in 173 Upazila that do not have any. She stressed on the importance of raising public awareness and reducing dependency on fire service at a roundtable discussion organised by Media Initiative for Public Policy on fire-extinguishing preparedness in important cities Friday. Speakers emphasised keeping firefighting materials and equipment, trained manpower, arranging fire drills and strict enforcement of law in high-rises. The minister said many installations have modern firefighting tools but not the people to operate them and referred to the Bashundhara fire in March. News agency Associated Press's Bangladesh bureau chief Farid Hossain chaired the discussion at the Press Institute of Bangladesh Auditorium where fire service officials, architects, journalists and other professionals participated.
