 Jhenaidah, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  A regional leader of outlawed Purbo Banglar Communist Party (Janajuddha) was killed in what law-enforcers claimed an exchange of gunfire with RAB and police in Jhenaidah early Tuesday. The dead was identified as Siddiqur Rahman Biplob, son of Abdul Matlub of Bhabanipur. Jhenaidah superintendent of police Jahangir Hossain told bdnews24.com Tuesday morning that being tipped off about the presence of the extremists, RAB and police had raided Ramchandrapur of the Sadar Upazila. At one point, the extremists took on with the law-enforcers at around 11:45pm. After the half-an-hour gun battle the extremists fled the scene, Jahangir said. The police recovered Biplob's body, one motorcycle, two mobile phones, one revolver, one shutter gun and one bomb from the scene, he said. There were three murder and five bomb attack cases with the Sadar Police Station against Biplob, he said.
