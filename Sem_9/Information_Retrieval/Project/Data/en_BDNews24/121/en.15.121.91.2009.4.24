<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee has shrugged off allegations of war crimes against him, saying those were "lies". "It [allegations of war crime] is utterly untrue," he told reporters Friday emerging from a conference of Bangladesh Madrasa Teachers' Council (BMTC). Earlier, he told the conference the Muslim community will not tolerate any conspiracy to abolish madrasa educations. "The conspiracy will ruin you [government]." On law minister Shafiq Ahmed's recent comment of Madrasa being "breeding ground for terrorists", he warned prime minister Sheikh Hasina that she would have to bear the consequences for comments by her ministers. He criticised the move to implement recommendations made by a commission which is modelling a national education policy on the one made by 'Kudrat-E- Khuda Commission'. The government is planning to implement suggestions of an education commission of 1973 led by Dr Kudrat-E-Khuda, which promotes socialism and secularism, according to him. "No human being is secularhow does she [Sheikh Hasina] claim herself secular while she is performing Omrah?" Sayedee also claimed that the Awami League had never been able to be in good terms with the "religious people". He called upon all to crush any conspiracy against madrasa. "Leave us alone." Sayedee, also president of BTMA, announced a seven-point charter of demands including inclusion of curriculum of the Quran and Hadith in the general education system.
