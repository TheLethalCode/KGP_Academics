<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will go to the High Court to challenge the government notice to vacate her cantonment residence, said a senior BNP leader Tuesday. "Khaleda Zia is likely to file a writ petition with challenging the legality of the notice," former law minister Moudud Ahmed told reporters. "The party chairperson is meeting with senior lawyers tonight; everything will be decided there," he said. The directorate of military land and cantonments served a notice on Khaleda on Apr 20 asking her to leave her cantonment house within 15 days. Three days later, Khaleda responded with a legal notice of her own to the government asking it to withdraw the notice by April 28 (Tuesday). Law minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters Monday that the government would not reply to the legal notice. "We sent a legal notice to the defence secretary, cabinet secretary, director of military lands and cantonments directorate, military land administrator and military estate officer asking them to withdraw the notice within five days," Barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan told bdnews24.com. "As they have not withdrawn the notice within the deadline, we will take further legal steps." The legal notice sent by Khaleda's lawyers said that the-then president had allotted Khaleda Zia the house on a yearly rent basis after the assassination of Ziaur Rahman on 30 May 1981. The house was registered on 13 July 1981 and Khaleda along with her family members had been residing at this house for over 27 years, said the notice. Therefore, it was illegal in the eye of law to be asked to vacate the house by serving a notice, it said. The notice also said that Khaleda Zia would take further legal steps unless the government notice was withdrawn. b
