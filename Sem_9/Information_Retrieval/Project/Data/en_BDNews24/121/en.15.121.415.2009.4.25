<TITLE> 'Green innovation' depends on IP, argues US ambassador </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)Intellectual property protection is crucial to 'green innovation', and with it the solution to some of the most difficult problems that face the world today, argues US ambassador James F Moriarty, marking World Intellectual Property Day. This year, Apr 26 (Sunday) is being marked with the theme "Promoting Green Innovation". Moriarty in a statement on Saturday emphasised the importance of IP for development of green technologies and eco-friendly products for a healthy environment and promote sustainable agricultural and economic development. "We are in a period of heightened concern about both climate change and the global economic crisis," said Moriarty. "Historically such challenges have sparked innovation, presenting new opportunities to benefit from intellectual property. By encouraging enforcement of trade rules, including intellectual property protection, we can support innovative industries, create new jobs and solve global challenges." Creative individuals and industries continue to generate solutions to some of the most difficult problems that face the world today, says the US envoy. "Intellectual property protections help foster environments in which creativity and innovation can thrive and contribute to economic development and improved quality of life around the world," he said. Moriarty mentions Brazil as one example. "Brazil has undergone a Green Revolution, dramatically increasing agricultural production. Investment in research, technology transfer, and the use of new technologies has been essential to this success." Mentioning a new soybean varietym bred with the help of the US that helped Brazil become a major soybean producer, the ambassador says intellectual property protection in both Brazil and the United States was crucial to its development. He also mentions the UN Development Program's Transformation of Rural Photovoltaic Market Project in Tanzania, where local entrepreneurs are helping bring authentic and affordable solar energy systems to rural areas. "[But d]espite the strong benefits that these solar technology systems bring to health centres, schools, businesses and individual households, low quality imitation products sold at small electric shops threaten to hurt their reputation." Innovation at the heart of civilisation Innovation is at the heart of civilisation, says the American ambassador. "The pursuit of new knowledge is at the centre of the human spirit and is what led Thomas Edison to invent and develop technologies like the light bulb." The US intellectual property system is what allowed others to build upon Edison's work, says Moriarty. "By granting him patent protection that let him reap financial benefit for his significant contribution to society." "We must ask ourselves: Who are the Thomas Edisons of today?" "Where are they? And, how do we ensure that intellectual property protections are in place to encourage their innovative spirit and support the safe and secure distribution of technologies to those who desperately need them?" "As we work to address global challenges such as the current international economic crisis, climate change and clean energy, we must redouble our efforts to encourage and protect intellectual property rights and foster a robust environment for global innovation," said the US ambassa
