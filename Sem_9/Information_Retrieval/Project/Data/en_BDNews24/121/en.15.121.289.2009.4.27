 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)The government will cancel a land lease deal signed in 1999 with Singapore-based company Ipco International Limited, said civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader on Monday. He said the civil aviation authority of Bangladesh will require the land for the future expansion of Zia International Airport, which is now "overcrowded". The parliamentary standing committee on civil aviation last week asked the ministry to revoke the deal for construction of a hotel and golf course on over 144 acres (435 bighas) of land adjacent to the airport. According to the local land registration office, the current market value of one bigha in that area is around Tk 10 crore. "On unanimous recommendation of the parliamentary standing committee, we are moving to cancel the deal with Ipco," Quader told bdnews24.com on Sunday at his office. "We are examining the legal implications before revoking the contract". The minister said 90 percent of ground space at Zia International Airport was occupied by aircraft. "Where will we keep our new planes," said Quader, referring to state carrier Bangladesh Biman's aircraft deals currently in the pipeline. The minister said all the members of the parliamentary watchdog had visited the airport in recent days and backed cancellation of the deal. "We have observed that Ipco failed to act in accordance with the agreement," committee chairman Engineer Mosharraf Hossain told reporters after a meeting Monday. He said, under the deal signed with the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, Ipco was supposed to start construction within one and a half years of signing. "We have recommended cancelling the deal and also asking the civil aviation authority to take legal action against the errant company," said Mosharraf, who was civil aviation minister in 1999. He told bdnews24.com that the land was given to Ipco on a 60-year lease to construct a multi-storied luxury hotel and golf course ahead of a NAM summit to be held in 2002. The past BNP-led government in 2001 decided not to host the summit in Dhaka, but kept the deal alive. "My question is why the deal was not cancelled by the then government which backed out of hosting the NAM summit," Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com. Ipco's executive chairman Abul Khair Litu says his company is not responsible for violating the deal. "We are not at fault. The blame goes to the government for not approving the plans." "If the government wants, it can take the land back providing compensation as per the agreement," Litu told bdnews24.com on Apr 21, when the standing committee first recommended cancelling the deal.
