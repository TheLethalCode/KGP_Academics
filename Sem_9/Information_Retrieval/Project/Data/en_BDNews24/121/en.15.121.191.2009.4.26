 TEHRAN, Sun Apr 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has agreed to help defend a US-born journalist jailed for spying but prison officials refused to let the human rights lawyer see Roxana Saberi on Sunday, an Ebadi aide said. Ebadi could not visit her client for a first meeting in Tehran's Evin jail even though a court had given her permission to do so, her spokeswoman Narges Mohammadi told Reuters. She was speaking a day after Saberi's father said his 31-year-old daughter had called to say she was on a hunger strike and would continue to refuse food until she was released. The freelance journalist was sentenced to eight years in jail on April 18 on charges of spying for the United States, in a verdict that could complicate Washington's efforts toward reconciliation with Iran after three decades of mutual mistrust.

The United States has called the charges against Saberi, who has worked for the BBC and the U.S. National Public Radio, baseless and demanded her immediate release. U.S. President Barack Obama has expressed deep concern for her safety and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said releasing Saberi would serve as a goodwill gesture. Tehran, which does not recognize dual nationality, says Washington should respect the independence of Iran's judiciary. But in a statement welcomed by Khorramshahi, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last week called on Tehran's prosecutor to ensure that Saberi enjoys full legal rights to defend herself. The judiciary chief has said her appeal must be dealt with "in a careful, quick and fair
