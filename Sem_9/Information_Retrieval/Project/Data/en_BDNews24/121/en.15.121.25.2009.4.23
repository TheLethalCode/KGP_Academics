<TITLE> Tk 488 cr to go for Hatirjheel compensation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mohosinul Karim bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, April 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government will start compensating locals within a few days for land acquisition in the ambitious Hatirjheel-Begunbari development project in the heart of the capital. Around Tk 488 crore has been handed over to the Dhaka deputy commissioner for the purpose, said the state minister for public works on Thursday. Abdul Mannan Khan said the government has a draft list of those entitled to compensation. "But it is not complete, and we cannot yet put an exact figure on the number of likely compensation claims," he said. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipokkho (Rajuk) and district authorities will call on compensation-seekers through newspaper circulars within the next few days to come forward with legal documents. "The draft list was made at the beginning of the project's primary phase. All those who believe they are entitled will be asked to come to the DC office with their documents," said the minister. The 300-acre site had until recently been a haven for encroachers, including illegal developers as well as thousands of slum dwellers. Asked whether the government would take any initiative to rehabilitate the latter, the minister said he could not say at present. The move to recover and save Hatirjheel and Begunbari canals was taken during the past caretaker government as an environmental measure to clear away decades of encroachment. The project, initiated in 2007, aims to preserve rainwater and eliminate water logging in the area by restoring two of the capital's crucial water bodies, and to ease traffic gridlock by creating another east-west route in the city. Army engineers began the work of clearing the land for the project with a cost initially estimated at Tk 1000 crore. It was later revised to Tk 1,480 crore. Though the project is supposed to be completed by June 2010, the acquisition of 139 acres of private land, of the total 299 acre site, could not be accomplished in the last two years despite clearing the area of almost all occupants. Though the government is finally set to start the process of paying out compensation, it will take some time to complete. The minister said the work would end within June next year by "completing the land acquisition work swiftly". But a huge obstacle, namely the disputed BGMEA Bhaban, still remains smack in the middle of the project area. b
