 Faridpur, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)Intern doctors at Faridpur Medical College Hospital, on strike since Saturday in pursuance of their four-point demands, called it off after a meeting with authorities, an official said. Dr Niranjan Dhali, acting superintendent at FMCH, said the doctors rejoined their duty at the hospital outdoors after the authorities assured them that their demands would be met in phases. The doctors have told the authorities that they have to meet their four-point demands by 9am Monday. An alleged assault on a doctor and a wardboy by a patient's relatives Friday evening led the disgruntled interns to go on a wildcat strike from Saturday noon. The demands pressed by the interns are arrest of the offenders, setting up a police camp on the campus, warding the 'middlemen's circles', issuance of IDs to FMCH staff and barring patients' attendants from staying in the hospital. bdn
