 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com) Kabirul Islam Bharasa did not plan and killed younger brother, Khairul Islam, Monday, the investigation officer of the case said Tuesday. Imran Hossain, brother-in-law of Khairul, filed a murder case with Paltan Police Station Monday night accusing Kabirul, the first child of former Jatiya Party MP Karimuddin Bharasa's second wife. Investigation officer Shamsul Islam told bdnews24.com Tuesday that the family said Kabirul was a drug addict who used to take money from the family. He might have gone to his brother's office at Bijoy Nagar in the capital for money and when Khairul refused to oblige, Kabir shot him, the police officer suspected. On whether they had had evidence of someone else's involvement in the murder, he said they did not have any. Islam added they were carrying out raids to arrest Kabirul. Police detained driver of Kabirul's car and released him after interrogation. The vehicle had been seized, Shamsul said. A relative of Khairul's wife, preferring not to be named, said someone else might have been involved with the murder as none of the nine brothers wanted to file case after the killing. Kabir shot his younger brother at the latter's Bijoy Nagar office over a business feud, father Karimuddin told bdnews24.com. Khairul was rushed to Square Hospital in critical condition where the doctor declared him dead, said the father. Khairul, the third child of Karim's second wife, was buried at Banani graveyard Monday night after autopsy. Kabirul was the first child. 'Altercation' Employees at Khairul's office said the two brothers had an altercation at around 2.30pm and at one stage Kabirul shot his brother in the chest. "Kabir, entering Khairul's room, sat down in a chair, took a paper out from his pocket and placed it in front of his brother," said Anwar Hossain, an staff, quoting a colleague who was in the room at the time. "Khairul asked the employee to leave, saying, 'We brothers will talk now'," said Hossain. Shortly after that shots were heard from the room. Then Kabirul came out carrying a gun," said Hossain. Employees rushed to Khairul's office and found he had been shot in the chest, said Hossain. bd
