 Jessore, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  The BDR director general has again said the trial of the Peelkhana bloodbath in the Feb25-26 mutiny must be held to bring discipline back to the border guards. "We have to end the no-confidence [in the force] that has been created after the incident," Maj Gen Moinul Hossain told the BDR members at 22 Rifle Battalion headquarters in Jessore Monday. He said the borders are secure and everything is going on the way they should be. "You are enjoying all government facilities. Still, the trial should be held for the sake of discipline in the organisation," he told the border guards. Khulna BDR sector commander Zahedul Alam, 22 Rifles Battalion commander Lt Commander Hasib Alam, among others, were present. Moinul is currently travelling Jessore and Khulna to ensure border protection and headed for Khulna after the meeting. He is expected to visit Benapole border in the afternoon and exchange views with top officials of India's Border Security Force. At least 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, seven BDR men and three civilians were killed in the bloody mutiny at the BDR headquarters in the capital. bdnews
