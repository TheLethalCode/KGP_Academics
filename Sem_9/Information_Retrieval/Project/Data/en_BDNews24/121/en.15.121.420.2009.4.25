 KATHMANDU, April 25 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Nepal's Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda has put off his plans to visit China next week, an aide said on Saturday, amid a deepening crisis over a Maoist plan to remove the army chief. The government, led by the Maoists, said last week it planned to remove General Rookmangud Katawal as chief of the national army, saying he had refused to carry out instructions to not take on any new recruits. But the main opposition Nepali Congress party, and some allies in the ruling coalition, criticised the move, saying the Maoists wanted to politicise the army and weaken the military. Frantic negotiations were under way in Kathmandu this week as politicians and diplomats tried to defuse the crisis, which could threaten a fledgling peace process that ended the Maoist conflict three years ago. Om Sharma, a spokesman for Prachanda, said the leader, a former rebel commander, would not go on a week-long official visit to Beijing, which was due to begin on May 2. "The prime minister has to remain here to resolve some complex and difficult problems facing the country now," Sharma said. Analysts said the army row, one of the serious crises facing the Maoists since coming to power eight months ago, exposed the crisis of confidence between the two old foes who fought a decade-long civil war. Katawal has opposed the integration of more than 19,000 Maoist former guerrillas into the army as insisted by some Maoists saying they were "indoctrinated". The Maoists accuse Katawal, due to retire in four months, of recruiting 2,800 soldiers early this year against government instructions and boycotting six national tournaments because the Maoists were participating. Authorities said several agreements were expected to be signed during the visit to China, a key trade and economic partner as well as a key donor to aid dependent Nepal. "The visit will be rescheduled in consultation with the Chinese side," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suresh Pradhan, said.
