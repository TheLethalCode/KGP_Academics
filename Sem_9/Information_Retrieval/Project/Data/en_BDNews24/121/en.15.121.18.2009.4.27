 NEW DELHI, April 27 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - The Supreme Court ordered a fresh probe on Monday into the Gujarat riots of 2002 that killed thousands, including the role of Chief Minister Narendra Modi, court officials said. Modi is accused of turning a blind eye to the riots in which some 2,500 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The probe against Modi, a bearded and bespectacled star of right-wing politics, comes in the middle of a general election and could hurt the chances of his Bharatiya Janata Party, India's main opposition, analysts say. The court ordered a special team to investigate the killings, particularly the murder of a Muslim federal lawmaker. Modi is among 50 Hindu-nationalist politicians named as accused. "We hereby direct the special probe team to look into all allegations, particularly in the killing of an MP (member of parliament)," judges Arijit Pasayat and A.K Ganguly said. The Supreme Court had earlier slammed the Gujarat government for failing to protect Muslims and compared Modi to Roman Emperor Nero, who legend has it "fiddled" on his lyre while Rome burned. Washington denied Modi a visa in 2005 on the ground of severe violations of religious freedom. The Gujarat riots are seen as testing of whether minority Muslims can get justice in officially secular but Hindu-majority India. The violence also became a rallying point for radical Muslims and an effective recruitment tool for Islamist militants. Following the court order, India's ruling Congress party sought Modi's resignation as chief minister. "He must step down for justice to be delivered," Veerappa Moily, a senior Congress party leader said. The riots broke out after a suspected Muslim mob burnt alive 59 Hindus, mostly religious activists, in a train in Gujarat in February 2002.
