 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)  The AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers will get underway on Sunday in the city amid scorching heat but all four participating nations believe it would not affect on their performance. The country is in the grips of a heat wave with the temperature soaring to 38.2 degrees Celsisus in the capital on Saturday. The met office expects the heat wave to last for another 2-3 days. It is commonplace for a foreign team to complain of heat soon after arriving in Bangladesh but no such concerns for the foreign teams this time. Cambodia, Macau, Myanmar and Bangladesh will be playing in the Group A qualifiers. "I see no difference compared to our country and I don't think it will hamper our performance anymore," Cambodian coach Tep Long Sovannara told reporters at the pre-match briefing on Saturday. Macau manager Delagado de Sousa Daniel echoed the same view. "We are used to such conditions and it is a matter of time to adapt to it," said Daniel. Macau coach Leung Sui wing believes all participating teams have the same target to qualify for the finals and he was also confident to secure a final place through winning the qualifiers. The coach said that the players of the Macau team have been together for one and a half years and the inclusion of some new players have strengthened the side, who qualified for the qualifiers with an advantage of away goal against Mongolia with an aggregate 3-3 result in play-off matches. Macau will face on Myanmar in the first match at 3:00pm. Myanmar coach Tin Myint Aung also saw no problem with condition and he compared the weather to their own country. Myanmar have brought a youth team, mostly comprising of U-23 players as coach Aung wants to build up new generation for the senior team. The coach thinks their two-week preparation is well enough to qualify for the finals as his side won four out of four practice matches at home. It seems Myanmar are only thinking about hosts Bangladesh. "We had earlier played against Bangladesh on a few occasions and we know them well. So I think Bangladesh will be the tough opponents for us in the tournament," said Aung. Meanwhile, the eastern galleries have been kept open for the school-going students, who would be able to enter showing their identity cards. bd
