 NAMSAI, India, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rising numbers of wild elephants are being illegally captured from the jungles of northeast India and forced to work in temples and give tourists rides, conservationists say. About 70 to 80 of Assam's 5,000 wild elephants are smuggled out of the northeastern state every year, conservationists say, despite India's ban on the trapping of wild elephants in 1986. "Elephant smuggling has become rampant in Assam in recent years," said Soumyadeep Datta, a conservationist in the state, which is home to about a third of India's population of wild elephants. Officially, Assam's forestry department says there is no problem. But, talking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, a senior forestry official said the conservationists' might even be underestimating the extent of the problem. It normally takes a team of men on three to four elephants to separate a wild elephant from its herd and capture it. It can then expect to be tied up, beaten with sticks and poked with sharpened rods until it is tamed, conservationists say. "Usually it takes three to four months to train an elephant without inflicting injuries. But these people torture the elephants and inflict injuries as they finish the training within a month," said Kushal Konwar Sarma of the government's Project Elephant, which is working to preserve wild elephants. It can then be sold to Hindu temples or into the tourist and leisure industry, passed off as having been born to a captive elephant. "We decide the price according to the size of the animal," said Tarak, an elephant smuggler working in the jungles of Assam's Namsai district. "We sell a baby elephant for around 100,000 rupees ($2,500)." A smuggler typically earns 15,000 to 30,000 rupees per elephant, he said. Given the size of the creatures, all this must be done in collusion with corrupt forestry officials, who help smugglers prepare forged documents showing the animal was born in captivity. Many captured elephants end up in Hindu temples, particularly in the country's south, where they are seen as a symbol of prosperity and take part in ceremonies. They are often seen in temples offering blessings with their trunks in exchange for a few rupees. And an elephant ride through one of India's national parks is an important part of many tourists' trip to the country. But captive elephants often suffer from being away from their natural habitat. Tuberculosis is particularly common, said Project Elephant's Sarma. ($1=40.98 Indian rupe
