 KATHMANDU, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's parliament has approved a law earmarking seats for women and ethnic groups in this year's constituent assembly elections, officials said on Friday, a move aimed at defusing ethnic protests. The vote is due in November or December for the 497-member assembly, meant to draft a new constitution and decide whether to retain the Himalayan nation's monarchy or establish a republic. Nepal's interim parliament, which includes Maoist former rebels, passed the law late on Thursday, allowing voters to elect 240 members to the assembly directly, speaker Subash Chandra Nemwang said.

The polls, due this month, were delayed after the commission said it needed more time to prepare. "Now the government should decide the election date soon so that we can make all arrangements for the vote," he said. The elections will be the culmination of a peace process under which the Maoists have laid down their weapons for UN monitoring and joined an interim government. Their decade-long civil war against the monarchy claimed more than 13,000 lives and hit the aid- and tourism-dependent economy in one of the world's poorest countri
