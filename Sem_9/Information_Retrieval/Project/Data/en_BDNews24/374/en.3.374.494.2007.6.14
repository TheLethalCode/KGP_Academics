 THE HAGUE, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 1989 ban on elephant ivory exports will be extended for nine years after one-off sales of stocks by southern African nations, a UN conference on endangered species agreed on Thursday. The 171-nation talks endorsed an overnight compromise by African ministers, reached after days of disputes, about how to halt poaching while letting local communities benefit from ivory sales in regions where elephant numbers are rising. "We have reached consensus on the proposal," Greg Leach, an Australian chairing the talks of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in the Hague, said to applause from delegates. The deal will allow one-off sales of government ivory stockpiles by four southern African nations, registered as of Jan. 31, 2007, and then bar them from making new proposals to CITES to allow exports of ivory for nine years. Kenya and Mali had argued for a total ban on ivory exports for up to 20 years to halt poaching, saying 19,000 elephants are poached a year, pushing elephants towards extinction in many areas. Southern African states Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa favoured tightly regulated sales, saying elephant numbers were rising. Proceeds of sales will be ploughed back into conservation and into building schools or hospitals. "This resolution keeps humanity living side by side with our natural resoures," Zimbabwe's Environment and Tourism Minister Francis Nhema said. The United States objected to the inclusion of sales by Zimbabwe, saying poaching was rising sharply. Julius Kipng'etich, head of the Kenya Wildlife Service who led his country's delegation, said the deal was a "Africa's finest hour, a proud moment for the continent, its people and the elephant". "This African solution to an African problem marks a great step forward for wildlife conservation," CITES Secretary-General Willem Wijnstekers said. "It's good news for the elephant, good news for the people who live alongside them and good news for regional cooperation in Afria." The dispute on the world's largest land mammal has been the most divisive issue at the June 3-15 talks about how best to regulate trade in threatened species such as tigers, corals, fish or timber. It was unclear how big stockpiles are. Botswana says, for instance, that it has stockpiles of 55 tonnes from animals that die of natural causes, from seizures from poachers and from shooting "problem elephants". Ivory sells in Japan for hundreds of dollars per kilo (pound) and is prized in jewellery and for carvings. African elephants number about 470,000-685,000 against millions decades ago, but populations are rising in some southern regions. Since the 1989 ban, a one-off sale of 50 tonnes of ivory was approved in 1997. Another approved last week -- of 60 tonnes to Japan split between 20 tonnes from Botswana, 30 tonnes from South Africa and 10 from Namibia -- would become part of the agreed stockpile sale
