 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)A special court Thursday set June 21 to hand down a verdict on the graft case against former BNP state minister Amanullah Aman and wife Sabera Anam. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban set the date. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on March 6 for acquiring assets through unfair means. SM Shajahan, the counsel for the accused, told court Aman and Sabera had been indicted in the case with motive and the government had failed to prove allegations against them. He appealed to court to acquit the couple. The court recorded testimonies of 23 witnesses in the case. Shajahan said: "None of the legal procedural actions in this case such as, serving a wealth statement notice, the FIR, an investigation report and the chargesheet were executed properly." State defence lawyer Mahbub Ahmed said: "The accusations have all been documented and proved substantially. I plead to court for awarding the accused maximum possible punishment." Aman was taken to the court from Dhaka Central Jail by prison van at about 11:30am and an ambulance carried Sabera from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. According to case details, the couple had acquired Tk 8.28 crore in illegal assets during the period 1992-2006, which they did not mention in their wealth statement to the ACC. bdnews24
