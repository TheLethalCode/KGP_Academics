 KABUL, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US soldier opened fire at the scene of a suicide bombing in the Afghan capital on Saturday, killing one civilian and wounding another, police said. Ali Shah Paktiawal, chief of Kabul police's criminal branch, described the shooting as a "mistake". He gave no more details. A US military spokesman said US-led coalition forces were still looking into the incident. Paktiawal said the soldier had opened fire after a suicide bomber attacked a military-civilian convoy on the outskirts of Kabul, killing four civilians and wounding five people, including a foreign soldier.
