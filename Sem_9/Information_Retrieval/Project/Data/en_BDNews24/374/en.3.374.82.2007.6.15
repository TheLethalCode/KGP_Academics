 KABUL, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suicide bombers attacked foreign troops in central and southern Afghanistan on Friday, killing five children and a Dutch soldier in a day of renewed bloodshed. Another foreign soldier, belonging to a US-led coalition force, also died in combat in eastern Paktika province on Friday as violence flared in areas where Taliban guerrillas were waging an insurgency against the government and its foreign allies.

Four adult civilians were also killed and seven wounded, local police chief Mohammad Qasim added.

ISAF referred inquiries to Afghanistan's Defence Ministry, but a ministry spokesman was not immediately available for comment. A US military spokesman said the soldier killed in Paktika province had died from wounds sustained in combat. He declined to give any details or the name or nationality of the soldier. Also on Friday, a Dutch aid group said two of its Afghan staff, a doctor and a driver, had been kidnapped for a $100,000 ransom in eastern Nangarhar province while they were returning from a vaccination field trip on Wednesday. The kidnappers have threatened to behead the two men, said Geert Leerink, Asia operations director for HealthNet TPO, which is providing health care across Afghanistan. "It's not clear who is the (kidnapping) group, if it is Taliban or a local tribal group," Leerink said. "Community leaders of the area are trying to solve the problem because they know the grou
