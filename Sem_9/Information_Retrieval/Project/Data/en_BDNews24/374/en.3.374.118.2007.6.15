 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka stocks hit a new high last week as optimism of good earnings brought in fresh buying into most of the sectors after a three-day profit-taking spree. The benchmark DGEN or general index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange surged to 2028.83 Thursday, breaching the previous high at 2017.44 points on June 4. The DGEN added 22.41 points or 1.12 percent from the previous week. The other two indices on the DSE also ended upbeat. Banks, especially Uttara, AB, Dutch-Bangla, UCBL, IFIC and Rupali reinvigorated the market. "It seemed very strong and positive, and looked like a buyers' market due high interests of both retail and institutional investors," said Saiful Islam, managing director of Equity Partners Securities. "The market passed a topsy-turvy week due to convergence of a few elements. Profit-taking, overlapping of IPO subscriptions and worries over hassles in legalising untaxed income influenced the market as a whole," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh. The burse rebounded on June 13 after a three-day profit-taking spree. A Bangladesh Bank advice to five banksUttara, UCBL, Dutch-Bangla, IFIC and ABto issue bonus or right shares buoyed the market. The BB restricted the announcement of cash dividends by these banks until each of their paid-up capitals reached Tk 1.0 billion. Reports on quick transfer of Rupali Bank to Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud injected extra vigour into the market, pushing market capitalisation to Tk 453.43 billion last week from Tk 444.64 billion a week earlier. Turnover, however, fell 31.67 percent to Tk 5.93 billion last week from Tk 8.68 billion the previous week. The daily average turnover also dropped to Tk 1.18 billion from Tk 1.73 billion a week ago. Sayeed linked the slide in turnover to the overlapping of IPO subscription dates. Recently five IPOs, Union Capital, Phoenix Finance and Investment, International Leasing and Financial Services, Trust Bank and Paramount have set dates for public subscriptions. Investors who want to subscribe to the next IPO from the refund of the previous ones, face difficulties due to the overlapping of subscription dates, he said. "We have never been faced with such a problem," Sayeed said. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, BRAC Bank, Southeast Bank, AB Bank and Prime Bank ruled the turnover table on the bourse during the week. bd
