 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)Professor Ashraf Hossain Chowdhury, chairman of the 27th BCS exams committee, resigned office Thursday. He said the reasons behind the decision were personal. Prof Ashraf joined his previous teaching job at the marketing department of Dhaka University. The resignation came after the 27th BCS oral exam was cancelled on May 30 amid broader allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism surrounding the exams. Prof Ashraf told bdnews24.com that he had just wanted to quit with dignity. Prof Ashraf was appointed to the PSC on May 30, 2004. His resignation cut the numbers of PSC members to seven. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams in a move meant to restore trust of people in the Public Service Commission and establish transparency in the wake of several news reports questioning the transparency of BCS exams. bdnews24
