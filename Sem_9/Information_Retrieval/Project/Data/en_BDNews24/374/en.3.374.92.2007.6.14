 ABUJA, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Nigerian court freed on bail former militia leader Mujahid Dokubo-Asari on Thursday, meeting a demand by armed groups who have disrupted oil production and kidnapped expatriate workers in the Niger Delta. The release of Asari, who is on trial for treason, comes after rebel groups in the delta freed hostages, declared a truce and said they were willing to try a dialogue with the government of newly inaugurated President Umaru Yar'Adua. Their peace moves remain tentative, however, and the effect of the killings of eight suspected militants by troops during an attempted attack on an oil well in Bayelsa state in the delta on Tuesday was not yet clear. Asari's lawyer applied for bail on health grounds and prosecutors did not oppose the application. "I'm convinced the accused is not playing to the gallery. The accused is ordered to be released on health grounds," said Justice Peter Olayiwola. The judge added that Asari should not hold any political rally or engage in any political activities and his movements should be reported to the security services. The Supreme Court had denied Asari bail last Friday after a 20-month legal process, arguing he represented a threat to national security. Prosecutors had steadfastly opposed his release until now. Activists close to nascent peace negotiations between the government and the delta rebels said Thursday's court decision was the result of a political deal. Asari has been in detention since September 2005 and his trial has dragged on from one adjournment to the next. There were several unsuccessful attempts by elders from his Ijaw ethnic group to broker a deal to get him out. The climate changed after the swearing-in of Yar'Adua, who used his inaugural speech on May 29 to call for a ceasefire in the delta. Since then, powerful state governors from the region have publicly called for Asari's release. Ijaw activists said Thursday's ruling would boost efforts to pacify armed rebels demanding local control over oil revenues and compensation for oil spills in the impoverished delta. "This was part of what we've been demanding. The action is in the right direction," said Ifeanyi Jonjon, head of the Ijaw Youth Council. The Ijaw are the most populous ethnic group in the delta. "Asari can be used to reach out to the freedom fighters and redirect them away from carrying guns and towards peace," he said. Asari, who has lost a lot of weight in detention and has complained of ill treatment by the State Security Services, was not present in court but his supporters were jubilant. "This is good news for anyone with a business in the Niger Delta. It will pour cold water on the situation. Asari is key to bringing peace to the delta," said Emmanuel Diffa, an Ijaw elder who has been campaigning for Asari's release
