 NEW YORK, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hostility is associated with reduced lung function in young adults, according to a report in the journal Health Psychology. Previous work has demonstrated that hostility increases the risk of coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and the overall risk of death, Dr Benita Jackson, a psychologist at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, and her co-authors note. But little has been done to examine the link between hostility and lung function. They evaluated data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study cohort (CARDIA). Included were 5,115 participants age 18 to 30 years old in 1998-1996. Hostility was measured using the Cook-Medley Questionnaire, a standard test. Hostility was highest in black men, followed by black women, white men, and white women. Both race and ethnicity were also associated with reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity, two commonly used measures of lung function. Jackson's team observed that the association of hostility with impaired lung function was still present after accounting for the influence of age and height, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and asthma. They conclude the additional research is needed to establish whether hostility actually occurs before changes in lung function or is associated with lung function at other points in the life course, especially during older adultho
