 MARBELLA, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tip-off hotline set up by a former British policeman on the Costa del Sol has nabbed three British criminals on the run in Spain and impressed local police looking for new ways to tackle organized crime. The Spanish coast is a popular bolthole for criminals fleeing the law because they can blend easily into thriving expatriate communities, like the 500,000 foreigners resident in the southern province of Andalusia. The mainly British suburb of Nueva Andalucia lies just inland from the flashy port of Puerto Banus, where luxury yachts bob in their moorings and Ferraris park alongside a promenade lined with top-end stores like Gucci and Dolce and Gabbana. "It's that attraction of being in a nice, sunny environment, lost among the expats in a community of people where most people don't know much about them anyway," said Dave Cording, who worked as a police officer for 33 years before becoming Director of Operations at British criminal-hunting charity Crimestoppers. Crimestoppers, in the first campaign to target British criminals living on the Costa del Sol, encouraged anyone who recognized the wanted criminals on its Web site www.mostwanted-uk.org to call a Spanish free-phone number. Calls are answered in the UK by Crimestoppers call-handlers. "We don't want to know who you are, just what you know," a banner reads on the site. The concept of giving information anonymously in a criminal investigation is unknown in Spain, where police witnesses must identify themselves. While the scheme targets Britons, Germans make up the biggest group of criminals on the run in Spain by nationality, police say, followed by the French, Italians, Belgians and British. The British runaways often continue their life of crime, falling in with local gangs. Violent gun attacks involving expats are not unusual in the area surrounding Marbella. Last August, a London man with a Spanish criminal record was shot dead at close range on the terrace of a busy bar in the development, where pink and white villas and apartments lie behind manicured hedges smothered in purple bougainvillea. "We were just so lucky that they didn't get anyone else ... we were very busy at the time," said a waitress who was working that night in The Point bar. MOBSTERS The three the Crimestoppers initiative helped track down were among ten criminals originally advertised when the project was launched in November, wanted for credit card fraud, conspiracy to murder and drug-smuggling. "The whole thing has been a huge success for us," said Cording. "All those three people have been on the run for a while. Nobody knew where they were, but there was a guess from the police involved that they were probably in Spain." Inspector Lorenzo, the head of the Spanish police's fugitive unit, who cannot give his surname for security reasons, was glad to collaborate with Crimestoppers on the project and is considering setting up a similar scheme for Spanish criminals. "It has been a big help, the exercise has turned up a mountain of information for the British police," he said. On a shelf behind the inspector's desk in Madrid lie a Thames Valley Police medal and a British bobby's helmet, given to him in thanks for capturing three British men in Barcelona wanted for the torture and murder of a man in Slough, England. He has over 1,000 criminals on his wanted database, most of them foreigners, and has detained nearly 400 fugitives since the unit was set up in 2004. But the image of the London mobster retiring from crime to bake in the Mediterranean sun by the pool of a glitzy villa, popularized in films like 'Sexy Beast', is misguided, Lorenzo said. "They don't make a big show, they live in run-of-the-mill houses, they don't have big cars or big mansions. They live very modestly and merge into their surroundings," he sai
