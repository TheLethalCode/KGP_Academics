 LISBON, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel still wants a two-state solution with moderate Palestinians despite Hamas's takeover of the Gaza Strip, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said on Friday. But Livni, speaking in Lisbon after Hamas Islamist fighters routed forces loyal to the Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas in Gaza in six days of fighting, said Israel will maintain pressure on Hamas in the coastal region. "The goal is a two-state solution, or to give the Palestinians their own possibility to fulfil their aspirations in a state of their own," Livni told journalists during a visit to Portugal.

"We need forces to stop them and there is a huge question whether those who are talking about an international intervention in the corridor are also willing to go house to house and to confront (them)," she said. "I am talking about confrontation with the terrorists, with Hamas, and this is an open question," Livni said, adding Israel was only interested in an international force on the border in order to crack down on arms smuggli
