 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  The finance adviser and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Thursday differed on the foreign financing component in the proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08. Jonathan Dunn, resident representative of the IMF in Dhaka, at a post-budget discussion, where finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam was present, said that foreign financing in the proposed budget was quite ambitious. While the adviser said: "We have been fairly realistic on foreign financing projection in the proposed budget." Huge foreign loans are in the pipeline, he said. "So we've not made an unrealistic projection." The adviser said that Bangladesh's foreign loan receipts were only about US$ 400 million till January of the current fiscal. "The figure increased to $1.2 billion until Wednesday," he said. Azizul announced the country's budget of Tk 87,137 crore, implying a deficit of 5.6 percent of the GDP. Of the deficit, financing from domestic sources is to cover 3.6 percent, while the remaining 2 percent, is to come from foreign financing. The net external borrowing has been estimated at Tk 6,305 crore in the proposed budget compared to Tk 5,183 crore in the revised budget for fiscal 2006-07. bd
