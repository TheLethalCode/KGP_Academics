 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) -A Dhaka court Thursday granted the police four more days to interrogate former BNP lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu in a case for misappropriation of relief CI sheets, blankets and rice. The court also allowed the law-enforcers to take former chief forest conservator Mohammed Osman Gani into another three-day remand, granted earlier under the Passport Act. Falu was taken to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka at 3pm Thursday. Assistant director of the Anticorruption Commission, Sheikh Abdus Salam, prayed for a seven-day remand to quiz the former BNP lawmaker. Metropolitan magistrate Jagannath Das Khokan granted four days after a hearing. Deputy director of RAB-2 Md Abdus Salam filed the case on March 2 against six people, including Falu with Tejgaon Police Station. The police in their remand appeal said 600 pieces of corrugated iron sheets, six sacks of blankets and 15 kilogrammes of rotten rice, meant for government relief, were seized from Tejgaon ward No. 37 commissioner's office, under Falu's constituency. The accused needed to be further grilled to know through whom and how these government relief supplies had been stocked there, the police added. In the case, employees of the ward commissioner's office Sujat Ali, Monju, Naziruddin and Shafiquddin were also accused. Gani, the former chief conservator of forests, was produced before the court of Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at 3:45pm after a 12-day remand in three phases. bdnew
