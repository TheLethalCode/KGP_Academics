 CAPE TOWN, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Financial Corp plans to lift spending in Africa to take advantage of strong commodity prices and a fall in the number of conflicts racking the continent, a senior official said on Thursday. The IFC, the World Bank's private sector lender, has spent $1 billion in Africa since it was set up in 1956, and the lion's share of that funding has taken place in the last four years, said Thierry Tanoh, IFC Director for Sub-Saharan Africa. "Africa is the place to be," he said in an interview at the World Economic Forum for Africa. "But put in perspective, that $1 billion is but a drop in the ocean. I would hope to see us put in $10 billion in the next 10 years, half of it going into infrastructure." Tanoh said the IFC had dedicated most of its annual budget in the last four years to funding African projects. Much of the IFC's cash has been in loans and joint investments in more than 20 countries on the world's poorest continent. Since the IFC funds only 25 percent of projects, the full worth of investments it has been involved in so far is some $4 billion. Roads, rail, ports and energy have been blamed by most businesses for turning off potential investment in Africa. But the ramp-up in IFC spending has been driven by a raw material boom fuelled by resource-hungry China and India, and economic reforms by African nations, which has given the private sector a bigger say in the running of their economies and allowed small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to grow. IFC's investment in various mining ventures in Africa jumped to $300 million in 2007 against $50 million in 2006, with funding going into platinum, gold and petrochemical sectors. "Before, the economic environment in Africa was not conducive. But in the past five years we have seen fewer conflicts, a resource boom and an average growth of above 4 percent," said Tanoh. "The next step is to hope to fund projects that will see these resources transformed for export from the continent. We are also widening our net to fund projects in smaller countries we have not been involved in before." IFC has also spread its wings to embrace some smaller economies including Rwanda, Togo and Burkina Faso, which have seen new cash injected in transport, infrastructure and SMEs. Tanoh also said the IFC has also launched a post-conflict initiative with countries that were formerly at war such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He said IFC had opened an office this month in the DRC capital Kinshasa, and was keen on mining and infrastructure. He said he hoped to see investment's worth $300 million a year in the DRC in the next 5-10 years. Angola's tourism sector was an area he was also keen to invest in
