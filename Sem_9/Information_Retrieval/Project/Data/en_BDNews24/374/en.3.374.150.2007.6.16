 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina Friday alleged that the military-backed government would make people file another 30 cases against her. She said the government were looking for the owners of Pran Group, Akij Group of Industries and Sharif Melamine Industries to get them to press charges against her. Hasina named the three big companies in her news briefing to reporters at her Sudha Sadan home amid government restrictions on her scheduled travel to the US to see her relatives. The former prime minister said: "If somebody is a thief, the government tries to bring the same charges against others. If somebody is an extortionist, the government will brand others as extortionists." "Nothing is more inhuman than making innocent people guilty of the wrongs they didn't do at all." Hasina faces three extortion casesall filed during the state of emergency by as many businessmenmost of them known to be loyal to the AL. The AL chief denied all charges and said the cases had been designed to harm her. bdn
