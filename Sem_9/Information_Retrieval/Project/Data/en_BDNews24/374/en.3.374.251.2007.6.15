<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina Friday said she was not sure she would be able to fly out of the country to the US to see her relatives there. "I am not still sure I will be able to go. I have read in the newspapers that two more cases were filed against me," Hasina told reporters in a midday news briefing at her Sudha Sadan home. Hasina, scheduled to travel to the US Friday night, faces two more extortion cases filed by as many businessmen Wednesday. "I didn't hear from the government about any travel ban. I heard it from others that they won't let me go for the sake of investigations into the two cases. "One thing I don't understand, when I was abroad it was said that there was a case against me and I cannot be allowed to come home. "It was said that if I returned home the investigation would be hindered. "Now I hear that if I go abroad the investigations will be hampered again. The matter isn't clear to me at all." "A conspiracy is onto bar me from elections. We have the right to serve people and the people have the right to take our service," Hasina said. "It's nothing but a conspiracy to deprive people of the right." Politics cannot be cleaned by destroying political institutions, Hasina said. The AL chief took questions from reporters after outgoing Vietnamese ambassador Ngo Van Hoa met her at Sudha Sadan at about 12.30pm. Hasina termed the cases against her false. "I can say it on oath that I demanded nothing from anybody in my political career." "I can say it on oath that I demanded nothing from anybody in my political career. I didn't have to demand." "Donations are required to run a party. It is the moral duty of those who support the Awami League to pay donations. The money is meant to run the party," Hasina said. "There is a difference between donations and extortion. The government doesn't seem to understand that." Hasina said the government does not provide assistance for running parties. "There is no law either that the party will run on government funds. If anybody helps the party, it doesn't amount to extortion." "Should I say Prothom Alo collects money thanks to Bandhu Sabha and help people with the money and it falls in the category of extortion? In that line of argument, it is extortion." bdnews
