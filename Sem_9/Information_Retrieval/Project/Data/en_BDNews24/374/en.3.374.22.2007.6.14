<TITLE> Time still not right for indoor politics: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) - Law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein said Thursday the government is reluctant to lift a ban on indoor politics at the moment since it believes such a move will allow corrupt individuals to take undue advantages. The law adviser made the remarks in response to outgoing US ambassador Patricia Butenis' comment on a resumption of parlour politics. Butenis Wednesday criticised the government for not lifting the ban on all political activity. "I am disappointed that I am leaving Bangladesh with the ban still in place on all political party activity, a ban which does not seem to apply to some behind-the-scenes activity promoting the concept of a new party," she said at an American Alumni Association programme. Mainul said: "We are moving forward, establishing a roadmap for democracy. We have reformed the Election Commission and ensured the independent Anticorruption Commission to free politics from dishonesty. "In addition, the Public Service Commission (PSC) has been restructured." "It is understood that some political activists are speaking behind the scenes about political reforms in their parties, although they are doing so with a state of emergency in force. "We want to create an environment for reform. Pro-reform leaders should be given some space." Speaking at the information ministry, the adviser said, "Parlour politics is not the most noteworthy issue. Re-establishing democracy is our main objective." On whether the government was patronising pro-reform leaders, Mainul said, "As a government we have to keep our eyes on all sides. Much of the population did not know how huge the corruption of big leaders had become. "The people now have an opportunity to know that. That is why there is still dialogue about reform." bdnews24.com/ahd
