<TITLE> Japan PM Abe's support slides below 30 pct in poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's support rate fell below 30 percent for the first time since he took office last September, a survey showed on Friday, further dimming his ruling camp's chances of winning a looming election. Abe, who faces his first big electoral test in an upper house poll expected next month, is struggling to soothe voter outrage over mismanaged pensions and concern about corruption after his scandal-tainted farm minister killed himself in May. "I believe it's important to sincerely carry out policy and not rejoice or despair over the support rate," Abe told reporters. Jiji news agency said a survey it conducted between June 8-11 found support for Abe's cabinet had fallen to 28.8 percent, down 10.6 points from the previous month, while 48.4 percent of respondents did not back his government. It is the first time a Japanese prime minister's support rate has dropped below 30 percent since April 2001, when gaffe-prone premier Yoshiro Mori saw his popularity slide below what some analysts consider a crisis level, Jiji said. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) pressured Mori to resign and replaced him with the maverick Junichiro Koizumi in order avoid a bashing in an upper house election that year. This year's upper house election was expected on July 22, but some LDP members want to extend the current session of parliament and delay the poll to give time for voters' anger to cool. "I think they will postpone the election until July 29, but even so, it will be tough," said Hidenori Suezawa, a chief bondrol of the chamber. But a big loss would mean the ruling bloc would be unable to enact legislation, which must be approved by both houses of parliament, threatening political paralysis and prompting calls for Abe to resign or even call a snap lower house election. Voters are outraged at the failure of a government agency to keep track of millions of pension premium payments, bungling that could mean retirees are getting short-changed. "It may take some time, but my cabinet will resolve concerns over the pension problem. I promise to make all payments," Abe said. A senior opposition leader expressed guarded optimism about the election on Thursday and said an extension of parliament would actually work to his party's advantage. "The people's anger over the 'vanished pensions' is spreading to the regions," Democratic Party Secretary General Yukio Hatoyama told Reuters in an interview. "If parliament's session is extended ... it will serve as a stage for us to fight our battl
