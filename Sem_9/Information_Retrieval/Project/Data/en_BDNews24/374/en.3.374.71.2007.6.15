 Faridpur, June 15 (bdnews24.com) - Politicians had established such misrule by diving into corruption and abusing power that martial law might have been the only way to restore order in the country, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Friday. "It is our pride that Bangladesh has not become like Pakistan," he said while exchanging views with the deputy commissioner and officials of different departments at the office of the Faridpur deputy commissioner. "The politicians established a mafia politics and misrule in the country through corruption and misuse of power. The crisis assumed such a proportion that it seemed that only martial law could overcome it. "But the firm stand of the caretaker government and the timely intervention by the patriotic armed forces helped overcome the crisis." Mainul said 11 advisers were working neutrally to continue the democratic process and the administration to establish justice. He asked all to work unitedly for establishing people's rule and said there was no influence or pressure of evil politics on the administration. The adviser later laid the foundation stone of the second building of Faridpur District Bar Association. He also held separate meetings with the district's judicial service officials at the judge's court building. bdnews24.c
