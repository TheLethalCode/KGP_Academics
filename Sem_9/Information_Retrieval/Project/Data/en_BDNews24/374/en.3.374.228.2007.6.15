 BRUSSELS, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The international Quartet of Middle East peace mediators pledged full support to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday as he sought to muster an emergency government, a European Union spokeswoman said. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon and EU officials held an emergency teleconference call after the Islamist movement Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip. "There was a clear message of support to President Abbas especially in this difficult time of forming an emergency government," a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said after the conversation of around an hour. "There was great concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and a commitment to use all means to ensure humanitarian efforts can be realised," she said, adding the Quartet planned new contacts on the crisis early next week. Russia separately called for calm and urged mediators to help to avert civil war, while Egypt pulled its diplomats out of Gaza in protest at the Hamas takeover and Iran said the violence showed Palestinians had lost sight of their true enemy. Both the United States and the EU had endorsed Abbas's decision to declare a state of emergency and vowed to stand behind Palestinian moderates, but the Quartet statement underlined the breadth of international backing for Abbas. "We fully support him in his (effort) to try and end this crisis for the Palestinian people," Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters in Washington. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack described Abbas's choice for prime minister, the Western-backed independent Salam Fayyad, as enjoying "a sterling reputation" and brushed off Hamas appeals that the move was tantamount to a coup. There was no word on when the West might end an embargo on direct aid to the Palestinian Authority imposed after elections last year won by Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, the EU and Israel. However Solana's spokeswoman said efforts would be made to get relief through to the most needy Palestinians in Gaza as soon as security allowed. Despite the embargo on direct aid, the EU had maintained humanitarian transfers, but on Wednesday said it had to suspend even that because of the "suicidal" fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Israeli President Shimon Peres about the situation, which the Kremlin said caused "serious concern". "The bloodshed is continuing and it is important to help the Palestinians to reunite. Civil war in Palestine is in no one's interest," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters. British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said: "Once again, extremists carrying guns have prevented progress against the wishes of the majority who seek a peaceful two-state solution..." In London, a senior Foreign Office official said Britain was open to the idea of an international force in Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert suggested should monitor the Gaza-Egypt border to help counter the growing strength of Hamas. The official said it would be "challenging". In a blow to Hamas -- long welcome in Cairo despite being shunned in the West -- the head of Egypt's diplomatic mission in Gaza, Major-General Burhan Hammad, left with his entire staff as Hamas declared it had seized control of Gaza. Iran, a key ally of Hamas, also signalled its displeasure. "Unfortunately, Palestinian fighters have forgotten their main enemy and are fighting against each other instead of the Zionist regime (Israel)," said former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. "This ... is in line with the enemy's interests. It's exactly what they want," he told worshippers in Tehr
