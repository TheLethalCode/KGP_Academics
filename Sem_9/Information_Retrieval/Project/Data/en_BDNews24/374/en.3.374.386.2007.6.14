<TITLE> Beckham confident LA move will not affect England career </TITLE>

 MADRID, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham is confident his decision to join LA Galaxy will not jeopardise his international career following his recent return to the England squad. "The manager (Steve McClaren) has already made me aware that as long as my fitness is right and as long as I'm playing like I have been in the last six months then there won't be a problem. "I believe my fitness will be the same as it is now if not better," the Real Madrid midfielder told a news conference on Thursday. Beckham was recalled to the England squad last month, nearly a year after his last international, and played a decisive role in last week's 3-0 win over Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifier. The 32-year-old former England captain put his impressive late-season form with Real Madrid down to a combination of playing fewer matches in the first part of the campaign and renewed confidence following his return to club action. "I think the reason why my form has been so good in the last part of the season is that I didn't play very much," he said. "While I wasn't training and playing with the team I was resting and spending time with family. It was a position I'd never been in before. "I was getting my rest in, having days off when players were meeting up with their national teams, so that's the reason I'm so fresh now. The other reason is confidence. "Six months ago my confidence was probably knocked out of me, but now it's back and I'm enjoying the rest of the season and I can't wait for the last game." Beckham will have the chance to leave Real on a high in his final appearance for the club this Sunday. If they beat Real Mallorca at the Bernabeu, Real will end a four-year trophy drought and wrap up their 30th league title
