<TITLE> Tigers eye taking Test matches to fifth day </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  Newly-installed Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful Thursday said they want to shake off the poor Test efforts and take all three Test matches against Sri Lanka to the fifth day. "Our target is to take all three Test matches to the fifth day," Ashraful said at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Tigers will fly Saturday to the emerald islands on a five-week tour also to play three one-dayers. "If we perform better in Test series, we can take it to the one-day series though we have been playing some good cricket in the shorter version of game," he added. The youngest Test centurion, however, knows the tour would be tough for them as even the top-ranked teams struggle on Sri Lankan wickets. "We know the top teams of the world struggle in Sri Lanka and our previous experiences also tell us so. "But this time we are positive to play better cricket in the Tests and the boys are looking forward to it." The Tigers focussed on batting in the week-long, new-look training method that is said to have instilled confidence in the team. "Every batsman almost spent one hour in the nets a day and tried to correct their mistakes and avoided playing rushed shots. It increased our self-confidence," the 22-year old middle order batsman explained. "Sri Lanka are good opponents, but we are not far beyond them. Most of us are young and the old guys have been doing very well that would help us a lot." Bangladesh interim coach Shaun Williams also thinks the youthful side are constantly improving and keen to do well. "It is always exciting to work with the national side whose expectation is generally high, but we are looking forward to make sure to do as best as we can. "The boys are keen to do well in Sri Lanka and are still learning," said the Australian coach, also manager of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) development unit. The 35-year old coach, however, thinks the Sri Lanka tour would be tough. "We know it is going to be a tough series, which is what you should always expect at the international level. But, we are focussed on what we need to do. "We know the young players would like to get exposure as they are learning every day and that is the way of progress." The Tigers have been given a one-day rest before their departure. Bangladesh will open their tour with a three-day match on June 20-22 in Colombo before the first Test starts on June 25-29. The second Test and the final Test will start on July 3 and June 11 while the three one-dayer are billed for July 20, 22 and 24.
