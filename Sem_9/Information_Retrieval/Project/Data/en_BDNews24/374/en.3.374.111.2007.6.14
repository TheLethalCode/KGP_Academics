 JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa is to launch currency futures trading on Monday, allowing investors to trade rand futures in a regulated exchange for the first time, exchange operator JSE Ltd said on Thursday. The currency futures will be traded on the JSE's interest rate exchange, YieldX, which was aimed at giving retail investors access to offshore forex markets. "This is a milestone for South Africa's financial markets, it will be the first time that people will be able to take positions on the currency and could be used as a hedge," said Allan Thompson, head of derivatives and equities trading at the JSE Securities Exchange. The market would start with dollar/rand trading, adding the euro and sterling at a later date, he said. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel announced in his budget speech in February that JSE Ltd had been given the go-ahead to launch futures trading on the rand to help boost liquidity. The turnover on the local currency market is currently $10 billion a day, according to Reserve Bank data, but the JSE said they had no estimate of how much the currency futures would add to that. The JSE said individuals could trade the currency with a minimum contract of $1,000 with no limitations but pension funds and insurance companies would be subject to their 15 percent foreign allocation allowance, in line with exchange control regulations. Asset managers and registered collective investments would be limited by their 25 percent foreign allocation while corporates would need special permission from the Reserve Bank to participate. Hedge funds would be barred until the industry was regulated, it said. "These are not our rules, they come from the Reserve Bank, every request will be reviewed on a case by case basis and they can accept or reject a request," said Warren Geers, YieldX senior manager. The currency futures market was another step towards abolishing foreign exchange controls in South Africa, exchange officials said. "Based on how it goes, we do see further exchange control relaxation. The Treasury would like to relax exchange controls, but do not want to do it with a bang, but we can't say what dispensation will be next after this one," Thompson said
