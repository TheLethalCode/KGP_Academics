 BAGHDAD, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates met top US military commanders in Iraq on Saturday to assess a troop build-up designed to buy time for the Shia-led government to win over disaffected Sunni Arabs. Gates flew into Baghdad on Friday, saying Washington was disappointed with the government's progress so far in passing a series of laws aimed at reconciling Iraq's warring factions. His comments amounted to some of the strongest US criticism of the government, although he took care to stress Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki faced "enormous obstacles" and deserved Washington's continued support. US officials gave no details of his talks with the leading US military commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, and his number two, Lieutenant-General Raymond Odierno. Gates is due to meet Maliki and other Iraqi leaders later in the day. Gates is the third senior US official to visit Baghdad this week, following in the footsteps of the top US military commander in the Middle East, Admiral William Fallon, and US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. He said he would echo their message to Maliki and other Iraqi leaders to speed up passage through parliament of legislation that includes laws on distributing oil revenues, control of regional oil fields and holding provincial elections. "It is the same message that I have been delivering since December, that our troops are buying them time to pursue reconciliation, that frankly we are disappointed with the progress so far," Gates told reporters travelling with him. RELUCTANCE The main Iraqi political blocs have so far shown a reluctance to compromise on any of the key issues. Analysts say Shias, Sunni Arabs and Kurds in Maliki's coalition government are too divided to reach a political accommodation on their own. US President George W. Bush has sent an extra 30,000 troops to Iraq, mainly to secure Baghdad, boosting troop levels to 160,000 despite opposition from the Democratic-controlled US Congress, which wants to start bringing soldiers home. The Baghdad security plan was launched in mid-February and has had mixed results. It has been costly in the lives of US soldiers, whose increased presence on the streets of the capital have made them more vulnerable to roadside bombs. In its quarterly report on Iraq this week, the Pentagon said it was too soon to assess the crackdown. While violence was down in Baghdad, the overall level in Iraq was unchanged as militants had simply moved their bases outside the capital, it said. Petraeus and US ambassador Ryan Crocker are due to make an assessment in September on whether the US troop build-up is succeeding in taming the Sunni Arab insurgency and curbing sectarian violence.
