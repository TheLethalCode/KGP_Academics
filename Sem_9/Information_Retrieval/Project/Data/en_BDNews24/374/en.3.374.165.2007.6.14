 BRUSSELS, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission has suspended humanitarian aid to Gaza because of "suicidal" fighting among Palestinian factions and will only resume it if violence stops, the EU's top aid official said on Thursday. "The humanitarian situation is catastrophic, we have had to withdraw our (aid) operators," European Aid and Development Commissioner Louis Michel told Reuters. "It's dramatic and it's unacceptable."
