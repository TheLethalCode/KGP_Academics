 LONDON, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's First Choice Holidays said on Thursday its core first-half loss had widened by 8 percent to 82.5 million pounds ($163 million) as it paid for acquisitions, and selling package holidays remained tough. First Choice, which is merging with German rival TUI, said longhaul and adventure holidays had sold well over the winter but margins at its package holiday arm would continue to suffer over the summer due to increased taxes on holidaymakers and the higher cost of fuelling its planes. "In Mainstream Holidays our performance has tracked in line with our expectations in what remains a challenging market," First Choice said. First Choice said it would raise its interim dividend 11 percent to 2.5 pence per share and said trading in the last six weeks was in line with its expectations. The underlying first-half loss of 82.5 million pounds did not include a further 12.9 million pounds spent closing shops in Germany and Belgium, downsizing elsewhere and paying lawyers and bankers for work on its failed attempt to sell its Mainstream package holiday business. Including all exceptional items, the first-half loss totalled 102.8 million pounds. "The company's prospects will of course depend on the success of the merger with TUI," said Panmure Gordon analyst Gert Zonneveld. "Overall, interim results are reasonably good in what has been a challenging market, particularly in the UK." Shares in the firm, which have trebled in the past two years, rose 2.8 percent to 342.75 pence by 0930 GMT. Chief Executive Peter Long told reporters he had cut the number of holidays on offer to places like Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal this summer by around 4 percent, to boost prices and margins by keeping a stranglehold on supply. "I don't anticipate excess supply in the market for the high season. When I look at the overall market I remain optimistic in terms of selling prices that the whole industry can achieve." he said. Long said the firm would continue to make acquisitions in the adventure and specialist holiday arenas, where people struggle to piece together their own trips on the Internet. He said the weakness of the dollar had also boosted the numbers of British holidaymakers jetting to places like Florida and the Caribbean, adding its new business selling Arctic and Antarctic getaways was also booming. This month the European Commission conditionally approved the firm's plans to tie up with Germany's TUI AG. The European package holiday is set to shrink from four major player to two after the Commission also backed German-owned Thomas Cooks buyout of British package holiday rival MyTravel in May. First Choice and TUI have said they expect to save around 100 million pounds by 2009 by creating TUI Travel Plc, a London-based company 51 percent owned by TUI. First Choice shareholders would own 49 percent
