 MANILA, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo promised on Thursday to end a series of killings of Philippine journalists, asking prosecutors and police to solve such crimes speedily and bring the guilty to justice. Fifty-two journalists have been killed since 2001 when Arroyo was swept into power after an army-backed revolt. Hundreds of leftists and opponents of the government have also been killed in what rights groups say is a systematic pattern of intimidation. "We aim to break this cycle of violence once and for all," Arroyo said at the start of a dialogue with about a dozen senior journalists from seven press associations. "As we have made tough choices to turn around our economy, we will also get a handle on these killings to end them once and for all." Although the discussion centred on killings of journalists, Arroyo said the effort would extend to leftists and government opponents as well. A UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings said in February that the Philippines' military was responsible for many of the deaths. Rights groups say up to 800 people have been killed since Arroyo came to power. The military has said it is investigating. On Thursday, the European Union announced the arrival next week of a six-member team of human rights experts to help the Philippines identify and prosecute those responsible for extra-judicial killings. "The technical mission next week is not in any sense an investigation or a fact-finding exercise in relation to the killings themselves," said Alistair MacDonald, European Commission ambassador to Manila. "The experts will be working with the Philippine authorities and civil society to identify areas where EU technical assistance, training and advice on such matters could be most useful." The experts from Finland, Germany, Sweden and United Kingdom would share Europe's best practices in investigative techniques, forensic science, human rights and humanitarian law based on the request of the Philippines
