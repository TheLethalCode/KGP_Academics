<TITLE> New EU treaty faces Polish veto threat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of "grave consequences" on Thursday if the EU failed to clinch a deal on reforming its institutions, but Austria cautioned that Poland seemed determined to prevent a German-led agreement. In a speech to parliament ahead of a June 21-22 summit where she hopes to revive the treaty, Merkel said agreement with Poland over reform of voting rules was "not yet in sight". Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer, speaking after talks in Poland, went further. "One gets the impression that the Polish leadership... is simply unwilling to allow the Germans a victory in reviving the reforms," he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily. He said they might prefer to defer a deal until the German presidency ends. "They sharply criticised the German presidency," he added. Merkel said the "road map" for launching a new charter that she aims to unveil at the Brussels summit would contain a proposal for reforming the 27-nation bloc's institutions through a so-called "amended treaty" rather than a new "constitution". The term "constitution" has become something of an incumberance since French and Dutch voters rejected the last charter in 2005, plunging the bloc into a crisis of confidence. "If we fail it will not mean the demise of Europe, of course not," Merkel told parliament. "But it will have indescribable and grave consequences for the future of Europe." Poland believes the voting rules contained in the old treaty give big states like Germany too much influence. Its demands for changes are opposed by every EU member state except the Czech Republic, which offers Warsaw half-hearted support. French President Nicolas Sarkozy is due to meet Polish leaders on Thursday to try to persuade them to drop their opposition. Merkel will host Polish President Lech Kaczynski on Saturday near Berlin in a final effort to force a compromise. The charter was aimed at streamlining decision-making in the EU after its expansion into eastern Europe. The twin brothers who rule Poland -- President Lech and Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski -- won elections in 2005 promising to take a tougher stance towards the EU just a year after the country joined. Since then, ties with Brussels have been soured by verbal skirmishes and power-sharing disputes
