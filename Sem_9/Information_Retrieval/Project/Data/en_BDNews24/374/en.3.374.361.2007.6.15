 PRISTINA, Serbia, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbs and ethnic Albanians might need more talks on the fate of Kosovo, to overcome fierce Russian opposition to its independence from Serbia, a senior US official said on Friday. The possibility of resuming talks, raised by US envoy Frank Wisner in Pristina, implied a fresh delay to the ethnic Albanian majority's demand for independence. Diplomats said the talks could last 120 days. But Wisner said there should be no doubt about the outcome. "We talked about the possibility of a resolution that might include a period of further discussion about status," he told reporters after meeting Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu. "If there is to be some further discussion of some time-limited basis, it would be to prove that every effort has been exhausted to achieve an agreement on status. Not to delay what the outcome has to be, but to make it clear to the world that every avenue was pursued." Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombs drove out Serb forces to halt the slaughter of Albanians in a two-year war with separatist guerrillas. Its fate has turned into a high-stakes diplomatic standoff between Russia and the West, which leads 16,000 NATO troops in Kosovo and fears unrest if independence does not come soon. UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari mediated 13 months of talks between Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians in Vienna, ending in stalemate in March. He proposed independence, supervised by the European Union, and ruled out further talks as pointless. Western powers had promised the 90 percent Albanian majority a decision by the summer. But Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the brakes on a draft U.N. resolution at this month's G8 summit, saying Serb sovereignty trumped self-determination. US President George W. Bush, in neighbouring Albania on Sunday, said the United Nations should grant independence quickly, and if Russia blocked it, the West would act. But European powers, which under the Ahtisaari plan would take over supervision of Kosovo, have baulked at the idea of a unilateral declaration of independence. The 27-member EU's fragile unity on Kosovo would almost certainly crumble. President Sejdiu said Kosovo could not be held hostage to delay, but needed "overall support" in the Security Council. Wisner said consensus was needed. "It is important that independence is achieved as a result of a UN Security Council resolution," he said. He stressed there was no agreement as yet between the major powers on whether to hold further talks, and urged Kosovo Albanians to maintain "calm and discipline." Serbia has offered a vague "maximum autonomy" for land cherished by Serbs as their spiritual heartla
