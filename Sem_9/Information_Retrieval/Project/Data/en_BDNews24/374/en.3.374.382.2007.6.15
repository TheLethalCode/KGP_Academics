 LONDON, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The key foreign policy appointments of Britain's premier-in-waiting Gordon Brown -- an economist and an Iraq expert -- suggest he plans to put economic development at the heart of his Middle East policy, experts say. Brown, Britain's long-serving finance minister, is due to take over from Prime Minister Tony Blair on June 27. He has said he will learn from mistakes made in Iraq, after seeing Blair's popularity plummet owing to his staunch support for the US-led war. While Brown has accepted responsibility for the cabinet decision to back the invasion of Iraq, he said during a visit to Baghdad this week he is willing to "listen and learn" from the Iraqi people. Brown's appointments suggest he will use his expertise in financial and international development issues to focus British policy on trying to improve social and economic conditions in Iraq and possibly elsewhere in the Middle East. "There has been criticism of uncoordinated development assistance in the early years after the invasion. A lot needed to be done and there was no evidence of planning how to reinvigorate the economy and get people jobs," said Claire Spencer, Middle East expert at the Chatham House thinktank. Brown has already said there should be greater emphasis on political reconciliation and economic development in Iraq. Jon Cunliffe, currently Brown's representative at meetings of the Group of Seven wealthy nations, will head international economic affairs and Europe issues. Cunliffe accompanies Brown on international trips and has close contact with finance ministries around the world. Brown's senior adviser on foreign and defence policy will be Simon McDonald, who currently heads the Iraq desk in the Foreign Office and was previously Britain's ambassador to Israel. Spencer said Brown's choice of advisers could spell more targeted and focussed funding for the region, but warned his government would need the help of the Iraqi government and an improved security situation. "The strategy could go down much better with the public. But voters will be wary of lots of money being spent on activities that don't result in a more stable Iraq," she said. Commenting on the appointments, one government source said: "Gordon wanted to bring to foreign policy the idea of approaching it from the political economy point of view." Another government source noted that McDonald had not only extensive experience and contacts in the region but also a similar mindset to Brown. "He's also a proponent of 'soft power' policy -- he believes that you have to get trade right and aid right," which fits in with Brown's vision, the source said. Brown has said he will cut British troop numbers in Iraq as and when possible, but aides say he is unlikely to make any big shifts in policy as the military is already planning cutbacks in the size of the force, currently being reduced to 5,500. Dan Plesch, international affairs expert at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said Brown's choice of advisers showed a recognition that economic development was critical to social stability in the area and a moving away from Blair's more military interventionist approach. "The history of successful war termination shows that economic concerns are a realist necessity and Brown's appointments indicate that he understands that," he sa
