<TEXT>
 Chittagong, June 14 (bdnews24.com) - Adviser MA Matin Thursday stopped the Lake City Housing Project, which was designed to build homes cutting hills in Chittagong city. Chittagong City Corporation had earlier taken up the project to build houses in Pahartali area. The adviser also directed authorities to take steps to stop cutting hills for all housing projects. Matin said he was surprised to see indiscriminate hill-cutting for the sake of Lake City Housing Project sprawling over 30 acres. Experts say hill-cutting was one of the main reasons for the recent landslides that killed more than 100 people in the port city. Md Manjur Alam, acting mayor of CCC, divisional commissioner Mokhlesur Rahman and CDA chairman Shah Akhter Uddin accompanied the adviser to the scene. Alam later told reporters: "It's a housing project. We've stopped work to show respect to law." Earlier in the day, the adviser visited Chaktai Khal and told reporters that the government would move to revive the Tk 1,000 crore UNDP Chaktai Cannel renovation project. He said action would be taken to free 19 cannels of grabbers. bdnews
