<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Victoria Beckham, wife of British soccer star David, launched her debut denim collection in New York on Thursday to a crush of photographers, television cameras and journalists. Ahead of a summer move to Los Angeles -- where David has signed to play with LA Galaxy -- Beckham boosted her US profile by unveiling her dVb collection of denim pants, skirts and shorts at Saks department store on Fifth Avenue. Wearing white jeans, silver high heels, and a sparkly, silver singlet top, Beckham posed for photographers -- who, a security guard said, outnumbered fans -- before heading upstairs to sign autographs for about 70 fans waiting in line. "She's been my idol for 10 years and everything about her is just fantastic," said Melissa Zartz, 18, a student from Jersey City, NJ, who had waited for more then six hours and was a little annoyed and surprised more people hadn't turned up. "I'm sure there will be more people coming," said Zartz, who had paid $80 for a charcoal drawing of the Beckhams that she planned to give to her idol. But Zartz and her friends had not yet purchased any of Beckham's denim clothing with the dark jeans, that have a large star stitched on the back pockets, selling for around $250. "I promised myself my next pay check will be to buy some," said Gabriella Greco, an 18-year-old student from Manhattan. "During Middle School I became the ugly duckling and I didn't have many friends and then I started following Victoria and her fashion tips and people starting telling me I was beautiful," she said. "I have her to thank for that." The dVb range by Beckham, known as Posh from her days in the 1990s pop group The Spice Girls, also includes sunglasses. But the dVb label is not Beckham's first foray into fashion, she has previously designed a collection of jeans for label Rock and Republic and also handbags and jewelry for Japanese brand Samantha Thavasa. Beckham, who has three sons, has also been chronicling her family's move to Los Angeles for a reality show for US television. David, who plays his last game for Real Madrid on Sunday, starts a $250 million contract with Galaxy in Augus
