<TEXT>
 WARSAW, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said on Friday a compromise over a mandate for talks on the proposed EU treaty was closer after a visit by the French leader Nicolas Sarkozy to Warsaw. Poland has threatened to block progress at a key June 21-22 EU summit if the 27-member bloc's leaders do not agree to discuss a Polish proposal for re-weighing the voting system. Asked by the Dziennik daily in an interview whether the talks had changed Poland's position, Jaroslaw Kaczynski said: "I believe we can say, some light has appeared. But it is too early to say anything definitive or give any details." Kaczynski's foreign policy adviser, Andrzej Sados told daily Rzeczpospolita on Friday Sarkozy had made a new proposal which was being analysed by the Polish side. "Some proposals had been made thanks to which the summit could end successfully," Sados said.
