<TITLE> Mohiuddin deportation is near-final: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  The process of sending Bangabandhu killer AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed back to Bangladesh is near-final, a senior foreign ministry official said Friday. But it was not clear when the former army officer would arrive back in Dhaka. BBC Radio quoted acting foreign secretary Towhid Hossain as saying that the decision on deportation came after Mohiuddn lost his appeal to the US Federal Court Thursday not to deport him to Bangladesh. Hossain said: "I don't know when Mohiuddin will exactly be deported." But he said it would be anytime soon. The US authorities were likely to inform the foreign ministry about the date for deportation 24 hours before schedule, he said. If Mohiuddin's lawyers do not move further to halt the move with new court appeals, his return to Dhaka would be soon, Hossain said. Quoting unnamed foreign ministry officials, BBC said Mohiuddm would be escorted straight to jail from airport. Earlier, the family of the former army major convicted of killing independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made emotional appeals for asylum in Canada after the US decided to deport him. Mohiuddin has lost his last appeal to stay on in the US, where he entered on a tourist visa in 1996 and stayed on illegally. Mohiuddin has been declared a fugitive after he was tried in absentia and convicted in 1998 for his part in the assassination on Aug 15, 1975. Mohiuddin is one of the many former soldiers, dubbed "killer majors", who is at large after being given safe passage. Some of them were given diplomatic assignments and now live outside Bangladesh.
