 GAZA, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said on Friday after seizing control of the Gaza Strip that it was in an advanced stage of negotiations on the release of a British reporter abducted there almost three months ago. A statement by Hamas's armed wing said it was talking to the captors of the BBC's Alan Johnston had "begun practical steps to secure his release". Johnston, the only Western correspondent based full-time in Gaza, was seized on March 12. His abductors -- a little-known group called the Army of Islam -- issued a video of him on June 1 in which he said he was in good health and being treated well, although it was not known when the tape was made. Johnston, from Scotland, turned 45 in captivity last month.
