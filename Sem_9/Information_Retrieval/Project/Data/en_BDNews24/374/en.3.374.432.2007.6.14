 Dhaka, Jun 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Economic Association Thursday stressed a strong market monitoring system to stop price manipulation to hike prices of essential commodities. It said lifting duties on import of essential commodities alone will not help to spiral back the price hikes. "The idea of leaving everything to the market is not working. Prices of commodities will continue to soar unless the government moves to ensure a strong regulatory system," BEA president Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad said at a post-budget press conference. He pointed out the tendency to maximise profit, corruption and extortion in the supply chain of essentials push the prices. The interim government offered withdrawal of import duties on pulses and edible oil in its proposed budget for fiscal 2007-2008. It also pledged to continue the lower duty incentives against imports of rice, onion and some other essentials. The BEA chief asked the government to immediately approve the Consumers Rights Act to give people some respite. "Such tax incentive brought no benefit in the past nor will it bring any in the coming days," said Abul Barkat, general secretary of BEA, referring to duty incentives on rice and onion in the previous year. The BEA was critical of the government's "lack of attention to reduce poverty and generate employments". It said the proposed budget reflected government's dependency on market mechanism and foreign aid. "The budget failed to reflect the goal of welfare of people. As a result, desirable progress in reducing poverty will not come. Inequalities will increase and domestic entrepreneurial initiatives will be hampered." It warned the government failure to mobilise foreign funds might increase borrowing from the domestic sources, which in turn, will drive inflation higher. "Aid dependency also seriously undermines the freedom of the policymakers," the BEA said. On restructuring of duty slabs in the proposed budget, it said the measure will allow increased imports of finished products and affect local productions. The BEA observed the restructuring of the duty system will see import duty on raw materials rise 1 percent while duties on intermediate goods and finished products fall 1 percent and 4 percent respectively. It also slammed imposition of duty against import of computer and computer accessories. "We expect the government will reorganise proposals on duty structures in order to generate employment and help boost local production," the BEA said. bdn
