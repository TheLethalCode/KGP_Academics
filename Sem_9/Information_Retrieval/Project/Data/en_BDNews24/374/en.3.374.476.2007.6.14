 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)The National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral resources, Port and Power Thursday asked the government to realise Tk 12,980 crore in compensation from multinational companies Chevron and Niko Resources. The claim arises from the Magurchhara, Chhatak and Tengratila gas-field explosions in Sylhet 10 years ago. The committee made a request for the money to be invested in the fiscal 2007-08 budget. The demands were made during a press conference, organised at Dhaka Reporters' Unity Thursday, to mark the anniversary of the Sylhet explosions. Professor Anu Muhammad, an economist and secretary of the committee, claimed that at least 550 billion cubit feet of gas has so far been destroyed by the Sylhet gas-field explosions. The huge loss of gas has so far failed to generate any concrete action from the authorities claimed Professor Muhammad. He said: "This doesn't chime with the government's excuses of resource scarcity." "When national organisations commit big errors, the World Bank and other institutions start pressurising the government to shut them down. However no-one acts when multinational incompetence causes the government to lose huge sums of money," he said. "Neither the World Bank nor any national budget speeches have so far called for compensation from the defaulting multinationals," Professor Muhammad claimed. bdnews24.
