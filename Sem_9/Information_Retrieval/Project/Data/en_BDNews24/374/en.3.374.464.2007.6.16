 PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian militants released 10 Indian hostages, security and company sources said on Saturday. The move followed the release on bail of former militia leader Mujahid Dokubo-Asari on Thursday, whose imprisonment in 2005 triggered a surge in violence in Africa's top oil exporter. The 10 Indians were freed overnight, a security official working in the region for an oil company said. Militants said they released them in response to the bail for Asari, he added. Gunmen using dynamite and heavy machineguns kidnapped the 10 on June 1 from their residential compound near Port Harcourt. The hostages included at least three senior managers of Indonesian chemical company Indorama and their family members.
