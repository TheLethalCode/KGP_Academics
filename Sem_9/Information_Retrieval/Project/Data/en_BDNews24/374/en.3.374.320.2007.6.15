 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Archrivals and leaders Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club eye a solo lead when they square off for a second time in the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. Both the giants along with Muktijoddha Sangsad Krira Chakra are on top with 22 points, but Dhanmondi-based Abahani have played a game fewer than Mohammedan and Muktijoddha's 12. "The boys played a good game against Chittagong Mohammedan just in the previous round where they showed their mental strength by overcoming the hosts despite being level at one stage," Abahani's long-serving coach Amalesh Sen said. "The boys are keen to keep up the performance in tomorrow's (Saturday) match." Sen said confidence of his players has not been better and they hope to play better against Mohammedan having defeated them 1-0 in the first-leg. The veteran coach is worried with his defence as he believes the absence of Argentine defender Mariano Carlos Caporale has made the backline a bit vulnerable. But he has pinned hopes on Prodeep Poddar to get the job done. Sen said Mohammedan have improved a lot after a poor start in the beginning and credited their four Nigerians with getting the side to the top. Mohammedan, however, will have to do without striker Emeka Christina who was sent off against Sheikh Russel KC in the previous match. "We will certainly miss Emeka who understands most striker Mwach Ukwu Paul, top scorer of the league," said Shafiqul Islam Manik, the coach of the Motijheel-based outfit. Manik, however, was confident that either Farhad or Rony would make up for Emeka's loss. "There is no alternative to win to stay in the title race and we are certainly looking forward to leaving the field with a victory," Manik said. "The boys played better against Muktijoddha Sangsad and Sheikh Russel in the previous matches and it would inspire the boys to do better against Abahani," said the former Bangladesh international. Doubts are there though about how much effort the players would put in the crucial match as they recently boycotted practice for a day over a pay row. Manik said the management has resolved the problem and the boys were focused on the game.
