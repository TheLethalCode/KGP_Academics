 NEW YORK, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US newspaper executives will meet next week in New York to wrestle with one of their biggest challenges: persuading investors to stick around. But there will be some conspicuous absences at the annual Mid-Year Media Review hosted by the Newspaper Association of America. Los Angeles Times owner Tribune and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow will skip the meeting. One is going private, the other may get bought. Shareholders at both companies lucked out after the surprise bids helped their shares outperform the industry, which is struggling with a poor prognosis as advertisers and readers flee print for the Internet. At the top of investors' minds is whether more companies, such as USA Today publisher Gannett could be buyout targets. Analysts say they shouldn't count on it. "It's hard to see who the buyers would be," said Outsell Inc. media analyst Ken Doctor. "The markets are awash in capital, but essentially no private equity came after Knight Ridder or Tribune. When they look at the picture, they're saying there's not a lot of money to be made here in their usual three- to five-year horizon." It is tempting to seek buyers as Dow Jones ponders News Corp's $5 billion bid and Tribune heads toward closing the $8.2 billion buyout by real estate magnate Sam Zell. Many publishers' share prices continue to fall. McClatchy is down about 38 percent over the past 12 months, and Journal Register has lost nearly half its value. Long-time newspaper analyst Lauren Rich Fine, who retired earlier this year from Merrill Lynch, said investors should give publishers time to retool their businesses instead of leaping at buyouts to drive up share value. "I have long been an analyst who was less focused on quarterly results, and more into companies building value over time," Fine said. GRIM Ad sales performance remains grim. The New York Times May ad revenue from continuing operations fell 8.5 percent, while The Wall Street Journal's ad revenue fell 3.4 percent. Companies that attend the conference, which starts on Tuesday, likely will field questions on when digital operations will make enough money to make them 'growth' businesses again. The answer, said Outsell's Doctor, is likely to be no answer because there is no certainty. "The decline that we're seeing is not going to be made up by online advertising any time in the next five years," he said. "If you're losing advertising at mid-single digits in print and only growing at 20 percent in digital, you're slipping," said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner, which owns EW Scripps, McClatchy and Washington Post shares. Fine pointed to efforts by many publishers to build up their online ad business by working with Yahoo and other search engine and media companies. "There is still going to be this negative tone about the financials, but for people who are looking beyond the next couple of quarters, there's a slightly better sense of enthusiasm," she said. Scripps is dealing with the situation in a different way: It's not coming. Russo said this is an attempt to remake its image. "They just want to get the point across that they're no longer a newspaper company." Two Scripps officials did not return calls for comme
