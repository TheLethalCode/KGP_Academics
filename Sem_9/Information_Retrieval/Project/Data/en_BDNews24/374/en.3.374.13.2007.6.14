<TITLE> Ronaldinho admits poor fitness affected his season </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona forward Ronaldinho has admitted that poor levels of fitness have been responsible for his failure to live up to expectation this season. "Personally I haven't been in good shape this season," the 27-year-old Brazilian told sports daily Mundo Deportivo in an interview on Thursday. "I think I can work much harder and I want to make sure that I'm at the same level as the rest of the team next season." The Brazilian said the chief reason behind his decision to opt out of the Brazil squad for the Copa America was his desire to be in top physical shape for next season. "I renounced the Copa America because I want to make sure that I'm physically fit so that I can play more comfortably. I will be like I was before." Ronaldinho missed last week's 2-2 draw against city rivals Espanyol through suspension and his side can now only win the league title if arch-rivals Real Madrid slip up at home to Real Mallorca in the final match of the season. He said that a combination of inconsistency, injuries and misfortune had been responsible for the side's failure to stay ahead in the title race. He said he was hopeful his team could turn the tables on Real on the final day of the season. "We've had some good moments, some bad ones, some injuries to important players and some bad luck," he said. "We've got one match still to play and we have to win it and then see what happens.... I believe in miracles." Barca play fellow Catalans Gimnastic Tarragona in their final match of the season on Sunday
