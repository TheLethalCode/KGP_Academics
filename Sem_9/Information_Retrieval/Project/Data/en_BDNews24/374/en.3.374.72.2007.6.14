 MUMBAI, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank, said on Thursday it would launch a share sale next week to raise up to $4.9 billion to fund robust demand for loans in the rapidly expanding economy. It will offer shares worth 87.5 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) each in India and in the United States, with a greenshoe option for 15 percent, taking the total offering to 201.25 billion rupees. The follow-on sale will be the biggest by an Indian company, surpassing the $2.3 billion raised by state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp in 2004. "We will fix the indicated price band on Monday," Chief Financial Officer Vishakha Mulye said at a news conference, referring to the domestic portion of the offering which will be open for subscription June 19-22. ICICI, with a market value of about $20 billion, will simultaneously sell American Depositary Receipts in the United States. The bank will use the funds to lend to the corporate and the retail sectors, Chief Executive KV Kamath said. Demand for loans in India has been rising at more than 26 percent annually as the economy, Asia's third-largest, grew 9.4 percent in the fiscal year that ended in March. Smaller rivals HDFC Bank and UTI Bank have announced plans to raise about $1 billion and about $600 million respectively in share sales. DSP Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Enam Financial Consultants and JM Morgan Stanley are the Indian issue managers
