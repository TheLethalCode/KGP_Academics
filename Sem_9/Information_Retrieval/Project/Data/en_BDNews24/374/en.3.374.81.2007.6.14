<TITLE> Croatia to open major warcrimes trial under EU eyes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia will on Monday open a major war crimes trial of two generals indicted for atrocities against rebel Serbs, a case that will be closely watched by western and human rights officials. The trial of Mirko Norac and Rahim Ademi, an ethnic Albanian, is seen as another test case of Croatia's new resolve to deal with its recent past, needed for the country to progress towards European Union membership. "We will be watching with interest. This is the first case the (United Nations war crimes) tribunal has transferred to Croatia and we want to see how the local judiciary handles it," said a European Commission official in Zagreb. Norac and Ademi have been charged with commanding troops who killed some 30 Serb civilians and prisoners of war during a swift commando incursion into rebel territory in southern Croatia in September 1993. Croatia fought a 1991-95 independence war against rebel Serbs backed by Belgrade. The case was initially investigated by the Hague war crimes tribunal but was later forwarded to the Croatian judiciary. The trial will have nine hearings before the summer break, with witness testimonies scheduled only in September. "This is actually a great thing for Croatia, which has to show whether or not it can conduct a fair trial in a case like this. This could be a turning point, especially knowing that one of the most serious complaints coming from Brussels concerns our judiciary," said political analyst Zeljko Trkanjec. Norac has already been tried and sentenced to 12 years for a separate war crime. His arrest in 2001 and the subsequent trial prompted mass protest from right-wing nationalist groups, who at one point threatened to overthrow the government, accusing it of betrayal. No protests are expected this time. "The trial will be underway during the election campaign so some nationalist parties may try to use it, but the general public is not likely to react at all," Trkanjec said. Croatia, which is due to hold a general election in November, hopes to join the European Union around 2010. But it must first step up the pace of reforms in public administration and judiciary -- which most Croatians see as too slow and corrupt -- and cut state subsidies. Norac is currently serving his term in jail. Ademi, who surrendered voluntarily to the Hague tribunal, was not jailed while awaiting trial, but must not leave his place of residence, talk to the press or influence witnesses
