 QUETTA, Pakistan, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan told a visiting US official on Thursday it was trying its best to plug its long, porous border with Afghanistan and denied Taliban leaders were hiding in Pakistan. Cross-border incursions by the Taliban militants have long been a bone of contention between Pakistan and Afghanistan, two major US allies. Afghan officials say most of the militants fighting an insurgency in their country come from sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the border. Pakistan denies that, although US commanders in Afghanistan have also complained about Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan. US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Richard Boucher flew over Pakistan's border with Afghanistan on Thursday to get a first-hand look at Pakistani measures to control the wild frontier. He also met some of the Pakistani officials in charge of the effort. "We are taking as many steps as possible to secure the border with Afghanistan," an official quoted the chief minister of Baluchistan province, Jam Mohammad Yusuf, as telling Boucher in the provincial capital, Quetta. Yusuf also rejected Afghan accusations Taliban leaders were directing the Afghan insurgency from Quetta. "There are no Taliban leaders in our province," the official quoted the chief minister as saying. Pakistan has arrested hundreds of al Qaeda militants and handed many of them over to the United States since joining the US-led war on terrorism following the Sept 11 attacks in 2001. Pakistan says it is doing all it can to stem militants' activities on its lawless border areas and urge US and Afghan forces to do more on their side to secure border. Boucher's discussions in Pakistan have also focused on a crisis brewing ahead of elections due this year, sparked by government efforts to dismiss the country's top judge. On Wednesday, he met election officials and was later quoted as calling for a free and fair vote
