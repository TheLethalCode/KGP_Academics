 NEW YORK, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With Father's Day being celebrated in a host of countries this Sunday, Reuters asked a few celebrities from the entertainment and sporting worlds to tell us the best advice their dads ever gave them: ENRIQUE IGLESIAS - Award-winning singer and son of famous Spanish singer Julio Iglesias "His favorite word was always discipline. He would always say that if you don't have discipline you won't get anywhere and I think he is 100 percent right. To be successful there are sacrifices that you have to pay. It does not come easy." JUSTIN HAYWARD - Lead guitarist/singer of The Moody Blues "My father taught me that "the most powerful thing you can be is an example to other people." He was to me."

He said: "Son... always split aces no matter what the dealer's showing." Even today I can't think of it without getting a little misty-eyed." DR. JOYCE BROTHERS - Syndicated advice columnist "My Dad, Morris, would ask my sister and me over dinner every night about the events of the day and we would discuss current affairs, like FDR's changes in the Supreme Court. So, we learned that it is important to know what people are thinking and to care about what happens in the world." CHRIS PRONGER - Professional ice hockey player for the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks "Always work hard. Don't eat yellow snow." ELLIOT SADLER - Race car driver in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series. "Take pride in yourself and always treat people the way you would expect to be treate
