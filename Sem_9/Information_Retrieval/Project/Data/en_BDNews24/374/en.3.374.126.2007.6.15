<TITLE> Bank tussle over, but North Korea still slams US </TITLE>

 SEOUL, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea lashed the United States on Friday for conducting an arms race and, far from announcing plans to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme, warned that it would "bolster its deterrent for self-defence". A banking dispute holding up implementation of a disarmament deal struck in February appeared to be almost resolved after the territory of Macau announced that some $20 million of frozen North Korean funds had finally been released. But the hermit state made no mention of the funds, which had been stuck for nearly two years in Macau's Banco Delta Asia (BDA) due to US money-laundering charges. Instead, its official KCNA news agency railed against the United States' plan for a chain of missile defence systems around the world and its "hard-line hostile policy" towards Pyongyang. "The U.S. ever-more undisguised row of finding fault with the DPRK (North Korea) and the arms race escalating in the areas around Korea due to the US moves will only force the DPRK to bolster its deterrent for self-defence," it said. The communist state's defiant tone came as no surprise to Chun Yung-woo, South Korea's chief envoy to six-country talks on ending the North's nuclear programme. "The process... is much more difficult than the BDA problem," the Yonhap news agency quoted Chun as saying. He said the BDA dispute was just the first obstacle to implementing a Feb. 13 deal between the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States for the impoverished North to shut its nuclear reactor and finally end its nuclear power ambitions. Although all parties had agreed the money could move out of Macau's BDA, it took months to find any bank willing to risk letting tainted North Korean money pass through its tills. North Korea has seen resolving the issue as key to allowing it back into the global banking system from which it has been largely ostracised by US charges of illicit activities. But analysts said the resolution might well not be enough to remove the stigma attached to handling North Korean funds. Japan's Kyodo news agency quoted Macau authorities as saying the funds would move along a highly unusual route, first to the U.S. Federal Reserve's New York branch, then to Russia's central bank and finally to a Russian bank. "It was a one-time, technical solution and did not quite allow North Korea's integration into the international financial system," said analyst Paik Hak-soon at Seoul's Sejong Institute. Even though U.S. President George W. Bush has the political will to sort out the problem, Paik said the complexity of the issues meant the negotiations would take a long time. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso said he did not expect an early resumption of the six-party talks, and regional powers would wait to see what North Korea did next. Pyongyang's main commitment under the Feb. 13 deal -- the deadline for which passed two months ago -- is to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, the source of material for its weapons programme. It must also re-admit international atomic inspectors. Once it closes the reactor and accepts inspections, the resource-poor state will receive 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel or equivalent in aid. There is a total of 950,000 tonnes in oil waiting for Pyongyang once it completes disabling all its nuclear facilities and makes full disclosure of its nuclear programmes. But many analysts say that North Korea is likely to drag the talks on as long as possible, seeing nuclear power as about the only leverage it has in a largely hostile wor
