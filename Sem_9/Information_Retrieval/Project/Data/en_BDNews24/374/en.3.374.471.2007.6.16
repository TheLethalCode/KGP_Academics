Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis said the `Text a Tip Program', announced on Friday, appeared to be the first in the nation to combine cell phone text messaging with an anonymous police tip line. He said he hoped it would crack a street culture where gangs often punish people who `snitch', making it hard for police to solve crimes at a time when the murder rate is rising. "It's something that is more anonymous than a telephone call where you have to have a conversation with someone," Davis said. A traditional tip line, using a toll-free telephone number to police, was becoming obsolete, he said. Like many US cities, Boston is struggling to stem a wave of violent crime. The city's 27 homicides this year are nearly on pace with last year's tally. Many go unsolved because witnesses are afraid to come forward. In the new system, people with information about crimes would type the word `tip' into their phones and send the message to police. The sender's identification is blocked, Davis said. Police will then `text' a message back asking for details.
