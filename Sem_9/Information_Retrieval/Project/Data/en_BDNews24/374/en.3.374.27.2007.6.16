 NEW YORK, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - You won't see any dogs playing poker or chewing slippers in the art for sale next week at Christie's. Although it won't include anything close to the much-imitated images of anthropomorphized hounds that have graced rumpus rooms across the United States, the auction house expects its New York dog art sale on June 22 to net more than $3 million, which Christies said would be the most valuable ever in the dog art category.

Some consider works like Sargent's more serious than those of Cassius Marcellus Coolidge, the American who painted a well-known series of pictures of dogs playing poker that have been widely reproduced as puzzles and prints hung on family-room walls. But 'A Bold Bluff' and 'Waterloo: Two,' two of the paintings from Coolidge's series, sold for $590,400 at a 2005 sale at Doyle New York's annual Dogs in Art Aucti
