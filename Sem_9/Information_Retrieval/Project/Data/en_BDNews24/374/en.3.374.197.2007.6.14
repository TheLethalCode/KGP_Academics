 BRUSSELS, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's top sports regulator will not interfere in the row between Sheffield United and the English Premier League over the Carlos Tevez affair, EU officials said on Thursday. United, relegated on the last day of the season, claim West Ham should be deducted points and demoted instead of being fined over their handling of the Argentina forward's transfer. United chairman Kevin McCabe said on Wednesday he would take the issue to the European Commission in Brussels on Friday but a spokesman for EU Sports Commissioner Jan Figel said there was no possibility of the EU executive taking action. "The meeting is taking place between Sheffield United and someone from our directorate about their Campaign for Fairness in Football. The meeting is not with the Commissioner," spokesman Frederic Vincent told Reuters. "I'm sure they'll want to say a word about their upcoming (Premier League) arbitration concerning the Carlos Tevez affair. But it has been made clear from the start by us that the Commission cannot and will not intervene in a national issue." Figel is penning a strategy on how sport should be run across the 27-nation bloc which is due to be published next month. The paper will include all aspects of sport including the issue of transfers and players agents. "The Commission hopes to clarify a lot of legal matters with this process, but it also has to be careful not to send out a message that sports organisations can come running to Brussels every time there is a problem," a Commission official said. The Premier League holds an arbitration hearing on Monday and Tuesday, with United claiming east London club West Ham should be docked points for breaking the transfer rules instead of just being fined 5.5 million pounds ($10.84 million)
