 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) - The government has extended, until June 17 the time for disbursement of money for the last installment of the development budget, the finance ministry said in a statement Wednesday. The extension is the third for this fiscal year, officials said. The first deadline was on May 31 and second on June 3. "The finance ministry is a bit more cautious about disbursement of money this year to maintain fiscal discipline," a senior finance ministry official told bdnews24.com, requesting anonymity. Planning Commission officials said that only 44 percent of the annual development programme was disbursed in the first 10 months of the last fiscal year. "The flow of fund disbursement increased at the end of the last fiscal year. But the trend created huge pressure in the financial sector. The government gets hardly anytime to audit the expenditure demands," he said. The official said a committee formed by the government, comprising officials of the finance ministry, Bangladesh Bank and Accounts General office, will inspect the disbursement demands this year. All ministries and divisions have been instructed to follow the circular strictly. bd
