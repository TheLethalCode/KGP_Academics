 LONDON, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former top Russian spy Oleg Gordievsky rubs shoulders with cricketer Ian Botham, author Salman Rushdie and actor Barry Humphries in the Queen's birthday honours list, published on Saturday. Gordievsky, a KGB Colonel who became the highest ranking defector in the Cold War when he first started spying for and later escaped to Britain, becomes a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. His citation for the award, usually reserved for top diplomats, is for services to the security of the United Kingdom. The award comes as relations between Britain and Russia are under strain over the murder in London last year with radioactive Polonium 210 of another former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, who accused Moscow of ordering his death. Botham, already an OBE, becomes Sir Ian, with a knighthood for his services to cricket and to charity in honour of the millions of pounds he has raised through long-distance walks. West Indies record-breaker Viv Richards, who played against Botham at international level and with him for English county team Somerset, welcomed the news. "It's long overdue, I thought he would get this when he had just finished playing but it's better late than never," he told Reuters. Author Salman Rushdie, who spent years in hiding after his novel The Satanic Verses prompted Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa death warrant for him, gets a knighthood for services to literature. Australian comic actor and writer Barry Humphries, whose characters Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson lampoon both Britons and Australians, becomes a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to entertainment. The twice-yearly honours ritual -- designed to recognise outstanding achievement -- is part of an ancient and complex honours system that has been beset by scandal this year, damaging Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labour Party. Blair steps down as premier on June 27. Departing prime ministers have traditionally named their own honours lists but it is not clear whether Blair will do so. Among those on Saturday's list are Christiane Amanpour, chief reporter for US cable news network CNN, for services to journalism, and legal rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti, for services to human rights. Both get CBEs. Writer and director Stephen Poliakoff also gets a CBE, as do historian David Starkey, dairy farmer and Glastonbury pop festival organiser Michael Eavis and magistrate Timothy Workman, who handles most of Britain's terrorism and extradition cases. Star hairdresser Nicky Clarke becomes an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), as do gravel-voiced singer Joe Cocker and footballer Ryan Giggs. Other OBE recipients include prolific film and television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, actor Peter Sallis -- best known as the voice of bumbling inventor Wallace, of Wallace and Gromit fame -- and 1960s actress Sylvia Syms. In total 946 honours were handed out in the birthday list, including 21 knighthoods, 100 CBEs and 229 OB
