 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) - Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal Thursday said there was much ado about political reforms and dropping one or two people from parties would not mean much. Sultana said reforms mean a complete change of thinking and culture. Her comment touched the current contentious issues of political reforms although she was speaking at the opening of a two-day conference on health rights at the capital's BIAM auditorium. Sultana, however, was not unmindful of her career as a human-rights activist, as she continued: "Reform is related to the right to live of an individual. Right to healthcare has no difference." She said the right to healthcare is part of good governance and democracy. The former adviser was, however, supportive of the interim government's effort to purge the country of corrupt political elements. She said the people are with good policies and against corruption. "We are being labelled as corrupt for a handful of people," she said. She identified a discriminatory social and economic system as responsible for the country's ramshackle healthcare system. A super-rich class has emerged in the country, who do not need public hospitals, she said, adding that it is the poor who need support from the state. Farzana Nayeem, director of Manusher Jonno, said access to healthcare is not a privilege, it is a right. Former vice-chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Prof Mahmud Hasan said insecticides and fertiliser are having an adverse effect on the environment and health. "People are suffering from arsenicosis as the ground water has been contaminated," he said. Some 52 organisations, including Health Research Rights Foundation and Population Services and Training Centre, organised the conference. Media Initiative for Public Policy, Health Reporters Forum, Urban Health Network and Consumers Association of Bangladesh were the co-organisers. bdnews24.
