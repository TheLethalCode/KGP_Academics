 Dhaka, Jun 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Market capitalisation on the Dhaka Stock Exchange crossed the Tk 450 billion mark Thursday, triggered by price spirals in most issues. The rally came after the central bank advised five banks to raise their paid-up capital up to Tk 1.0 billion by issuing bonus or right shares. Bangladesh Bank imposed a bar on declaring cash dividends on Uttara Bank, UCBL, Dutch-Bangla, IFIC and AB Bank until each of their paid-up capital reaches Tk 1.0 billion. A buying spree drove market capitalisation on the DSE to Tk 453.43 billion, up from Tk 440.08 billion on May 31. "An increase in the prices of issues has pulled market capitalisation. A Bangladesh Bank restriction to issue cash dividends on five banks have encouraged the market to rise," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. The prices of UTTRA, UCBL Dutch-Bangla, IFIC and AB Bank rallied 10 percent, 5.73 percent, 7.49 percent, 23.41 percent and 11.96 percent. A 30.76 percent rise in the shares of another banking sector heavyweight, Rupali Bank, on reports of speedy transfer of its shares to Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud also boosted the market. Except the IT sector, almost all the sectors moved up. Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange rose to Tk 1.35 billion from Wednesday's Tk 1.25 billion. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, it increased to Tk 250.36 million from Tk 201.51 million. The DGEN or general index finished at 2028.82, up 37.97 points or 1.90 percent. Buoyed by a rally in Rupali, IFIC and UCBL, the DSI or all-share price index moved up 58.36 points or 3.60 percent to 1678.33. The DSE-20 blue-chip index gained 31.02 points or 1.73 percent to 1817.94. All the indices on the CSE finished higher. AB Bank, BRAC Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Southeast Bank and UCBL topped the turnover table. AB Bank that registered Tk 108.46 million in turnover climbed 11.96 percent to Tk 1487.75.
