Players have been training under the supervision of the Pakistan military and Cricket Board (PCB) since last week in Abbotabad, a popular summer resort that is also home to a military base. "The training is being carried out by a team of our own trainers and army instructors to improve the fitness and fielding levels of the players," Zakir Khan, director cricket operations, told Reuters on Saturday.

Pakistan's captain Shoaib Malik said the training was paying off. "When we had camps in Lahore or Karachi there were too many distractions for the players.
