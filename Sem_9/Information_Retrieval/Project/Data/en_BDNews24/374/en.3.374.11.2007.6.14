 BEIRUT, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some 2,500 mourners chanted anti-Syrian slogans on Thursday at the funeral of a Lebanese legislator killed in a car bomb attack that increased tension with Damascus and deepened Lebanon's political crisis. Walid Eido was the seventh anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated since February 2005 when former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a suicide truck bombing. Allies of Eido blamed his killing on Damascus and said it was Syria's response to the June 10 establishment of a UN backed court to try suspects in the Hariri attack. But Syria denied any links to Eido's assassination. "Syria strongly denounces this crime and condemns the campaign of lies by some Lebanese used to accuse Syria after any killing and before an investigation even starts," a Syrian Foreign Ministry statement said. As the funeral procession moved slowly through the streets of Beirut, mourners shouted slogans against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud. "O Beirut, we want revenge against Lahoud and Bashar," they shouted. Eido, a Sunni Muslim, belonged to the majority anti-Syrian parliamentary bloc led by Hariri's son, Saad al-Hariri, which controls the government. "I tell the criminals that, God willing, you will be punished and dragged to jail like low-lives," Hariri told the funeral crowd. Wednesday's bombing near a Beirut beach club killed Eido, his eldest son, two bodyguards and six passers-by. Businesses, banks and schools were shut in Beirut and elsewhere as Lebanese observed a national day of mourning. Three ambulances carried coffins draped in Lebanese flags to a Beirut mosque. Mourners carried white-and-blue flags of Hariri's Future Trend movement and filed past pictures of Eido and his lawyer son with the slogan "Men of Justice". "We have been living in the shadow of savage crimes, but we will not change our path," said one man, who gave his name only as Bassam. "We will stay the course until the truth appears and justice takes its course." The bodies were laid to rest after final prayers were performed at a Beirut mosque. Eido's death was likely to fuel tension between the government and the opposition led by the pro-Syrian Shi'ite Hezbollah group, which has condemned the killing. Parliament member Wael Abou-Faour said the assassination was aimed at cutting the Hariri bloc's parliamentary majority, which now is down to 68 in the originally 128-member assembly. President Lahoud refused to call a by-election when another anti-Syrian MP, cabinet minister Pierre Gemayel, was shot dead in November, saying the government has lost its legitimacy. "The dramatic scenario is clear: Bashar Assad is assassinating parliamentarians and Emile Lahoud is not allowing (by-elections) to elect others," Abou-Faour told Reuters. "The parliamentary majority is diminishing and they are trying to change the political equation through assassination." Tension was already high in Lebanon before the attack. The army has been battling al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants at a Palestinian refugee camp in the north for more than three weeks. Sporadic fierce clashes continued on Thursday with troops pounding Fatah al-Islam positions in Nahr al-Bared. The army said in a statement that it found a large Fatah al-Islam explosives depot at Nahr al-Bared "which shows the aims and destructive inclinations of this terrorist gang". Rescue workers evacuated 45 civilians from the camp. Some 30,000 civilians have fled and more than 144 people have died in the battles, the worst since the country's 1975-90 civil war. Five less powerful bombs have exploded in and around Beirut in the past month, killing two peop
