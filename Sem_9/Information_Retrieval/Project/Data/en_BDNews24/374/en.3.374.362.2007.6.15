<TITLE> Musharraf's US visitors stir expectations of change </TITLE>

 ISLAMABAD (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In his earlier job as US intelligence chief John Negroponte predicted this would be a challenging time for both President Pervez Musharraf and the United States, due to elections in Pakistan this year. But even Negroponte, now Deputy Secretary of State, who arrived in Islamabad on Friday, must have been sideswiped by the mess American ally Musharraf got into by trying to oust Pakistan's top judge in March. The judiciary, the independent media and mainstream opposition parties have rallied round Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, and tens of thousands of ordinary people have turned out to see him on trips outside the capital to gather support. Negroponte's surprise visit is aimed at demonstrating the importance of Washington's relationship with nuclear-armed Pakistan at a time when General Musharraf is short of friends. Admiral William J Fallon, Commander of US Central Command, and Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher are also in town. The diplomatic flurry has re-ignited speculation Washington will offer wise counsel to the general, suggesting his best bet would be to share power. For all the protestations by US officials, Pakistanis are convinced of the influence Washington wields over their leaders. "The U.S. is not talking about a return to undiluted democracy immediately. It is talking about a transition to a greater democracy," Najam Sethi, a respected political analyst, wrote in his Friday Times weekly. The chief rumour, denied by US officials, is that Washington is trying to broker a deal whereby Musharraf would allow ex-premier Benazir Bhutto to return from self-exile. As the most popular politician after the president, according to opinion polls, and the leader of a party regarded as the most progressive, Bhutto could help Musharraf push his policy of "enlightened moderation". There is also a growing belief, also denied by US officials, that the United States may try to persuade Musharraf to give up his dual role as army chief sooner rather than later. Indeed, analysts say Musharraf's motive for getting rid of Chaudhry was fear the judge would allow constitutional challenges to his plan to be re-elected in uniform by the current assemblies before they are dissolved for elections. In January, Negroponte spoke of the global threat posed by al Qaeda regrouping in Pakistan, and the need to eliminate safe havens for the Taliban in Pakistani tribal areas. He described the country as "a major source of Islamic extremism". While the Pakistan army's cooperation is needed to fight al Qaeda and the Taliban, Washington's policymakers have recognised for some time that the best way to push back the Islamist tide would be by promoting democracy. U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr, in Washington on Thursday, struck a firm tone. "Freedom of press, freedom of assembly, an independent judiciary, and free and fair elections are essential to that development and must not be infringed," she said. "We have stressed and continue to stress these points to our interlocutors in Pakistan at all levels of the government." Pakistani newspaper editorials sensed Washington is now catching a tide that has turned against Musharraf. "It seems quite clear that America's continuing support for President Musharraf is linked in large part to not only his government delivering in the war against terror, but also in holding free elections and in -- all likelihood -- him giving up the role of army chief before standing for re-election as president," The News, the country's largest English language daily, said in an editorial on Friday. Bhutto, whose party has engaged US public relations firm Burson-Marsteller, has ruled out any deal with Musharraf unless he quits the army. Last month after 40 people were killed in political violence in Karachi, Bhutto iced talk of an agreement, but the speculation won't go aw
