 MOSCOW, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will step down next year after eight years in power, may have a surprise choice for his preferred successor, state news agency RIA Novosti said on Friday, quoting a senior Kremlin aide. Putin is popular in Russia after presiding over seven years of strong economic growth. His departure has fuelled concerns at home and abroad about potential hazards to Russia's political stability. Putin's support will be decisive for any candidate in the March 2008 elections but the president has said he will disclose his preferences only after the campaign kicks off in December. At the moment, analysts point to Putin's close associates, the two first deputy prime ministers -- Sergei Ivanov and Dmitry Medvedev -- as the most likely successors. "People keep talking about these two people as potential candidates, but my president may come out with one more surprise," RIA quoted Igor Shuvalov, Putin's envoy handling ties with the Group of Eight leading nations, as saying. "Perhaps later this year you will learn about one more possible figure," added Shuvalov speaking in Washington late on Thursday where he is preparing Putin's visit to the United States due on July 1. Despite pressure from his allies, Putin has rejected the idea of redrawing the Russian constitution to allow himself a third consecutive four-year term, although he has spoken in favour of increasing the president's tenure to five or seven years for future leaders. "They are asking all the time if Putin is leaving indeed," Shuvalov said. "We constantly hear it from him, including in private conversations, that he will definitely leave." Shuvalov said Putin did not want to be compared to other ex-Soviet leaders like Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko or late Turkmenistan leader Saparmurat Niyazov, who had changed their constitutions in order to stay on. Putin has said he will remain active after leaving the presidency but has not yet indicated what role he might take. Commentators here have speculated that he might return to the presidency in the 2012 elections, which is allowed under Russia's constitution. "At the end of the day, Russian democracy will be judged when President Putin leaves without changing the constitution," Shuvalov said. Putin, accused by foes of intimidating the political opposition, has bristled at suggestions he will appoint a successor, pledging that Russians will have a free choice over whom to pick as their next president. "The next president will be elected in free and democratic elections rather than appointed," Shuvalov said.
