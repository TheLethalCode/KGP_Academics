 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Thursday decided to introduce match fees for the cricketers to make the National Cricket League (NCL), country's lone first-class league, more competitive. The decision was taken at an executive committee meeting of BCB Thursday night. Each cricketer will get Tk 10,000 for a four-day match and Tk 5,000 for a one-day match, said BCB general secretary Mahbub Anam after the meeting at a city hotel. Anam said they are yet to decide the prize money for the champions and runners-up, but said it could be Tk 10 lakh and Tk 8 lakh. The meeting also decided the participating divisional teams would undergo a 21-day camp. They will take part in the warm-up tournament, Corporate Cricket League, in the first week of August before playing the NCL, scheduled to start on Oct 29. The selectors will declare the divisional teams and it will be mandatory for the national cricketers to play for their own division if they are fit and not engaged in the national duty. The meeting also decided to bring the umpires under the pay scale to be finalised in line with proposal of the BCB Umpires Committee. The board confirmed the Under-19 team would travel to Sri Lanka and Malaysia in July. The team will also play a tri-nation tournament with Sri Lanka and India in Sri Lanka.
