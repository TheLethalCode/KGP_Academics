 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina was confined inside her Sudha Sadan home cordoned by platoons of police as an Emirates flight she was scheduled to take at 9:30pm to see her expecting daughter left for the United States. A horde of media and at least a dozen police platoons kept vigil at the home since late evening ahead of her scheduled visit, which she herself had called uncertain hours earlier. The Awami League chief, faced with three counts of charges of forcibly taking money from businessmen known to be loyal to her and party, called it a "big mistake" by the government. At 8.53 pm, Hasina told senior correspondent Sumon Mahbub: "The promised police protection didn't arrive. Twelve platoons of police are surrounding my home. Immigration has been told not to let me board." Virtually confined inside her husband's home in the capital's Dhanmondi residential area since returning from her ancestral town Tungipara, the Awami League chief was reached by phone by Sumon Mahbub as reporters and TV crew waited out in the open braving heavy rains. "I've heard that police have been deployed at the airport too. The government is making a big mistake by not letting me go," she told bdnews24.com. "I wanted to go to Chittagong for humanitarian reasons, but was not allowed to. For similar reasons I needed to go to the States," she said. Barely half an hour before her scheduled flight and sitting 15 kilometres from the airport, she said: "I am waiting, willing, ready to go. I'll be able to go even if I am allowed now." bdnews24.com senior correspondent Kamran Reza Chowdhury and photographer Qamruzzaman, among the rain-soaked media crew, said at 8.50pm that a police officer had gone inside apparently to talk to Hasina. Police did not let anyone pass barricade they had put up for the past few days. In a late-night news briefing, Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury said the government had taken "another inhuman decision" by preventing Hasina from visiting her daughter. She said Hasina was ready to go to the US to be with her pregnant daughter but the government did not allow her. The AL chief will continue her efforts to visit her daughter, but ruled out any possible negotiation with the government, Motia said. "A mother's visit to her daughter is a human thing. The government has behaved inhumanly by not allowing Sheikh Hasina to go to Chittagong. This time again, the government has taken another inhuman step," Motia told reporters in reactions to the travel restrictions at around 10.00pm. Motia spoke to the press on the road to Hasina's Sudha Sadan home. "Sheikh Hasina is hurt and the Awami League disturbed." Earlier in the day, the former prime minister had said she was not sure she would be able to fly out of the country to the US to see her relatives there. "I am still not sure I will be able to go. I have read in the newspapers that two more cases were filed against me," Hasina told reporters in a midday news briefing at her Sudha Sadan home. Hasina, scheduled to travel to the US Friday night, faces two more extortion cases filed by as many businessmen Wednesday. The AL chief Friday said she had not heard from the government about any travel ban. "I've heard from others that they won't let me go for the sake of investigations into the two cases," Hasina said. Businessman Noor Ali filed a Tk 5 crore case with Tejgaon Police Station and Azam J Chowdhury, managing director of East Coast Trading Limited, filed the other of Tk 2.95 crore against Hasina and AL leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim with Gulshan Police Station. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Thursday asked police and the immigration to stop Hasina going abroad if necessary for the sake of investigation into the cases. The court order came after investigating officers from Gulshan and Tejgaon police stations appealed to the court seeking a ruling to stop Hasina from leaving Bangladesh, saying that her absence might hamper investigations, already underway. "One thing I don't understand is that when I was abroad, it was said that there is a case against me and I cannot be allowed back home," Hasina said in her press briefing Friday. "It was said that if I returned home the investigation would be hindered. "Now I hear that if I go abroad the investigations will be hampered again. The matter isn't clear to me at all." "A conspiracy is onto bar me from elections. We have the right to serve people and the people have the right to take our service," Hasina said. "It's nothing but a conspiracy to deprive people of the right." Politics cannot be cleansed by destroying political institutions, Hasina said. The AL chief took questions from reporters after outgoing Vietnamese ambassador Ngo Van Hoa had met her at Sudha Sadan at about 12:30pm. Hasina termed the cases against her false. "I can say it under oath that I demanded nothing from anybody in my political career." "I didn't have to demand. Subscriptions are required to run a party. It is the moral duty of those who support the Awami League to pay subscriptions. The money is meant to run the party. "There is a difference between subscription and extortion. The government doesn't seem to understand that." Hasina said that the government did not provide assistance for running parties. "There is no law either that a party will run on government funds. If anybody helps the party, it doesn't amount to extortion." "Should I say Prothom Alo collects money thanks to Bandhu Sabha and help people with the money and it falls in the category of extortion? In that line of argument, it is extortion." Selim Mohammad Zahangir, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Ramna zone told bdnews24.com that additional contingents of police were deployed in the Sudha Sadan area. Usually five platoons of police are assigned around Sudha Sadan. Four more platoons were added Friday. At about 6.15am, advocate Abdul Mannan Khan and advocate Rahmat Ali entered Sudha Sadan while retired colonel Faruk Khan went in 15 minutes later. Nobody was allowed in after them Friday. Some Awami League leaders, including former lawmaker Dr Mizanul Haque, waited for a long time behind the police barricade. Chief security officer at Zia International Airport, Abdul Awal, told bdnews24.com that the Awami League had sent a letter to the director of the airport and the authorities took necessary steps in line with it. bdnews24.com/sum/krc/ans/eh
