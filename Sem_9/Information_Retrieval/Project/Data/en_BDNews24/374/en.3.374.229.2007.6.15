<TITLE> Wall St rallies on tamer inflation, Intel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - US stocks climbed on Friday on reassuring inflation news and fresh optimism about the tech sector after an upgrade of bellwether Intel. A 4.1 percent jump in the shares of Intel Corp. triggered an advance in technology stocks after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the world's dominant chip maker, to "buy" from "neutral." A flurry of deal news also lent support, following a report that the New York Mercantile Exchange was exploring a sale. Shares of the NYMEX, the world's largest energy market, rose 2.9 percent. Wall Street got some good news about the outlook for the US economy and interest rates before the opening bell, when government data showed the core U.S. Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose only 0.1 percent in May, below Wall Street's median forecast for a gain of 0.2 percent. The tame inflation reading reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve, which meets June 27-28, is likely to hold interest rates steady. A pullback in benchmark US Treasury bond yields gave investors a reason to buy shares of utilities, banks and other companies especially sensitive to interest rates. "We got exactly what we had hoped for, a very equities friendly core CPI number," said Ted Oberhaus, manager of equity trading Lord Abbett & Co. "What we've been concerned about is higher interest rates and the fact that would choke of the M&A pipeline." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 115.52 points, or 0.84 percent, at 13,669.24. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 13.74 points, or 0.90 percent, at 1,536.71, after earlier rising more than 1 percent to a session high at 1,538.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 29.00 points, or 1.12 percent, at 2,628.41. The Nasdaq climbed to 2,630.51, its highest in more than six years. At current levels, the gain for the week for the Dow is about 1.88 percent, the best since the week of April 21st, while the S&P 500 is up 1.97 percent, also the best since that week in April, and the Nasdaq is up 2.1 percent, the best in two weeks. A much lower-than-expected reading in the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index did not spoil the Street's party mood. The major indexes briefly tirmmed gains on the news that the preliminary June reading for the index was 83.7, the weakest in 10 months, as gasoline prices soured consumers' mood. But investors' attention quickly shifted back to the tame inflation data and the indexes sharply extended their gains. Intel shares rose to $24.18 on the Nasdaq, ranking as the biggest gainer in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Intel, which also is one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow average, also was among the top five contributors to the Dow's advance. The Nasdaq's second-biggest advancer was Apple Inc., up 1.3 percent at $120.23, continuing its recent climb spurred by optimism about its soon-to-be-released iPhone. Shares of the New York Mercantile Exchange, or the NYMEX, rose to $143.78 after Bloomberg News reported that the company was exploring a sale for about $14.3 billion. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.19 percent, down sharply from its climb earlier this week to 5.33 percent -- above the fed funds rate. An S&P index of utility shares rose 1.5 percent, while an S&P index of financial companies' shares advanced 0.9 percent. Higher bond yields in the past week had dented the appeal of high dividend-paying stocks such as utilities. Shares of industrial conglomerates also gained, with 3M Co.'s stock up 1 percent at $88.27. Monsanto Co. was another standout, gaining 4 percent to $65.86 after the company increased its fiscal 2007 earnings outlook due to strong results from the corn planting season in the United States and its herbicide busine
