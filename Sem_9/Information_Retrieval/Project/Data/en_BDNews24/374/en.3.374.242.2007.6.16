 LOS ANGELES, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Comedian Ellen DeGeneres dominated the 34th annual Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday, winning awards for best talk show and best host for the fourth consecutive year. But she said the combative Rosie O'Donnell should have been honored in her stead. Meanwhile, the Daytime Emmy for best dramatic series -- also known as soap operas -- ended in a tie for the first time, lending a note of unexpected drama to the evening. The 70-year-old CBS show 'Guiding Light,' the oldest continual dramatic series on American television, shared the spotlight with 'The Young and the Restless.' It was only the third time 'Guiding Light' has won the top soap opera award despite its longevity. It was the seventh time 'The Young and the Restless' has won.

Maura West of 'As the World Turns' was named best dramatic actress and Christian Jules LeBlanc of 'The Young and the Restless' was named best actor. Genie Francis, whose character on 'General Hospital' was written out in 2002 in traditional soap opera style -- by having her fall into a comma -- won best supporting actress for her triumphant four-week return. "I have waited 31 years for this moment," Francis, who plays Laura Spencer said in reference to her many years on the show, which started when she was a 14-year-old. Rick Hearst, who plays DA Ric Lansing on 'General Hospital', was named best supporting actor, winning his second Daytime Emmy . Kevin Clash, who plays Elmo on 'Sesame Street,' tied for best performer in a children's series with Carroll Spinney, the who plays Oscar the Grouch on the sh
