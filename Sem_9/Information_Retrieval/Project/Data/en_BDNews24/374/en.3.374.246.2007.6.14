<TITLE> Govt needs to rethink public sector jute mills: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said the government needs a rethink on feasibility of the public sector jute mills. "I would be discussing the issue with stakeholders including the advisers soon," Islam told a post-budget discussion organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue at Sonargaon Hotel. "I'm sort of convinced that the jute industry in the public sector is not viable at all," he said. "It is supposed to be export-oriented, but it has become a cash incentive-oriented industry." The adviser said some days back he had pumped Tk 32 crore into the jute mills to pay arrears of the workers. "Where the subsidy will come from? Somebody else has to pay for it." Islam said subsidy to the industry cannot go on forever and there are no freebies in economy. Chaired by M Saiduzzaman, a CPD trustee, the discussion was attended by politicians, economists, businessmen and government officials. CPD executive director Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya presented the keynote paper on the "State of the Bangladesh Economy and Budget Responses". Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed spoke as special guest. The adviser also answered questions from the discussants. Azizul said the government is not overly concerned about financing the proposed budget. He said the budget has been based on collections of internal resources and inflows of external assistance. The revenue target has been set at 10.8 percent of GDP, which he said is not at all ambitious. "If we cannot reach the target, then I am afraid we have to turn to either domestic or external borrowing." He said the budget has made a fairly realistic projection of foreign loans. "We have huge foreign loans in pipeline, but its disbursement depends on our capacity to implement the projects." The adviser said the budget deficit financing has been projected at 5.6 percent, which is slightly higher because of inclusion of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation's liabilities of Tk 7,523 crore. On subsidies, he said he would sit with the relevant ministries to devise ways so that the targeted people get them. Azizul said that a 7 percent GDP growth and 6 percent inflation rate projected in the budget are attainable and realistic. He blamed the price hike of essentials on the marketing system developed over the years. "It cannot be changed overnight, but we are trying to build alternatives, such as involving the BDR." On the proposed hike in import duty structure, the adviser said one has to assess the issue in its entirety, not partly. bd
