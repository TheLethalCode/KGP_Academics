 KABUL, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car-bomber attacked a convoy of foreign troops on Saturday in the Afghan capital, killing four civilians, police and government officials said, in the third such attack on international forces in two days. A suicide attacker drove a car packed with explosives at troops from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in western Kabul, but none of the soldiers were killed or wounded, interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary said. He said the four killed had been all men and that five civilians were also wounded in the blast, which followed suicide attacks in the south and centre of the country on Friday. Taliban guerrillas have been waging an insurgency against the Afghan government and its foreign allies since US-led forces evicted the Talibs from power in 2001 for refusing to give up their ally, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. But suicide bombings are a relatively recent phenomenon in Afghanistan. In the past two years, the Taliban and their al Qaeda allies have stepped such attacks, though there had not been a suicide bombing in the capital for many weeks. Bashary said authorities were investigating Saturday's suicide attack but he doubted it was part of a new, intensive campaign to disrupt security across the country. "This is something different," he said. He did not elaborate. The head of Kabul police's criminal branch, Alishah Paktiawal, said initial reports suggested a foreigner had been among the wounded but this could not be verified immediately. An ISAF spokesman said the blast had caused casualties but was unable to say immediately whether any soldiers had been killed or wounded. On Friday, a suicide car-bomber attacked foreign troops in central Afghanistan, killing five children and a Dutch soldier. Later in the day, a second suicide bomber on foot attacked a foreign troop convoy in the southern Kandahar city, wounding at least five civilians, a police official said.
