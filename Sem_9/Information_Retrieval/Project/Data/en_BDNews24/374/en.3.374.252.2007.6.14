 KINSHASA, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two gunmen shot dead a journalist working for United Nations-sponsored radio in Democratic Republic of Congo's troubled eastern city of Bukavu, UN officials said on Thursday. Serge Maheshe was the local head of Radio Okapi, a nationwide radio network set up to aid the peace process in Congo following a 1998-2003 war. He was walking from a friend's house to a UN vehicle late on Wednesday when he was approached by two men dressed in civilian clothes who asked the 31-year-old to sit down and then opened fire. The attack took place around 9.00 pm (20:00 GMT). "We still don't know if it was simply criminal or if it was related to his job," said Kemal Saiki, spokesman for 17,000-strong peacekeeping mission in Congo. Media reported that Maheshe, a respected local journalist, had received death threats. Several reporters have been murdered in Congo in recent years. Franck Ngyke, political editor of "La Reference Plus" newspaper, and his wife were shot dead in Kinshasa in 2005 and freelance journalist Bapuwa Mwamba was gunned down at his home in the capital last year after denouncing police intimidation. The international press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders classifies Congo as a "difficult situation" country. "There is an atmosphere of deep sadness at Radio Okapi. We are deeply affected by this," the station's national editor-in-chief Yves Renard said. "Everything possible must be done to uncover the exact facts and identify those responsible.
