 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  RAB arrested four suspects in Kishoreganj and Narsingdi Wednesday night with links to the sensational six-murder in Narshingdi, the police said Thursday. A RAB-2 team made the arrests after raids on Bhairab in Kishoreganj and some areas in Narsinghdi Wednesday night. The elite crime-busters claimed at a press conference in the city's Magbazar that the arrestees were members of a notorious gang and had killed at least 21 people in 10 incidents. RAB-2 commander M Akbar Ali, also deputy inspector general of police, said six members of a family were killed on May 11 in Belanagar of Narsingdi but the police were clueless. Later, RAB took over the investigation and arrested Akteruzzaman Biru at Bhairab Wednesday night. On information gleaned from him, they arrested Dudh Mia at Doulatkandi village in Raypura Upazila of Narsingdi, Khokon Mia at Shambhupur village and Zillur Rahman at Karakmara village under Kuliarchar Upazila. They were brought to the press conference for reporters to see. RAB also seized weapons from a swamp near Jubaraj Villa. The RAB commander said six people took part in the six-murder in Jubaraj Villa. He would not disclose two other names in the interest of investigation. RAB additional director general colonel Gulzaruddin said Biru and Dudh Mia are members of an inter-district robbers group. The police have evidence against them of killing at least 21 people in Gaibandha, Sylhet, Naogaon, Brahmanbaria and Habiganj, he said. They killed every member of the families they had robbed and used iron rods in the killings, not any sharp weapons or firearms, Gulzaruddin said. bdnews24.c
