 BRIDGETOWN, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chris Gayle will captain West Indies in three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 matches against England. The 27-year-old all-rounder takes over from Daren Ganga, who has deputised for the injured Ramnaresh Sarwan in the current test series. Gayle, who has played 168 one-dayers, was originally nominated as captain by the selectors but was not approved by the West Indies Cricket Board. The board then met again and decided to approve Gayle as captain after the selectors threatened to resign. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, the most senior player with 217 one-day appearances, will be vice captain. Sarwan was forced out of the tour with a shoulder injury sustained in the second test at Headingley. Ganga was not named in the one-day squad, his place going to Austin Richards Jr., a left-handed batsman from Antigua. All-rounder Dwayne Smith and opener Lendl Simmons, who both played in the recent World Cup, were recalled to the squad after missing the test series against England. West Indies play two Twenty20 Internationals at the Oval in London on June 28 and 29. The three one-dayers are at Lord's on July 1, Edgbaston on July 4 and Trent Bridge on July 7. The fourth and final test is due to start on Friday. England lead the series 2-0. West Indies squad: Chris Gayle (captain), Shivnarine Chanderpaul (vice captain), Dwayne Bravo, Fidel Edwards, Runako Morton, Daren Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul, Austin Richards Jr., Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Devon Smith, Dwayne Smit
