 LONDON, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Focus, Britain's third-largest DIY retail chain, said on Thursday it is in talks with US hedge fund Cerberus about a sale of the company. Holders of Focus loan notes would receive 40 pence apiece, the company said in a statement to the Irish Stock Exchange. Focus, owned by private equity firms Apax Partners and Duke Street Capital, struggled to pay the interest on its debt amid rising interest rates and stiff competition for customers. The company operates 250 stores across Britain. Rothschild was appointed to manage a sale after the company failed to reach a debt restructuring agreement with its creditors. "The company confirms that Focus DIY Group Limited is in negotiations with a company affiliated with Cerberus European Investments LLC concerning the sale and that, subject to contract, these negotiations are expected to be concluded in the near future," Focus said in its statement on Thursday. The price values the company at about 250 million pounds ($492.5 million), a person close to the deal said. Cerberus is expected to acquire the company along with another retail investor, the source said, declining to name it. The sale price is below the 280 million pounds needed to repay bondholders, though holders of 180 million pounds of senior debt would be repaid
