 BEIRUT, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of mourners marched in Beirut on Thursday behind the coffin of an anti-Syrian Lebanese legislator killed in a car bomb attack that increased tension with Damascus and deepened Lebanon's political crisis. Walid Eido was the seventh anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated since February 2005 when former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a suicide truck bombing. Allies of Eido blamed his killing on Damascus and said it was in response to the establishment of a UN court to try suspects of the Hariri attack. Syria has not commented on Wednesday's bombing near a Beirut beach club in which Eido, his eldest son, two bodyguards and six passers-by were killed. As the funeral procession moved slowly through the streets of Beirut, mourners chanted slogans against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud. "O' Beirut, we want revenge against Lahoud and Bashar," they shouted. Sunni Muslim Eido belonged to the majority anti-Syrian parliamentary bloc of Hariri's son, Saad al-Hariri, which controls the government. Saad and his key allies led the mourners. Businesses, banks and schools were shut in Beirut and other parts as Lebanese observed a national day of mourning. Three ambulances carrying coffins of the victims were draped in Lebanese flags. Mourners carried white-and-blue flags of Hariri's Future Trend movement and filed past pictures of Eido and his lawyer son with the slogan "Men of Justice". "We have been living in the shadow of savage crimes, but we will not change our path," said a mourner, who gave his name only as Bassam. "We will stay the course until the truth appears and justice takes its course." Eido's death was likely to fuel tension between the government and the opposition led by the pro-Syrian Shia Hezbollah group, which has condemned the killing. "Those who killed and those who are thinking of killing will realise that this policy will not lead anywhere," Information Minister Ghazi Aridi told Reuters Television. "This crime is not only a major challenge to Lebanon but also to the international community." Tension was already high in Lebanon before the attack. The army has been battling al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants at a Palestinian refugee camp in the north for more than three weeks. More than 144 people have died in the battles which are the worst since the country's 1975-90 civil war. A UN Security Council resolution setting up a tribunal to try suspects in the Hariri killing went into effect on June 10. "Terrorism of Syrian regime challenges the court: Walid Eido martyred," said the front-page headline of the daily al-Mustaqbal newspaper. Five less powerful bombs have exploded in and around Beirut in the past month, killing two people. The United States, France, Britain, the European Union and the United Nations condemned Wednesday's attack. "Those working for a sovereign and democratic Lebanon have always been the ones targeted," said US President George W Bush. "The United States will continue to stand up for Lebanon, its people, and its legitimate government as they face these attacks." Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said the government was asking the UN commission investigating Hariri's assassination to help with the inquiry into Eido's killing. He called on the Arab League to take action to protect Lebanon
