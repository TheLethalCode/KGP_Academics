<TEXT>
 HARARE, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Zimbabwe court on Friday postponed the start of former test batsman Mark Vermuelen's arson trial to allow time to study medical reports as to whether he is mentally fit to take the stand. Vermeulen, 28, is charged with setting fire and causing extensive damage to Zimbabwe's cricket academy, which was housed in a thatched building, and a sports club in Harare. Last month, the magistrate's court ordered medical checks on Vermeulen, who has played eight tests and 32 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe, after his lawyers argued the former test player was mentally unstable. He faces up to 25 years in jail if convicted of arson. Prosecutor Tawanda Zvekare told the court on Friday the medical reports were now ready, but asked to have the case deferred to allow further consultations with the defence. "The medical affidavits which we were waiting for have been compiled, but we are making final deliberations on the matter," Zvekare said. "We ask that the accused be remanded to July 11 while these deliberations are underway.
