 BEIJING, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A call by Japanese lawmakers for China to remove photographs and exhibits about Japan's wartime invasion showed that Japan lacked the courage to live up to its historical mistakes, China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. A group of 42 Japanese lawmakers, mainly from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, vowed on Wednesday to press China to stop showing "fake or wrongful" photographs, films and exhibits that reflect badly on Japan. "The photographs have recorded the miserable facts about the period, and the requirement to withdraw them can only reflect Japan's lack of courage to cut ties with its mistakes made in history," Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a regular news conference. "The Japanese invasion of China launched by Japan's militarists brought serious disaster to the Chinese people, and to remember the history is not to continue the hatred, but to prevent tragedies from happening again," Qin said. The remarks coincide with the approaching 70th anniversary of the July 7, 1937 skirmish at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing, which sparked all-out war between China and Japan. Ties between the neighbours have been strained by what Beijing calls Tokyo's refusal to acknowledge atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in the country between 1931 and 1945. Relations were hurt by former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine for Japan's war dead, which Beijing sees as a symbol of Japan's past militarism because some convicted war criminals are honoured there. Koizumi's successor, Shinzo Abe, has been trying to mend fences, visiting Beijing last October for a leaders' summit less than two weeks after taking office. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao followed up with an "ice-melting" visit to Japan in April, marking the first visit by a Chinese premier to Japan since 2000. "We should cherish the peaceful life that did not come easily, and maintain the already better momentum in the development of mutual relations," Qin said
