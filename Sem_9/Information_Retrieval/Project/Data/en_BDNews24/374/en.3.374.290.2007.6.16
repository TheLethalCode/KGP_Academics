 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com) - People woke up to the second day of the Bangla monsoon 'Barsha' Saturday, as skies overcast with heavy rain clouds poured in intermittent showers, spelling woes for commuters in the capital. Kamrul Hasan, meteorological department duty officer, told bdnews24.com that under the influence of strong monsoon winds, all the districts should expect rainfall through the next couple of days. Barisal and Chittagong divisions might receive moderate to heavy rainfall, he said. Hasan said day temperature might slightly fall. Meanwhile, commuters faced acute transport shortages Saturday morning while making it to their work places.
