<TITLE> Over half Karzai's new Afghan cabinet picks vetoed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Afghan parliament rejected over half of President Hamid Karzai's second slate of cabinet nominees on Saturday, including two out of three women, dealing him a second major political blow in as many weeks. Several key ministers were confirmed, including for Foreign Affairs, Justice and Counter-Narcotics, but 10 out of 17 candidates were voted down, meaning Karzai is still without confirmed leaders for over a third of his ministries. Parliament unexpectedly threw out the majority of his first picks in a vote two weeks ago, a move hailed as positive for democracy but a setback for Afghan reconstruction after months of uncertainty caused by last year's fraud-marred presidential poll. The second round of vetoes will prolong the turmoil at a time when the insurgency is worsening and after a year when record numbers of foreign troops and civilians were killed. In an embarrassing development, it also emerged on Saturday that the nominee for the ministry of rural development was underage, a government official said. The candidate was 31 years old while under the constitution the minimum age is 35. Karzai has been under intense pressure from his Western backers, and frustrated Afghans, to choose ministers deemed clean and competent. Those who were approved in the first round of voting were mostly liked by foreign diplomats. The second round of picks are less well-known but there was widespread unhappiness about the choice of Zarar Ahmad Muqbel, a former Interior Minister who international diplomats lobbied hard to have excluded from earlier cabinets. Karzai's spokesman has said he has a list of backup candidates to replace any rejected in this round of voting, and a source at one ministry had earlier said he was vetting two other prospective nominees. But he faces a tight schedule to get them in place before travelling to the London conference, a vital international forum on the future of Afghanistan, on Jan 28. DISAPPOINTMENT FOR WOMEN The rejection of two women, out of a record three nominated for the cabinet, was a disappointment to activists and women who had praised Karzai for a bold choice. "It's probably still too early to expect this much from a parliament that is led by conservative elements," said Orzala Ashraf Nemat, an activist and member of the Afghan women's network, which was co-founded by rejected Women's Affairs Ministry nominee Palwasha Hassan. "I'm sure the reason they didn't vote for her is that they are too scared of women's empowerment," Nemat added of Hassan. The only woman approved was Amena Afzali as minister for martyrs and disabled. Parliamentarian Daoud Sultanzoy had warned ahead of the vote that many of the candidates would be rejected because they presented weak programmes to parliament or seemed only interested in personal gain. "One of the things that I think is very disturbing is that some of the people that were introduced were coming with political baggage, with political influence from those circles who are seeking influence in the government," Sultanzoy said, declining to give names. Karzai has yet to suggest a candidate for the ministry of energy and water after his wish to retain Ismail Khan, a former anti-Taliban guerrilla leader, was rejected by parliament
