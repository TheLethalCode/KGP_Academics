<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Virender Sehwag's comments that Bangladesh would find it difficult to take 20 wickets in the first Test starting at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium here on Sunday drew a sharp reaction from the home team on Saturday. The Indian vice-captain claimed, "It's difficult for Bangladesh to take Indian 20 wickets. The kind of batting line-up we have I don't think so. Even Sri Lanka can't do that. So it's very, very difficult for Bangladesh." But Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan disagreed saying, "I don't think so that Bangladesh won't be playing competitive cricket at the moment. In fact, I think we are a good team who can win against any side. We won the last two-match series against the West Indies. So, I think we have a very good chance in this Test match." Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said, "I've not read the comments. It should not be comments worth talking about. Sehwag should have stayed away from the mike from now on. Everything goes through phases of development. Every team has good years and bad years. "We are not an extraordinary side. We have proved to enough people in recent history that we are an improving side. I think we are hoping to show in the Test match and the Test series. We'll take it day-by-day. As I said, Hopefully we'll prove him (Sehwag) wrong." Bangladesh vice-captain Mushfuqur Rahim reminded reporters: "Australia's captain Ricky Ponting made similar remarks in 2006 in Fatullah before start the Test. We proved them wrong. Hopefully we will do the same against India
