 LONDON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Flintoff has been ruled out of this year's Indian Premier League (IPL) after another operation on his troublesome knee that is expected to sideline him for about six months. The Lancashire all-rounder has been out of action since undergoing a micro-fracture operation on his right knee after retiring from Test cricket having helped England regain the Ashes last year. After an arthroscopy operation this week, the 32-year-old will not now be fit to play for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, which runs from March 12 to April 25.

"First and foremost I have to prove to myself that I can regain my fitness and perform for Lancashire," he added. "My first love remains playing for Lancashire and I want to help them win trophies and hopefully I can help achieve that later this summer." Flintoff is confident he will eventually return to action with England as well as Lancashire. "I have worked extremely hard over the last few months to get to this position and realise there is a lot more hard work in front of me if I want to return and play international cricket again," said Flintoff.
