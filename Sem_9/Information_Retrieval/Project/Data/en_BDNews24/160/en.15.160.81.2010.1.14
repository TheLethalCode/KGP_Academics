 LUBANGO, Angola, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Cup-bound teams continued their miserable start to the African Nations Cup on Wednesday with Cameroon suffering an embarrassing 1-0 defeat by neighbours Gabon in their Group D opener. None of the teams who have qualified for this year's World Cup in South Africa has won a game in Angola yet, with Algeria, Nigeria and Cameroon losing their opening matches and Ivory Coast being held to a draw. In another surprising result, Zambia, who were not expected to make it to the next phase, held Tunisia 1-1 in Wednesday's other Group D match.

In Lubango, 33-year-old Rigobert Song, taking part in a record eighth Nations Cup finals, looked his age when he let Roguy Meye find Cousin with a through pass for the Hull City striker to coolly slot home and give Gabon all three points. Cameroon proved unable to break the deadlock despite playing with three strikers in the second half. Paul Le Guen's side are bottom of Group D after Tunisia and Zambia played out their draw in Lubango. Outsiders Zambia went ahead in the 19th minute thanks to a clinical finish by forward Jacob Mulenga after the ball was slipped to him by James Chamanga. Tunisia equalised five minutes before halftime when Youssef Msakni burst into the Zambia box and found Zouheir Dhaouadi who fired into the roof of the net. Cameroon will play Zambia and Tunisia will face Gabon in the group's next match day on Su
