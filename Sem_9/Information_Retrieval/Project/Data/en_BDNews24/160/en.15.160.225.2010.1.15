 Dhaka Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)The temperature was 32 degrees Celsius at 12.30pm when the annular eclipse began. But temperatures dropped perceptibly as the Moon began to eat away at the Sun. The mercury dipped to a low of 22 degrees Celsius within 2.30pm when the dramatic annular eclipse was complete. People who had shed their warm clothes in the midday heat, put them back on. The phenomenon, observable across a 300-kilometer-wide (about 185 miles) band stretching across half the earth, gave millions the opportunity to watch the 'ring of fire' . 'Anushandhitshu Chakra' established 20 camps in Dhaka, including one at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre, for sighting the eclipse. Other than that, camps were also established at Dhaka University and Jahangirnagar University. Aklima Parveen had come to the novo theatre premises with her daughter-in-law and eight-year old granddaughter. "I have watched many of these. But back then we did not have fancy glasses, so we would watch the reflection on large bowls filled with water," she said. The 65-year old said she thought she would come and watch the eclipse one last time with her granddaughter. "Who knows whether I will be alive when the next one happens." The last annular solar eclipse--the next one that can be viewed from Bangladesh not due before five decades, on Feb 17, 2064--ended on Friday. A former government official, Mohammad Nazimuddin, had come with his daughter. He said he had found out a lot about eclipses at the planetarium. "The last time I had watched it from home. But the ambience did not quite seem right. So I thought I would watch it from here this time." An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line, but the distances are such that the apparent size of the Moon is smaller and does not blanket the whole of the Sun as viewed from Earth. The Sun appears as a thin bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the silhouette of the Moon. The place was abuzz with crowd, mostly eager children and even children in arms. Anisur Rahman thought he would make day of it. He had come with his wife and three-year old Nafis in his arms. They thought it was good that the eclipse was happening on the weekend. "Or we could not have come together." The eclipse started at Uganda, passed through Nairobi, entered the Indian Ocean where the longest eclipse was seen mid-ocean. After that it entered Maldives, where the second longest eclipse occured with 10.8 minutes of viewing. It then entered India at Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala and exited at Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. After Rameswaram, it entered Sri Lanka at Delft Island, exited at Jaffna in Sri Lanka, will cross Bay of Bengal and will end on the Myanmar-China border. According to the NASA Eclipse website, the annual eclipse of the Sun will be visible from within a 300-km-wide track that traverses half of Earth. The path of the Moon's antumbral shadow begins in Africa and passes through Chad, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Somalia. bdne
