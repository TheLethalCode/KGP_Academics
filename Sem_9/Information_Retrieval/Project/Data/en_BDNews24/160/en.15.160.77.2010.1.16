<TITLE> Brown offers social mobility in campaign speech </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown will promise to improve social mobility in a speech on Saturday, trying to appeal to the middle-ground voters surveys show are swinging to the opposition Conservatives. "A fair society is one where everyone who works hard and plays by the rules has a chance to fulfil their dreams; whether that's owning a bigger house, taking a holiday abroad, buying a new car or a starting a small business," Brown will tell centre-left activists in London. "Let me be explicit today, social mobility will be our theme for the coming election and the coming parliamentary term," the Labour leader will say, according to extracts of the speech obtained by Reuters. The centre-right Conservatives are tipped to win the election, which must be held by June, but some opinion polls have pointed to a hung parliament and analysts say a victory for Labour -- in power since 1997 -- should not be ruled out yet. Brown, who took over from Tony Blair in 2007 after 10 years as finance minister, has seen his initially high popularity hit by the longest recession in decades, growing anger over the war in Afghanistan and a parliamentary expenses scandal. Labour strategists want Brown to avoid divisive rhetoric in the run-up to the election, especially after he accused the Conservatives of dreaming up policies "on the playing fields of Eton", a reference to the expensive private school attended by Conservative leader David Cameron and several of his aides. The quip appealed to grassroots Labour activists who regard the Conservatives as a party of privilege, but worried Labour officials who know Brown needs to reach out to as many voters as possible to win his party an unprecedented fourth term. Cameron, educated at Eton and Oxford University, has pushed hard to win back the middle classes who flocked to Blair's centre-left Labour in 1997 and says his party represents the interests of all. BUDGET CUTS Whoever wins the election faces a tough task repairing the damage done to the labour market and economy by the recession, not least because of the need to squeeze public spending and raise taxes to tame a massive budget deficit at the same time. Many economists expect a sluggish recovery, and markets fear Britain could lose its triple-A credit rating unless decisive action is taken to cut the deficit, set to top 12 percent of gross domestic product this year. Labour plans to halve the deficit over four years, and Brown has said that exceeding that pace would put the economic recovery at risk. Osborne says he wants to move faster. One Labour strategist said Cameron and his economics policy chief George Osborne were "taking the middle class for granted" by pledging to remove some of the fiscal perks enjoyed by middle-income families as part of their deficit reduction plans. "Osborne clearly wants to be seen to punish those on middle incomes in a desperate attempt to claim credibility," the strategist said. "There is a huge amount of doubt about the Tories (Conservatives) among middle earners. It's not just the financial benefits they care about, but the kind of public services they will have access to in the future." The Conservatives, warning that Britain could lose the confidence of international investors, say they will start cutting the deficit later this year if they win power and will execute the bulk of the fiscal tightening through spending cuts
