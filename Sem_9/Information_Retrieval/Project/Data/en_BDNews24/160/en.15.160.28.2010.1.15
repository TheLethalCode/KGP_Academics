 CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India are focused on winning a two-test series against Bangladesh, not maintaining their place at the top of the world test rankings, said skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The tourists climbed to the top of the test rankings for the first time in December after winning a three-test series against Sri Lanka. They begin the first test in Chittagong on Sunday. India are scheduled to play only four test matches in 11 months, which means their stay at the top of the rankings could be a short one. "We don't really think too much about the ranking for us. Our focus is on the two test matches that are we are playing and we will look on concentrate for the first game right now," Dhoni told reporters. "If we do well the ranking will take care of themselves, as I said in the past that we are just thinking about the game that we are playing next." India's preparation for the test series suffered a setback when they lost to Sri Lanka in the final of a tri-series one-day tournament in Dhaka. But Dhoni still took some positives from the tournament, which also involved Bangladesh. "The biggest positive was I think the bowlers were coming back into form, you know. They showed glimpses of performance you can say that was really great, the spinners, the fast bowlers, they bowled really well in patches and as the tournament progressed we saw them bowling better and better," he said. "That's a good positive sign for us and good preparation for the test series." India have won all but one of their five tests against Bangladesh. The only test they failed to win was a rain-forced draw in Chittagong in May 2007. Bangladesh will take inspiration from their 2-0 win against a depleted West Indies side in their last test series last July. They have won only three of their 61 tests, drawing six matches and losing 52. "We are not feeling any pressure. If we can bat well and bowl in the proper channel we put any side under pressure," said all-rounder Mahmudullah.
