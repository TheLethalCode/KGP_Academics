 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)--A clash triggered by internal conflict of Bangladesh Chhatra League left several rooms of Ziaur Rahman Hall at Dhaka University ransacked late on Friday night. Both sides claimed some of their activists were hurt but failed to name them. Witnesses said supporters of BCL's hall unit president Rifat Hossain Ziku allegedly ransacked 10 rooms of supporters of secretary Saiful Islam Sohag around 11 pm. The clash was marked by chase and counter chase between the activists of the pro-ruling Awami League student organisation. Sohag told bdnews24.com Ziku along with his supporters chased his supporter Borhanuddin, a first-year marketing student while he was coming out of canteen after having his meal. "As Borhan took shelter in my room, they vandalised several rooms failing to get him," he said. Dismissing Sohag's allegation, Ziku said, "Our junior activists ransacked some rooms after Sohag set some first-year students to insult a senior student." Hall provost professor ABM Faruk said, "On hearing the incident, I rushed to the spot and am trying to find out who are responsible for the incident." bdnews2
