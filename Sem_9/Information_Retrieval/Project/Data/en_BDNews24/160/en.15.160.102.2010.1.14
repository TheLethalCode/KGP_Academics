<TITLE> Still no place for Buriganga waste </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) --- Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) is deeply concerned about finding out a suitable location to dump the wastes being retrieved from the Buriganga riverbed. Until they can find a convenient dumping ground, the wastes from the Buriganga are being dumped at Jaochar in Savar and Sholmachi in Keraniganj, BIWTA sources said. BIWTA has already made newspaper advertisements to find interested land owners who want to fill their low land with garbage. Abdul Malek, the BIWTA chairman, said they did not ponder over the possible locations for dumping the wastes before they launched the river cleansing drive. "But what is important is that the cleansing drive has been undertaken," he said, adding that it was now equally important to find suitable dumping grounds for the wastes to protect the environment. Malek told bdnews24.com that a stretch of one kilometre of the river has been primarily selected on both sides of the second Buriganga Bridge for extracting wastes and garbages from the riverbed. Four contractors have been assigned with the task of cleansing the river at a cost of Tk 6 crore from the environment and climate funds. The cost of total project that was launched on January 6 was estimated to be Tk 24.90 crore, he said. The BIWTA chairman said, "Three of the four contractors have started their work. On an average, 74 cubic metres of wastes are being removed from the river everyday." Malek said the drive was being appreciated by different quarters, but at the same it was facing many problems. Bangladesh Environment Lawyers' Association (BELA) filed a writ with the High Court over dumping the wastes on a land at Aminbazar owned by Dhaka City Corporation (DCC). In the writ, BELA claimed that the land being in a flood-prone area, dumping of wastes there would endanger the environment during rainy season. The writ is awaiting hearing. BIWTA chairman said, "Though the hearing of the writ is still pending, we have decided not to dump the wastes there considering the environmental consequences." "We have now chosen some privately-owned land at Jaochar in Savar and Sholmachi in Keraniganj as the dumping ground for the wastes," he said. He said the authorities were looking for more new locations to dump the wastes. "We have got some land in the inner part of Keraniganj, but we will have to see whether it is worth using." He admitted that it would have been wise to select a suitable location for dumping the wastes before the contractors were assigned with the job of cleansing the river. It was also urgent to stop the mills and factories from throwing their wastes into the river, he said, adding that some industries at Keraniganj, Soarighat and Shyambazar were continuing to throw their waste materials into the river. He said Upazila nirbahi officer of Keraniganj has been asked to call a meeting of industry owners and public representatives to stop dumping of wastes into Buriganga. b
