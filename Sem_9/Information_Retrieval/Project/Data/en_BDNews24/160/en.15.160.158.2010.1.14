 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com) The government is thinking of liquefied natural gas (LNG) import to meet the increasing demand for the natural resource, state minister for energy and power Enamul Haque told parliament on Thursday. Replying to a question by Comilla-9 MP Md Tajul Islam, he said the government is considering the option, as the natural gas available from the existing fields cannot meet demand for it. "There is a supply-demand gap despite production of gas at the highest possible rates taking into consideration the extractable gas reserves Demand for gas is rising as it is eco-friendly and cost effective," the state minister said. He said initiatives have been taken to produce gas at the highest possible rates from the fields that the state exclusively owns. To a question by Rasjshahi-4 MP Enamul Haq, the state minister said four distribution companies are now supplying 1950-1970 cubic feet (CFT) of gas everyday on the average against the demand for around 2280 cubic feet from the present coverage areas. No gas network expansion Enamul Haque said the government has decided not to expand the gas coverage areas until the production rises to 2200 CFT. Answering a question by Dhaka-3 MP Nasrul Hamid, he said: "Gas connections to new areas will be given when the production will rise next year." He said: "New gas line can be set up on condition of its physical and economical viability and availability of the natural resource for future use." To a query by Dhaka-9 MP Saber Hossain Chowdhury, the state minister said the present shortfall of gas production is around d 250 CFT
