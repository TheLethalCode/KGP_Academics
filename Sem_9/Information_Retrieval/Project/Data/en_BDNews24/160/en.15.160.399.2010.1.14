 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  The High court on Thursday issued a contempt of court rule against four officials and a former official of the ministry of fisheries and livestock on charges of violating a previous court order. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui issued the rule on secretary Sharful Alam, joint secretary Shamsul Kibria, senior assistant secretary Sabbir Hossain and acting director general of the department of livestock services Abdul Khalek and former assistant director Rafiqul Islam. They are asked to explain within four weeks why punitive actions should not be taken against them for not postponing promotions in the ministry according a previous High Court verdict. Earlier, HC ordered them to suspend promotions to the district fisheries offices, through the director general of department of livestock services, over a writ petition filed by nine senior upazila fisheries officials challenging the promotions. Abdul Sattar, an officer of the department, moved the contempt of court petition on Jan 10 challenging the promotions that were still in progress. bdnews
