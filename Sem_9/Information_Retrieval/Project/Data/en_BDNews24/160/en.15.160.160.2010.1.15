 LONDON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Injured Liverpool striker Fernando Torres has called on the club's American owners to improve the struggling team by bringing in top quality players. His plea to owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett follows a humiliating home defeat by Championship (second division) side Reading in an FA Cup third round replay Wednesday.

"Anything less than winning the tournament would be terrible. If we do not win it then we have to say it's been a very, very, very bad season in Europe."
