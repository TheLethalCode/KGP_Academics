 KABUL, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States does not know if the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed by a drone strike earlier this week, a senior American envoy said on Saturday. Pakistani officials have said a US drone fired two missiles on Thursday at a compound in northwest Pakistan where Mehsud was believed to have been, but his fate was not known. "I've heard every conceivable version of what's happened and I don't know." the US special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke said. "But if he's still alive he's one of the worst people on earth. Absolutely vicious," Holbrooke told reporters during a visit to the Afghan capital, Kabul. Holbrooke is visiting Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of "routine" consultations with their governments, his office said. If Hakimullah was killed, it could provide a much-needed boost to both Pakistan and the United States, which lost seven CIA employees to a suicide bomber in Afghanistan on Dec. 30, the second deadliest attack in the agency's history. The bomber posed with Mehsud in a video that was released after the attack. The government said in August the leader of the Pakistani Taliban had died in a Taliban power struggle after his predecessor Baitullah Mehsud's death. Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq denied the reports of Hakimullah Mehsud's death. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said after meeting Holbrooke on Wednesday that any intensified US drone strikes or US special forces presence in Pakistan would threaten ties between the long-time allies. US officials say the drones are an effective weapon against militants
