<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Transport movement on all routes in Rajshahi district remained suspended since Thursday morning as workers enforced an indefinite strike causing untold sufferings to thousands of passengers. A number of transport workers' associations called the strike at a meeting on Wednesday night demanding release of three of their fellow workers for violation of traffic rules. A mobile court in a drive on Wednesday afternoon ordered seven days' detention of three supervisors and fined Tk 200 each. The agitating workers also took out processions in the city in support of the strike. Additional police were deployed at the bus terminals and important crossroads in and around the city. The district administration asked the demonstrators to withdraw their strike considering sufferings of the bus passengers. Rajshahi deputy commissioner Shefaul Karim said the mobile court had punished the transport workers upon specific allegations of law violation. "Since the alleged people have the scope to appeal the workers should not have enforced strike," he said. bdn
