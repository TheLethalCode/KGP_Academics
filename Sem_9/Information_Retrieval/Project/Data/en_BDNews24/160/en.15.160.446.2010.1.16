 MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending champion Rafa Nadal has declared himself fighting fit for the rigours of a Grand Slam but the world number two is not certain he will be back to his best at the Australian Open next week. Nadal, whose five-set defeat of Roger Federer in last year's final left the Swiss maestro in tears, has struggled to reach his all-conquering best since knee tendonitis forced him off the tour for two months after the French Open.

Nadal, who allowed himself scarcely a day's break after the Davis Cup ended on December 6 before plunging back into training, said there were no question marks over the strength of his knees. He also shrugged off not having outright favourite status, saying that people had been telling him he was favourite at the French Open every year before his 31-match reign was broken by Swede Robin Soderling. "On hard court there's a lot of very good players and think being number two of the world, probably I am not the ... favourite but I am one of these ones, you know.
