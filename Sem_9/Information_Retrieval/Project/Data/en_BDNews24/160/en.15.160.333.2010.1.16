 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Defending champions India started their quest for a second successive title in style, thrashing qualifiers Afghanistan by eight wickets in their opening Group A match of the ICC Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand on Friday, reports PTI. Indian skipper Ashok Maneria elected to field in the lop-sided encounter and his bowlers kept the faith by packing off the minnows for 118 in 49.2 overs.

The chase was hardly a challenge for India, though the team did lose an early wicket in Mayank Agarwal (10).

India had earlier won the tournament in 2000 and were runners-up to Pakistan in the 2006 edition.
