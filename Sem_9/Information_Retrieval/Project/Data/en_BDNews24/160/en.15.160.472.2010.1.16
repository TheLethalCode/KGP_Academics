<TEXT>
 Dhaka, January 16 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina defended the outcome of her recently-concluded India tour, answering questions and tackling some of the criticisms that have been aired since her return, at a formal press briefing on Saturday, the first of its kind attended by scores of senior journalists and televised live from the Prime Minister's Office. Flanked by senior Awami League and alliance figures, in a show of strength and unity, she quoted from Rabindranath Tagore's Gandharir Abedon saying she had returned "victorious". A former student of Bangla literature at Dhaka University in the 1960s, she also later quoted from Kazi Nazrul Islam's poetry. She said she had secured Bangladesh's interests in line with the goals of the tourthough she only hinted at what those goals were. "Poverty is our common enemy and we want to fight it in unison. And to do so, we must strengthen the relations between neighbours." Hasina began the White House-style open-air press conference at 4pm, with a recap of Awami League's achievements since coming to power a year ago, seguing into advances made in Bangla-Indo ties in areas of connectivity, security, power and water sharing on her Jan 10-13 India trip. Her 20-minute briefing was followed by 40 minutes of questions and answers. The prime minister laced her replies to senior editors with her trademark humour and often referred to the "anti-India rhetoric" of political rivals, which she said routinely followed all her interaction with the mighty neighbour. "When I secured the Ganges water treaty in 1996, they said that water was not good enough for ablutions (oju)." The prime minister also urged the opposition to return to parliament and place their criticisms there. BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia is due to give her own press conference Sunday on the outcome of the India tour. As Hasina listed her present government's successes, she said one of the major achievements had been a turn-around of Bangladesh's 'negative image' abroad into a positive one, by fighting corruption and militancy over the past one year. CONTENTIOUS ISSUES Tackling one of the most domestically contentious Bangla-Indo issues head-on, Hasina said the government would move very fast to upgrade Chittagong and Mongla ports to international standard. "We will take initiatives to prepare and develop Chittagong and Mongla ports so that India, Nepal and Bhutan can start using them this year," Hasina said. She also seized on an editor's remark that India was known for its lack of interest in multilateralism, rather New Delhi had always favoured bilateral arrangements ignoring regional interests. "So, as you said, I succeeded in securing a deal for four countries--Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan," she said of the transit-corridor arrangements with the two small countries in sight. The offer to India for use of ports, however, was one of the most criticised arrangements from the tour, with the opposition strongly objecting on the grounds that Bangladesh's "sovereignty" would be put at risk. The prime minister replied to such criticism immediately on her return, saying Bangladesh in this day and age "cannot remain with doors closed". In Saturday's briefing, she also argued that only limited potential of these ports, 40 percent of Chittagong seaport's capacity and 10 percent of Mongla's, was being utilised at present. She said the two ports could be commercial hubs of the region. "If we can make 100 use of them, we will be significantly benefited." The prime minister has come under fire too for not securing greater assurances from New Delhi on two vital issueswater sharing and the sea border dispute. She told the press conference that a Joint River Commission meeting will be held "straightaway" to address water sharing of trans-boundary rivers. Maritime boundaries too will be determined without delay, Hasina said, in a rebuttal of former BNP ministers who she said had even failed to initiate talks with India on this crucial issue. She also highlighted an important power agreement, among other outcomes of the tour. GRAND AFFAIR The prime minister on return from India had said her visit marked the start of a new era of cooperation between the two neighbours. Critics including the opposition, however, have said Bangladesh gained no more than vague assurances while India secured concrete gains. Saturday's press conference, staged by the fountain at front of the Prime Minister's Office, turned out to be a grand affair with a huge turnout by ruling party and alliance members in a show of support for the "success" of the India tour, which the opposition alliance has repeatedly called a "total failure". The briefing was attended by stalwarts of the ruling Awami League as well as senior leaders of other parties within the government alliance. It was also attended by a large delegation of the press and news agencies, including editors. Responding to queries from journalists on whether Bangladesh's or India's interests were served, the prime minister said: "Hasina never sells her country short. My father, my mother, my brothers and 30 lakh martyrs sacrificed their lives for this country." Asked to clarify exactly what the Indian premier had assured Bangladesh about the proposed Tipaimukh dam, she said: "India's prime minister clearly said that India will not initiate any steps that go against Bangladesh's interests. I don't want to speak further on this issue." The contentious project on the cross-border Barak river is an issue the opposition in particular has run with over the past year, though concerns about the yet-to-be built dam's possible environmental impact are widespread. 'VICTORIOUS' One editor pointed out: "The opposition called your trip '100 percent failure', you have said it was '100 percent success'; we would like to know on what basis these '100 percent' estimations are being made." Hasina replied: "I secured Bangladesh's interests in India in line with my pre-visit goals. I went there seeking victory and I've returned victorious." With a dig at the opposition, she added: "People know well why they continuously criticise us saying that we sold the country to India." Among the crowd of senior party figures were Awami League presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowhdury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Obaidul Kader, alongside AL advisory committee members Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Jalil, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak and Tofail Ahmed. Those from the cabinet included, foreign minister Dipu Moni, and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, also AL general secretary, and information minister Abul Kalam Azad. Alliance members included former president and Jatiya Party chief, HM Ershad, Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon and JSD president Hasnaul Haq Inu. Dozens of other ruling party MPs, party officials and advisers were in attendance too. bdn
