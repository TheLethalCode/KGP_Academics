 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez faced renewed criticism for his team's failures after Reading performed an astonishing giant-killing act to knock them out of the FA Cup on Wednesday. The Championship (second division) strugglers beat the seven-time FA Cup winners 2-1 after extra time in their third-round replay after Liverpool had been less than a minute away from securing a fourth-round tie against Premier League rivals Burnley. Liverpool are 12 points behind Chelsea in the title race and have been knocked out of the Champions League, League Cup and now FA Cup, with little left to play for this season apart from the Europa League.

There just hasn't been any improvement in performances -- if we say average, we're being kind. "I'd probably need an hour to discuss what went wrong tonight for Liverpool. Five or six of that team tonight simply aren't good enough. There will be calls for Rafa Benitez to leave." While Benitez was struggling to find the answers to his teams problems, Reading's caretaker manager Brian McDermott was delighted. "I thought our guys were terrific. It was a really, really good performance. We were unfortunate to go in at halftime 1-0 down because we had three or four chances that just went wide, but you have to think you're gonna get another one.
