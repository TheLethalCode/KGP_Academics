 HARIDWAR, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Hindus bathed in waters considered sacred across large parts of the country to mark the start of the "Kumbh Mela" festival on Thursday, with at least seven people killed in a stampede in West Bengal. At least half a million men, women and children braved chilly winds to bathe in the icy waters of the Ganges in the holy Himalayan town of Haridwar at the "Kumbh Mela", or Pitcher Festival, held every 12 years in different cities. Hindus believe that bathing in the Ganges during the almost four-month-long festival cleanses them of their sins, speeding the way to the attainment of nirvana.

After bathing in the polluted but sacred waters many filled cans and bottles with water, saying they would carry them for their relatives who could not make the journey. Haridwar is one of four spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested during a battle with demons over a pitcher of the divine nectar of immortality. Garuda's flight lasted 12 divine days, or 12 years of mortal time, hence the celebration of "Kumbh Mela" every 12 years. "Kumbh is the soul of Indian culture," said Pilot Baba, a Hindu monk with thousands of followers in many countries. "Kumbh gives us an opportunity to connect with the world, to be a progressive nation," said the monk, clad in saffron-coloured robes, as many bowed before him in resp
