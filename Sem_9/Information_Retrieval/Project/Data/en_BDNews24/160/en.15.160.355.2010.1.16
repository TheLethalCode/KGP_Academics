<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Kamrul Islam, state minister for law, has attributed the delay in commencing war crimes trials to the government's inexperience in the field but said they would begin soon. Kamrul said that there was none in the country with the experience of trying war criminals. "So the preparations are taking some time," he told a discussion on war crimes trial organised by Dhaka University's 'Awami Ain Chhatra Parishad' on Saturday. He said the government was aiming to conduct internationally acceptable trials by taking advice from countries that have already been through the process. The Awami League government, after assuming office in January last year, initiated the procedure to hold long-awaited trials of 1971 war criminals in line with one of its top electoral pledges. Bangladesh estimates that Pakistani occupation forces and their collaborators killed three million innocent people and raped 200,000 women during the 1971 Liberation War. The government has allotted Tk 10 crore to mobilise the prosecution of the war crimes. Necessary legal steps have been taken, with amendments to the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act. A site for the tribunal was also decided upon though this has now been deemed unsuitable. The investigating agency and prosecution team are yet to be appointed. Various organisations have raised complaints that the government is moving too slowly with the trial process. The junior minister, however, said: "War criminals and terrorists are the same. Terrorists killed Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) in 1975. So the landmark judgement on the killers will make the process easier for trying war criminals." He said the war crimes trials would commence after execution of the court's death penalties in the Bangabandhu murder case. The keynote paper at the discussion was presented by Dhaka University law professor Mizanur Rahman. The session was presided over by the organisation's president, Biplob Hasan Palash. bdnews
