 KABUL, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai prepared for another showdown against lawmakers, after they finished debating his new list of cabinet nominees on Thursday, agreeing to vote on them at the weekend. Karzai, who was elected in an August poll which was heavily tainted by fraud, had to revise his first choices for his new cabinet after parliament rejected most of them earlier this month -- a major blow to his authority as he tries to appease his Western backers who want him to appoint clean ministers. Parliament wrapped-up the fourth and final day of hearings to grill Karzai's new replacement candidates and will vote on them for a second time on Saturday. "The parliament decided to vote on the 17 ministers on Saturday. We still have not received the nominee for the ministry of energy and water," said Haseeb Noori, head of parliament's media affairs. Karzai's candidates for seven key posts such as defence, interior and finance, were approved by parliament early this month in the initial list, most of them incumbents favoured by Western donors. The list includes a record three female ministers, hailed as a positive change and welcomed by women's rights activists. A spokesman for Karzai has said he has a third list of nominees to replace any who might be rejected by parliament again when it votes for a second time. Karzai is keen to have the cabinet approved in time for an international conference on Afghanistan's future in London on Jan.
