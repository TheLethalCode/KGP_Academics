 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Experts on water management have stressed exchange of information to avoid conflicts regarding water sharing and construction of dams on trans boundary-rivers. A one-day international workshop, on Himalayan Sub-regional Cooperation for Water Security , heard that "water has become a crisis issue" for people of the subcontinent. Participants in the opening discussion almost unanimously cited the need for better information sharing and scientific exchange to solve regional water issues. Sundeep Waslekar, president of Strategic Foresight Group (SFG), an India-based geopolitical research body, said disputes over rivers, flowing down from the Himalayas affect millions in the sub-regional countries, especially Bangladesh and Nepal. "The problems from water-related issues are mostly affecting the poor while the decisions are coming from the policymakers at the top," he said. Waslekar said countries must ensure fair flow of information for mature solutions to water conflicts, before irreversible measures produce adverse results. Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS) and SFG jointly organised the workshop at the Dhaka Sheraton with experts from China, Nepal, India and Bangladesh. The workshop included discussions on cooperation for data sharing, production of hydroelectricity, water trade, transit and integrated basin management. In his opening address, BIPSS president Maj Gen (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, mentioning that water had become a crisis issue, said: "If water problems are managed properly, a secured and sustainable water future can be ours."
