 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)State minister for law Quamrul Islam, in parliament Thursday, declined to answer when asked by an MP to name "newspaper owners charged with grabbing land". Replying to the question from Jatiya Party MP Hafiz Uddin Ahmad, Islam said he did not want to "antagonise" anyone. But, he added: "People know very well which newspaper owners are land grabbers." "I don't want to antagonise them by referring to them by name," said Islam, who was answering questions on behalf of the information minister. The Jatiya Party MP's question referred to a comment the previous day by industries minister Dilip Barua who said "land grabbers are now bringing out newspapers". Barua's statement was published in several daily papers on Thursday.
