 BRUSSELS, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO's commander in Afghanistan believes the strategy of raising international troop numbers in the country is starting to turn the tide against the Taliban, the head of the military alliance said on Friday. Speaking weeks before an international conference on Afghanistan in London on Jan. 28, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the gains were only a start and additional troop commitments were needed to maintain the momentum. Asked in an online question-and-answer session if he agreed with a view expressed this week by US and NATO commander General Stanley McChrystal that the tide in the 8-year war against the Taliban was turning, Rasmussen replied: "I rely on General McChrystal's sense of things on the ground. He meets a lot of people of all rank and station. Afghan officials and our troops in the field. "The collective impression that they give him is that things are starting -- but only starting to turn if we remain committed and improve our capability to build on this momentum." McChrystal, who warned last year that the war would be lost without a big increase in international troops, said in an interview with ABC news broadcast on Monday that President Obama's decision to send 30,000 more soldiers had blunted the Taliban's momentum and was turning the tide against them. NATO officials say that although many of these additional troops have yet to arrive in Afghanistan, the decision to send them has sent a message to ordinary Afghans and insurgents that the West is committed to the conflict. INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN AFGHAN LEADERS Rasmussen said there was also evidence of an increase in confidence among Afghanistan's leaders, with a willingness to take a more active role in military planning and President Hamid Karzai's travels outside Kabul to meet troops and local leaders. "We have also seen more Afghans speak out against the insurgents, organising themselves to provide alternatives to Taliban shadow governance and implement development efforts," he said. Rasmussen said he saw a sense of urgency in the need to improve governance and development and said the London meeting would reaffirm international commitment to Afghanistan. The conference aims to improve coordination in civilian development efforts and put greater responsibility on the Afghan government to respond to security and reconstruction needs. Rasmussen reiterated a call on all nations contributing to the international effort in Afghanistan to look at what more they could provide in terms of troops, trainers for the Afghan armed forces, money or civilian experts. "While we have increased our military effort, we need to see a stronger and more coordinated civilian effort," he said. Last month, EU countries and other non-US allies followed Washington's lead and pledged nearly 7,000 more troops for Afghanistan. But some, like Germany, are waiting for the London conference before announcing their pl
