"The terrorists today carried out a suicide attack in the bazaar of Deh Rawud district of Uruzgan province as a result of which 16 civilians were killed and 13 others were wounded," the office of President Hamid Karzai said in a statement. Karzai strongly condemned the attack, the statement added. Three of those killed in the blast were children, provincial police chief Juma Gul Himat told Reuters by phone. The detonation happened before lunch, in a very crowded section, he added. General Abdul Hameed, a senior Afghan army officer in Uruzgan, put the toll even higher. "The bomber had explosives attached to a waistcoat. He was spotted by a guard of the money market which is inside the bazaar and then he blew himself up, killing 20 civilians including the guard," he told Reuters.
