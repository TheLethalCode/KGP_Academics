 Gopalganj, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)--At least 50 people were wounded on Thursday in a series of clashes between students and transport workers in Gopalganj. Unruly students of Bangabandhu College vandalised 15 vehicles, including buses and trucks, leaving traffic gridlock on Dhaka-Khulna highway to run back for at least 15 kilometres between Dumudua and Ghonapara. Long-haul vehicles began to run at 8pm after the students removed barricade on the highway and in front of their college which they had put at around 9am. Bangabandhu College Chhatra Sangsad vice president and Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Nazrul Islam Hira said violence erupted when transport workers harassed college teacher Aminul Karim and student leader Sohel Sikder. Hira, college students 'Walid', Rahul Bairagi, Zahirul Islam Lipton, and 'Rafique' were admitted to Gopalganj Sadar Hospital. Additional superintendent of police Haidar Ali Khan said they arrested two transport workers over the incident. Transport workers protested against the arrest and blocked the highway near Fakirkandi and police line crossing at 10am. They lifted the siege at 10:30pm but another clash ensued as students vandalised vehicles at Bedgram crossing. Khan said at least 25 people were injured in the clash. In addition, bus passengers 5-year-old 'Mitu', 'Akhi', 17, Rustom Ali, 85, and transport workers' leaders Humayun Mollah, 35, and Jabbar Sheikh, 30 sustained injuries.
