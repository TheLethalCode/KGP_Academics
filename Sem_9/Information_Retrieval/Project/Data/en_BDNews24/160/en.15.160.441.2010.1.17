<TITLE> Dhaka mirrored New Delhi in security post-1975, says ex-FM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  A former foreign minister said on Saturday that the post-1975 governments in Bangladesh created security concerns in India's seven north-eastern states "mirroring" New Delhi's alleged involvement with insurgency in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The comment came at a discussion on Bangladesh-India relations, organised by English-language newspaper The Daily Star, in the wake of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's just-concluded tour of India that has renewed debate on ties between the two neighbours. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, referring to a number of agreements and arrangements on security, power, trade and connectivity, told the discussion: "We have rescued Bangladesh from being redundant in the region." Former foreign minister Anisul Islam Mahmud, now a Jatiya Party lawmaker, was the one to make the link between 'security concerns' of the two neighbours. "All the governments after 1975 followed anti-Indian policies for which India stalled on different unresolved issues with Bangladesh," he said. "They (India) created a security concern in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and we created a security concern for them in the north east," said Mahmud who served as foreign and water resources minister for seven years between 1982 and 1990, when HM Ershad was in power as a military ruler. Ershad, who was eventually ousted as a dictator, is now part of the ruling alliance. Mahmud thanked prime minister Sheikh Hasina for taking 'bold' steps to improve Bangladesh-India relations during her recent India visit. He said Sheikh Hasina, during her previous term, had also resolved the security concerns in the Chittagong Hill Tracts with a peace accord. The ethnic minorities of the hill tracts took up arms, allegedly with Indian support, against Bangladesh government, from the mid-1970s until the 1997 peace accord was signed, protesting exploitation and injustice. India, meanwhile, has alleged in the past that Bangladesh sheltered insurgents of the separatist movements in the seven sisters, which are connected by a narrow corridor, bordering upon Bangladesh's north, with the rest of India. Mujahidul Islam Selim, general secretary of Communist Party of Bangladesh, also thanked Hasina for meeting her Indian counterpart to improve relations with Delhi. Former state minister Reaz Rahman, now an adviser to the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, expressed the opposition's critical stance on the prime minister's visit. He said the visit could be summed up as 'too many concessions for too few gains'. "The three agreements (on combating crime) signed during the prime minister's visit will pose further security threats in Bangladesh," said Rahman, who was opposed by most of the participants. "The Awami League has seriously endangered our nation," he said prompting foreign minister Dipu Moni to respond with the comment that Bangladesh could not stand by and be sidelined on matters of regional importance. Mahfuz Anam, the Daily Star editor, also thanked prime minister Sheikh Hasina for taking the initiative to improve the relations with India. Matiur Rahman, editor of Prothom Alo, the Daily Star's sister publication and the leading Bengali-language daily, stressed the need for greater political consensus to improve India-Bangladesh relations after the prime minister's India visit. "India-Pakistan rivalry plays out here in Dhaka," Matiur Rahman said, quoting a former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh. Former ambassadors, journalists, economists and other professionals were among those who addressed the meeting. bd
