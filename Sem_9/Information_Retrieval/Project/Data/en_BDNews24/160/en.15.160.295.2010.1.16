 Manikganj, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Manikganj district authorities imposed a Section 144 in the town on Saturday to prevent clashes between two feuding Awami League factions centering around elections to the executive committee of Manikganj Red Crescent. The authorities also suspended the election, Manikganj Sadar police chief Azizul Haque told bdnews24.com. He said the Section 144, which bans public gatherings, was issued for 12 hours starting from 8am Saturday to avoid any untoward situation. Earlier, two panels, one loyal to Manikganj AL general secretary Gazi Qamrul Huda Salim and the other supported by local MP Zahid Malek Swapan, submitted nomination papers for the election. A meeting was held on Friday between the two groups to settle their disputes over the election. Advocate Dipok Ghosh, also the chief election commissioner, told bdnews24.com the election had been suspended as the two conflicting groups were on the brink of a violent situation failing to reach any bilateral agreement. bdnew
