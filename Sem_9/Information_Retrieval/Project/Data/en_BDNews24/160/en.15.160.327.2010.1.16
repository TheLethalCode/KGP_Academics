 Dhaka, January 16 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's official briefing Saturday, on the outcome of her just-concluded tour of India, began with another recap of Awami League's achievements since coming to power a year ago. The conference at the Prime Minister's Office turned out to be a grand affair, meant to show support for the "success" of her recently concluded India tour which the opposition alliance has repeatedly called a "failure". The prime minister on her return from India on Jan 13 said the tour marked the start of a new era of cooperation between the two neighbours. The opposition has said Bangladesh gained only vague assurances, while India secured concrete gains. Saturday's televised briefing for the media and public was attended by stalwarts of the ruling Awami League as well as senior leaders of other parties within the government alliance. It was also attended by a large delegation of the press and news agencies, including editors. Those present included AL advisory committee members, Suranjit Sengupta, Amir Hossain Amu and Tofail Ahmed, and presidium members Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Obaidul Qader. Those from the cabinet included, foreign minister Dipu Moni, and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, also AL general secretary. Alliance members included former president and Jatiya Party chief, HM Ershad, Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon and JSD president Hasnaul Haq Inu
