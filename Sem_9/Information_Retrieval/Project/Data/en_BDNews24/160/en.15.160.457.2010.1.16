 Catherine Bremer PORT-AU-PRINCE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Witnessing Haiti's earthquake aftermath from street level is horrific -- dead bodies poking out of collapsed buildings, bandaged survivors whimpering in tent cities and the stench of rot and death. But seeing it from the sky is when the enormity of the disaster that hit the Western hemisphere's poorest nation last Tuesday really sinks in. Viewed from a U.S. army helicopter flight, large areas of Port-au-Prince are reduced to rubble. Entire shanty towns have slid down hillsides. Swathes of rusty iron roofs look as if they have been sprinkled with debris by a giant hand.

The government's estimated death toll of up to 200,000 people would put Tuesday's earthquake among the 10 worst in recorded history, and it has happened in one of the poorest and volatile countries in the world. Looting and fighting over food began on Friday on streets where no police are in sight and there is no sign of government control, let alone any sign of a recovery plan. "These are bad times the country is living. Who knows what's ahead?" said Antonio Elias, 47, who is leaving his business and flying to his native Venezuela with his Haitian wife and baby. "It's not easy to leave everything behind. Who knows when we'll come back. But I'm not taking the risk of staying he
