 MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a military vehicle in the Pakistani part of the Kashmir region on Saturday killing two soldiers, security officials said. The Pakistani part of the disputed Kashmir region had for years been free of Islamist militant violence until several attacks there over the past year. The violence has fuelled concern Pakistani Taliban militants battling the state are trying to expand their campaign from their northwestern heartland on the Afghan border to stretch the security forces. The suicide bomber attacked the vehicle as it was travelling through the southern part of Kashmir, near the town of Rawalakot and not far from the de facto border with India, the officials said. "A man jumped on a military vehicle at a turning in the road. Two soldiers were killed and four wounded," said a military official who declined to be identified. Pakistan is facing US pressure to fight Afghan Taliban militants in lawless border enclaves who infiltrate into Afghanistan to battle US-led forces there, while also struggling against its own homegrown Taliban insurgency. Militant violence has intensified since mid-October when the army launched an offensive against the Pakistani Taliban in their South Waziristan bastion on the Afghan border. At the same time, the United States has stepped up missile strikes by pilotless drone aircraft on militants in northwestern Pakistan. Security officials said a drone targeted Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud on Thursday but there has been no confirmation of his fate. MEHSUD WOUNDED? The Taliban said on Thursday Mehsud had escaped the strike but one militant official said on Friday he had been wounded. Apparently determined to show their leader was alive, the Taliban on Friday produced a tape recording which they said was of Mehsud. But there was no proof it was him speaking or of when it was made. The United States has stepped up its drone attacks since December 30 when a suicide bomber killed seven CIA employees at a base near the Pakistani border in eastern Afghanistan. The attack by a double agent was the second worst on the CIA in its history. Ten days later, Mehsud appeared sitting beside the bomber in a farewell video, creating the impression that his Taliban movement had become a bigger force to be reckoned with. US drones struck twice in northwest Pakistan on Friday, killing seven militants, Pakistani officials said. Pakistan says the drones are a violation of its sovereignty, even though they have killed high-profile al Qaeda and Taliban figures fighting the government. Pakistan also says its security policy will not be dictated by outsiders, brushing off the US pressure to attack Afghan Taliban factions. Pakistan sees the Afghan factions, which are not attacking inside Pakistan, as useful tools to counter the growing influence of old rival India in Afghanistan. Pakistan also believes the United States will soon withdraw from Afghanistan leaving the country in chaos when Pakistan will need allies among warring factions to pursue its interests. The foreign ministers of Iran and Afghanistan were in Islamabad on Saturday for talks with their Pakistani counterpart on regional issu
