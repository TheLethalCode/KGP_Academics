<TITLE> SQ Chy vows to stop India using Ctg port </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury on Friday vowed to prevent India from using Chittagong port. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had put Bangladesh's security at risk by allowing India to use Bangladesh's ports in a deal sealed in her recent trip to that country. The BNP policymaker said this move would gradually isolate Chittagong port from the rest of the country and observed that it was 'successful' only for India. The centre-right party leader vowed to prevent India from using it as in the case of the United States several years ago when there was a plan to build a container terminal. He said a strong people's movement will be initiated from Chittagong to save the port from such an 'evil force' as India. The BNP leader was talking to reporters at a press briefing at his home in Chittagong in the afternoon. Criticising the security deals, Chowdhury said, the Bangladesh government asked for its own security from Delhi. "Nothing else can be more disgraceful. The government has destroyed the image of country." He drew from an adage pointing to the futility of trusting a fox with chickens since the chickens would all be eaten up. "There is no point for chicken to entering an agreement with a fox for its security." He said it was understandable and quite right that Bangladesh should maintain good relations with its larger neighbour, India. "But that does not mean that we should export our internal problems to India and import theirs." bdnews
