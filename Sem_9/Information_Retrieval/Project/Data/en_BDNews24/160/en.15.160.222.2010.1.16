 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Tamim Iqbal has said doing well against India gives him extra satisfaction, for they are his favourite rivals. He added he was aiming to develop more patience and play longer knocks, similar to his century against West Indies, reports Cricinfo. Tamim's violent six off Zaheer Khan after charging down the track was one of the best shots of the 2007 World Cup, and certainly one of the most famous strikes ever by a Bangladeshi batsman. Does he reserve his best for India? "They [India] are my idols," he said. "I really admire the batting of Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh and, in fact, want to speak to Gambhir during this series about my batting. It's a pleasure to play against India, as they are one of the big teams of the world and it gives you extra satisfaction. Winning against India is special because of you guys [media].The media attention, and I'm telling the truth, when I do well against India also matters." When asked if there was a niggle between him and Zaheer, for both had an exchange of words, not for the first time, in the recently-concluded tri-nation ODI series, Tamim said: "No there is nothing like that. It was just a misunderstanding with him. That happens in cricket. I don't know him that off the field but I am sure once we meet and chat, we will get along well. "It's not as if I do anything extra against him. Hitting the bad ball for four is my target. If I get one I just punish it whether the bowler is Zaheer Khan or anyone else." Aggression has been never been a problem with Tamim, but patience has. Tamim said he was aware of that and knew patience was the key to becoming a successful opener. He hit a breezy 84 against New Zealand on his Test debut, but rates his 248-ball 128 against West Indies as the possible turning-point in his career. "I batted almost 80 overs [and 311 minutes]," Tamim said. "It's the only time I have batted for that long. The century wasn't much, it wasn't that great but the fact that I played so many balls was extra special. I don't know what happened to me that day but I was enjoying it and I really want to bat like that again. I want to control my mind more and play like that in Test cricket." Tamim said he has worked hard on his batting to correct the flaws and hopes he will rattle more big scores in the future. "There were some weak points in my batting," he said. "I can't tell you guys what, but there were some areas where I was weak. I have worked really hard with coach Mohammad Salahuddin, who really helped me a lot. Jamie Siddons, too, has helped me in becoming a better player now." Tamim will get a chance to showcase his learning and batting in two days time on a flat track in Chittagong. His captain Shakib has already said Bangladesh will take draw as a good result. "A draw will be good for us," Shakib said. "I am confident that we will have a good chance if we can score 700 runs in the two innings." The captain's task will be made easier if Tamim plays a long, patient inn
