<TITLE> Minister presents draft health policy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, January 16 (bdnews24.com)  Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque presented a draft National Health Policy 2010 on Saturday, aimed at ensuring a modern health system for the people, which he said would be finalised within three months in light of public opinion. The document, presented at a press briefing at the health ministry, proposes to increase per capita health expenditure from the current $13 to $24. However, while the draft states that the government currently spends just $4/$5 out of that $13, there is no indication as to the proposed new ratio of government versus private expenditure or the means to finance the increase. The policy envisions providing health care more equitably and greater spread of specialised services and adoption of modern health technology. Every citizen would have access to primary health care services regardless of geographical location and specialised health services would be available at upazila level. The entire health administration will be decentralised with the same objective of making services more accessible to the people. The minister, terming the policy "scientific and equitable", said his ministry had received over 3,000 opinions by email. He said the committee to formulate the policy would also consult experts and professionals and incorporate their opinions into the document. "The draft will also be taken to the districts and sub-districts for discussion and feedback. It will finalised for parliament approval only after all opinions have been taken into account." The policy was originally expected to be finalised within the first few months of the government taking office in January last year. One year on, Haque repeated that it would be finalised "as soon as possible". Bangladesh has never seen any of its health policies implemented since independence in 1971. A policy drawn up in 1990 never got the green light and was eventually cancelled. Although another health policy was finalised and accepted in 2000, it never saw implementation due to a change of government soon after in 2001. The current draft is based on that of 2000. The briefing was also attended by health adviser Syed Modasser Ali, acting health secretary Barun Dev Mitra, director general of the health directorate, Shah Manir Hossain and other senior officials. bd
