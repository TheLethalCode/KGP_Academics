 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)--Lyricist and singer Apel Mahmud on Thursday petitioned the court to withdraw copyright violation charges he had pressed against the top officials of HSBC Bangladesh. The court was to begin trial of three HSBC officials, including its chief executive officer Sanjay Prakash, on Thursday. He filed the petition to Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashirullah's court where he said he had reached an out-of-court settlement with the bank. At the hearing of the case, the judge asked the defence and prosecution lawyers if the copyright infringement case can be mutually settled. The lawyers said that the copyright law is incomplete and so there is no section or statement on this. Mahmud earlier on Oct 5 filed the case against Prakash, Corporate Banking Division head Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman and head of finance Mostofa Alim Awlad. He alleged that the three were responsible for selling a CD with his songs without his permission. The songs were such as 'Mora ekti phulke banchabo bole juddho kori (Just to save one flower we fight a war)' and 'Teer Hara Ei Dheuer Sagor Pari Debore (This endless rough sea we will cross)'. The CD with the title `Sotoborsher Bangla Gaan (A Century of Bangla Song)', had songs of other artistes which is a crime as per copyright act, he also alleged. Judge Bashirullah ordered arrest of the senior officials on Oct 28. The defendants later secured bail from the court. b
