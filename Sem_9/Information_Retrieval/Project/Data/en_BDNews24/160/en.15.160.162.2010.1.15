 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African paceman Dale Steyn reflected on a "career highlight" after ripping through England with five wickets on the first day of the fourth and final Test on Thursday. The world's top-ranked bowler took five for 51 as England were dismissed for 180, giving the 26-year-old a five-wicket haul against all Test-playing countries. "Taking five wickets against England means a lot to me. I was chatting at the start of the series about getting a five-for against England, the only team I haven't done that against. I came close in Cape Town, but when decks like this come around, you have to fill your boots," Steyn told reporters. The home team, 1-0 down in the series, were 29 for no wicket in reply at the close. "My motivation is to keep doing the basics and polish them properly, I'm not the kind of bowler to run in and try to do something special," added Steyn. "I probably haven't done the basics well enough in my seven previous Tests against England. My first three Tests against them I was very young and I wanted to make a name for myself." Morne Morkel extracted lift and bounce to claim three wickets in his first five overs and he and Steyn proved a handful with the new ball, as England slumped to 39 for four inside 10 overs. "Morne bowled really well and he came out and set the tone for us today, he got rid of the better batsmen. Trott and Pietersen are two of England's more dangerous batsmen and Alastair Cook was looking very solid," said Steyn. "With Makhaya Ntini no longer in the team, it's almost like the start of Morne's career and he's had to step up to the plate." England's top-scorer Paul Collingwood, who hit 47, defended captain Andrew Strauss' decision to bat first, saying South Africa would have done the same. "Graeme Smith would have batted first as well, so both captains had the same idea. We weren't surprised by the pitch in any way, although maybe there was a bit more bounce than expected," he said. "It can be tough playing on these sort of pitches and you need to commit 100 percent to whatever shot you are playing. There were some good balls, some good catches, but some of our batsmen will be disappointed with how they executed their stro
