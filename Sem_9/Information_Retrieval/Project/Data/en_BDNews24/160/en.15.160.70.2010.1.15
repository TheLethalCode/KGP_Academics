 Khulna, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)Students activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir clashed at Khulna and Meherpur on Friday, with BCL adherents setting ablaze the office in Meherpur of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami that backs Shibir. At least 50 students were injured when the two student organisations fought each other at Khulna Government BL College. In another clash, lasting about three hours, at least 24 Shibir activists were arrested at Meherpur Government College. BCL activists went on the rampage at a Shibir hostel 'Shapnayan' and set fire to it too. However, there were no injuries reported other than three reporters. In Khulna, police and witnesses said the three-hour clash ensued at around 11 am when activists of pro-ruling Awami League BCL and opposition Jamaat's student wing Shibir were taking out processions on the campus to welcome admission-seeking students. The authorities announced a ban on student politics on the campus for an indefinite period following the clashes. Police charged batons and shot around 20 rounds of tear shells to rein the campus in. Two of the injured have been admitted to Khulna Medical College and Hospital and five others to Islami Bank Hospital. College unit president of BCL Saifuzzaman Mukul told bdnews24.com that a stone coming from the Shibir procession hit BCL activists, sparking chase and counter-chase leading to the clash. College unit president of ICS Gazi Morshed claimed BCL activists armed with sharp weapons swooped on their activists 'without any provocation'. "They chopped our activists Touhidul Islam and Ashraful Islam," he said. BCL city unit president Shafiqur Rahman Palash told bdnews24.com that the Shibir activists fired three rounds aiming at leaders and activists of Titumeer Hall. Both sides claimed that around 25 of their activists were injured in the clash. Deputy commissioner of Khulna Metropolitan Police, Md Mostafa Kamal, however, said the number might not be more than 10-12. He said four students were arrested in connection with the incident. The teachers at a meeting at 3pm announced an indefinite ban on student politics on the campus. In Meherpur, police and witnesses said the clash erupted at around 11 am on Friday over establishing supremacy on the campus. The BCL cadres also beat up three reporters when they went to cover their skirmish. The injured reporters are Tuhin Aranyo of Prothom Alo, Polash Khandaker of Amar Desh and Mizanur Rahman of a local newspaper of Kushtia, 'Desh Tattho'. BCL activists alleged that the Shibir workers were carrying pistols and attacked them. But Shibir men claimed that Chhatra League cadres for burning down valuables and vandalising their hostel. Meherpur police chief Rabiul Islam said they had recovered some iron rods from the hostel. bdnews
