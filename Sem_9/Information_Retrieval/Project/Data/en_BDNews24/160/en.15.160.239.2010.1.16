<TEXT>
 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Some 4,000 families living around the site of the proposed bridge across the river Padma would have to be relocated at other places for the construction of the bridge. Badal Hossain, a resident of Medinimandal village, situated on the bank of the river Padma, will be one of those who will have to leave his ancestral home. But he said he would be happy to vacate his land for building the bridge in national interest. Talking to bdnews24.com on Friday, 50-year old Badal said: "We have been hearing for last four to five years about construction of the bridge. This might come true this time. The government has already served notice that our land would be acquired soon." He said if the bridge is constructed the people of southern region would be benefited. "That's why we have no objection in leaving this place. But I will miss my ancestral land." To relocate the people of Medinimandal village, the government has reportedly started the process of acquiring lands in three villages of Kumarbhog, Josholdia and Kandipara in the area. Local people are now busy discussing prices of land around those three villages. The government would acquire 1,000 hectares of land on both banks of the Padma in Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur districts for construction of the bridge, officials said. Before that the authorities would arrange rehabilitation of the people who would be evicted from their lands. Kazi Md Ferdous, executive engineer of Padma Bridge Rehabilitation Project, told bdnews24.com: "The government has begun buying lands to rehabilitate some 3,500 to 4,000 families who would be evicted from the site of the proposed bridge." An official of Christian Commission for Development in Bangladesh, an NGO working for rehabilitation of people in the area, said 72 acres of land were being acquired in Munshiganj and 93 acres in Shariatpur and Madaripur for relocating the evicted people. Ferdous said they would complete purchase of lands by June and start relocating the people. The rehabilitation process would be completed by September-October this year. The government has a target of completing the construction of the long-awaited bridge by 2013. The estimated cost of the 6.15 km long and 23.6 meter wide bridge is US$ 2.4 billion. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain recently said that tender for the construction of the bridge would be floated in February. Finance minister AMA Muhith last month said that the World Bank would provide US$ 1.2 billion, the ADB US$ 550 million, IDB US$120 million and JICA US$ 300 million for construction of the bridge. Besides, Abu Dhabi Development Group will lend US$ 31 million for this project. The rest of the fund will be mobilised locally through issuing bonds and other means, officials of finance ministry said.
