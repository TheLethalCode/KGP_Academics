 Khulna, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)At least 50 students were injured on Friday when Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir at Khulna Government BL College. Police and witnesses said the three-hour clash ensued at around 11 am when activists of pro-ruling Awami League BCL and opposition Bangladesh Jamaat Islami's student wing Shibir were taking out processions on the campus to welcome admission-seeking students. The authorities announced a ban on student politics on the campus for an indefinite period following the clashes. Police charged batons and shot around 20 rounds of tear shells to rein the campus in. Two of the injured have been admitted to Khulna Medical College and Hospital and five others to Islami Bank Hospital. College unit president of BCL Saifuzzaman Mukul told bdnews24.com that a stone coming from the Shibir procession hit BCL activists, sparking chase and counter-chase leading to the clash. College unit president of ICS Gazi Morshed claimed BCL activists armed with sharp weapons swooped on their activists 'without any provocation'. "They chopped our activists Touhidul Islam and Ashraful Islam," he said. BCL city unit president Shafiqur Rahman Palash told bdnews24.com that the Shibir activists fired three rounds aiming at leaders and activists of Titumeer hall. Both sides claimed that around 25 of their activists were injured in the clash. Deputy commissioner of Khulna Metropolitan Police Md Mostafa Kamal, however, said the number might not be more than 10-12. He said four students were arrested in connection with the incident. The teachers at a meeting at 3pm announced an indefinite ban on student politics on the campus. bdn
