<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)The last annular solar eclipse--the last one that can be viewed from Bangladesh not due before five decades-- ended on Friday. The eclipse started from 10:05:24am and continued until 4:07:36pm. The highest point of the eclipse was observed at 2:31:37pm. It was totally visible in Bangladesh only from Saint Martin's Island, for the highest duration, and Cox's Bazaar. It was seen from Dhaka at 12:44:7pm through to 4:58pm. The next one that can be seen here is due on Feb 17, 2064. The Sun cast Moon's silhouette in a root which would be some 300 km in width, whereas the path travels a half of the Earth's circumference, meaning the Moon's shadow travelled more than 20,000 km across the earth, giving the earthlings a fine chance to witness a solar eclipse. 'Anushandhitshu Chakra' established 20 camps in Dhaka, including one at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theater, for sighting the eclipse. Other than that, camps were also established at Dhaka University and Jahangirnagar University. The traffic of excited spectators of the phenomenon crammed these camps. Many were there with their children. The main observation camp was set up in Cox's Bazaar sea beach's Shugandha point while there was one for the scientists at Chhenra Dwip in Saint Martin's Island. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line, but the distances are such that the apparent size of the Moon is smaller and does not blanket the whole of the Sun as viewed from Earth. The Sun appears as a thin bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the silhouette of the Moon. The eclipse started at Uganda, passed through Nairobi, entered the Indian Ocean where the longest eclipse was seen mid-ocean. After that it entered Maldives, where the second longest eclipse occured with 10.8 minutes of viewing. It then entered India at Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala and exited at Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. After Rameswaram, it entered Sri Lanka at Delft Island, exited at Jaffna in Sri Lanka, will cross Bay of Bengal and will end on the Myanmar-China border. According to the NASA Eclipse website, the annual eclipse of the Sun will be visible from within a 300-km-wide track that traverses half of Earth. The path of the Moon's antumbral shadow begins in Africa and passes through Chad, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Somalia. b
