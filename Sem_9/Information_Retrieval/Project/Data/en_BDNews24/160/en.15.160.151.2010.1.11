<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnws24.com)A governing party MP has suggested that the government formulate a 'guideline' for journalists to "tell the truth instead of writing wrong stories". Elias Uddin Mollah, however, thanked Bangla newspaper Janakantha for writing true stories on cattle market ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha in November last year. "Newspapers write wrong and negative stories instead of telling the truth," Mollah, elected from Dhaka-16 constituency (Mirpur-Pallabi), told parliament while reading a notice on urgent public importance matter. "But I thank the Janakantha for writing the truth on Nov 4. It wrote 'unlike previous years, this year (2009) there was no extortion in the cattle market in Gabtali'," said Mollah. "But I don't know whether the government has any guidelines for journalists to tell the truth. "If not, i wonder whether the information minister can make such a guideline to (make them) tell the truth," said Mollah. Speaker Abdul Hamid, however, did not accept the notice as public-important issue. As per the rules of procedure, the minister will place a written reply on the notice in the next session of parliament.
