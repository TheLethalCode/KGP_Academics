 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Police have confirmed the safety of six officers in Haiti, after the devastating earthquake on Jan 12 razed hundreds of buildings to the ground, including the presidential palace, and buried thousands of people in the Caribbean nation. The police officers posted to the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti sent news of their condition by e-mails, said a press release from the police headquarters on Thursday. Among the six police officers, inspectors Khandaker Hossain Ahmed, Md Abu Bakar, Md Shah Kabir and sergeant Md Mabian Mia were working in the capital Port-au-Prince while inspector Kaiser Ali and sub-inspector Abu SM Kamrul Ahsan were posted at Mirebalais. Police officials had expressed concern on Wednesday, saying none of the six had duties at the five-storey UN building in the Haitian capital that was brought down by the powerful quake, but their physical condition or location could not be immediately confirmed. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake was the most powerful to hit Haiti in more than 200 years, according to the US Geological Survey. Reports on casualties and damage were slow to get out due to communication problems. The quake's epicentre was only 16 km from Port-au-Prince, which has a population of about 1 million, and aftershocks as powerful as 5.9 rattled the city throughout the night and into Wednesday. As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is ill-equipped to respond to such a disaster and is appealing for international help. Television footage showed scenes of chaos on the streets of Port-au-Prince with buildings levelled and traumatized citizens dazed, injured and sobbing amid the rubble and scattered bodies. bdn
