 Kurigram/Lalmonirhat, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Train and road communications ground to a halt between Lalmonirhat, Kurigram and other parts of the country for three and a half hours due to an accident on the Teesta Bridge Saturday morning. The disruption occurred as a minibus crashed into the girder of the bridge at 10am while trying to overtake a motorcycle, injuring six people, including a six-year old child, Lalmonirhat railway department traffic superintendent Syed Jahurul Islam said. The injured received first aid. Locals, railway men and on-duty police evacuated the bus, which failed to move again as its steering broke down, Islam said. Hundreds of vehicles, including several trains had become stuck on both sides of the bridge by 1:30pm, he said. The intercity train 'Lalmoni Express' bound for Dhaka was delayed by two hours. In addition, the Kurigram-Kaunia, Lalmonirhat-Shantahar and ShantaharLalmonirhat mail trains, and a Parbartypur-Lalmonirhat local train, were stuck at various stations. Passneger buses bound for Dhaka from Lalmonirhat and Kurigram, as well as local vehicles, were also delayed by hours, Islam said. bdnews
