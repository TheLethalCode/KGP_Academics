 Dhaka, January 16 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, flanked by foreign minister Dipu Moni and backed by alliance members, strongly defended the outcome of her India visit in a press conference on Saturday attended by scores of journalists. Hasina began the briefing at 4pm, with a recap of Awami League's achievements since coming to power a year ago, seguing into advances in Bangla-Indo ties in the areas of trade, connectivity, power and water sharing on her India trip. She said that a Joint River Commission meeting will be held "immediately" to address water sharing of trans-boundary rivers. Maritime boundaries also will be determined without delay, Hasina said. The prime minister had come under some fire on her return from India for not securing greater assurances from New Delhi on the two issues. "We will take initiatives to prepare and develop the Chittagong and Mongla ports so that India, Nepal and Bhutan can start using them this year," Hasina said, on another contentious issue. Bangladesh's offer to India, for use of ports, was one of the most criticised outcomes of the India trip, with fears that "sovereignty" might be at risk. The prime minister has already replied to such criticisms, saying Bangladesh "in this day and age cannot remain with doors closed". In Saturday's briefing, she said: "At present we are using only 40 percent potential of these ports. If we can make 100 use of them, we will be significantly benefited." She also highlighted a crucial power agreement. "India will provide us 250 MW of electricity. Talks also were held on constructing a joint power plant." "We also asked India to take initiatives to stop killing BDR personnel and innocent Bangladeshi people on the borders," Hasina said. The conference turned out to be a grand affair, meant to show support for the "success" of her recently concluded India tour which the opposition alliance has repeatedly called a "failure". The briefing at the Prime Minister's Office was attended by stalwarts of the ruling Awami League as well as senior leaders of other parties within the government alliance. It was also attended by a large delegation of the press and news agencies, including editors. Those present included AL advisory committee members, Suranjit Sengupta, Amir Hossain Amu and Tofail Ahmed, and presidium members Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Obaidul Qader. Those from the cabinet included, foreign minister Dipu Moni, and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, also AL general secretary. Alliance members included former president and Jatiya Party chief, HM Ershad, Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon and JSD president Hasnaul Haq Inu
