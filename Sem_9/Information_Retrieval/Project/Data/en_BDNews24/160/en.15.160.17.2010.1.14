 Rajshahi, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Transport owners and workers in Rajshahi called off an indefinite strike Thursday afternoon after the city mayor assured them of taking steps to release the three workers. Transport movement on all routes in the district remained suspended since morning due to the strike causing untold sufferings to thousands of passengers. A number of transport workers' associations had called the strike at a meeting on Wednesday night demanding release of three of their fellow workers for violation of traffic rules. A mobile court in a drive on Wednesday afternoon ordered seven days' detention of three supervisors and fined Tk 200 each. Earlier, the district administration had asked the demonstrators to withdraw their strike considering sufferings of the bus passengers. Rajshahi deputy commissioner Shefaul Karim said the mobile court had punished the transport workers upon specific allegations of law violation. "Since the alleged people have the scope to appeal, the workers should not have enforced strike," he said. bdn
