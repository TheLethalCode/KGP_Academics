<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Progressive Democratic Party chairman Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi has said Bangladesh received no more than "assurances" whereas India made concrete gains from prime minister Sheikh Hasina's trip to New Delhi. "India has gained hundred percent from the prime minister's tour. "We only got assurances, there is doubt about their implementation," Quarishi told a press briefing on Saturday at the party's Segunbagicha office. During the visit, Bangladesh and India signed three deals on combating crime and two MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange. The PDP chairman said one of the three deals, on transfer of prisoner swap, was meant for returning separatist rebels of northeast India. "The purpose of the tour was to extradite separatist rebels. Bangladesh will face threats for that," Quarishi said. He also strongly criticised Bangladesh's offer to India to use its road, rail and water routes. India will be allowed to access Chittagong and Mongla sea ports, accoding to the joint statement released by both sides following Hasina's bilateral talks with Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh. "These deals have fulfilled India's long cherished transit demand India will not be interested in Asian Highway now," Quarishi said. He also said India's offer of a $1 billion credit line for the development of Bangladesh's road, railway and water routes would ultimately benefit New Delhi for its transit purposes. He said India's offer of seven dredgers for river clearance was also in India's interest. "Bangladesh will gain nothing from these offers," Quarishi said. Quarishi termed the assurances given by India, in areas of trade, power, cultural exchange and the sea boundary dispute, as "merely conventional". "Bangladesh has left nothing to bargain with on these issues," he added. b
