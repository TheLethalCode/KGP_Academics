<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were skittled for 180 on the stroke of tea, having no answer to the pace of Dale Steyn on the first day of the fourth and final test against South Africa Thursday. England, after winning the toss and choosing to bat, were rocked by three wickets from fast bowler Morne Morkel in his first five overs as they crashed to 39 for four. Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell lifted the visitors to 100 for four at lunch but there was more misery in the second session as Steyn sparked a collapse of six for 80 to finish the innings with five for 51. Collingwood and Bell shared a stand of 76 before debutant Ryan McLaren had the former caught at point off a leading edge for 47. Bell was then bowled for 35 by a good ball from Steyn that came back through the gate. England lead the series 1-0.
