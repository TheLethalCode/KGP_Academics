 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  A mobile court of the department of environment fined 13 vehicles for noise pollution and black smoke emissions, due to unfit engines, in the capital on Thursday, in a spot drive aimed at bringing greater traffic discipline to Dhaka's chaotic streets. The court fined the vehicles a total Tk 13,400 and registered a case against one vehicle owner during the drive held from 10.30am to 2pm on the Mirpur-Gabtoli link road, an official said. Dhaka divisional office director of the department Jamshed Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the court was realising fines on the spot and also seizing illegal hydraulic horns. Leaflets were also distributed to road users to raise awareness of noise pollution and air pollution during the drive. Jamshed was leading the drive, with executive magistrate Abul Bashar Md Fakhruzzaman, and assistance from Dhaka Metropolitan Police and Bangladesh Scouts. The DoE official said the department was conducting the spot checks just two days a month due to lack of adequate manpower. He said the next spot check would be held on Jan 26 on Pragati Sarani. The drive are being conducted in line with the Noise Pollution Control Act 2006, which provides for jail terms up to one month and/or a fine of up to Tk 5,000 for a first violation.
