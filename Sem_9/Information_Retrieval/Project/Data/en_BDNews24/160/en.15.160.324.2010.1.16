 Chittagong, Jan 16, (bdnews24.com)- World's top ranked Test nation India is expecting to win the first Test smoothly against bottom side Bangladesh. The hosts however, are determined to make a fight out of the match starting Sunday at Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong. India's vice-captain Virender Sehwag said, they know how to play a Test match against Bangladesh and they are ready for that.

If we can play our best of ability that's might be lot of chances to carry end of fifth day even to win." Bangladesh had faced India five times at home and never away. India won four of those Tests.

The Chittagong pitch is expected to be full of runs. Bangladesh Jamie Siddons is hopeful that his team will do well. Shakib and his spinners are looking to benefit from the conditions, although the situation may not be exactly as the hosts are hoping for. Regardless of the conditions, India emerge as clear favourites by dint of records and Bangladesh's trend
