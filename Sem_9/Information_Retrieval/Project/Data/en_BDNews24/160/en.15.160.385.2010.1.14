<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP has declared the prime minister's India tour "a total failure", saying New Delhi benefited from deals signed and other agreements while Dhaka gained nothing. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on her return from India on Wednesday said the trip was "a hundred percent successful" and termed it the start of "a new era of cooperation" between the two neighbours. The main opposition party BNP, however, has termed the trip the exact opposite. "The prime minister's tour was a hundred percent failure," BNP secretary general Khander Delwar Hossain told a press briefing on Thursday. Delwar said three deals for combating crime that were signed by the two sides during the visit were "unequal and anti-state". "It is India that was profited by the deals, not us. The country will have to face innumerable losses due to the agreements," he said. A BNP standing committee meeting on Wednesday night discussed the prime minister's tour. "BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will make the position of her party clear before the nation on Saturday," said Delwar. He also reitereated the opposition's stance that they could not return to parliament as there was no "congenial atmosphere". "We want to go back to parliament. But the ruling party has not offered any scope for us." "The party's parliamentary party will decide in a meeting whether we will return to the house or not this session," he added. Delwar expressed sorrow for the devastating earthquake in Haiti. b
