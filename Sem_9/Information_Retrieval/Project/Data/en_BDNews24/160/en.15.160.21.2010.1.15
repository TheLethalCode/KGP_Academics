 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief Khaleda Zia will brief the media half an hour before prime minister Sheikh Hasina addresses a news conference on Saturday on her recent trip to India. Prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com on Friday that she would address the media at 4pm on Saturday at her office. The BNP chief's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com on Friday that Khaleda's briefing will take place at her Gulshan political office at 3:30pm. A meeting of the party's national executive committee, the highest policymaking forum, decided to make its position known to the media on the deals signed with India during the Jan 10-13 trip. During her maiden visit to India after her party Awami League formed government a year back, the prime minister signed three deals that BNP termed 'unequal and anti-state'. The party also declared prime minister's tour as 'a hundred percent failure' in a rebuttal to Hasina and ruling Awami League party's claim that the trip was a total success. "It is India that was profited by the deals, not us. The country will have to face innumerable losses due to the agreements," BNP secretary-general Khandker Delwar Hossain told a press briefing on Thursday. The prime minister on her return from India on Wednesday said the tour marked the start of 'a new era of cooperation' between the two neighbours. The two sides signed three deals on combating crime, and MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange. Strides were also made on connectivity, including cooridrs for Bangladesh to Bhutan and Nepal, use of Mongla and Chittagoing ports for India and joint rail and other infra projects with major Indian assistance. b
