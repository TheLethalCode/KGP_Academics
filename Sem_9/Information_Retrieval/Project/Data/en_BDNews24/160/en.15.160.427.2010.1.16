 BUENOS AIRES, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Maradona resumes his Argentina coaching duties this weekend after a two-month FIFA ban for insulting reporters by visiting his team's World Cup base in Pretoria. Maradona completed the suspension on Friday after being sanctioned for lewd comments he made to journalists in Montevideo after Argentina qualified for the tournament in South Africa with a 1-0 away win over Uruguay in October.
