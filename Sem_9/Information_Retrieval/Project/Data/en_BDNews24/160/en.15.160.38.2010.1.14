<TITLE> 'Inefficient' IRIS gets MRP deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)The government has picked Malaysian-based IRIS Corporation Berhad for a Tk 526 crore contract to launch machine-readable passports and visas, just months away from an international deadline. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), all countries must introduce machine-readable passports (MRP) and machine-readable visas (MRV) by April 1. The approval for the contract finally came Thursday from a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase, deputy secretary of the cabinet division Md Nur-ur-Rahman said. Rahman said IRIS will manufacture and supply 6.6 million MRPs in three instalments under the project for 'Introduction of Machine Readable Passport and Machine Readable Visa in Bangladesh'. Concerns were raised earlier during the tender process as the Malaysian-based company has been blacklisted in Turkey for its inefficiency in a similar job. The Turkish government has prohibited IRIS from taking part in any government tenders until October 2011 as it failed to complete an e-passport project in time. Asked why the IRIS Corporation Barhad was again given the job despite cancelling it initially, Brigadier General Refayetullah, director of MRP and machine-readable visa (MRV) project, told bdnews24.com that after the evaluation committee made the recommendation it was convinced that IRIS Corporation had not been blacklisted in Turkey. General Refayetullah said, "IRIS submitted documents to the committee claiming that they had not been blacklisted in Turkey. On scrutiny of the submitted documents, we were convinced about the authenticity of their claim and included the firm in the third and most recent recommendation forwarded on December 20." bdnews24.com probe found that "IRIS Technology Ltd" blacklisted in Turkey and IRIS Corporation Barhad were in fact the same company with same address. International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA) in July 2005 asked all countries to introduce MRPs and MRVs within April 2010. It also said that after this ultimatum, it would not be possible to fly abroad without possessing MRPs and MRVs. After that announcement, Department of Immigration and Passport (DIP) initiated a project to introduce MRPs and MRVs in Bangladesh. It is now plausible that Bangladesh government is going to miss the April ultimatum. Home minister Sahara Khatun said on Jan 3: "The government is sincerely trying to implement the MRP and MRV projects but it is taking some time to complete the formalities." "It might take until May or later to even start the project after completion of the tender process," Gen Refayetullah told reporters. The total process of manufacturing and supplying MRPs/MRVs is likely to be completed in July 2014. The government invited international tender on Sep 16, which closed on Oct 27 last year. Eight companies of different countries participated in the bidding. The tender was called for supplying 22,00,000 passports every year. DIP officials said no old (manual) passport will be issued after the project takes off. But those with old passports with valid expiry dates will not face any problem. There are some 1.2 crore manual passport holders in the country. bdnews
