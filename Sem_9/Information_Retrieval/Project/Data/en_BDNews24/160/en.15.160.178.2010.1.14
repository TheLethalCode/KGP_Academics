<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)Awami League MP Saber Hossain Chowdhury has initiated a bill to oversee conduct of members of parliament and prevent abuse of authority. The Members of Parliament Conduct Bill 2010, tabled in parliament Thursday, proposes that MPs will no longer be able to receive gifts worth above Tk 5,000. The private member's bill, if passed into law, says MPs will be accountable "to their conscience and to avoid conflict of interests". Chowdhury also proposed the formation of a parliamentary committee on morality, which would act as a watchdog and recommend punishments for the MPs if they violate the law. He also said MPs must not be involved in "character assassination, personal attacks, unwanted criticism or praise" through their speeches in parliament. The proposed law was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on private member's bills and resolutions for further scrutiny. Chowdhury said he initiated the bill as newspapers often report that MPs are involved in influencing government or private decisions to secure their personal or their political interests. Section 5 of the bill says MPs will not resort to any illegal way of securing their own or others' interests. It also says members should maintain their lifestyles to avoid conflicts of interest. "If they become confused on deciding issues involving conflicts of interest, the MPs will resort to the morality committee for decisions," says the same section. The bill also says, "MPs will not recommend any type of recruitment, promotion, transfer or seniority for anyone. They will not misuse their authority to proffer someone benefits". "The MPs will refrain from influencing government decisions on public procurement, approval and implementation of projects. "They will not stand in the way of guaranteeing impartiality in the law enforcing agencies, judiciary and other bodies." the proposed law says. MPs would also turn to the morality committee if they receive gifts above Tk 5000, and deposit those to the government. "They must not accept any gifts that can influence their decisions as MPs," the draft law says. Chowdhury proposed that every new parliament will form a nine-member morality committee, headed by the speaker, to oversee the implementation of this law. The bill says the morality committee would be authorised to take cognizance of any reported incident and would present a report on its activities every year making it public.
