 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh made a winning start to their ICC U-19 World Cup campaign in New Zealand after beating Papua New Guinea on D/L method in Palmerston North on Saturday. New-ball bowler Abul Hasan picked up four wickets, three of which dented PNG's top and middle order after they chose to bat, while the spinners kept run in check. PNG were bowled out for 191 in 46 overs. Set a D/L target of 189 in 46 overs, the junior Tigers suffered a top-order wobble but the lower middle order polished off the chase with 112 balls to spare and five wickets in hand. The main contributor was Shabbir Rahman, who hit an unbeaten 51 from 45 balls. His innings was sandwiched between key knocks from Mahmudul Hasan (38) and Nurul Hasan (24 not out from 17 balls). Bangladesh play West Indies at the same venue on Sunday. The Windies lost their opening match against Pakistan by 40 runs. Cricinfo adds: England had few hassles overhauling Hong Kong's 185 on the second day of the Under-19 World Cup at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval.

Hong Kong had been carried to 185 in 48.5 overs thanks to Niazkat Khan's 69-ball 65 and middle-order roles from Irfan Ahmed and Mark Chapman. Hosts New Zealand cruised to a victory in their first match, defeating Canada by nine wickets in Lincoln. Chasing Canada's meagre total of 128 all out in 29.3 overs, New Zealand reached the target in just the 20th over for the loss of one wicket. James Neesham top scored with 47. Canada's effort with the bat, after they were put in, was forgettable with the No 8 Arsalan Qadir proving the most successful with 26 from 30 balls. Australia flexed their muscles over USA in Queenstown, securing a 108-run win after posting 262. USA had done well to dismiss Australia inside 50 overs because at one stage they collapsed to 28 for s
