 Natore, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  A citizens group in Natore called off a protest programme on Thursday after it was "assured" of receiving gas supply lines. State minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarker, and an MP from Natore, said that gas would be supplied to the district town. He made the declaration through local Awami League leader Hanif Ali Sheikh. Earlier in the day the group, calling itself the Natore Gas Supply Movement Committee, observed a half-day strike demanding a gas pipeline. All businesses and shops were shut down and transport movements suspended in the district town during the strike. The state minister said he had talked to the prime minister and energy ministry about the matter. "A cabinet meeting will be arranged at Natore Gano Bhaban soon where the matter will be approved," he said. The committee had earlier this month observed a half-an- hour road blockade to press their demand. bdnews
