 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Experts on water management pressed a Dhaka Declaration on Water Security at an international conference in the capital on Saturday, urging greater political commitment and data exchange among Himalaya basin countries for collective approaches to the region's water challenges. The one-day conference on Himalaya Sub-Regional Cooperation for Water Security, attended by 25 experts from China, Nepal, India and Bangladesh, stressed that water has become "a crisis issue" for people of the subcontinent. Participants almost unanimously cited the need for better information sharing and scientific exchange to solve regional water issues. They also acknowledged the possibility of serious conflict over resources if prevailing water disputes are not resolved in a cooperative manner. Participants expressed their deep concern regarding water sharing and construction of dams on trans boundary-rivers. The serious consequences of climate change for water security across the basin countries was also observed. The meeting, jointly organised by Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS) and India-based Strategic Foresight Group (SFG), underscored the need for securing equal interests of all basin countries, especially the lower river nations. Sundeep Waslekar, president of SFG, an Indian geopolitical research body, in the opening session, said disputes over rivers, flowing down from the Himalayas affect millions in the sub-regional countries, especially Bangladesh and Nepal. "The problems from water-related issues are mostly affecting the poor while the decisions are coming from the policymakers at the top," he said. Waslekar said countries must ensure fair flow of information for mature solutions to water conflicts, before irreversible measures produce adverse results. In his opening address, BIPSS president Maj Gen (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, mentioning that water had become a crisis issue, said: "If water problems are managed properly, a secure and sustainable water future can be ours." During its day-long sessions, the workshop included discussions on cooperation for data sharing, production of hydroelectricity, water trade, transit and integrated basin management. Formation of an expert committee was recommended to prepare a road map and guidelines for transparency regarding data sharing and scientific exchange. Participants stressed joint efforts by concerned countries and groups for exchange of data and information on flow of Himalayan rivers in the low season. Saturday's session followed a gathering of delegates on Friday as part of a long term process to build cooperation between the Himalayan River Basin Countries. The process is supported by the US-based John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation, an international peace and security research group.
