 PARIS, Dec 2, Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Wednesday he welcomed US President Barack Obama's decision to send more troops to Afghanistan, but did not immediately commit France to following suit. However, just days after France said it would not dispatch more forces to the region, Sarkozy left the door open for eventual reinforcements in the new year. "(Obama's) speech was courageous, determined and lucid, giving new impetus to the international commitment and opening new prospects," Sarkozy's office said in a statement.

French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said on Wednesday that "for the moment" France had no need for additional soldiers in the areas where it was operating in Afghanistan. "As I have said, there are other regions and if the strategy changes we can review things," he told France Info radio. Obama telephoned Sarkozy on Monday as he briefed world leaders ahead of his speech on Tuesday, and the change of tone from French officials suggests that Paris does not want to be seen snubbing Washington. A senior French diplomat with NATO in Brussels told Reuters on Tuesday that France could help with police or supplies.
