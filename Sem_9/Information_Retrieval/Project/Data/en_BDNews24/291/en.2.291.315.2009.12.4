 WASHINGTON Dec 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military may hand security responsibility in parts of Afghanistan to local leaders and their security men and police rather than President Hamid Karzai's US-trained national army, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Thursday. The strategy underscores US doubts about Karzai as well as the prospects of training enough Afghan National Army soldiers in parts of Afghanistan to allow for a smooth handover of security responsibilities under a new US timetable. Karzai's international standing has been hurt by his victory in a fraud-marred election and rampant corruption in his government. Much of Afghanistan is controlled by local authorities rather than Karzai's central government in Kabul, and US officials believe alliances with local tribal leaders may be key to broadening security and sidelining the Taliban. In addition to deploying 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, President Barack Obama has directed that US forces in July 2011 begin to transfer security responsibility to Afghan forces, district by district and province by province.

"In fact, a good bit of this security that may come as part of this (July 2011) transition will be local security, local police, as we've seen develop in parts of Wardak province," he added, referring to an area outside the capital Kabul. "So it won't be necessarily that we turn over security responsibility to the Afghan National Army but rather to local authorities who have... reestablished control of their own areas from the Taliban," Gates said. The Pentagon envisages the transfer of authority in Afghanistan to follow the model in Iraq, where the US military ceded control to the country's security forces and began to gradually pull out. Gates said Afghan provinces with the least amount of violence would likely be handed over first. "What we have to do is strengthen again the local and traditional governance systems in Afghanistan that in fact can reestablish local control and deny the Taliban authority," he s
