 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP could form only 48 of the 72 district committees even after extending the deadline twice, the last ending on Nov 30. "The final list of the councillors for the fifth national council is complete. A total of 2,512 councillors will participate in the national council," office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said at a media briefing at the Naya Paltan headquarters on Tuesday. "Before the end of the second deadline, councils have been held in 48 districts, which are 67 percent of the total." Ahmed also said 70 percent of the upazila, municipal and thana councils have been conducted. "The convenors and the primary co-convenors will join from those districts and thanas where councils are yet to be conducted." The office secretary said no representative from the dissolved Dhaka metropolitan committee will be attending the upcoming national council. He said other than the councillors, 40 delegates from each parliamentary constituency wil ljoin the national council on Dec 8, with the total number of the delegates at 12,000. However, the presidents and general secretaries of the metropolitan's thana committees would attend by virtue of their position. As part of the party's reform from the grass-roots level, new convening committees were formed in 72 of the 75 district committees in the first half of February. New convening committees of Dhaka and Manikganj districts and Dhaka metropolitan are yet to be formed. Clashes and intra-party feud foiled the committee formation and councils in several places.
