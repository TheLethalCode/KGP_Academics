<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has asked the government to immediately withdraw the case against Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco filed over the Bhola ferry tragedy. He said in a statement on Thursday that the charges were pressed to politically persecute the sons of opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia. "This case was filed to taint the image of the Zia family and to confuse the people. It is clear to all that the case was filed with government backing." Delwar said Tarique and Coco were not related with the incident and are taking treatment abroad, he said. The secretary-general insisted on an apt investigation to expose the actual reason of the capsize of the MV Coco-4. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan told reporters on Wednesday that Tarique and coco were on the board of the launch company Rahman Shippers Bangladesh Ltd that owns the MV Coco-4. He said sixteen people, including businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun, who is also a director of the company and a close associate of Tarique, faced a case filed in the Marine Court on Nov 30 by shipping department inspector Shafique Aiyub. The Coco-4 partially capsized Nov 27, the night before Eid-ul-Azha, on the river Tentulia at Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town. Rescue operations were called off on Thursday, with the death toll reaching 85. The search for bodies was halted on Wednesday night, though officials say many passengers are still missing. b
