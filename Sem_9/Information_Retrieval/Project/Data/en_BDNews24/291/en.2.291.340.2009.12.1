<TITLE> Minaret ban under fire in UK </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)Religious leaders in the UK have condemned the Swiss decision to ban the construction of new minarets following a referendum this week. London's former mayor Ken Livingstone has also voiced serious concerns. "The ban on minarets in Switzerland, a country that only has four minarets, is an attack not only on Muslims, but on the most basic freedoms in society," Livingstone said in a statement on Monday. Dr Abdul Bari, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain said: "Mosques and minarets in our European cities are manifestations of the proudly indigenous nature of Islam in Europe." Other faith community leaders were troubled by the Swiss move. Dr Edie Friedman, executive director of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality, said: "It is a very sad day when such an important religious symbol is put to the vote." Bruce Kent, vice president of Pax Christi, said: "I am dismayed at this decision which is manifestly discriminatory. As a Christian, I live in an area where we have a beautiful mosque and minaret which cause no offence to anybody and contributes to the beauty of the environment." The referendum in Switzerland was proposed by the far right Swiss People's Party and gained 57.5% of the vote on Sunday, despite opposition from the Swiss government, Church leaders and the Vatican. The Swiss People's Party utilised imagery and campaigns that whipped up hostility against Muslims in the run up to the referendum. Switzerland currently has only four minarets on mosques throughout the country. Livingstone, who heads the One Society Many Cultures campaign in the UK, said: "If this had been a similar ban on Synagogues or Church spires, it would have been rightly met with revulsion. "Yet across Europe we are seeing intimidation and attacks against Muslims and others by emboldened fascists who are using Islamophobia to grow." Livingstone pointed out that the far right had made gains in Europe in the first half of the last century by demonising and attacking Jewish people. "Let this referendum be a rallying call for all democrats - we must challenge Islamophobia and racism if we are to stop the far right." Bari, also a member of the One Society Many Cultures campaign, said: "The Swiss referendum results today show how far and how quickly Europe is moving in the wrong direction in its attitudes and policies towards Muslims and other minority groups in Europe." "It is tragic that the Far Right is stripping away at our illustrious heritage of coexistence between different faiths and cultures in Europe and replacing it with their warped and xenophobic outlook," he said. "The results today sets a dangerous precedence and demands that Muslims and others must work hard and diligently against the Far Right ... This is no less than a battle of ideas for the future of a plural and progressive Europe". Friedman said: "That anyone should even consider this is unbelievable. This could have very dangerous consequences, sending out the wrong message to the rest of the world." "Far from cementing positive relations between people, this can only sew division and disharmony. I hope that common sense prevails, this decision is reversed and building a cohesive society in Switzerland is taken up with renewed vigour." Livingstone launched the One Society Many Cultures campaign earlier this year, aiming to promote and defend the fundamental human rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and cultural expression, which underpin democratic society and have been hard fought for hundreds of years.
