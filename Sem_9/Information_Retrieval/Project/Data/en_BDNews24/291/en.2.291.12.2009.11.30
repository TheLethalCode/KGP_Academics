 Chittagong, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Local influential people felled and removed more than 1,500 trees on Sunday night in the Sitakunda coastal area, in a second such incident of illegal logging in five months, officials said on Monday. Forest department officials said the people did the damage to the coastal green belt, which spreads over an area from Ghoramara at Madhya Sonaichhorhi, with the help of 200 to 300 men. Police did not respond immediately after reporting about the incident. A similar large-scale felling of trees occurred some five months ago, but the local administration and the forest department have remained tight-lipped about who are responsible for the crime. Forest officer Mohammed Hassan Miah told bdnews24.com that the criminals took away 1,560 'Keora' trees from the forest department's 10-acre forestation project. "We had nothing to do and watched them felling the trees. We have lack of manpower to prevent such crime. The police at Sitakunda Police Station reached the spot very late though we informed them just when the criminals started cutting those trees," he added. Officer-in-charge of Sitakunda Police Station Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com that additional police has been deployed at the spot to prevent any such incident in future. The forest department is preparing to file a case, he said. Earlier on July 8, SM Al Mamum, the son of a local MP Abul Kashem Master, and his associates cut some 10,000 trees from the same coastal area. Coastal forest department planted 222,000 trees on 125 acres of land 20 years ago. But 80 acres of forest have already disappeared because of the planned ship-breaking yard. Some 17 cases were filed earlier in this connection, but none was tried. bd
