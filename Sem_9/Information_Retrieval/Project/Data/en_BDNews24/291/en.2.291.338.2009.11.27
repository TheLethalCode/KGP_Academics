 KABUL Nov 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai reached out to the Taliban on Friday, part of a call for reconciliation that the palace says will be the main focus of his second term that began last week. Speaking to reporters outside his palace in Kabul on the first day of the Muslim Eid Al-Adha holiday, Karzai said: "I once again call upon our brothers, the Taliban, Hezb-e-Islami and everyone who is away from their land and who have taken up arms against their soil, to come back to their country for peace, stability, prosperity," he said.

There are now about 110,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan, two-thirds of them American. US officials have backed Afghan efforts to reach out to the militants, including attempts to make contact with Saudi Arabia acting as a go-between. "I will not abandon this struggle. I hope that Mullah (Omar) and other Taliban realise this act is a national necessity for peace and security," he said. Karzai, whose reputation has been severely damaged after a fraud-marred election in August, called on his rivals, including former presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah to join the new government. He is expected to announce a cabinet line-up in coming we
