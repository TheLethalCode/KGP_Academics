 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 05 (bdnews24.com)  Occupants of Dhaka's older high-rise buildings, constructed before 2007, are more likely to fall prey to fire due to poor ventilation and lack of emergency exits, officials said Saturday as a blaze in the capital claimed one life. The fire at the 12-storey Shahjalal Complex in the city's crowded Malibagh area lasted just 45 minutes before being put out, and was confined to the ground floor. Even so, one person died, at least 10 were injured and over 100 were stranded due to lack of safety measures, officials said. Fire service duty officer Parvin Akhter said five units were sent to the scene as the fire broke out at around 3:15pm. It was extinguished by 4pm, she said. Ramna police chief Shibli Noman said they tried to evacuate the building as plumes of smoke reached the fourth floor. Dhaka Medical College Hospital's emergency medical officer Dr Protul Kumar Sarkar told bdnews24.com the victim, 25-year old Saiful Islam, died from suffocation. Ten people admitted to the DMCH suffered serious smoke inhalation, he added. Matiur Rahman, fire department director (training), told bdnews24.com: "There were no fire exits, and many fell unconscious from smoke for lack of proper ventilation." "Such a scenario is common in most of the buildings in Dhaka city. One high-rise building adjoins another building with no space in between." Matiur said construction companies have started following building codes only very recently. "Until just a few years ago, buildings were constructed without following any codes. As a result, there are no emergency exits or sufficient ventilation for smoke to escape in thousands of high-rise apartments across the city." Architect Ikbal Habib told bdnews24.com, "There were many loop-holes in building regulations before the national building code of 2004 was formulated." As a result, safety measures could not be enforced. "The building code, amended in 2006, was made compulsory for all and more strictly enforced from 2007." "There is now a provision of eight years' imprisonment for those who fail to comply with the regulations," he said. But this does not solve the fire risk to occupants of older buildings. At least ten major fire tragedies in Dhaka have made the headlines in the past year or so Most took place in the crowded slums or congested old city. In one of the most deadly fires, ten people were killed in a blaze originating from a chemical shop on the ground floor of a five-storey house in Aga Sadek Road on the night of August 3 last year. The residents on upper floors, finding no way out, were knocked out by noxious smoke and burnt to death. As wall-to-wall high-rises have spread across Dhaka, almost any area of the city could face a similar tragedy due to congestion and poor safety, officials say. Fire department director Matiur Rahman said Saturday's fire at the Shahjalal Complex looked like it had originated from an electrical short circuit in the offices of private firm ICT Enterprise located on the ground floor. Ramna police said smoke reached upward of the fourth floor during the fire. Anisur Rahman, director of Falgun Paribahan Company on the fifth floor of the building, told bdnews24.com: "I was at our office during the fire. Suddenly, I got wind of smoke." "My surroundings became dense with smoke within a short time. I couldn't breathe." "I was on the point of suffocating. I really thought I was going to die." His colleagues managed to rescue him. The fire department's Matiur Rahman advised people to keep heads down to the ground in case of fire as smoke rises and there is usually adequate oxygenated air up to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. In addition, he said, it is possible to prevent fire fatalities through regular fire drills in residential and office buildings. bdnews
