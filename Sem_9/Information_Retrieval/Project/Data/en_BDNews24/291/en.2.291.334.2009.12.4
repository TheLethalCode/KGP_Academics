 SYANGBOCHE, Nepal (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's cabinet began a meeting close to the base camp of Mount Everest on Friday to send a message on the impact of global warming on the Himalayas, days before global climate talks start in Copenhagen. Wearing oxygen masks and heavy jackets, Nepal's Prime Minister and more than 20 ministers flew in by helicopter to meet 5,242 metres (17,200 feet) above sea level with Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, towering in the backdrop.

Thousands of glaciers in the Himalayas that are the source of water for 10 major Asian rivers could go dry in the next five decades because of global warming, experts say. In freezing temperatures and surrounded by snowy peaks, Nepal's cabinet began meeting at Kalapathar, a small patch of grassy land that is also one of the target destinations for trekkers.
