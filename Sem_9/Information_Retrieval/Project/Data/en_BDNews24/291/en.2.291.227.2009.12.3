 Benapole, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com)--Import through Benapole land port was suspended from Thursday morning over a transport strike in India, officials said. More than 500 goods-laden trucks headed for Bangladesh were stranded on Petrapole land port across the border, according to port officials. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) backed by Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) were enforcing a daylong shutdown at Bangaon in India after gunmen shot dead transport worker, Animesh, 40, at Bangaon. They continued demonstrating at the Petrapole port, forced suspension of cross-border trade and transport at Bangaon, and stopped the trucks entering Bangladesh. Cargo branch inspector of Benapole customs Abdul Gafur told bdnews24.com 38 trucks had lined up at Petrapole port up to 2:30pm, waiting to be unloaded. Petrapole Clearing and Forwarding Staff Welfare Association general secretary Kartik Chakravarty said India-bound passengers were facing trouble.
