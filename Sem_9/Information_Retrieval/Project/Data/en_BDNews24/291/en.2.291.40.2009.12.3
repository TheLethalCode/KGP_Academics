 Dhaka, Dec 02 (bdnews24.com)  A new report highlights falling standards of primary education in Bangladesh, saying literacy level and over-all quality of education "do not meet expectation". Success rates in different classes of primary schooling have dropped in the last one decade, according to the non-government report titled 'Education Watch-2008'. The report also said half of primary school children still drop out before completion. Senior government figures expressed their disappointment in the findings of the report prepared by the NGO Campaign for Primary Education (CAMPE). "Education up to Class 5 has attained very low progress due to complications in expansion of primary education," said finance minister AMA Muhith, unveiling the report at the LGED- auditorium Wednesday. "Enrollment rate has not increased but number of dropouts has risen," he said. Citing the example of West Bengal, he said better results could be attained if local government and voluntary organisations were included in expansion of education. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, attending as special guest, said the new education policy would be finalised within this month and implemented from early next year. He said, "This education policy will not be inflexible like religious scriptures. It will be open for change and match the need of the times." The minister said books would be distributed free up to level ten at the beginning of the new session despite various "conspiracies and complications". He said timely distribution of books for free among the students would reduce dropout rates and raise the enrolment rates. CAMPE researcher Samir Ranjan Nath presented a summary of the report. He said around half of students enrolled at primary level drop out before completing the five years. "The high dropout rate indicates lack of quality provision, poor resources and inefficiency in the system," he said. The standard of literacy and over-all quality of education are far from the desired level, though success is seen in gender parity, Samir said. That girls outnumbered boys in net enrollment was first documented in 1998 (78.5 vs. 75.5 percent) and continued to 2008 (87.1 vs 85.6 percent), the report says. Dropout rate and retention rate at primary level increased by 11.5 and 10.9 percent respectively over the last decade. But literacy rate among children aged seven and above fell to 48.5 percent in 2008 from 49.5 percent in 2005, says the report. Paid private tutoring rose during the past decade irrespective of class, sex area and school type. In 1998 and 2000, over a fifth of the primary school students had private supplementary tutors which increased to 31 percent in 2005 and 38 percent in 2008, CAMPE found. Former caretaker government adviser and Education Watch chairman Kazi Fazlur Rahman presided over the ceremony. CAMPE executive director, Rasheda K Chowdhury, also a former caretaker adviser, delivered the address of welcome. bd
