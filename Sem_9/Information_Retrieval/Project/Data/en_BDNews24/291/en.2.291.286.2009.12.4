<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 04 (bdnews24.com)The removal of a self-imposed ban on exports of shrimps to European Union countries has apparently hit snags. The government's Department of Fisheries (DoF) last month decided to resume exports of fresh-water shrimps from Dec 7. Bangladeshi exporters and the DoF suspended shrimp consignments to the EU for 'six months' from last May after almost 100 shipments over four years were subject to a 'Rapid Alert' notice, which circulates information on food safety problems among European nations. The alert came for contamination of frozen shrimps by nitrofuran, a toxic antibiotic. Bangladesh was set to ease the ban after initiatives to eliminate contamination of the toxic element began to take hold. In a meeting held on Nov 8, the DoF set the deadline for the ban and informed the matter then to the Commission of European Union in Dhaka. "It was agreed that we would have to inform the EU of the matter a month ahead of lifting the ban and we did so," Rafiqul Islam, director general of the DoF, said. But, the EU sent a letter to the DoF on Nov 26 asking for the status of the progress of the initiatives to eliminate the problem, he added. "It's already have been sent to the EU," Islam told bdnews24.com on Thursday. He said that the country was all set to start exports of freshwater shrimps to the EU countries on the scheduled date. "We are ready to start but still it depends on the EU Commission," added the DoF chief. Islam said they have been able to 'significantly reduce' the contamination of nitrofuran. "I think it's now at permissible level to allow export." bd
