 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)--The government will appoint ombudsman by next January to establish rule of law, the law minister has said. Shafique Ahmed spoke to reporters after a meeting with country director of Asian Development Bank Paul J Heytens at his secretariat on Tuesday. The minister said, "To establish good governance, the ombudsman will be appointed within the next January. The ADB has assured us of providing logistics supports along with financial aid for this." Ahmed also said, "On the basis of complaints of the affected people, the ombudsman will investigate irregularities of the government, semi-government and autonomous organisations." The ombudsman will also submit reports to the government proposing actions to be taken. The government will be bound to take actions accordingly against the accused. In accordance to article 77 of the constitution, there is provision for appointing an ombudsman. A law had also been passed for it in 1980. The minister added, "The president will appoint an eligible person as the ombudsman based on parliament's recommendation." Answering to a query, he said, "The ADB has asked for a permanent attorney service. This will rid the change of law officials with change of governments. "However, a separate cadre service is needed for it. ADB also assured us of providing all necessary financial aids for the establishment of the cadre service." He had said in October that a scrutiny committee, headed by the speaker, had been asked to finalise the nominations. bdnews24.com/
