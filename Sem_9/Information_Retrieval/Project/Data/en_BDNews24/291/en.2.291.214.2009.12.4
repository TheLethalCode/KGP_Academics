 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)The government is going to award a blacklisted foreign company a deal to produce machine-readable passports (MRP), according to documents obtained by bdnews24.com. Several government sources said the evaluation committee has not maintained the rules and procedures while recommending two foreign companies for the MRP and machine-readable visas (MRV). The deal is awaiting approval of the highest government level bypassing rules and procedures, the sources added. The two companies even failed to meet the requirements in the tender documents, sources said. An investigation by bdnews24.com reveals that the two companies that quoted lowest rates are Malaysia-based "IRIS Corporation Barhad" and "Flora Telecom Company, and Gemalto", which failed to fulfil some terms and conditions required to strike a deal for MRP/MRV project to be implemented by the Department of Immigration and Passport. Sources said IRIS is banned in Turkey and "Patimas", an associate of Flora Telecom Ltd, is blacklisted by the Bangladesh Bank. Both the companies lack experience in MRP/MRV manufacturing. International Civil Aviation Authority has already given directives to all the countries to introduce machine-readable passports and visas by April 2010. Travelling abroad will be barred without MRP/MRV after the deadline expires. An ECNEC meeting on Mar 19 decided to issue 174,00,000 general and 10,00,000 urgent passports under the five-year project at a cost of Tk 283 crore. The project, launched in July, is expected to be complete by June 2014. The government has assigned the Army to supervise the project and appointed Brig Gen Refayet Ullah as its project director. International tender was invited on Sep 16 while it was closed on Oct 27. Eight companies participated in the bidding. The tender was called for supplying 22,00,000 passports every year. Companies such as 'Iris' (Malaysia), 'Beijing Jinchen Ciccone Security Printing Co, Ltd.' (China), Flora Telecom with Gemalto (Luxembourg), 'Oberthur' (France), and 'ST Electronics' (Singapore) were the leading contenders for this project. The successful bidder will get the task to operate and maintain the project for two years and DIP will take over the project in phases. IRIS and Flora have been selected provisionally by the committee. DIP officials said no old (manual) passport will be issued after the project starts functioning. But those with old passports with valid expiry dates will not face any problem. There are some 1.2 crore manual passport holders in the country. IRIS has been barred from participating in government tender in Turkey until Oct 2011 as it failed to complete the e-passport project there in time. It does not have the experience of supplying 2.5 crore passport books and manufacturing 80,00,000 passports a year as mentioned in the bidding requirements. Moreover, it did not include rates for blank MRP books, lamination, visa stickers, routers, switch and some other necessary machinery. However, the two companies have mentioned providing of two MRP printer machines, which also do not match bidding terms. The evaluation committee later informed the company to give one more printer. But that was not made in line with the government's Public Procurement Policy-2008. The visa printers to be provided by the company does not have the 'UV printing' option, which is obligatory according to the terms of tender. Even the machinery proposed to be supplied by IRIS are of low quality in global standards, several technical experts commented. On the other hand, the machinery and parts in the list as mentioned by Flora Telecom are not in line with the terms and conditions of the tender and have technical anomalies. It did not include the prices of some machinery as per the requirement, which meant the offered price by the company was relatively low. Its associate company "Patimas" was blacklisted by the central bank after failing to complete a project in time. The proposed visa printers and passport readers supplied by the company are not capable of fulfilling some terms of the tender. There are allegations that the evaluation committee has recommended both the companies as "capable", without mentioning the low standard router/switch and barcode scanners. Another associate "Gemalto" has no experience in supplying passport books and the company did not mention how many books it produced a year earlier. Moreover, the visa printer, proposed by the company, can print only 200 passports an hour while the requirement was for 2000 passports. bdnews2
