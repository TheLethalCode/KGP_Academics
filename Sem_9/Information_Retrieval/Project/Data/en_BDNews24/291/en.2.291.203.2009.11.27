 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Traffic misery shifted from the capital to highways up and down the country Friday with the rush of thousands of vehicles carrying homebound passengers a day ahead of Eid. At least 18 people were killed in road accidents in different districts. Hundreds of thousands of homebound people were stranded on different highways, meanwhile, raising fears of missing Saturday's Eid congregation. "People will get home in time. An eight-hour journey is now taking 16 hours. Buses are moving at a snail's pace, but people are still reaching home," said a highway police officer. Anwar Kamal, highway police superintendent, told bdnews24.com the number of vehicles had risen five to six fold on the highways causing extreme traffic build-up. ACCIDENT TOLL HITS 18 At least 18 people were killed and more than 100 injured in road accidents across the country, as the highways filled with holiday traffic. In Jamalpur, three people including a police constable were killed and 40 injured in a bus accident on the Jamalpur-Madarganj highway at arund 8pm, police said. Five people were killed and 40 others injured in a bus crash on the Dhaka-Khulna highway in Madaripur. In Dinajpur, two people were killed after a bus hit their motorcycle on the Dianajpur-Thakurgaon highway at around 6am, police said. Police said five people were killed and 20 others injured in a bus accident on the Doulatdia-Khulna highway near Goaland bus stand in Rajbari. Another three people were killed Friday morning in two separate accidents in Tangail. ENDLESS QUEUES AT TERMINALS Reports reaching the capital said hundreds of vehicles of all kinds had been waiting in long queues at ferry terminals and along the two sides of narrow bridges. "We are trying all very hard to manage the Eid traffic. The government has even cancelled our Eid leave for ensuring smooth transport movement," Kamal said. Mohsinul Karim Lebu, stranded at Savar Baipal for more than two hours on his way to his Rangpur home, said he did not see any highway police around there. Hundreds of thousands of homebound holidaymakers were waiting for buses in the capital's terminals on Friday afternoon, just hours before the morning Eid congregation. Buses leaving for the northern and southern districts were delayed at departure from the city on Thursday. Ehsan Lenin, a Comilla-bound passenger, went to Sayedabad bus terminal at 5am, but he could not get on any bus even after the midday Friday. "I had to return home yesterday after waiting for hours. I have been waiting for bus since dawn, but there is no bus," he said. "Let's see what happens," said Lenin, who is still hopeful of getting a bus and joining with his family to celebrate the Eid. Like Lenin, thousand of people were waiting for buses in Sayedabad bus terminal, the major departure hub of buses bound for the south and north-eastern districts. Bus owners and operators said buses were coming late due to heavy gridlock on the highways. Sultana Rahman, who wanted to go to her in-law's house to celebrate the first Eid, could not catch any bus. It is impossible for women and children to board the buses that come to the terminal after long time. Many were forced to get onto the roofs risking lives. Passengers allege the counters had demanded charges twice or thrice the usual rate. Moinul Haque Chowdhury, a Chittagong-bound passenger, said his bus left Sayedabad at 11:30pm on Thursday. He crossed Daudkandi at midday on Friday. It takes from one hour to one and a half hours to cross Daudkandi in normal time, but the long traffic snarl meant it took 13 hours. OVERNIGHT WAITS The same scenario was seen at Gabtoli bus terminal, the major departure place of the north-bound buses, where thousands of passengers were stranded overnight from Thursday as buses were delayed by up to 8 hours. Golam Mortuza Antu, trying to leave the capital, said he had seen thousands of fellow passengers waiting at Gabtoli terminal in early hours of Friday, who had spent the night there. Police and bus operators blamed the traffic chaos on the makeshift cattle markets on roads and highways and high traffic volume. They said buses were unable to leave the terminal because of acute tailbacks on major routes out of the city. bdnews24.com/mhc/
