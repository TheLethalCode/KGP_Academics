 CONAKRY, Dec 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guinea tightened security in the capital Conakry on Friday, residents said, after junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara was wounded in an attack carried out by his own soldiers. The incident underlined the fragility of the West African nation, which is the world's top exporter of the aluminium ore bauxite and whose stability is seen as vital to its neighbours. "The government can offer the assurance that the situation is under control," a junta official said on state television after the violence flared late on Thursday.

Communications Minister Idrissa Cherif said Toumba had been located somewhere in the capital and added: "Those who orchestrated this insurrection will be punished." Camara came to power in a bloodless coup last December after the death of strongman Lansana Conte. He initially promised to allow a transition to civilian rule but has since delayed elections and refused to hand over po
