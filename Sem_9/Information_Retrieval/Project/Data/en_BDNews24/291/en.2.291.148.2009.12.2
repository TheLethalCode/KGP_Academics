 Dhaka, Dec 02 (bdnews24.com)  The government has finalised the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for the next one and a half years. The implementation of the second PRSP during the period between Jan 01, 2010 and June, 2011 will cost Tk 2814.81 billion. Finance minister AMA Muhith disclosed this on Wednesday after a meeting on the second PRSP at the planning ministry in the capital. The finance minister said: "We will switch over to our five-year plan from July 2011. But until then, we will pursue activities under the second PRSP. There will be no other PRSP after July 2011." Muhith said development work will start in full-swing from this Dec under initiative of Public-Private Partnership (PPP). A policy on the PPP will get approval at the next cabinet meeting, he added. After the approval, the activities under the PPP will start, which include invitation of tenders. The minister also said: "We wanted to start implementing the project under the PPP. But we were unable for various reasons. We can now do it from Dec." Muhith said the one that will be launched from July, 2011 will be the sixth five year plan. It will address the election pledges of the government. Responding to query from a journalist regarding the changes made to the second stimulus package, the minister said: "The stimulus package is a continuous process. We do not want any of our sectors to be harmed by the recession. We will arrange such packages according to needs of the sectors at that time." Establishment secretary Moshiur Rahman, who was present at the press briefing, refuted the accusations of no work being done saying the work has already been started. "People will be seeing the results soon. However, we want to ensure that government funds are not wasted," he added. The finance minister said local and foreign aid will help finance the implementation of the PRSP. Planning minister AK Khandaker was present during the press briefing. bdnew
