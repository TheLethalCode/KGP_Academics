 WASHINGTON, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Pakistan on Wednesday to do more to go after militants on their territory but sought to allay Islamabad's concerns over increased US troops in neighboring Afghanistan. Defending President Barack Obama's revised strategy for Afghanistan, Clinton was pressed by US lawmakers to give details on what Pakistan was doing to stamp out militants who sought refuge on their territory. "The unity of support that the people of Pakistan are showing for this effort is profoundly significant. But, as we have said, it is not enough," said Clinton, whose comments are likely to be met with hostility in Pakistan, where anti-US sentiment is already running high. "The Pakistanis have to do more against all of the insurgent terrorist groups that are threatening them, that are threatening us in Afghanistan and the Afghan people, and are threatening other neighbors in the region," she added. During a visit to Pakistan in October, Clinton came under a torrent of criticism for suggesting the government had failed to kill al Qaeda's leaders believed to be in the country, which is waging its own battle against increasingly powerful militant Islamists. She later rowed back from her comments and made certain on Wednesday to praise Pakistan's government for showing greater commitment in recent months to tackle the Taliban and its extremist allies. She also sought to allay Pakistani concerns over the so-called surge of US troops in Afghanistan, with plans to send in an additional 30,000 troops before next summer. Pakistani officials fear a dramatic increase in US troops in Afghanistan will push militants and refugees across its borders and complicate its own battle against the Taliban. Pakistan's foreign ministry said on Wednesday it wanted to make sure there was no "adverse fallout" from the troop decision and asked for more details on the strategy. "They certainly understand that having a destabilized Afghanistan that offers launching grounds and training is not in their interests," said Clinton when asked about Pakistan's reaction. Pakistan is also concerned the United States will leave Afghanistan before the job is done and setting a July 2011 date for US troops to start leaving underscores those fears. Clinton said she understood those concerns and said she had worked hard with Pakistan to explain Washington's long-term commitment to Islamabad, a fragile, nuclear-armed government locked in a bitter rivalry with neighboring India. "The Pakistanis understandably worry that our actions in Afghanistan increase cross-border efforts that threaten them, which they are obviously not in favor of seeing increase," she said. "We are not going to be in and out the way we have in the past," she ad
