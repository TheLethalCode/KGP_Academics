 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Leader of opposition and BNP chief Khaleda Zia has said the national council of her party will be held as scheduled. "The BNP council will definitely be held on Dec 8. There is no scope to be confused about," Khaleda Zia told reporters at Eskatan Ladies Club on Saturday. She was exchanging Eid greetings with the diplomats, party leaders and activists, and people from all walks of life. Khaleda Zia said the common people cannot celebrate Eid due to a miserable state of law and order and socio-economic condition. She said the present government has failed to run the country since it took office. "They could not do anything in the past 10 months for the people. The ruling people are busy with tender terrorism and corruption. "They are torturing the leaders and activities of the opposition party." The opposition leader also said they were ready to assist the government. Khaleda Zia blamed the ruling party for creating chaos in the BNP district councils. "The government imposes section 144 as the ruling party announces programmes on the venues of our district councils. But they are saying BNP itself is making chaos." The BNP chief expressed her grief at the Bhola Launch accident and road crashes, which took many lives, on Friday. She criticised the government for the rise of joblessness, lack of investment, closure of industries and shrinking manpower market. She blamed the ruling party for making parliament ineffective. "The government has destroyed the environment for us to return to the house. No notice of our MPs is accepted there. They are not allowed to speak for the people. "The house has turned into a place for those praising and criticising some individuals. That's why the speaker has termed parliament as a fish market." Khaleda Zia said: "We want to give time to the government; we want to assist it. "If it cannot solve people's problems and signs deals with foreign companies against the country's interest we will be compelled to wage movement," she warned. She later went to the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar and paid tributes there. b
