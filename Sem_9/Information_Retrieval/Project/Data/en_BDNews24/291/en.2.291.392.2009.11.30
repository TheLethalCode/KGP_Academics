 Bhola, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Another 10 bodies were recovered Monday morning from the site of Friday's ferry disaster in Bhola, after they floated to the surface of the Tentulia river overnight, raising the death toll to 66. Of the 10, two were of children and eight of women. The local administration has handed over some 50 bodies to relatives and estimates some dozens of passengers are still missing, district commissioner Mesbahul Islam said. Salvage vessel MV Hamza had to halt operations due to rising water levels caused by the morning's high tide. The increased river depth exceeded the Hamza's operational capacity, officials said. The accident occurred late on Friday when the MV Coco-4 was trying to anchor at Nazirpur terminal in Lalmohon, some 40 kilometres from Bhola district town. It was carrying more than triple its capacity, with over 1,500 passengers, from Dhaka to Lalmohon ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha. The vessel, crowded from hull to decks with people heading home to celebrate with families, began tipping with the weight of disembarking passengers and partially sank, according to eye witnesses. Salvage vessel MV Hamza reached the spot on Sunday morning to right the sunken ferry and ease rescue work. Police, divers of BIWTA and fire service men have been engaged in rescue operations since the early hours of Saturday. Thirty-one bodies, mostly women and children, were recovered on Saturday. Another 21 bodies were retrieved from the hull of MV Coco-4 on Sunday after the salvage vessel re-floated the partially capsized ferry. Hundreds of people gathered on the bank of the river throughout the Eid day Saturday and following Sunday, anxiously waiting for their relatives who were on board the launch. Families wailed over the bodies of dear ones as they were retrieved. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, now in Port of Spain attending a Commonwealth summit, expressed her grief Saturday over the launch disaster and ordered speedy rescue operations and investigation into the accident. The president also expressed his sorrow condolences for the grieving families. Three committees have been formed to report on aspects of the launch disaster. The government formed a five-member probe committee, headed by deputy shipping secretary Baitul Amin Bhuiyan, officials said. It was asked to submit a report within seven working days. BIWTA on Sunday also formed a five-strong body to investigate the incident, its chairman Abdul Malek told reporters. "The team will inspect the passenger capacity, fitness certificate of the launch and will visit the spot Monday," he added. The district commissioner said a three-member committee has been formed on behalf of the district administration. They have been asked to submit a report within three days. bdnews24.com/
