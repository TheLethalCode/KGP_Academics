 Bhola, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com) Seven more bodies were retrieved from the hull of MV Coco-4 after salvage vessel MV Hamza re-floated the partially capsized ferry on Sunday, raising the death toll to 53. The total number of bodies recovered on Sunday reached 18. The accident occurred late on Friday when the ferry was trying to anchor at Nazirpur terminal on Tetulia river, some 40 kilometres from Bhola district town. It was carrying from Dhaka more than triple its capacity with over 1,500 passengers ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha. The ferry was crowded with people going home to celebrate the Eid, and the weight of disembarking passengers caused it to tip and partially sink, according to eye witnesses. Local officials said they have prepared a list of 103 people still missing. The district administration has handed over 49 bodies to the relatives. Among the dead only 45 bodies could be identified. Rescue operations is still going on, said district commissioner Mesbahul Islam. Hundreds of people gathered on the bank of the Tetulia river anxiously waited overnight looking for their relatives, who were on board the launch. Witnesses said relatives wailed over the bodies of dear ones. Police, divers of BIWTA and fire service men have been engaged in rescue operations. The government has formed three committees to report on aspects of the launch disaster. bdnews24.com/c
