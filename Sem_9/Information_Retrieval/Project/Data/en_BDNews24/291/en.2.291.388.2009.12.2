 Dhaka, December 02 (bdnews24.com)  Top ULFA leader Arabinda Rajkhowa has been arrested in Bangladesh, Indian media reported Wednesday. Bangladesh authorities have yet to confirm the matter. Rajkhowa, founding chairman of the banned United Liberation Front of Assam, was picked up near Dhaka on Monday, according to India Today. The ULFA leader will reportedly be handed over to the BSF under tight security at its Gokulnagar outpost along the Indo-Bangla border in Tripura. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, who was in New Delhi for talks with his Indian counterpart, was asked to comment on the reported arrest and handover during a press conference on Wednesday. He said he could not confirm or deny the reports as he had been away from Bangladesh since last Sunday. Indian home secretary GK Pillai too said that he had no knowledge of Rajkhowa's arrest in Bangladesh or anywhere else. Bangladesh's inspector general of police Nur Mohammad also told bdnews24.com Wednesday he "knows nothing". Rajkhowa had an Interpol Red Corner notice issued against him and has been a fugitive since 1992, hiding out in Bangladesh during much of that time, the media reports alleged. Dhaka and Delhi, meanwhile, announced Wednesday they would redouble efforts to locate criminals under Interpol Red Corner Notices in either country. The ULFA or the United Liberation Front of Assam is an outlawed separatist group, which has been fighting for an independent homeland since 1979. Thousands have died in its separatist campaign. India has long claimed that Bangladesh is a fleeing ground for northeast Indian separatists. In August this year, India once again asked Bangladesh to deport ULFA founder-leader Anup Chetia, whose jail term is going to end soon. Chetia, whose real name is Golap Baruah, has been in jail since his arrest in Dhaka in 1997 under the Foreigners Act and the Passport Act. More recently, however, Delhi has acknowledged Dhaka's tacit cooperation against cross-border crime, terrorism and insurgency. Two other top ULFA leaders Chitrabon Hazarika and Sasha Choudhury were arrested just last month. The separatist group issued a statement at the time, saying they were also arrested from Bangladesh, before being handed over to Assam Police. ULFA protested the handover on the grounds that the two countries do not share an extradition treaty. GREATER COOPERATION Meanwhile, the two home secretaries, during four-day-talks concluding Wednesday, finalised drafts of three major agreements to formalise bilateral efforts against organised crime and terrorism. Sikder and Pillai finalised the draft agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters, Transfer of Sentenced Persons and Combating International Terrorism, Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking. The three agreements are now ready to be signed during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi later this month. Sikder and Pillai told a news conference on Wednesday that both sides had agreed to develop mechanisms to further hasten the process of verification of nationality of prisoners lodged in the jails of the two countries. Pillai also said that Indian government was thankful to Bangladesh government as the latter had recently foiled a reported terrorist plot by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba to attack the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
