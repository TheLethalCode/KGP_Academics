 Rangamati Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)Calls were renewed for a detailed roadmap to execute all provisions of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, with muted warnings against further delay, as the 12th anniversary of the signing was observed Wednesday. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Shanghati Samity, marking the anniversary in the hill districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban, called upon supporters of the accord to unite in a "tougher movement" for its full implementation. "Tensions will rise if army rule in the region, under the name of Operation Uttaran, does not come to an end," PCJSS chairman Santu Larma said. Larma also warned of anarchy by the United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) if the organisation, which rejects the terms of the Peace Accord, is not banned. The peace accord was signed on this day in 1997 between the then Awami League government and the PCJSS, also known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council, to end decades of insurgency and bring stability to the troubled region. Speaking at a rally in Rangamati, to mark the anniversary, Larma said that the government would be responsible for any further crisis in the region. He alleged that the UPDF through its terrorist activities had held the regional people hostage over the last 12 years, killing more than a hundred PCJSS members. UPDF was formed by breakaway PCJSS members with the view that the accord failed to address fundamental demands. Formed almost after a year after the signing, the UPDF rejected the peace accord demanding "full autonomy" as the only way to ensure right of self-determination for the hill tract population. Larma demanded a detailed roadmap for completing the peace process according to the provisions of the accord. He said implementation of the accord had been delayed for the last 12 years due to negligence of successive governments. "There can be no more delay," he said. The rally was also addressed, among others, by president of Bangladesh Workers Party, Rashed Khan Menon MP, secretary of Bangladesh Adivasi Forum, Sanjib Drong, organising secretary of PCJSS, Shaktipada Tripura, leader of CHT Mohila Samity, Suprova Chakma and president of Pahari Chhattra Parishad, Udayan Tripura. PATH TO PEACE Acting Awami League chief and deputy leader of parliament Sajeda Chowdhury said the current AL government would go for an all-out effort to implement the peace accord. "We have already started the process as it is a major commitment of our electoral manifesto," she told a discussion on the hill tracts issue in the capital on Wednesday. The government since January has taken a number of steps for the peace processit has finally constituted the CHT Land Commission, as well as creating a high level committee on the implementation of the peace accord, including a taskforce on rehabilitation of refugees, and a parliamentary standing committee on CHT affairs. In August this year, the government started what it termed as "the biggest single withdrawal" of troops from the region since the accord was signed, though regional leaders have demanded a detailed schedule for full withdrawal. There is also disagreement on the actual number of army camps that have been withdrawn since the accord was signed. The government says 200 camps have been dismantled in the past twelve years, while the regional council says the number is nowhere near as many. The army was deployed in the troubled region after indigenous communities, led by Chakma leaders, took up arms in the 1970s in protest against the government of a newly independent Bangladesh for its "inaction" over key demands. These included decommissioning the Kaptai hydroelectric project and restoration of traditional land rights. The Kaptai Lake, built in the 1960s, inundated the palace of the Chakma King and vast tracts of land displacing thousands of people. Many fled across the border to India to wage a campaign of insurgency against the Bangladesh Army. Many more fled in the wake of violence. The conflict escalated as the government in 1979 took up a policy of settling Bengalis, giving them lands and other facilities there, which subsequently reduced the indigenous population in the region from 97.5 percent in 1947 to just 50 percent at present. The Awami League government signed the peace deal on Dec 2 1997 with the PCJSS headed by Santu Larma, who at one time led the guerrilla war against the army. Complications remained, however, the opposition by another faction of Chakma insurgents, the UPDF, which continued with violence despite the peace deal. bdne
