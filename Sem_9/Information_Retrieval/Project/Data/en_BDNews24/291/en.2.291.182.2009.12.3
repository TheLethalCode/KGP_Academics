 TOKYO, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Japan's tiny Social Democratic Party threatened on Thursday to leave the ruling coalition if her views on a US military base were ignored, the latest sign of strains that are complicating policy decisions. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has formed an awkward coalition with the pacifist Social Democrats, whose support he needs to pass legislation, but whose stance on Tokyo's security alliance with Washington clashes with that of many in his own party. Japan is under pressure from the United States to implement a plan to shift a U.S. Marine base from the center of a city on the southern island of Okinawa to a more remote part of the island. But the Social Democratic Party (SDP) supports the view of local people who want it moved off the island.

PARTY LEADER UNDER PRESSURE Fukushima announced the previous day that she would run for the leadership of the SDP again in this month's party election.

Failure to implement the deal would hinder a wide-ranging realignment of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan, including a plan to move up to 8,000 Marines to the Pacific island of Guam. But Japanese media reports said on Thursday that Hatoyama was likely to postpone the decision until next year, risking further irritating the United States in an effort to keep the coalition together. Hatoyama will have no need of the coalition if his Democrats win a majority in the upper house election set for mid-2010. Though Hatoyama has a large majority in the more powerful lower house of parliament after his landslide election win in August, he needs the support of the SDP and another tiny coalition partner to pass legislation in the upper ho
