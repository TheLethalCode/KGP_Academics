 KABUL, Nov 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan announced a pay rise of nearly 40 percent for police and military recruits on Saturday, as Western countries aim to increase the size and quality of Afghan security forces so their own troops can go home. Interior Minister Hanif Atmar said monthly salaries would increase by $45 to about $165 for a new recruit. At present, there are about 95,000 Afghan soldiers and 93,000 police.

"This will help improve recruiting, increase retention of those professionals in the force today, and it will also help reduce attrition," US Lieutenant-General William Caldwell, commander of the NATO training mission, said in the statement.

U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to announce next week a strategy that involves sending tens of thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan to quell a growing Taliban insurgency. A top priority for Obama's strategy is to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces to take over responsibility from US and NATO troops. Newly inaugurated President Hamid Karzai said Afghans would be able to take over security of the country in five years, a goal US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called "ambitious", but one that Washington would work towa
