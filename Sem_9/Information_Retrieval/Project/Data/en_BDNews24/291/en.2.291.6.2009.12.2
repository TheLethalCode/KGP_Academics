 Dhaka, Dec 02 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia is set to retain the post of chairperson of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) as none other sought to contest Wednesday, the last day for filing nomination paper. No one collected nomination papers other than Khaleda Zia for BNP's 'Chairperson Election  2009' , said RA Gani, BNP election commission returning officer, at the party's Naya Paltan office. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com that Khaleda's nomination paper was submitted to the returning officer at 4:30pm. Rizvi collected the nomination paper on behalf of Khaleda on Tuesday. Answering to queries from journalists RA Gani said: "If only one nomination paper is submitted by the deadline, then after scrutiny, if it is found valid, unofficially the candidate will declared elected. But the official declaration will be made at the party's national council on Dec 8, said Sanaullah Miah. Incidentally, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was also elected as chairperson of AL without any contest on July 24.
