 Kutubdia, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of fishermen, struggling for a living on Kutubdia Island, are not aware that the fast changing climate will make their lives even worse. Many people living here believe that the island in the Bay of Bengal, close to the southern resort town of Cox's Bazar, is safe, despite predictions that it could be underwater by 2050. The reality has already hit the area with the monumental concrete lighthouse built during the British colonial era going down. Erosion and rise in sea level have swallowed the light house and dwelling houses around it nearly five years back. "The island is blessed by the Auliah. It will never sink. I do not go to the cyclone shelters despite storm warnings. If I die, I would rather die at home. It is the almighty Allah who will decide our fate," Manjur Alam of the old lighthouse area told bdnews24.com. Irony is that half of Kutubdia island has already been vanished into the sea, said Jainul Abedin aged about 55. Pointing to the area into the sea he said: "Every year, a part of the island is being washed away by tides, storms and coastal waves." On Sunday, at the western part of the island, waves slammed against a graveyard during high tides. Children used to play in the area during low tide. Along with it, the sea took away fertile lands, households. But still the residents are clinging on to their profession for survival. A new lighthouse with modern facilities was built on the other side of the Kutubdia upazila in the 80s. Environmentalists fear that with the change in global climate, the island along with a portion of Bangladesh will go under water. But most people in this country are not aware or least bothered about the future of their homeland although there is a continuous debate over how to minimise the effect of the climate change, caused mainly by emission of carbon, released by mostly developed nations. They do not know of the conference to be held in Copenhagen on December 7-18. The affected people say they do not care about that. "If it is the will of god; the island will sink at a given time. Not before that," says an inhabitant. Sarwar Alam, 38, is now a pauper after losing his household, which stretched nearly one and a half acres, to the sea. Alam says his family of four is still surviving. But he is unsure of how long they will sustain. He thinks that the water level of the sea is rising. He said that the island is slowly disappearing into the sea. He believes that no one would come forward to assist the homeless if Kutubdia is completely washed away. Research officer of private organisation Coast Trust, Atiqul Islam informed bdnews24.com: "The island had an area of 250 square kilometres. In the past 100 years nearly 65 percent of the area has gone into the sea. Many residents have shifted to various urban areas." The organisation said that nearly 2700 people live in a square kilometre of the island and claimed that the island area shrank to 58 square kilometres between 1980 and 1990. More 100,000 people currently live on the Island. Fishing and agriculture are their main sources of living. Some also earn their living by extracting salt from shore. Rina Bala, 35, has been drying fish from the child hood. She said: "Have not heard that the Island will one day go under water. But have heard that it will go underwater if there is an earthquake.'' 76-year-old Manindra Jaladas was strolling on the beach. He said that he was fishing in these waters for nearly half a century. Sometime the sea swells up. He recalled the devastating cyclone of 1991 and said: "Many people left the island after their homes were destroyed. Sanaul Alam, assistant head teacher of the Dhurang Ideal High School on the island, termed these people as 'Environmental Refugees'. He said, "The residents of the world's most precarious island are unaware of the huge risks they are in. They do not even follow warning signals during storms and tidal waves. Huge awareness has to be created in this area." Sanaul proposed building of sufficient cyclone shelters. "During storms the people run for the faraway shelters. Absence of adequate shelters might lead to larger death tolls." Currently, there are six unions in the island. Most of them are affected by erosion. A survey by Bangladesh's Statistics Bureau revealed that there are records of 27 severe cyclones and tidal waves to hit during 1584-1969. The same number was recorded within 1970-1998. In the next 10 years, the frequency has increased. The coastal area stretching 654 kilometres from Khulna's Shyamnagar to Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya is under increasing threat of calamities due to climatic changes. bd
