 DURBAN, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England claimed a series victory after the fifth one-day cricket international against South Africa was called off due to persistent rain at Kingsmead on Friday. The match was abandoned at five p.m. local time (1500 GMT) without a ball being bowled. The outcome means that England secure the series 2-1, after the first match was also washed out, and become only the second country to win a bilateral one-day series in South Africa. Australia achieved series wins in the 1996/7 and 2001/2 season
