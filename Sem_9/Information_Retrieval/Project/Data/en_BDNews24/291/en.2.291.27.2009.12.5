 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) -- A poll of 15 nations, most of them in the developing world, including Bangladesh, finds that majorities of people want their governments to take steps to fight climate change, even if that entails high costs. The poll was carried out by the World Bank. It questioned 13,518 respondents in 15 nationsBangladesh, China, Egypt, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, Senegal, Turkey, the United States, and Vietnam. People canvassed hinted they would support public measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions and step up adaptation measures, such as they would support higher fuel efficiency standards for cars, preserving or expanding forests, and extending funding to vulnerable countries so they can develop hardier crops suited to more severe climates. "The poll's findings shed light on global attitudes at a particularly important moment: the run-up to the conference on climate change to be held December 7-18 in Copenhagen. Hearing from people in the developing world offers a new lens on this issue," says Katherine Sierra, World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development. Other key findings include public concern about climate change is high worldwide, but it's generally higher in developing countries. The public, particularly in developing countries, believe climate change is already having negative effects. In most countries, wealthy and poor alike, large majorities are willing to pay to fight climate change. Support for increased adaptation funding to poor countries is widespread worldwide. The poll also asked about helping poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change. Majorities say their countries "should contribute to international efforts to help poor countries deal with these climate-induced changes." Many developing countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Kenya, and Senegal express more than 90% support for acting in solidarity with other countries facing problems like their own. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a recent statement said negotiations toward a successor to the Kyoto Protocol are intensifying, and domestic climate policies being formed, ahead of a critical United Nations conference on climate change in Copenhagen scheduled for December 7-18. It said policymakers are also searching for new sources of sustainable growth to recover from the deepest economic crisis for decades and, in many cases, also the means to cope with severe fiscal pressures exacerbated by the crisis. The crisis has had major effects on the global economy, but these detract little from the urgent need to combat climate change, it added. IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss Kahn has said that the global economic crisis must not distract us from tackling the important issue of climate change. "Sustaining the recovery and putting in place effective climate change policies can be mutually reinforcing with the right policies implemented resolutely. "The IMF can assist in its areas of expertise to advise on policies and support countries that are most vulnerable to economic and climate challenges," he said. MARKET FAILURES The statement also finds that the market failures underlying the climate problemabove all, that polluters do not bear the full costs of emissionsare unaffected by the downturn. Current mitigation efforts are now generally acknowledged to be inadequate for meeting the economic, social and political problems climate change can create: even accounting for the effects of the crisis global emissions could rise by 40 percent against current levels by 2030, without further policy intervention. However, political focus on restoring economic prosperity could weaken the prospects for such measures. A cautious shift toward more aggressive carbon pricing need not impede the recovery. And currently more moderate carbon and energy prices, as well some potential for "green" fiscal stimulus measures, afford important opportunities that should not be overlooked, the IMF said.
