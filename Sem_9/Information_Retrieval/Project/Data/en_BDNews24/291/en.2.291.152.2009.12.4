 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun on Friday denied the arrest in Bangladesh of Arabinda Rajkhowa, the founder and chief of outlawed United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), as reported in the Indian media. "The information is not correct. He was not arrested in Bangladesh," the minister told reporters after addressing a function at Banani Bidya Niketan in the capital. The Indian media for the last few days have been reporting that Arabinda was arrested in Bangladesh on Monday and later handed over to the Indian authorities. Hindustan Times on Thursday said Bangladesh handed him over to the Indian authorities through Tripura border though there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. Arabinda was later taken to New Delhi. The report also said that his wife Kaberi Kachari and two sons had been placed under house arrest in Dhaka. The newspaper said Bangladesh also handed over Biswa Mohon Deb Barma, an activist of NLTF, another Indian insurgent group, to India. When asked about handing over the two people to the Indian authorities, Sahara said, "Why does the question of handover arise since no arrests took place on our territory?" Earlier, Bangladesh police too denied the arrest incident. Indian media last month claimed Bangladesh police had arrested two top ULFA leaders, Shaha Chowdhury and Chitraban Hazarika. After a few days, Indian police produced them before the court. On papers, they were arrested from the border areas. Secretary general of the outlawed organisation Anup Chetia is currently detained in a Bangladesh jail since his arrest in 1998. Sahara said necessary security measures will be put in place for the BNP national council on Dec 8. "We arrange security measures not only for the ruling party, but also for the opposition. Asked if the government could trace the fugitive Bangabandhu murder convicts, Sahara said, "It is not 'specifically' known where they are now. But we're looking to capture them. We must get them." bdnews24
