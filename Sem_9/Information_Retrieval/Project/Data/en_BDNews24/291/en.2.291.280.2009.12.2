<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tillakaratne Dishan struck his second century of the series and Angelo Mathews hit his second test fifty to power Sri Lanka to 366 for eight at the close on the opening day of the final test against India on Wednesday. Opener Dilshan slammed 109 and shared in three crucial partnerships to lead Sri Lanka's charge for a series-levelling victory after opting to bat first. Harbhajan Singh took four wickets and his spin partner Pragyan Ojha claimed two scalps to stall the visitors' progress after Dilshan provided Sri Lanka with a confident 93-run start with Tharanga Paranavitana (53). At the close, Mathews was unbeaten on 86 and Muttiah Muralitharan yet to get off the mark. Sri Lanka, who are yet to win a test on Indian soil since their first visit in 1982, trail 1-0 in the three-match series after losing the second test by an innings and 144 runs. Left-handed Paranavitana was fluent in his strokeplay as he recorded his first fifty on the tour before falling to Harbhajan. India hit back after lunch by dismissing skipper Kumar Sangakkara (18), Mahela Jayawardene (29) and Thilan Samaraweera (1) to leave Sri Lanka on 213 for four at tea. DILSHAN UNLUCKY Explosive Dilshan, who struck 10 fours and two sixes in his 11th test hundred, and Mathews shared in a 74-run stand before the opener was unlucky to be given out to Harbhajan. Television replays showed the ball had not hit the bat before popping to short-leg. Dilshan, who scored 112 in the drawn first test in Ahmedabad, was merciless on anything short as he lashed fast bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth for a six and a four and Harbhajan for successive boundaries. Tall Mathews used his reach to the spinners as he hit 13 fours and shared in a 67-run stand with Prasanna Jayawardene, who made a fighting 43 before driving uppishly at Ojha to be caught at mid-on. The tourists were on a commanding 117-1 at lunch but lost the advantage in the second session with Ojha dismissing a struggling Sangakkara, caught behind by Mahendra Dhoni. Jayawardene, who recorded his sixth double century in the first test, batted beautifully before his uppish hook off Sreesanth found the hands of Virender Sehwag at deep backward square leg. Then Samaraweera fell to Harbhajan, caught by Murali Vijay at short-leg. India are eyeing the opportunity to climb to the top of the official rankings for the first time. India, third in the world rankings behind leaders South Africa and Sri Lanka, can go top for the first time with a victory in Mumba
