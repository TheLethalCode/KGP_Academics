 THE HAGUE, Dec 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia told a UN court on Tuesday, at the start of hearings on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, that Kosovo's action was a "flagrant violation" of Serbia's territorial integrity. The International Court of Justice in The Hague is holding the hearings at the request of Serbia, Kosovo's former ruler, and will give an advisory opinion on the issue. A decade after NATO bombing ended a two-year war between Serbia and ethnic Kosovo Albanians, Serbian ambassador to France Dusan Batakovic told the court "Kosovo is the historic cradle of Serbia and ... one of the essential pillars of its identity." The envoy told the 15-judge panel he hoped the court's ruling would provide scope for talks with Kosovo about its future status and contribute to "peace and stability". Serbian officials say they want to see Kosovo as the country's southern province with wide autonomy, something Pristina rejected in 2006-07 UN-sponsored talks. The United States and most other Western nations have recognised Kosovo's independence, but Serbia rejected it, as did its ally Russia, which fears it could set a dangerous precedent for separatist movements. Malcolm Shaw, a lawyer representing Serbia, warned the court that its ruling is being watched with "great apprehension" by other states also facing separatist pressures. "If on Earth there was be a single territory where secession would not be permitted, it would be Kosovo," said Marcelo Kohen, another lawyer representing Serbia. Spain, which is grappling with its own separatist movements, has already indicated that it will not recognise an independent Kosovo. Representatives from Kosovo speak later on Tuesday, followed by eight more days of statements by 29 countries. "We can live together with Serbia only as two independent countries," Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Rame Manaj told Reuters on Monday. "Serbia deported half the population of Kosovo, killed and massacred more than 12,000 people ... and because of all that we declared independence," he said. PIVOTAL HEARINGS The UN Security Council, noting a "grave humanitarian situation", adopted Resolution 1244 in 1999 to instal a UN administration in Kosovo and a ceasefire monitored by NATO troops. The resolution also called for autonomy and self-government in Kosovo pending a political settlement, while also recognising the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. Serbia's lawyers argued on Tuesday that the resolution was binding and prohibited unilateral action by Kosovo. Observers say a ruling in Kosovo's favour would lead more countries to recognise its independence, while an adverse opinion could push it into negotiating a settlement with Serbia. Kosovo's independence has been recognised by 63 countries, 22 of them European Union member states, but it will need many more before it can become a full UN member state. The court is due to hold nine days of hearings and to give its non-binding but influential opinion in several mon
