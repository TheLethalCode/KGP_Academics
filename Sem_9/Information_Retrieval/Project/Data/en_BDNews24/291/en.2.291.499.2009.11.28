 Savar, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)--BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi says 'conspirators' attacked his garments factory, vandalised and looted assets. Murshedi, who owns Envoy Group, told reporters at Savar on Friday there were no workers' rage for wages and allowances. "The workers demonstrated because they were granted holiday for six days although they asked for eight days," he said, visiting his three factories situated at Jamgara, near Dhaka Export Processing Zone. Sub-inspector of Ashulia Police Station Aiyub Mia told bdnews24.com a security officer of Envoy Group filed a case Friday evening. The case said the Group faced a loss of Tk 3.50 crore due to the workers' rampage, vandalism and looting. However, Murshedi on Thursday said the workers went on the rampage as they demanded a nine-day Eid vacation and factory authorities refused. "There is no salary or bonuses unpaid. We paid workers all dues last Tuesday," the chief of the apparel industry spokesman said. Murshedi on Friday said the 'conspirators' took advantage of the workers' rage and attacked the factories. He complained that the attackers looted Tk 50 lakh, kept for 'paying salaries', from the volt. They also set fire to the CCTVs and records of the workers, he added. He asked authorities to punish the perpetrators for creating unrest in the sector. Workers of the three readymade garment factories of Envoy Fashions Ltd, Envoy Designs Ltd and Manta Apparel Ltd on Thursday ransacked the factory premises, dragged out equipment including computers and furniture before setting them ablaze on the road. They also besieged the Dhaka-Aricha highway, claiming late payment of salaries and Eid allowances, which caused holiday traffic to mount on one of the major arteries out of the capital. Two workers, Saiful Islam and Rabeya Begum, told bdnews24.com that the demonstrations began in the afternoon when workers heard they would not be paid as promised on Thursday, the last business day ahead of Eid. bdnews2
