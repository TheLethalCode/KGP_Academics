 GSTAAD, Switzerland, Dec 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Film director Roman Polanski was released on bail into house arrest in his Swiss chalet on Friday, following his arrest after fleeing US sentencing for unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. A Reuters journalist saw Polanski in one of two cars which swept past some 200 waiting reporters and into the garage of Polanski's luxury home in the upmarket ski resort of Gstaad. "Roman Polanski was today released from custody pending extradition and transferred to Gstaad, where he is under house arrest at his chalet," the Swiss government said in a statement. "Polanski has undertaken not to leave his house and property at any time." Polanski was released from prison after posting $4.5 million bail, on condition he wore an electronic monitoring tag, surrendered his identity and travel documents and did not leave his house.

The Swiss Justice Department is expected to decide on Polanski's possible extradition within weeks but he could appeal, potentially dragging out the dispute for months. The filmmaker had been moved from a prison near Zurich to an undisclosed location, ready for transfer to the exclusive resort, which is also the winter home of French singer Johnny Halliday and Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone. The small Alpine town has been popular with celebrities for decades and was favoured by actor Audrey Hepburn, jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald and wartime British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Polanski's films include "The Pianist" in 2002 for which he won an Academy Award, "Rosemary's Baby", "Repulsion" and "Knife in the Wat
