 Syed Nahas Pasha, London London, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)The biggest ever climate change demonstration in UK history will place in London Saturday with tens of thousands of people flooding to the capital to march in 'The Wave' and call for the government to take urgent and effective action. People from all over the country dressed in blue will march from Grosvenor Square to Big Ben, calling on the UK government to settle for nothing less than a climate deal in Copenhagen to prevent dangerous global warming and protect the world's poorest who are already feeling its effects. They are also appealing to the UK government to increase its emissions cut targets, which still fall short. The UK's current ambition for an EU-wide emissions cut of 30 per cent within the next ten years would at best only give us a 50/50 chance staying below the global warming danger level of 2 degrees Centigrade, say environmentalists. The Wave has been arranged by Stop Climate Chaos (SCC), a coalition of NGOs and organisations in the UK, including Oxfam, WWF, The Women's Institute, Greenpeace and the NUS. It is also being supported by the Co-operative Society. The event comes two days before the crucial UN climate talks begin in the Danish capital, where a climate deal must be made to tackle the biggest crisis the world has ever faced. SCC director Ashok Sinha said: "Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life will converge in London to show they care passionately about climate change. "We will call on PM Gordon Brown to make Copenhagen count by committing rich countries to reduce their emissions by at least 40% in the next ten years, finally putting the right sort of money on the table to help poor countries, and urgently starting the process of decarbonising our energy supply. With bold leadership at home, Mr Brown can help inspire a fair, effective and binding international deal at Copenhagen." Unme Kulsum, an environmental scientist from Bangladesh and climate co-ordinator with CAFOD partner Prodipan will also be there. She said: "Communities in Bangladesh are aware about the consequences of climate change. They are raising their houses, strengthening roofs and are organised, trained and capable. But sometimes their efforts seem like using a single straw to stop the tide. They are trying to protect themselves from climate change but the problem is big. CO2 emissions must also be cut if they are to hold the pace of climate change." The Wave will follow a morning of separate events throughout London. Activities begin at Grosvenor Square from 12 noon. The finale will come as Big Ben strikes at 3pm, when thousands in front of the Houses of Parliament, on Lambeth and Westminster bridges and on the South Bank will wave and cheer. Oxfam chief executive Barbara Stocking said: "The UK government must fight for a comprehensive, fair and binding deal at Copenhagen - that is our demand today and we expect it to be fulfilled. They must return home with a strong, effective climate deal both for our own sakes in the UK and for the millions of poor people already suffering from the effects of climate change around the world." Ruth Davis, head of climate change policy at the RSPB, said: "The natural world is under grave threat from climate change. Up to half the world's species could be at risk of extinction if global temperatures rise by five-degrees. "The Wave is a chance to show our leaders people care about climate change and about the environment we all depend on. Let's get out there and make sure they leave for the talks with that message ringing in their ears." Paul Brannen, head of campaigns for Christian Aid said: 'Climate change will destroy poor countries first, then it will come for the rich. Copenhagen is our best opportunity to achieve a fair and ambitious climate deal. The Wave is the best opportunity for the people of Britain to play their part in achieving that deal.' The Wave will also take place in Glasgow, Belfast and Dublin.
