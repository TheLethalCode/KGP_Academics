<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun has asked members of the government to be careful in commenting on the matter of bringing back Bangabandhu's killers, currently at large in different countries. "Our initiative to bring back Bangabandhu's killers has not ceased. A 'red alert' has been issued by the Interpol for the fugitive killers," Sahara told reporters at the secretariat on Tuesday. But, she went on to say: "Disclosing information about bringing them back to Bangladesh is not right, as they may get the chance to move from country to country to evade capture." The home minister said the convicts are adopting a technique of "fast changing locations". Answering a query, Sahara said: "We must bring them back through mutual agreement with the countries that have no extradition treaties." Law minister Shafique Ahmed said Monday that Canada had agreed to deport Noor Chowdhury, one of 12 former army officers convicted and sentenced to death for the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He gave details of the decision, telling reporters Canadian authorities had seized Noor Chowdhury's passport for residing illegally in the country, and had rejected his applications for a residency permit and asylum. Returning to the country after a 10-day visit to Canada, the law minister said Chowdhury currently had to report to the police there once every week. He also said Chowdhury was trying to appeal against the Canadian decision. Answering a question on the whereabouts of Shariful Haque Dalim, another fugitive convict in the case, Shafique said, "I have learnt that he was in Canada for a while. But he has reportedly left the country." The minister said that the foreign ministry was trying to bring back all the fugitive convicted killers. Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujib was killed, along with most of his family members, on Aug 15 1975, just four years after the country gained independence from Pakistan. On Nov 19 this year, the Supreme Court, in a long-awaited judgement on appeals by five convicted former officers, upheld their death sentences in the murder case. Bazlul Huda, Syed Faruk Khan, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed had appealed to have their death penalties commuted from behind bars. Another six convicts also sentenced to death in the caseAbdur Rashid, Shariful Haq Dalim, Noor Chowdhury, Moslemuddin, Rashed Chowdhury and Abdul Majedare fugitives. bdnew
