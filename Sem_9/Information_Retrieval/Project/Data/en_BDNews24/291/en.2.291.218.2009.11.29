 Bhola, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)Rescue vessel MV Hamza arrived at Nazimpur in Bhola Sunday morning as the death toll from the capsize of the MV Coco-4 climbed to 40 with the recovery of five more bodies. Of them, three were women and one was a child, Lalmohon Upazila Parishad chairman Nazrul Islam said. Some 25 passengers are still reported missing. The Lalmohon-bound launch from Dhaka, carrying more than triple its capacity with over 1,500 passengers, overturned late on Friday at Nizapur terminal, some 40 kilomtres from the district town. Tragedy greeted families in Bhola on Eid day as 35 bodies, most of them women and children, were recovered on Saturday. The Hamza, a rescue and salvage vessel of Bangladesh Inter Water Transport Corporation, took more than 24 hours to arrive on the scene from bordering district Barisal. Officials said the river was low at this time of year, which caused poor navigability. bdne
