 Dhaka, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and India may sign two more agreements, on power and infrastructure, during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's New Delhi visit this month, in addition to three deals on security all ready for inking. "At least two more agreements are likely to be signed," Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, told reporters Thursday following a meeting with foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes. Chakravarty said he called on Quayes to discuss the itinerary of Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit. The high commissioner, however, did not give further details of the two agreements. A foreign ministry spokesperson told bdnews24.com Wednesday that the two neighbouring countries may sign memoranda of understanding: one on power and another on Bangladesh rail and road infrastructure projects with Indian funding. India in September agreed to sell electricity to Bangladesh. Such a deal would stipulate construction of cross border distribution lines between the two countries among other related issues.
