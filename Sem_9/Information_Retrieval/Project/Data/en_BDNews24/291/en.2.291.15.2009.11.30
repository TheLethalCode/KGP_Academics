 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia has decided to maintain its eight-month freeze on taking in Bangladeshi workers, reports said Monday. Prime minister Najib Tun Razak told his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina that that the last year's ban on import of Bangladesh workers would not be lifted as yet, according to Malaysian state media Bernama. The two met on the sidelines of the Commonwealth summit in Trinidad and Tobago. However, overseas labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com on Monday: "I have heard of such news first time." He also said it seemed highly unusual that "the prime minister of one country would say 'no' directly to a request of another prime minister". Hossain said: "As far as I know, Sheikh Hasina wanted the Malaysian government look after the Bangladeshi workers there and also to take in more workers if possible." "The Malaysian prime minister is reported to have told our prime minister that he would do his best," Hossain added. Malaysia in March cancelled the approved work visas for 55,000 Bangladeshi workers, who had not yet arrived, citing fears of layoffs amid the global recession. Dhaka has been pushing for resolution of the ban and the cancellation of the visas. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and Hossain were optimistic about a solution after a visit to Kuala Lumpur earlier this year. In January, the southeast Asian nation also banned the hiring of all new foreigners in manufacturing and services sectors after a report forecast 45,000 Malaysians were at risk of losing their jobs. The country relies heavily on manpower in the construction and farming sectors which mostly employ workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. State news agency Bernama also reported on Monday that the prime minister's statement had caused confusion for the Malaysian Trades Union Congress. It said the MTUC was confused and wanted its government to clarify whether the importation of Bangladesh workers into Malaysia was banned or temporarily frozen.
