 Hong Kong, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- A rare five-carat 'vivid pink' diamond ring broke the world record at Christie's jewellry auction in Hong Kong, selling for $10.8 million dollars at $2 million a carat. A rare, 5-carat pink diamond was auctioned off for a record $10.8 million in Hong Kong on Tuesday, putting some shine back into the world's rare and large stones market.

The price smashed a previous record set 15 years ago in Geneva for a 19.66-carat stone, which went for $7.4 million. Also from the same private collection, a 16.65-carat Sapphire ring sold for over $2 million and a 9.03-carat oval vivid yellow diamond ring sold for almost $1.3 million. Christie's auction comes as a sagging dollar drives some investors to convert currencies into gold and other assets. "I'm not sure they are seeing it as an investment. I think they see it as a way to put money away, number one. And number two, everybody is very tense and worried about the financial, the state of the economy," says Curiel. "Will there be inflation in Europe and in the USA because of all the money that has been printed to pay for the debt? And some may think it is better to own a five-carat pink diamond or a ten-carat sapphire than a lot of cash in your account." Overall, the jewellry sale made $48 million, the biggest jewellry auction in two years and the biggest ever in A
