 PERM, Russia, Dec 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 101 people were killed and 140 injured on Friday when hundreds of people stampeded out of a packed Russian nightclub after fireworks sparked a blaze, the Emergencies Ministry said. Clubbers rushed for the doors of the Lame Horse nightclub in the centre of Perm, a city of 1.2 million near the Ural mountains, after a firework show went disastrously wrong at about 11:15 p.m. (8:15 p.m BST). "The number of dead is 101 people, 140 people are receiving medical help ... 85 are seriously injured," Interfax quoted a local health official as saying.

Witnesses quoted by local media said a stray firework sparked a fire during a stage show at the 500 square metre (5400 square ft) club, prompting panic as hundreds of clubbers rushed for the exits. "I've just spoken to a friend who was there," said a posting on popular forum www.teron.ru, which serves the Perm region. "He says there was no blast, everything flared up from the fireworks. Many people were cut off from the exit and suffocated as a result," the posting said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the formation of a government commission to deal with the incident. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu, Health Minister Tatyana Golikova and Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev to the scene to coordinate rescue effo
