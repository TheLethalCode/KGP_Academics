 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  The city was off to a slow start on Monday following the three-day Eid break. Government offices and commercial banks opened again, though with poor attendance, said staff who were back to work on the day. Many employees were taking extended holidays, having travelled long distances to district homes to spend the holiday with families. The secretariat was seen in full swing, however, where finance minister AMA Muhith, home minister Sahara Khatun and law minister Shafique Ahmed, among others, attended their offices in the morning and exchanged Eid greetings with their staff. Sahara chaired a meeting with the heads of law enforcing agencies at noon and later expressed her satisfaction to reporters on the law and order situation over the Eid period. bdnews24.
