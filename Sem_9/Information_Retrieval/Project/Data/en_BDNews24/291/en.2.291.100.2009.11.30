<TEXT>
 Bhola, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  At least 76 people died, while scores remain unaccounted for, after a small overloaded launch carrying home going passengers partially capsized the night before Eid on the Tentulia river in Bhola district. Another twenty bodies were recovered Monday from the site of the accident after they floated to the surface of the river, three days after the accident. Fifty-six bodies were retrieved over the previous two days. Of the victims, at least 22 were children. The exact number of missing is still not clear, while a fire service official said there were no more bodies left inside the hull of the launch. The official, Mohammad Shahabuddin, told reporters the divers had searched the launch thoroughly. "They could not find any more after searching in the waters around the launch too." The rescue operation was suspended at 4:30pm for the day. District commissioner Mesbahul Islam told reporters they were planning how to continue further operations. Deputy shipping secretary Baitul Amin Bhuiyan, one of the members of a five-member probe committee formed earlier, told reporters they had a list of 103 missing people from the district administration. Of these, only 22 bodies have been recovered, while others should be deemed as "still missing", he said. However, the district administration said Sunday only 50 passengers were unaccounted for. The committee was reconstituted Monday by adding two more members. Joint chief of the shipping ministry Jayanta Kumar Nandi was made the convenor of the newly formed probe body. Committee members visited the spot in the morning and talked to the surviving 12 passengers of the launch and the local people. The accident occurred late on Friday when the MV Coco-4 was trying to anchor at Nazirpur terminal in Lalmohon, some 40 kilometres from Bhola district town. It was carrying more than triple its capacity, with over 1,500 passengers, from Dhaka to Lalmohon ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. The vessel, crowded from hull to decks with people heading home to celebrate with families, began tipping with the weight of disembarking passengers and partially sank, according to eye witnesses. Salvage vessel MV Hamza reached the spot on Sunday morning to right the sunken ferry and ease rescue work. Police, divers of BIWTA and fire service men have been engaged in rescue operations since the early hours of Saturday. Thirty-five bodies, mostly women and children, were recovered on Eid day, Saturday. Another 21 bodies were retrieved from the hull of MV Coco-4 on Sunday after the Hamza re-floated the partially capsized ferry. Hundreds of people gathered on the bank of the river throughout the holiday period, anxiously waiting for their relatives who were on board the launch. They rushed to the dead bodies as they were being retrieved, fearing the worst. Hamela Khatun of Moheshkhali village told bdnews24.com Monday: "My son Salauddin is still missing." She said Salauddin along with three friends were returning home. "All who were with him survived the accident. But he is still missing," she said. Like others, Jasmin of Charfashion was still desperately searching for her brother Kamal. The unlucky families who suffered losses wailed over their dead ones. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, now in Port of Spain attending a Commonwealth summit, expressed her grief Saturday over the launch disaster and ordered speedy rescue operations and investigation into the accident. The president also expressed his sorrow and condolences for the grieving families. Three committees have been formed to report on aspects of the launch disaster. BIWTA on Sunday also formed a five-strong body to investigate the incident, its chairman Abdul Malek told reporters. The district commissioner said a three-member committee has been formed on behalf of the district administration. They have been asked to submit a report within three days. bdnews24.com/
