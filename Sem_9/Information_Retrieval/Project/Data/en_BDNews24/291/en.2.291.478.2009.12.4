 Kuakata, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of people, including lawmakers, formed a two-mile long human chain by the shoreline at Kuakata on Friday to raise awareness of climate change ahead Monday's Copenhagen summit. Kuakata has been selected for the campaign because it is one of the areas going to bear the worst of the climate change in Bangladesh, said ASM Firoz, convener of the Parliament Members Forum on Climate Change, Bangladesh, the organiser of the event. An air of spontaneity and enthusiasm was pervading the area from the morning due to the event that started at midday and lasted an hour. Twelve members of parliament, climate experts, government officials, upazila and union parishad chairmen, students, teachers, NGO officials and common people took part in it. "People of the coastal areas have no way out. Salinity has threatened fish farms and agriculture in Barguna. The people there will not only be rendered jobless, their health will be at risk," said Manjur Morshed Khan, executive director of the Coastal Health Advancement and Nutrition Centre in Barguna. "Bangladesh is on the top of the list of the affected countries," said Jatiya Party secretary general Ruhul Amin Haoladar. This human chain supports the resolute stand of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the international arena to counter climate change, he said. Though the organisers said some opposition MPs will take part in the human chain none of them turned up. Local MP and state minister for water resources Mahbubur Rahman was not also present. "While the country faces grave threats due to rising sea level our politicians are not united on the issue. But all of us will suffer for this," said Abu Naser Khan, chairman of Poribesh Bachao Andolon, to bdnews24.com. Recently, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina demanded Tk 70,000 crore as emergency assistance for Bangladesh from the developed countries blaming them for the climate change. She made the plea at a function of European Development Day in Sweden. She also proposed to form an international committee under the supervision of United Nations to counter climate change due to global warming. The forum will take up further activities to compensate affected Bangladeshis and increase mass awareness, said Firoz. b
