 Dhaka, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and India may sign two more agreements, on power and infrastructure, during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's New Delhi visit this month, in addition to three deals on security all ready for inking. "At least two more agreements are likely to be signed," Pinak Ranjan Chakravary, Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, told reporters Thursday following a meeting with foreign secretary Mohamed Miajrul Quayes. Chakravarty said he called on Quayes to discuss the itinerary of Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit. The high commissioner, however, did not give further details of the two agreements. A foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com Wednesday that the neighbouring countries may sign two memoranda of understanding, one on power and another on Bangladesh rail and road infrastructure projects with Indian funding. India in September offered to sell electricity to Bangladesh, for which an agreement is required on construction of cross border distribution lines between the two countries among other related issues. THREE DRAFT DEALS READY ON SECURITY The home secretaries of Bangladesh and India finalised three draft deals on cobating cross-border crime and terrorism Wednesday after three-day talks in Delhi. The agreements, ready for signing are on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, on Combating International Terrorism, Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking and on Transfer of Sentenced Persons. Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh are set to ink the agreements during the former's visit to India from Dec 19. If the two sides can finalise the new draft agreements in time, the two premiers will also sign those, said the foreign ministry official. WATER SHARING Meanwhile, a delegation of the Indian water resources ministry is expected to hold talks with Bangladesh counterparts any day to discuss water-related issues between the two countries. Foreign ministry officials say the two sides will discuss water sharing of the common river Teesta at the three-day talks in Dhaka. Dhaka has been pressing Delhi for an agreement on sharing of the Teesta's water during the prime minister's visit. Bangladesh's largest irrigation project is sited on the Teesta, to water 750,000 hectares of cultivable land in the rice-producing greater Rangour region that is solely dependent on the river.
