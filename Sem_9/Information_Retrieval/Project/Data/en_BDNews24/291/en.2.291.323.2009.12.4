 MUMBAI, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck a spectacular hundred after Virender Sehwag had fallen seven runs short of a third test triple century on the third day of the third and final test against Sri Lanka on Friday. Dhoni struck 100 not out in India's record 726 for nine declared in reply to Sri Lanka's 393 as they bid for a victory that would secure their spot at the top of the test rankings. Sri Lanka were 11 for no wicket in their second innings at the close. Sehwag, who resumed on 284, was caught and bowled by Muttiah Muralitharan for 293 before Dhoni (100 not out), Sachin Tendulkar (53) and Vangipurappu Laxman (62) helped India record their highest test innings total. Muralitharan, playing in his final overseas test, finished with 4-195 while his spin partner Rangana Herath took three for 240 in difficult conditions on a day when Sri Lanka were let down by poor catching.

The skipper put on 56 for the last wicket with bowler Pragyan Ojha, who remained not out on five. Wicketkeeper-batsman Dhoni reached his third test century off 154 deliveries with a fifth six off Herath as India continued to torment Sri Lanka. Sehwag, only the third batsman to score two triple centuries after Australia's Don Bradman and West Indian Brian Lara, had shared in double century stands with opener Murali Vijay (87) and Dravid on the second day to put India in command. India hold a 1-0 lead in the series after they won the second test by an innings and 144 runs. The first test ended in a dra
