 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Muslims around the country celebrated Eid-ul- Azha on Saturday with prayers and sacrifice, although tragedy struck in Bhola as a launch disaster killed at least 35 people, many of them women and children. The day began with millions of Muslims offering prayers at mosques and eidgahs throughout the country for peace and prosperity. The main Eid congregation of the country was held at the National Eidgah in the capital at 9:00am , attended by President Zillur Rahman among others. The prayers were followed by the sacrificing of animals. Islam marks its second largest festival with a three-day holiday. The festival of sacrifice represents Abraham's obedience to God and willingness to offer his own son. Families slaughter animals and donate the cuts to the needy. MESSAGES OF PEACE President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition chief Khaleda Zia issued Eid messages of peace and prosperity for the day. The president exchanged Eid greetings at Bangabhaban on Saturday, with political leaders, heads of the armed forces and top civil and military officials, diplomats and emient personalities. In an Eid message, he said, "We have to reflect the great lesson of the sacrifice of Eid-ul-Azha in our thought and work to build a peaceful and tolerant society." The prime minister, in a message ahead of her departure for a Commonwealth summit in Trinidad, called on all to work for people's welfare from their respective positions and build a "disparity-free, happy and rich Bangladesh imbued with the spirit of Eid-ul-Azha". Opposition leader Khaleda Zia said also stressed the prime lesson of Eid-Ul-Azha as sacrifice of self interest and dedication to the welfare of the humanity. "Our duty is to get engaged in establishing peace and harmony in society by avoiding envy, spite, greed and anger," she said. MILLIONS JOIN IN PRAYER Millions across the country began their day with Eid-ul-Azha prayers for peace. Huge preparations were taken for the thousands of Eid congregations or Jamaats held up and down the country on Saturday morning. Arrangements were made for 360 Eid prayer congregations in the capital alone. Specials steps were also taken to ensure security of the large crowds during the Eid celebrations. Some 2,500 extra RAB personnel were deployed on Dhaka streets and another 4,500 countrywide. Peace descended on capital Dhaka as huge numbers of residents left the city for the break, and Eid celebrations left streets free of the usual traffic, crowds, noise and pollution. TRAGIC NOTE For the thousands who scrambled to get out of the capital, it was a different story, as they battled through dense holiday traffic to get home in time to celebrate with family. Anwar Kamal, a superintendent of highway police, told bdnews24.com the number of vehicles had risen five to six fold on the roads causing traffic miseries. Rivers too were crowded, with many vessels carrying passengers far above capacity. The crowded highways and overloaded vehicles led to tragedies that marred the Eid holiday for many families. At least 21 people were killed and scores were injured in road accidents in different districts in the 36 hours up to Saturday midday. Families in Bhola learned of another tragedy in the early hours of Eid day. The bodies of at least 35 women and children were retrieved Saturday from a Lalmohon-bound launch that partially capsized the previous night at Nazirpur, some 40 kilometres from Bhola town. Officials said most of the victims were from Charfashion and Lalmohan upazilas in the district. TANNERS LOOKS FOR EID BONUS The hub-bub of cattle markets rose to a peak on Friday as last minute buyers rushed to purchase sacrificial cattle. The festival of sacrifice meets some 80 percent of the demand for hides by the tannery industries. The leather industry, badly hit by global recession, was looking to shake-off the lull with Eid-Ul-Azha this year. Banks were offering the sector more loans over the period to help recovery. Three state-owned banks are disbursing over Tk 400 crore in loans to help the industry process the raw hides produced from the sacrifice of millions of animals. Private sector banks were also offering special loan facilities. Bangladesh's leather and leather products are among its major export items. bdnews24.com/
