 PARIS, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona and Argentina forward Lionel Messi was awarded the 2009 Ballon D'Or, French magazine France Football said on its website (www.francefootball.fr) on Tuesday. The 22-year-old became the first Ballon D'Or winner from Argentina, eclipsing runner-up and last year's winner Cristiano Ronaldo by a record 240-point margin. The award's 96 jurors gave Messi 473 points out of a possible 480, a near unanimous verdict, the magazine said. The win caps a brilliant year for the soft-spoken left-footer, who helped Barcelona to a Champions League title with nine goals, as well as bagging six in the King's Cup and 23 in the league. The gong, formerly known as the European Footballer of the Year award, was voted on by journalists from across the world.
