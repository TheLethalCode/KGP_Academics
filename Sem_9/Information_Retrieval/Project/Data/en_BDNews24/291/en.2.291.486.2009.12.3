 BRUSSELS, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Washington's NATO allies will face pressure to commit more troops and money to supplement President Barack Obama's troop increase in Afghanistan at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers starting on Thursday. European leaders were quick to offer verbal support on Wednesday to Obama's Afghanistan strategy, which includes sending 30,000 more US troops to join the fight against a Taliban insurgency. But they have been in less of a hurry to commit new forces to an uncertain military campaign that is increasingly unpopular at home because of rising casualties. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Wednesday he expected US allies to provide at least 5,000 extra troops and possibly a few thousand more -- short of the 10,000 troops and trainers Pentagon officials had sought. NATO officials also said about 1,500 of the 5,000 would be election reinforcements sent in earlier this year, and the Netherlands and Canada plan to withdraw combat forces of 2,100 and 2,800 in 2010 and 2011 respectively. US officials say Washington is now seeking up to 7,000 more troops from allies to supplement the US increase. A senior US official said the United States had put forward its views on what it believed other countries were capable of providing, either militarily or financially. "The decision on whether they will is up to them," he said. "We expect that other allies will look very seriously at how they can contribute to that effort." US EXPECTS MORE FROM ALLIES Referring to Dutch and Canadian withdrawal plans, the US official said: "This is the time to think about how we can do better, and perhaps do more, not the time to figure out how we can do less." US Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke said he hoped for continued Dutch support. A NATO diplomat said it was hoped the Dutch and Canadians could be persuaded to keep troops, perhaps as trainers for Afghan forces. Britain, which has the second largest troop contingent in the war zone, plans to boost its commitment by 500 to 10,000, and NATO officials said others that have announced plans to send more troops were Georgia (900), Poland (600) and Slovakia (250). The response from elsewhere has been cautious. Germany has signaled a willingness to do more police training but said it could not commit more troops before a strategy review early next year. France said on Monday it did not plan to send more troops but President Nicolas Sarkozy responded to Obama's speech by saying it would look at helping to train Afghan forces. Sarkozy said he would review his position after the NATO meeting and a U.N.-sponsored conference in London on January 28. Italy said it would send more troops, but declined to give numbers or a timetable, while Denmark said it would discuss the matter internally after the NATO meeting and the Czech Republic said it would consider sending 100 soldiers. Portugal is keeping its pledge made earlier this year to send 150 troops from its "rapid deployment" force to join 100 military trainers in Afghanistan, Defense Minister Augusto Santos Silva said. The reinforcements set out next month. Albania will send its first 35 combat troops, as well as 50 trainers and other military personnel to join 250 already in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on Wednes
