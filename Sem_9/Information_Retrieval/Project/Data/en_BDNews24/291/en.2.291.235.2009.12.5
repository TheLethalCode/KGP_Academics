 MUMBAI, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An India victory over Sri Lanka on Sunday and first place in the test rankings for the first time will be the culmination of an 18-month campaign, India coach Gary Kirsten said. Sri Lanka need 60 runs to make India bat again with just four wickets in hand going into the final day of the third test. A 2-0 series victory would put India on top of the world rankings. "I think it will be great. It is certainly something we aspired to right back 18 months ago before we started against Australia," Kirsten told reporters on Saturday. "We wanted to become the best test team in the world. That will be a great achievement for this team," said the former South Africa batsman who succeeded Australian Greg Chappell as coach. India, who lead the three-match series 1-0, are third behind top-ranked South Africa and Sri Lanka in the rankings but close enough to leapfrog both if they win the series 2-0. India have recorded series victories over Australia, England and New Zealand and drawn with South Africa during the past 18 months. "A lot of credit goes to the players in this team," Kirsten added. "They have all stood up to be counted at various times in these last 18 months, for a very powerful top-seven batting lineup and the bowlers have obviously on their day done the job they needed to. I am very happy from that perspective
