 MUMBAI, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Virender Sehwag said he knew a big score was within his grasp in the series after thumping an unbeaten 284 in the final test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. The opener hit the second fastest double test century to put India in command and is just 16 runs away from becoming the first batsman to score three test triple centuries. Sehwag shared in double century stands with Murali Vijay (87) and Rahul Dravid (62 not out) to guide India to 443 for one in reply to Sri Lanka's first-innings 393 at stumps on day two. "In the last test in Kanpur i missed it," he said. "This time I didn't want to...I was hitting only the bad balls." Sehwag scored 131 in the first innings in Kanpur which India won to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series after the opening test had ended in a draw. "In the last two tests i gave a couple of chances. This time I didn't want to give that chance," he said of his spectacular 239-ball knock studded with 40 fours and seven sixes. Sehwag, who has hit three of the four fastest double hundreds, reached his double century in 168 deliveries --- New Zealand's Nathan Astle holds the record for the fastest in 153 balls ---- and passed the 6,000-run mark in test cricket. "After lunch we stepped it up. I was seeing the ball very well, so I thought let me bat the way I know I'll do better than others," he said. India plundered 351 in the final two sessions. "It is a good track to bat on," Sehwag said after his onslaught. Sehwag was severe on master spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who is playing his final overseas test after announcing he would retire from this form of the game at the end of next year. The world record holder for most wickets in both test and one-day cricket conceded 119 runs off 20 runs without taking a wicket. "Murali is a big challenge to face. Against Murali, you have to attack otherwise he will dominate. So i decided to dominate, that is why he is on the backfoot," Sehwag said after taking 78 runs off the bowle
