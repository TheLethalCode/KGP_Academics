 DURBAN, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn could miss the fifth and final one-dayer against England on Friday due to a hamstring injury. Steyn was hurt in the third match and sat out the fourth game which England won by seven wickets to take a 2-1 series lead. The opening game was washed out by rain. "For us the priority is the test series and we would never compromise Dale's chances of being 100 percent fit for the first test (in Centurion) by playing him on Friday," South Africa coach Mickey Arthur told a news conference on Tuesday.
