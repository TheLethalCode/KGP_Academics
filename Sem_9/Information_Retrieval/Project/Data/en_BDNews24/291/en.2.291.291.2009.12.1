<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Metropolitan Police have launched a weeklong promotional campaign to introduce new traffic lanes in the capital to ease congestion and create discipline on the streets. DMP commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque inaugurated the programme at Police Headquarters Tuesday. The programme includes publicity through media, announcements by mikes, posters and training sessions for transport owners and workers. Dhaka city drivers had new automated traffic lights from Nov 21 on an experimental basis at more than 50 intersections across the capital. The new lane system is being similarly introduced on a weeklong preliminary basis. Haque said from Dec 8, however, drivers violating traffic light or lane rules will be fined a minimum of Tk 1,000 and get a three-month ban on their licence. Regarding the reasons behind severe traffic gridlock in the city, the commissioner said: "Violation of traffic laws, lack of adequate roads, infrastructure problems and unplanned urbanisation are the major reasons." He said the new lane system would require private cars, microbuses and jeeps to drive along the furthest right lane. Buses, trucks and covered vans would use the middle lane, and auto-rickshaws, human haulers and tempos will use the left-most lane. According to the new rules, drivers will not be able to change lanes whenever they want and overtaking will be banned too. "Parking here and there is also prohibited from now on, and buses will only stop at specific spots," said the DMP chief. Owners and workers of different transports and journalists attended the campaign launch programme. bdn
