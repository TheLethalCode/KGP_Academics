 Dhaka, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com)  EU-Bangladesh relations will remain "unchanged", the head of the European Union delegation in Dhaka said Tuesday as the Lisbon Treaty came into force marking what is described as a new era for the 27-nation bloc. Delegation head Stefan Frowein said the EU's support will remain unchanged on climate change, trade and development activities. The EU remains Bangladesh's top trading partner, taking more than half its exports. It has also been a supporter of Bangladesh's climate adaptation plans. Frowein said the bloc would continue to back Bangladesh on the international stage. Of 27 member states, eightUK, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands Spain and Swedenhave diplomatic missions in Dhaka. Frowein assured continued visa support by EU member countries, and said Schengen visas would be introduced gradually in future for Bangladeshis to visit Europe. Top EU leaders marked the start of the "new era" with celebrations, fireworks and speeches in the Portuguese capital on Tuesday. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the Lisbon Treaty symbolised a "free and democratic" Europe. But critics say the treaty will hand too many national powers to Brussels. Institutional changes are now under way following ratification of the treaty by all 27 member states, eight years after the EU started negotiations. It is designed to streamline decision-making and give the EU greater influence in world affairs. It creates two new posts - President of the European Council and a High Representative for Foreign Affairs. The treaty overcame its final hurdle when the Czech Republic became the last of the member states to ratify it last month. bdn
