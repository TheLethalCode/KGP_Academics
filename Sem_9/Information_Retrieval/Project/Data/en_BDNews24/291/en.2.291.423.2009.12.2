 KABUL, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) Many Afghans respond negatively to Obama's announcement to send a further 30,000 troops. Afghans responded mostly negatively to US President Barack Obama's decision to send more than 30,000 extra troops to their country. One resident, after listening to Obama's speech on a radio at his home, said he didn't expect the decision to improve security. (SOUNDBITE) (Dari) AJAB GULL A RESIDENT OF KABUL SAYING: "We don't want an increase of more troops anymore. They already have more than 50,000 troops -- they have not done anything for security so far." An Afghan MP described the speech as nothing more than lip-service. (SOUNDBITE) (English) SHUKRIA BARIKZAI, AFGHAN MP, SAYING: "It seems to me, at least, that President Obama is very far away from the reality and truth in Afghanistan. And what is their strategy as a lip-service and what they are doing in Afghanistan is completely two different issues." Obama's decision to send more troops in the first part of next year is designed to escalate the fight against the Taliban, so that US troops can be brought home. Residents say that will only work if local forces are given proper training. (SOUNDBITE) (Dari) HAKIMULLAH KHAN, A RESIDENT OF KABUL SAYING: "If they (American) train the Afghan army properly and equip them, the Afghan army will be able to take responsibility for security. But if the Afghan army is not equipped well and properly, I don't think the Afghan army will be able stand on its own feet." Afghan analysts say US troops will probably be needed for a long time to come. (SOUNDBITE) (English) HAROON MIR, SAYING: "We will certainly need the US presence in Afghanistan to support the Afghan security forces probably for a longer time, probably for another decade. I think the US investment in USbases in Afghanistan is also an indication that if the US withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the USwill not quit Afghanistan as quickly as it is thought." Some experts had expected Obama to use a staggered deployment to put pressure on Afghan President Hamid Karzai's weak government to do a better job. But this approach was seen as dangerous by some analysts who believe that US troop deployments should not be tied to Karzai's performa
