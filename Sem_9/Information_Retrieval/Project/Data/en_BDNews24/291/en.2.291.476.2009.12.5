 Dhaka, Dec 05 (bdnews24.com)Sharing of Teesta water dominated the second day's talks of the technical committee of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission Saturday, a foreign ministry spokesperson said. The meeting, which kicked off Friday in city, also discussed issues relating to dredging of the Icchamati river and undertaking irrigation projects along the Feni river, he said. Bangladesh's Joint Rivers Commission member Mir Sajjad Hossain leads his side while the Indian delegation is headed by S P Kakran, the JRC member. Saturday's meeting took place at the state guest house Meghna. Journalists were not allowed into the venue. "On Friday, the two sides finalised a report on sharing of Ganges water," the spokesperson told bdnews24.com Saturday. "Sharing Teesta waters came up for discussion today," he said. "Besides, dredging of the Ichhamati river and implementing irrigation and drinking water schemes along the Feni river also featured the discussion," he said. Both are common rivers. The Indian delegation is due to meet water resources secretary Sunday, water ministry officials say. The government officials term the three-day technical committee meeting crucial for any deal with India on sharing of the Teestaa lifeline of the farmers in the greater Rangpur area, a food producing region. The proposals of the technical committee will be forwarded to the ministerial-level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission before prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to Delhi on Dec 19. The technical committee meeting will pave the way for the ministerial meeting to fix the volume of Teesta water for Bangladesh and India, before signing of any deal by the two premiers. But the date of the JRC ministerial-level meeting is yet to be set, according to foreign ministry officials. During foreign minister Dipu Moni's India visit in September, both Bangladesh and India agreed to expedite negotiations to finalise an agreement on sharing water of the Teesta. Dhaka has been pressing India for years to sign an agreement on the Teesta, on which Bangladesh has the largest irrigation project covering 750,000 hectares of land. Bangladesh cannot implement the second phase of the Teesta irrigation project due to paucity of water as India has constructed a barrage in Gazoldoba in the upstream. The two sides in September also agreed to undertake river bank protection works, dredging, irrigation and drinking water schemes along other common rivers. Bangladesh and India share 54 common rivers.
