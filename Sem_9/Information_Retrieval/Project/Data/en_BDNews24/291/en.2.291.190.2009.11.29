 Bhola, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)The death toll from the capsize of the MV Coco-4 climbed to 46 Sunday with the recovery of 11 more bodies, two of them children, at Nazirpur in Bhola. Salvage vessel MV Hamza, arriving in the morning, erected the capsized launch that allowed rescue workers to better reach the hull. Some 20 passengers are still unaccounted for. The accident occurred late on Friday as passengers were disembarking from the MV Coco-4 at a river station on the Tetulia river near the town of Lalmohon . The launch from Dhaka, carrying more than triple its capacity with over 1,500 passengers, overturned at Nazirpur terminal, some 40 kilometres from the district town. Tragedy greeted families in Bhola on Eid day as 35 bodies, most of them women and children, were recovered until rescue operations were called off on Saturday night. The work resumed on Sunday morning. The Hamza, a salvage and rescue vessel of Bangladesh Inter Water Transport Corporation, took more than 24 hours to arrive on the scene, setting off from bordering district Barisal on Saturday morning. Officials said the river was low at this time of year, which caused poor navigability. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, now in Port of Spain attending a Commonwealth summit, expressed her grief Saturday over the launch disaster and ordered speedy rescue operations and investigation into the accident. The president also expressed his sorrow condolences for the grieving families. The government formed a five-member probe, committee headed by deputy shipping secretary Baitul Amin Bhuiyan, officials said. It was asked to submit a report within seven working days. bdnews
