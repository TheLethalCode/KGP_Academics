<TITLE> Gas crisis hurts knit units: BKMEA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  BKMEA president Fazlul Haque has said gas crisis is seriously affecting production in the knitwear industry. "We do not get 40 percent gas of the total demand for the industry," he told a press briefing on Saturday ahead of a three-day international fair titled Knit-Tex. This is the second annual exhibition organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association and event management organisation Conference and Exhibition Management Limited. "If the government does not come forward to solving the crisis all the initiatives including its stimulus package to weather the impact of global downturn and the fair will end in failure," he said. After the press conference Haque told bdnews24.com: "Our knitwear factories are based at Narayanganj. If the government makes proper arrangement of gas supply to this area most of the problems will be solved." The demand for power is less in the winter. Gas production depends on power. "The gas crisis can be resolved if the government supplies gas from Siddhirganj power station to the factories of Narayanganj," the BKMEA president suggested. "All our moves will be futile if we cannot make clothes due to paucity of gas," he said. Commerce minister Faruq Khan will inaugurate the fair on Dec 10 at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Seventy five companies of 15 countries are taking part in the fair. Bangladesh exports knitwear to over 100 countries of the world. The industry earned $ 6.46 billion in fiscal 2008-09. Bangladesh ranks third among the knitwear exporters. bd
