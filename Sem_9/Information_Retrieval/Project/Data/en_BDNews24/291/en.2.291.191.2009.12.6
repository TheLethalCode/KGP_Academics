 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  Banned Indian insurgent outfit United Liberation Front of Assam has accused the Bangladesh government of "betrayal". "Bangladesh has betrayed us," Arabinda Rajkhowa, arrested ULFA founder and chairman, told journalists on Saturday after he was produced before the chief judicial magistrate's court in Guwahati, the main city of the northeastern Indian state of Assam. India's Border Security Force announced on Friday that it had detained Rajkhowa, his wife and their two children, near the India-Bangladesh border at Dawki in the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya. Also detained with them were his personal bodyguard Raja Bora, the deputy commander-in-chief of the ULFA's military wing Raju Barua and others, said BSF. They were all handed over to police in Assam after their arrest, said the border force. Bora and Barua too were produced before the court in Guwahati on Saturday. The three were remanded into police custody for 12 days. Indian media, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, had originally reported on Wednesday that Rajkhowa and others were picked up in Bangladesh. They also reported that the ULFA leader had then been handed over to India. ULFA has protested such actions as Bangladesh and India do not have any extradition treaty. Questioned by media during a joint press-conference in New Delhi on Wednesday, the home secretaries of Bangladesh and India, Abdus Sobhan Sikder and G K Pillai, had declined to confirm or deny the reports about Rajkhowa's arrest and handover. Pillai, however, did confirm the arrest of two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists by the BSF near the India-Bangladesh border in Meghalaya earlier that day. New Delhi later announced Rajkhowa's arrest in Meghalaya, while Bangladesh's home minister Sahara Khatun categorically denied that Rajkhowa was detained in her country. India and Bangladesh have not yet inked any bilateral extradition treaty. But Indian intelligence agencies have hinted that Dhaka has tacitly agreed to track down Indian fugitives illegally entering and hiding out in Bangladesh. India's foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said on Saturday that cooperation between New Delhi and Dhaka had delivered "very positive results". She, however, did not confirm or deny Dhaka's role in detention of the ULFA leaders or LeT terrorists. Meanwhile, the two home secretaries, in talks ending Wednesday, had finalised three draft deals on security to combat cross-border crime and terrorism, for signing during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to India. Delhi has since long been conveying its concern to Dhaka over Indian insurgents and terrorists having bases in Bangladesh. The ULFA has been pursuing an armed rebellion since 1979 with the professed objective of liberating Assam. Thousands have died during their insurgent campaign. Pakistan-based LeT is blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Indian security agencies have reportedly handed their Bangladeshi counterparts a list of leaders the ULFA and other insurgent outfits of the northeastern India, who had been suspected to be living in Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh. Early last month ULFA claimed two leadersits 'finance secretary' Chitrabon Hazarika and 'foreign secretary' Shashadhar Choudhury were picked up by unidentified men from a residential area in Dhaka and later handed over to the BSF. BSF said Hazarika and Choudhury were caught near the Indo-Bangla border in Tripura, another state in the northeastern region of India. After the detention of the ULFA chairman and others, its military wing chief Paresh Barua is the only top leader of the outfit who is still absconding. Indian intelligence officials believe that Barua too has been based in Dhaka, at least till recently. In March 2008, Mohammed Hafijur Rehman and Din Mohammed, both prime accused in the Chittagong Arms Haul case, had confessed in the court that the 10 truck-load of weapons and ammunition that was seized in 2004 had in fact been meant for the ULFA. Rehman also revealed that Barua, himself, had supervised the arms-smuggling operation. It is not clear if Barua is still in Bangladesh or has fled to any other neighbouring country in the wake of the reported crackdown by Dhaka on Indian insurgents and terrorists. Sources said that several other leaders of smaller insurgent outfits of northeastern India had also been detained in Bangladesh over the past few days and Delhi would soon formally announce their arrest by the BSF near the India-Bangladesh border. Amid speculation of a peace-process between the Indian government and ULFA, Rajkhowa told journalists in Guwahati that they had not surrendered. "We have not surrendered. We want peace, but not in this way," the handcuffed insurgent leader said, as police escorted him out of the courtroom. A huge crowd had gathered in front of the court to have a glimpse of the elusive rebel leaders, who  along with Paresh Barua  led one of India's oldest insurgencies over the past three decades.
