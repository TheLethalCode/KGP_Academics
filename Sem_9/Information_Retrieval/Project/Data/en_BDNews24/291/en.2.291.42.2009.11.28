The death toll jumped to 35, said officials, as ten bodies were recovered Saturday morning and another 25 bodies were found after divers began searching underwater for still-missing passengers in the afternoon. Many more passengers still remained missing, locals said. Bhola-3 MP Jashimuddin said a rescue ship could not reach the accident spot due to poor navigability of the river.
