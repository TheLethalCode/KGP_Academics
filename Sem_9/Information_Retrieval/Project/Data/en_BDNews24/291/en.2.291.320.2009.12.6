 LONDON, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Queen Elizabeth has written to newspaper and magazine editors over the issue of paparazzi photographers intruding on the royal family's privacy, Buckingham Palace said on Sunday. "The letter was sent to editors in response to many years of the royal family being hounded by photographers on the Queen's private property," her press office said.

The first test of the new royal stance is likely to come later this month when the queen is joined by other members of the royal family during her regular Christmas visit to her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, in eastern England.
