 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  Road accidents in Dhaka take up to 30 lives each month, mostly due to poor traffic control on the city roads, the DMP chief said Saturday as a drive was launched against unlicensed drivers. "We are taking action to enforce greater discipline," AKM Shahidul Haque, Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner, told reporters at a meeting at Rajarbagh Police Telecom auditorium on Saturday. He said 27 to 28 road accidents took place each day in the capital, resulting in around 30 fatalities a month. He blamed underage and unlicensed drivers for many of the accidents. The commissioner also said 70 percent of public transport drivers were using fake driving licenses. "We are becoming stricter. So now, we are not only stopping unfit vehicles, but also going after drivers without licences." "DMP have been given the power to make arrests without warrant for some types of offence, including driving without a valid licence," he said. Haque said 14 were arrested on Friday, as the crackdown began, on Dhaka roads. Among them, some had no licences, including those under the legal age for driving, or produced false licences, he said. Among other traffic control measures, DMP launched a week long promotional campaign on Dec 1 to introduce new traffic lanes in the capital to ease gridlock and enforce greater discipline on the roads. The city has also seen introduction of automated traffic lights since Nov 21 at more than 50 intersections across the capital. Haque said from Dec 8, drivers violating new traffic light or lane rules will be fined a minimum of Tk 1,000 and get a three-month ban on their licence. bdnews
