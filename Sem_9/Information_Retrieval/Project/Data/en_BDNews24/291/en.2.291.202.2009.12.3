<TEXT>
 PANAJI Dec 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An unusual film that casts 68-year-old Amitabh Bachchan as a 13-year-old school boy, with his own son playing the lead, has the film industry buzzing. In "Paa", Bachchan plays Auro, a teenager afflicted with progeria, a rare genetic condition that causes a person to age faster than normal.

Bachchan's role and heavy make-up, which took five hours to apply, is uncommon in Bollywood, which generally puts out films that revolve round love stories and trademark song-and-dance sequences, or more commonplace social or political themes. "The make up was the toughest part, but I don't want anyone to think that this is a film about progeria. This is a father-son story at its heart," director R. Balakrishnan said. Bachchan said he was intrigued by the fact that he would play his own son's son, but Abhishek said he deliberately distanced himself from that real-life relationship. "We are actors and we know that when the camera is rolling, all relationships go out of the window. As an actor I can't be thinking, "oh, he is my father, and I am playing his father." That just messes with your head," he said. "Paa" opens in more than 700 cinemas in 20 countries on Fri
