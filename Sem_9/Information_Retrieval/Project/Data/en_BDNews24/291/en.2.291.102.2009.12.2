 By Steve Holland and Caren Bohan WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama is offering to send 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan by next summer to speed the battle against the Taliban and plans to bring some soldiers home in 19 months. The accelerated timetable Obama unveils in a high-stakes speech surprised some Pentagon planners who expected a 12- to 18-month period for deploying forces to bolster the 68,000 U.S. troops already in the war zone. "The 30,000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 -- the fastest pace possible -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers," Obama will say, according to excerpts of his speech released by the White House.

The anticipated $25 billion to $30 billion needed to fund the 30,000-troop surge will push the overall cost of military operations in Afghanistan to nearly $95 billion for this fiscal year, eclipsing the $61 billion to be spent in the same period on the Iraq war.

Now, we must come together to end this war successfully," Obama will say. "For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility. What's at stake is the security of our allies and the common security of the world." Senior Obama administration officials said the president's decision to start bringing the troops home by July 2011 represents a faster exit timetable than any of the options presented to him during a three-month review of Afghan policy. "Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground," Obama will say. A Republican congressional leadership aide said Obama made clear in an afternoon briefing with lawmakers that the July 2011 withdrawal timetable will be dictated by th
