 Dhaka, Dec 05 (bdnews24.com)  Road accidents in Dhaka take up to 30 lives each month, mostly due to poor traffic regulation on the city roads, the DMP chief said Saturday. "Metropolitan police is taking action to restore discipline on roads," AKM Shahidul Haque, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner, told reporters at a meeting at Rajarbagh police telecom auditorium on Saturday. Answering questions, he said: "We are becoming stricter. So now, we are not only stopping unfit vehicles, but also arresting drivers without valid licences." "For some types of offence, including driving without a valid license, DMP have the power to make arrests without warrant," he said. Haque said 14 people were arrested on Friday for driving on Dhaka roads without valid licences. Among them, some had no licences or were carrying false licences, others were under the legal age for driving, he said. Metropolitan police launched a weeklong promotional campaign on Dec 1 to introduce new traffic lanes in the capital to ease gridlock and enforce greater discipline on the roads. The city has also seen introduction of automated traffic lights since Nov 21 at more than 50 intersections across the capital. Haque said from Dec 8, drivers violating new traffic light or lane rules will be fined a minimum of Tk 1,000 and get a three-month ban on their licence. bdnews
