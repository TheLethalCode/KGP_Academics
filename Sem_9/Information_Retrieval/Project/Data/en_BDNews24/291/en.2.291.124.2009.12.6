 SRINAGAR, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least a dozen people were injured on Saturday in Kashmir's main city when hundreds of demonstrators clashed with police in protests against an attack on a separatist leader who favoured peace talks with India.

"We want to tell those elements (attackers) that Hurriyat will not be threatened by these attacks, we will not pull back, we make a commitment that we will take this issue to its logical conclusion," Farooq said on Saturday. Farooq was reported to have held peace talks with Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram in New Delhi last month.
