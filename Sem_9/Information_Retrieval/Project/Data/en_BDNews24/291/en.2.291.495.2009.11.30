 MANILA, Nov 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said on Monday she has no plans to retire from politics after her term ends in June next year, and would seek a seat in the lower house of Congress. Her decision drew criticism from the opposition, which said Arroyo was trying to prolong her grip on power. "I realised I am not ready to step down completely from public service," Arroyo said in an interview on government radio. "As you all know, the people from my congressional district in Pampanga asked me to stay in politics, so after much soul searching, I have decided to respond affirmatively to their call. To that end, I will file my candidacy for Congress in order to serve the hard-working people of my province. Arroyo has been president since 2001, and is not eligible to seek that office again. She is expected to win her seat hands down in the election. "I believe her decision to seek a seat in Congress is part of a larger political plan," said opposition Senator Manuel Roxas, who is running for vice president. He said Arroyo might push for changing the constitution and hopes to regain power by becoming prime minister. But analysts said that would be difficult if an opposition candidate wins the presidency next year. "She can win a seat in Congress, but it would not easy to get the support of a majority of lawmakers to become speaker, change the constitution and become prime minister," Ernesto Maceda, a former senator and newspaper columnist, told reporters. Ramon Casiple of the Institute of Political and Electoral Reforms said the president's move was unprecedented in the country's history. Although he expected it, Casiple said he was surprised that Arroyo would stand despite low rating in opinion polls. Arroyo's predecessor, Joseph Estrada who was ousted in 2001, said she should not be allowed to run for any position because as sitting president, she would have an advantage over her rivals. Estrada, who was convicted of economic plunder but later pardoned, filed to stand as a presidential candidate on Monday. Apart from Estrada, billionaire Senator Manuel "Manny" Villar, also filed his candidacy for president two days after another opposition candidate, Senator Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino, submitted his presidential nomination papers. The pro-administration party's candidate, former defence chief Gilberto Teodoro, will file his candidacy on Tuesday, the last day for the nomination proc
