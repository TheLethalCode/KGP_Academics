 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  The shipping minister has said that Tarique Rahman, Arafat Rahman Coco and Giasuddin Al Mamun will be charged over the deaths of more 80 passengers caused by the capsize of the MV Coco-4 in Bhola. Shahjahan Khan told reporters Wednesday that Tarique and Coco, sons of the opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, were on the board of the launch company Rahman Shippers Bangladesh Ltd that owns the Coco-4. He said sixteen people, including businessman Al Mamun, who is also a director of the company and a close associate of Tarique, faced a case in the Marine Court, filed on Monday (Nov 30), by shipping department inspector Shafique Aiyub. The case brings charges of overloading the vessel and reckless endangerment of lives. "Tarique and Coco will also be made accused in the case," Khan said. Shahjahan Khan told journalists at the ministry: "As far as I know, Tarique Rahman is the managing director of the launch company and Arafat Rahman Coco is a director." He said a supplementary case was being filed against the two. The minister said the government would also punish its own officials if their culpability was proved. In another case, the launch officials were sued on Tuesday in a case filed in Lalmohon, the scene of the tragedy, by a surviving passenger, Muhammad Kamal, police said. Lalmohon police chief Jakir Hossain said the case accuses on-duty officials of the MV Coco-4 of causing the accident and deaths of passengers by overloading and attempting to dock 50 feet away from the Nazirpur launch terminal, where passengers were attempting to disembark. The Coco-4 partially capsized last Friday (Nov 27), the night before Eid-ul-Azha, on the river Tentulia at Nazirpur in Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town. The death toll rose to 84 by Wednesday, as bodies continued to float to the river surface, with dozens of passengers still unaccounted for five days after the tragedy, officials say. The vessel, crowded from hull to decks with people heading home to celebrate the holiday with families, began tipping with the weight of disembarking passengers and partially sank, according to eye witnesses. The 600-capacity ferry was carrying more than 1500 passengers from Dhaka to Lalmohon. Police, divers of BIWTA and firemen were engaged in rescue operations since the early hours of Saturday. Hundreds of desperate families of still-missing passengers continued to crowd the banks of the river up to Wednesday night, when rescue operations were called off. The government and local authorities have formed three separate committees to probe the accident. BIWTA OFFICIALS SUSPENDED Three BIWTA officials were suspended Tuesday for ignoring responsibilities regarding the launch tragedy, as rescue vessel MV Hamza was so late in reaching the accident spot, a shipping ministry statement said Tuesday. The Hamza, a salvage and rescue vessel of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, , setting off from bordering district Barisal on Saturday morning, took more than 24 hours to arrive on the scene. It began its operations on Sunday morning, some 36 hours after the accident, righting the capsized ferry, allowing rescue workers to better reach the hull. The sacked officials are Md Abdur Razzaque, director of the waterway conservancy division, Md Shahjahan, a senior deputy director of the division's Barisal branch, and Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, senior deputy director of Barisal river port. BIWTA officials said the river was low at this time of year, which caused poor navigability and delays. Meanwhile, two vessels have been dispatched to assist the rescue and salvage work. A trawler with 11 chainssix with capacity to lift ten tonnes and five of 15 tonnesstarted from Barisal Tuesday morning. Another salvage vessel, the MV Rustom, had also set off Monday evening from Narayanganj to assist the Hamza, reaching the spot on Tuesday night. bdnews2
