 by Arshad Mahmud Washington, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Embassy in Washington held a condolence meeting Wednesday to mourn the sudden, unexpected death of its press minister Akhter Ahmed Khan. His Namaj-e-Janaza was held Tuesday at a local mosque in Virginia, attended by ambassador Akramul Qader, embassy officials and staff, and a number of Bangladeshi Americans including Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury, head of Voice of America Bengali Service. Khan's untimely death caused shock and sorrow among the Bengali community, many of whom were seen weeping unreservedly at the Janaza. Khan, whose body was found lying in his home in Bethesda, Maryland on Monday evening, joined the embassy in July as the press minister on a two-year contract. Ambassador Qader told bdnews24.com that he enquired about Akhter on Monday morning, the first day of work after a long 4-day weekend that included Thanksgiving and Eid-ul-Azha. "When he didn't show up in the afternoon I got really worried", he said. "I then asked (Sheikh) Belal (the deputy chief of the mission) to go to his house after he failed to answer his cell phone". Belal, Khan's neighbor, said he tried to contact him several times during the holidays but failed to reach him. He found Akhter's house locked. "I thought he might have gone out of town during the long weekend", he said. Belal then contacted his brother-in-law, who is a resident of Virginia, but he also said he hadn't heard from him during the long weekend, thinking he was visiting other friends. "Akhter told me he won't be able to come to our house on Eid day as he was committed to visiting other friends", Samiur Rahman, his brother-in-law, told bdnews24.com. Finally, after all efforts failed to locate him, Belal called Akhter's landlord on Monday evening and together they unlocked the door and found his body lying on the floor. Later Maryland police came to the scene and in the presence of State Department officials and medical personnel they concluded Akhter, 54, had died of a massive heart attack. Akhter lived alone in his apartment, which he began renting just over a month ago. His wife and only daughter, aged 4, were scheduled to join him later this month. Akhter, a prominent journalist, worked for the BSS, New Nation, Bangladesh Observer and The Independent during a career spanning over two decades. He was also with bdnews24.com for a short period in 2006.
