 Bhola, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)Tragedy greeted families in Bhola on Eid day, as 35 bodies, 11 of them children, were recovered after the MV Coco-4 partially capsized late on Friday at Nazirpur, some 40 kilometres from the district town. Most of the victims were local. Ten bodies were recovered from the hold of the vessel and another 25 from the water up to Saturday afternoon, assistant commissioner of Bhola, Nuruddin Al Faruq, told the media. Local authorities said some 30 passengers were still missing. The Lalmohon-bound launch was carrying more than triple capacity, with over 1,500 passengers, from Dhaka, officials and passengers said. Its capacity, as inscribed on the vessel, was 600 passengers in the day and 446 at night. Families, trying to reach home for the Eid holiday, were crammed into the hull of the vessel, said those who boarded the launch in the capital. They said there was barely standing room throughout the decks of the launch. The launch left Sadarghat at 11am on Friday. Witnesses said its hull was damaged as the vessel moored at Nazirpur Ghat at around 10:30pm. Dozens of passengers were injured as they tried to jump from the overloaded launch that began tilting after the hull was breached. Others never made it off the boat. Police, district officials, fire fighters and locals joined in rescue work through the night, recovering the bodies of ten women and children from the hold by morning. Assistant commissioner Nuruddin Al Faruq told bdnews24.com that rescue vessel Hamza of Bangladesh Inter Water Transport Corporation had also headed for Bhola Saturday morning. But the rescue ship failed to reach the accident spot due to poor navigability of the river, former Bhola-3 MP Jashimuddin told bdnews24.com later in the day. The ten bodies, recovered in the morning, were identified as two-year old Faruk, three-year old Kabita, seven-year old Surabhi, eight-year old Toma, 12-year old Ripon, 15-year old Tamanna, 25-year old Aklima, 40-year old Khosh Bahar and 45-year old Shahnoor. Another body of a two-year old remained unidentified. Saiful Islam, second officer of Nazirpur Police Station, said most of the victims were from Charfashion and Lalmohan upazilas in Bhola, where families learned of the tragedy in the early hours of Saturday, Eid day. Another 25 bodies were recovered after divers began searching underwater for still-missing passengers at around 3pm. Many more remain missing, locals said. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan was heading for Bhola in the afternoon, said Jashimuddin. The government had already formed a five-member probe, committee headed by deputy shipping secretary Baitul Amin, officials said. bdn
