 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)A two-day film festival, 'Mini INPUT Dhaka 2009', has been showcasing some of the best of public television programmes around the world in Dhaka, screening documentaries and dramas at the Goethe-Institut from Dec 2-3. INPUT (acronym for INternational PUblic Television) is the biggest public television organisation in the world. It has organised international television's most important and influential annual screening conferences for more than 25 years  held in a different country each year  encouraging the development of public service television by screening, promoting discussion and debating about the television craft and the most outstanding programmes from around the world and across all genres. This will be a meeting point for professionals providing unique opportunity for producers, directors, writers and all those  including independent producers and programme makers  who contribute to public television. It recognises TV's potential to promote better understanding among the world's different cultures and it is a platform where colleagues can network, exchange ideas and discuss strategies to defend the mission of public TV. The two-day event was inaugurated by Jamil Choudhury, former DG of BTV, followed by a short introduction to INPUT. Mini INPUT Dhaka 2009 has been featuring the following programmes on Thursday each followed by post screening discussions by leading entrepreneurs, business managers, programme makers, academics and media personalities: Day 1 (Dec 2) (9:30 am  7:00 pm) CHAVEZ : Inside the Coup Dur: 60 min, Documentary, Ireland Director : Kim Bartley The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is a thrilling insight into the President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez; charting the last seven months in the run up to the April 2002 coup d'etat against him and his dramatic return to power some 48 hours later. Never has such a range of footage about Chavez, the new icon of the left and the thorn in the side of the US Administration been assembled in one documentary. THE CORPORATION Dur: 57 min, Canada, INPUT explores the curious history, inner workings, controversial impacts and the potential future of corporations. This first part asks, if the modern corporation is defined as a 'person' according to American legal jurisprudence, what kind of a person it would be? SURPLUS Dur: 52' Documentary, Sweden Director : Erik Gandini Terrorised into being consumers. Consumer confidence has been low since September 11 2001. A successful war against Iraq was supposed to be the only way to restore that confidence  and our happiness. But is shopping our salvation? Do we have a choice? If the average 30 second commercial is supposed to make you BUY, this film will make you THINK every time you enter the store! Surplus is a forceful award-winning documentary with a unique approach to over-consumption. GIANT BUDDHAS Dur: 96', Documentary, Switzerland Director: Christian Frei In February 2001, six months before the attacks on the Twin Towers, the Taliban issued a decree calling for the destruction of all non-Islamic-related statues in Afghanistan. Despite resounding outrage from the international community, the world lost two of its most magnificent landmarks. A pair of enormous stone Buddhas, hewn from the side of a cliff in the Bamiyan Valley more than 1,600 years ago, was blown to bits by Islamic fundamentalists. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christian Frei (War Photographer) has crafted a thought-provoking documentary that reveals the consequences of religious fanaticism as it exposes the hypocrisy of global indignation. DARK SIDE OF THE MOON Dur: 52', France High brow entertainment? Facts and fiction?  During an interview with Stanley Kubrick's widow an extraordinary story came to light. Kubrick and other Hollywood producers contributed to the popular success of the US space program by turning it into visual entertainment. This gave the film makers an idea. They wondered: How far will anyone go for the power of images? No "ordinary" documentary. It intends to inform and entertain, but also make the viewers aware of the fact, that one should always be just a little critical of "facts". DAY 2 (Dec 3) (9:30 am  7:00 pm) VIEWS ON WAR Dur: 35 min, Belgium stands back from the news to examine the image of war on our TV screens, taking highlights from war coverage to look how the stations handled it and waged it between themselves. BUYING THE GAMES (UK) Dur: 60 minutes, Genre: investigative documentary; Director: Howard Bradburn This programme unearths the ill practices and corruption that exists in an organisation that is supposed to be the healthiest.

France Director : Peter Chappell Genre : Documentary Can Great Science make mistakes? Could it be capable of running our souls and environment? This documentary tells an extraordinary controversy about science responsibility towards these issues. The whole world scientific community is in turmoil. ANGEL WITHOUT WINGS (Original title: Engelchen Flieg) Germany Dur 1 hr 29 min, Drama Director: Adolf Winkelmann Pauline is a little angel, a gift from heaven to her parents Michael and Hanna.
