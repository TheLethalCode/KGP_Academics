<TITLE> Lobo heads for victory at disputed Honduras election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEGUCIGALPA, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Honduran opposition candidate Porfirio Lobo was headed for victory on Sunday in a presidential election that has put the United States at odds with leftist governments in Latin America. Lobo, a rich landowner, had over 55 percent support with more than half the votes counted, official results showed, giving him a virtually unassailable lead over Elvin Santos of the ruling Liberal Party. The election could calm a five-month crisis which the Central America country has suffered since the army overthrew leftist President Manuel Zelaya in June and flew him into exile. But while Washington looks likely to recognize Sunday's vote, leftist rulers of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela and other Latin American countries say the election is invalid because it was backed by the coup leaders and could end any hope of Zelaya returning to power. The division puts in danger U.S. President Barack Obama's attempts to turn a new page with Latin America where memories of military coups supported by the United States during the Cold War are still fresh. As the partial election results were announced after long delays that officials put down to technical problems, some 300 supporters of the conservative Lobo waved National Party flags and danced in a victory celebration at a hotel in the capital. Lobo is seen as more able than Santos to lead Honduras out of political gridlock and diplomatic isolation, but Zelaya said the election was illegitimate and accused police of repressing his supporters. Soldiers grabbed Zelaya from his home on June 28 and threw him out of the country, sparking Central America's biggest political crisis since the end of the Cold War. Neither Zelaya nor his arch-rival Roberto Micheletti, installed as interim president by Congress after Zelaya's overthrow, took part in the race. Lobo vowed on Sunday to end Honduras' isolation from countries like Brazil and international organizations such as the Organization of American States, or OAS, which have frozen Honduras out in retaliation for the coup. "We are prepared to approach them and ask them to understand that there is a government which was elected, that it is the precise will of Hondurans at the ballot box, that it is a democracy and we should all respect the leadership of countries," he said. LULA CONDEMNS ELECTION But Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva again condemned the election, saying that failure to oppose it could encourage other "adventurers" to stage coups in Latin America. "If the countries that can ... make gestures do not do so, we do not know where else there could be a coup," Lula said in Portugal on Sunday. His government is increasingly flexing its muscles as Latin America's emerging power and has been disappointed by Washington's response to the Honduras crisis. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, the leader of a socialist bloc in Latin America and a close ally of Zelaya, said the vote was "an electoral farce." The U.S. State Department described the election last week as "a democratic way forward for the Honduran people" after talks to bring Zelaya back collapsed. But Washington has not clearly spelled out whether it will recognize the winner. The election, which was scheduled before the coup, took place peacefully despite a spate of home-made bomb explosions in recent days. Turnout appeared to be high in the capital. The OAS and United Nations refused to send observers to the election. Zelaya had upset Congress and the Supreme Court by forging an alliance with Chavez and hinting that the wanted to change the constitution to allow presidential re-election. Zelaya, camped out in the Brazilian embassy since September when he slipped back into Honduras from exile, told his supporters to boycott the election and said the winner would not be a true president.
