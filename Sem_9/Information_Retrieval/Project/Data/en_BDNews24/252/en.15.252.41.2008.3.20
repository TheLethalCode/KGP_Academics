 LONDON, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Every household in the country will be hit with average bills of more than 1,000 pounds, after Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) became the last of the big six utility providers to hike its prices. SSE said it would increase domestic power prices by an average of 14.2 percent and gas by 15.8 percent from April 1 for existing customers, although new ones will go straight onto the increased rates. They take the average quarterly bill for SSE dual fuel customers up 131 pounds to 1,006 pounds. "It means the average standard quarterly cash or cheque tariff for medium users of gas and electricity will be over 1,000 pounds with all of the big six energy giants," said Scott Byrom, utilities manager at price comparison Web site moneysupermarket.com. Despite the rises, SSE remains one of the cheapest suppliers and takes the crown for having the most competitive dual fuel tariff, if only by an average of one pound. SSE is the last of the big six suppliers to announce price hikes this year, blaming soaring wholesale energy prices. Npower, owned by Germany's RWE was the first major household energy supplier in Britain to announce double-digit price increases, at the start of January, followed by French-owned EDF Energy, British Gas, Scottish Power and E.ON. SSE said in mid-January it would not raise prices until at least March 30 and has fulfilled that promise -- just. "As the last UK energy supplier to put up its prices this year, SSE has missed out on around 400 million pounds in revenue, to the benefit of its eight million customers who have each saved around 50 pounds this winter," said Mark Todd, a director of energyhelpline.com. "It has not been all bad news for the supplier: as the company with the cheapest standard energy tariffs for the last two months, it has picked up tens of thousands customers who've chosen to switch." But further across-the-board hikes could be in the pipeline this year. "The question on customers' lips should now be, are there further price rises to come, especially as we head towards next winter," said Tim Wolfenden, head of home services at uSwitch.com.
