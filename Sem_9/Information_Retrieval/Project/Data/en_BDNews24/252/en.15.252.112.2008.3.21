<TITLE> Turkmen embassy in Azerbaijan reopens as rift ends </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Asghabat, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkmenistan plans to re-open its embassy in Azerbaijan to end a seven-year diplomatic stand-off between the two gas-rich Caspian nations, Turkmen media reported. Their relations turned sour in the 1990s due to ownership disputes over several offshore oil and gas fields in the Caspian Sea as well as Azerbaijan's debt for Turkmen gas supplies. Turkmenistan recalled its ambassador from Azerbaijan in 2001. Earlier this month Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan settled the gas dispute and agreed to press on with talks on Caspian fields. Turkmen Khabarlary news agency reported late on Thursday that President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who has vowed to settle the row since he came to power in 2006, has now appointed a new ambassador, Annamammed Mammedov, to Azerbaijan. Europe, seeking alternative energy supply routes to ease reliance on Russian gas, wants the two former Soviet nations to cooperate more on the long-delayed Nabucco pipeline, designed to give Europe direct access to Caspian gas.
