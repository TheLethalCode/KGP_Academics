 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index fell 0.9 percent by midday on Wednesday as renewed talk of trouble in the UK banks sector doused early gains spurred by a hefty US rate cut. By 1157 GMT the FTSE 100 was down 50.5 points at 5,555.3 as shares fell across Europe. Asian and US stocks rallied after the US Federal Reserve slashed borrowing costs by 75 basis points to a three-year low of 2.25 percent, in a bid to stave off a likely US recession. The FTSE 100 soared in the previous session, after sinking about 4 percent on Monday when the fire sale of US investment bank Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase sparked fears that the credit markets crisis would claim more victims. The index has shed more than 13 percent so far this year on fears of a US recession and further credit-related writedowns.

NEXT IN LINE Clothing retailer Next lost 6 percent after it reported a 4.1 percent increase in annual profit, in line with forecasts but said it expected trading to remain tough in the year ahead. Wolseley shed 6.9 percent after UBS cut the stock's price target to 750 pence from 890 pence. British budget airline easyJet dived nearly 12 percent after it said that if fuel prices didn't fall soon, it would make less profit this year than it previously thought. Energy shares also weighed on the FTSE 100 as US crude oil prices fell below $109 a barrel due to forecast increases in fuel inventories in the United States.
