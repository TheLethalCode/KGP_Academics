 INDIAN WELLS, California, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A jaded Maria Sharapova said she might take another break from the game after being beaten 6-3 5-7 6-2 by fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova in the semi-finals of the Pacific Life Open on Friday. The Australian Open champion took a brief holiday earlier this month after realising she had clocked just under 50,000 miles since the start of the year and jested she might skip next week's Sony Ericsson Open in Miami.

No one's forcing me to go out there and play. "This year is so young and I still have so many big tournaments ahead of me and so many goals that I want to achieve," added Sharapova, a winner of three grand slam titles.
