<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)--The country's bourses continued their rally gaining Wednesday from the previous day due to investors' heavy buying leading to increased turnover and trading volume. Market participators said the investors were buying in an attempt to reshape their portfolios that started Tuesday. The day's turnover board saw quite a good number of new scrips of cement, chemicals and food which market observers termed a result of investor speculations of bonus shares and dividends. "Investors are putting their money in unpopular issues like Heidelberg Cement and Fu Wang Foods Wednesday which I think may be driven on speculation of bonus shares or cash dividends," said Bashir Ahmed, an investment consultant. The incident might also be a result of some manipulation as the size of the market is too small and things like this have happened before, added Ahmed who works for Stock & Bond, a brokerage house. The DSE's general index maintained a generally upward trend throughout the day, with slight rise and falls, to finish higher. The benchmark DGEN or general index closed up 16.88 points, or 0.56 percent, to end on 2986.40. The DSI or all share price index finished at 2522.72, up 14.83 points, or 0.59 percent. The bourse's blue chip DSE-20 rose 13.85 points, or 0.62 percent, to end on 2226.59. Turnover on the country's prime bourse advanced to Tk 2.98 billion from Tuesday's Tk 2.37 billion, from 27,389,870 traded shares. Gainers beat losers 181 to 72, while six issues remained unchanged. The day saw major issues in banks losing while pharmaceutical bigwigs gained after falling Tuesday with prices of mutual funds and power shares going upwards. Grameen One MF topped the turnover board, rising 7.86 percent to end at Tk 137.20. AB Bank followed, ending on Tk 3191, down 0.88 percent. AIMS 1st mutual fund rose 2.23 percent to end on Tk 9.62.
