 CUTUD, Philippines, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Filipinos including a 15-year-old were nailed to crosses and scores more whipped their backs into a bloody pulp on Friday in a gory ritual to mark the death of Jesus Christ. The voluntary crucifixions in the northern Philippines were the most extreme displays of religious devotion in this mainly Catholic country, where millions are praying and fasting ahead of the Easter weekend. In the small village of Cutud, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Manila, men cried out as nails the size of pencils were driven into their hands and feet before they were hoisted up in the scorching heat. Eight went through the process. Eleven backed out, organisers said. "The poor are getting poorer. They are the focus of my penance and my petitions. I pray there's equality in the society," said Ruben Inaje, showing his bandaged hands after his crucifixion. In the neighbouring province of Bulacan, five people were nailed to wooden crosses, including a 15-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl. Thousands watched the spectacle in Cutud, which has grown from a village production started in 1962 to a media and tourist attraction copied in other parts of the country. For hours before the crucifixions lines of men, hooded and half naked, flayed their backs with bamboo whips and paddles tipped with broken glass. Blood splattered over the road. The atmosphere was festive, with hawkers selling beer, ice-cream and souvenir whips. VIPs watched from a specially elevated "viewing platform". The country's dominant Catholic Church disapproves of the crucifixions and flagellations as a misrepresentation of the faith. "The spiritual dimension is totally lost, and it's entered into only because of some shows, some manifestations for other people to be satisfied with or to see," said Bishop Deogracias Iniguez. "Many of these penitents, those who are practicing these physical afflictions have a meagre, have a shallow understanding of these practices." Some foreigners have previously been crucified including a Belgian nun and a Japanese man, who later allowed footage of his ordeal to be used in a pornographic film. No one has ever died during the rituals. Over 80 percent of the Philippines' estimated 90 million population are Catholic and across the archipelago this weekend will be a time for church ritual, family and the beach. Filipinos infuse their Catholic faith with local superstitions and some people avoid taking a shower or doing laundry after 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Good Friday -- the time Chrst was believed to have died -- for fear of bad lu
