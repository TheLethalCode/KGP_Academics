<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus's new president said on Wednesday he was ready to discuss a deal over the divided island with Turkish Cypriots in talks this week, but cautioned there could be no quick fix to the decades old partition. Demetris Christofias will meet Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat on Friday to resume stalled negotiations which remain a hurdle to Turkey's European Union aspirations. Cyprus has been split since 1974 when Turkey invaded in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup in Nicosia. Peace efforts collapsed in 2004 when Greek Cypriots rejected a United Nations reunification blueprint accepted by Turkish Cypriots. Cyprus (in the form of Greek Cypriots) joined the EU soon after and have veto rights over Ankara's hopes of joining the 27 member bloc. Diplomats and analysts do not expect a massive breakthrough from Friday's meeting, although both leaders are expected to announce the opening of Ledra Street, a barricaded road splitting the capital Nicosia into Greek and Turkish sectors. Elected on a tide of dissent with his predecessor's hardline policies which froze settlement hopes, Christofias warned this may be the last chance to reunite the island. "This time we must succeed. A new failure will be devastating for the future of our people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots," Christofias told reporters. "On our part, we are already willing to work hard to reach ... a fair, viable and workable solution soon." He also played down the prospect of immediate results. "This government was created 18 days ago ... a lot of people want things done right now. Not everything can be done immediately, and that is equally valid for the Cyprus problem." Christofias said he was ready to discuss a bi-zonal federation on the basis of existing agreements, international and EU law. "The continuation of the status quo is not to the benefit of anybody," he said. A likely point of contention is the basis of negotiations. Christofias wants the starting point to be the UN brokered agreement of 2006 calling for an incremental approach to peacebuilding, while Talat wants to use the 2004 U.N. blueprint. "I think both want progress, but that might be an issue. It's a complex problem which has been around for years, it can't be resolved over coffee in one morning," a western diplomat said. The assistant professor of conflict resolution at the University of Cyprus said progress would depend on goodwill. "They do not have to love each other, but they have to trust and work together for a mutually acceptable solution," said Maria Hadjipavlou. Christofias said he was ready to announce an opening of Ledra Street when he meets Talat on Friday. Asked when it would open, Christofias said: "Talat should tell us. I'm ready to do it tomorro
