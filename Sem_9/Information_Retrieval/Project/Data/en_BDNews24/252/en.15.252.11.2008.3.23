<TITLE> Space shuttle astronauts to get day of rest </TITLE>

 HOUSTON, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Space shuttle Endeavour astronauts were to rest on Sunday after the fifth and final spacewalk of a mission that brought the first piece of a Japanese laboratory and also a Canadian robot to the International Space Station. NASA officials said the astronauts were scheduled to wake up about midday and relax for eight hours before making final cargo transfers ahead of Endeavour's Monday departure from the space outpost. "We had over 33 hours of spacewalking time (on the flight). It's great to see it behind us, the crew is due for a little rest," lead spacewalk officer Zebulon Scoville told reporters at Johnson Space Center. On a spacewalk that ended on Saturday night, Robert Behnken and Michael Foreman performed chores that included Foreman checking out a balky rotary joint for one of the station's wing-like solar power panels. NASA discovered metal shavings inside the mechanism last year and is trying to trace their source. Space station flight director Dana Weigel said Foreman found no evidence that orbital debris had struck the joint, which eliminated one possible cause. "That's a big help for us. That kind of narrows down one of the chains of the fault tree," she said. The rotary joint keeps the panel pointed at the sun to maximize electricity production for the space station, and has been locked in place to prevent further damage. But the station is growing and its power needs increasing, so NASA must soon make decisions about how to repair the joint, Weigel said. "The first decision point is going to be the end of March," she said. One option, she said, is simply "to try to clean it up and live with it." Endeavour, after a night launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, arrived at the space station on March 12 with the first piece of Japan's Kibo lab and with Dextre, the Canadian-built maintenance robot. With both now installed, the shuttle is set to undock from the $100 billion outpost on Monday evening and return to Florida on Wednesday. The second of Kibo's three parts, the main laboratory, is scheduled to be transported to the station on a May shuttle flight. The US space agency plans to fly 10 more construction and resupply flights to the station and a mission to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope before the shuttle fleet is retired in 20
