<TITLE> Taiwan UN referendum that drew wide criticism fails </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Taipei, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Taiwan referendum on United Nations membership that drew strong criticism from archrival China, as well as close ally the United States, failed to pass in a vote on Saturday. The referendum, which asked Taiwanese whether Taiwan should join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan", failed to gain the required participation level needed to be considered valid. The United States, Russia and Britain were all sharply critical of the referendum, saying it was needlessly provocative in trying to alter the status quo with Taiwan's political archrival China. A second referendum asking whether Taiwan should join the United Nations under the island's official name, Republic of China, or any other practical name, also failed to break the 50 percent threshold. China has claimed self-ruled Taiwan as its territory since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, and has repeatedly blocked Taiwan's attempts to join the United Nations. Opposition party candidate Ma Ying-jeou won the presidential election, alongside which the two referenda were run.
