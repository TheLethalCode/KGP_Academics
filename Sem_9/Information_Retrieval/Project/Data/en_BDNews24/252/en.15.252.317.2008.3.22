 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Some restrictions on political activities under emergency will be relaxed prior to the general elections before Dec, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said in an interview with Al Jazeera Television aired Saturday. "We have not yet fixed the time. We will be looking at all options when and how the state of emergency will be lifted," Fakhruddin was quoted as saying, on March 17, in the interview with Al Jazeera on his recent UK visit. The interview was aired Saturday morning. Fakhruddin was quoted by Xinhua news agency as saying that the state of emergency was declared to improve law and order and bring the country back to normalcy. The chief adviser added that the emergency was not being enforced in a strict sense in many areas, citing "press freedom" as an example. Asked whether the elections will be held by December this year, Fakhruddin said, "Absolutely, that is the deadline. I have said this more than once and the elections will be held by December 2008." He said the Election Commission has announced an election roadmap. "I am absolutely committed and confident that the elections will be held according to the roadmap." bd
