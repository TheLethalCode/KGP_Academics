 NEW YORK, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks opened higher on Wednesday, helped by news a regulator of two major US home finance companies eased their capital requirements to pump money into the stressed mortgage market. The hotly anticipated market debut of Visa Inc, the world's largest credit card network, also buoyed optimism a day after Wall Street notched its biggest one-day surge in more than five years. The stock was yet to trade. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.69 points, or 0.19 percent, to 12,416.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index inched up 4.79 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,335.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 5.91 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,274.
