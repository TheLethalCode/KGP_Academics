 PARIS, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were flat shortly after midday on Wednesday, as grim outlook statements from Sony Ericsson and Deutsche Telekom hit tech and telecoms shares, eclipsing better-than-expected results from Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley. Banks were mixed, with Societe Generale down 5.4 percent after rival BNP Paribas said it would not bid for the French bank, which was hit earlier this year by a massive trading scandal. BNP was up 5.2 percent. At 1310 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was flat at 1,241.89 points. the index rose 1 percent shortly after the opening, tracking lofty gains on Wall Street overnight after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates. "The disappointing guidance from Deutsche Telekom on the fixed-line market coupled with Sony Ericsson's profit warning are really weighing on the market," said Chicuong Dang, equity analyst at Richelieu Finance. "That shows the uncertainty level on the market is still very high, and that investors not only fear more writedowns in the banking sector, but also negative news such as profit warnings among other sectors due to the current economic environment." Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecoms group, was down 8.2 percent after it said sales and earnings at its fixed-line unit would decline further this year. Ericsson was down 10.8 percent after its mobile phone handset joint venture Sony Ericsson warned on profits. Vodafone was down 1.8 percent, Telefonica down 1.6 percent. Telecom Italia was down 6.2 percent, hit by market speculation that the heavily indebted telecoms company could launch a capital increase.

Other banks were on the rise, with Credit Suisse up 3.8 percent and ING Groep NV up 2.8 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 is down about 18 percent so far this year, and is on track to record its worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2002, as stock markets around the world were hit by worries over the prospect of a U.S. recession and the impact of the global credit crisis. EUROPE HIT MORE THAN WALL STREET But the retreat on European stock markets has been sharper than on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average has lost around 6.6 percent so far this year, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index down about 9.4 percent. "We believe that the tailwinds behind European outperformance are shifting," Jeffrey Palma, global equity strategist at UBS, wrote in a note. "Earnings revisions in Europe have outstripped revisions in the US, serving as a major driver of outperformance. We see more downside risk to European earnings growth this year." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.3 percent, Britain's FTSE 100 index up 0.15 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.4 perce
