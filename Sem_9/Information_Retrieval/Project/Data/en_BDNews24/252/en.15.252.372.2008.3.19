<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)A former NBR boss Wednesday recommended that the government make the next budget aiming at expanding the tax net by cutting tax rates. Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury, former NBR chairman, also recommended that the government introduce special taxation for the SME sector to enable it flourish. Speaking at a pre-budget discussion at the NBR in Segunbagicha, Chowdhury, also chairman of SME Foundation, pointed out that direct foreign investments were not beneficial to the economy. "Revenue earnings will increase when more taxpayers are in the tax net as a direct result of cutting down tax rates," Chowdhury said. Stressing the importance of NBR officials' capacity enhancement, he said, "The field-level NBR officials lack skills in carrying out their basic responsibility. They have to discharge their responsibilities honestly and sincerely." "I don't consider FDIs to be beneficial for the country's economy at all though they may appear to be so, as FDIs harm the local industries, because most benefits get netted by foreign investors." Representatives of a number of SMEs attended Wednesday's discussion on the forthcoming budget, chaired by NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid. The NBR chairman said: "The forthcoming budget will incorporate necessary governmental support for the development of SMEs as they contribute specially to poverty alleviation and employment generation." Abdul Majid said: "We want to create a taxation-friendly environment. Measures will be taken to ensure that the taxpayers volunteer to pay taxes without any harassment or intimidation. There won't be any hurdle between the taxpayer and the tax collector." bdnews
