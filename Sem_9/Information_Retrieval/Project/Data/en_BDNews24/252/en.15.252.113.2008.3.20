<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Mar 19 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Ashley Alexandra Dupre, the call girl at the center of the Elliot Spitzer sex scandal, watched the potential earnings from her new-found fame drop by $1 million on Tuesday as old nude videos of her emerged. Adult DVD distributor "Girls Gone Wild" discovered videos of a semi-nude Dupre, now 22, in its archives and plans to sell them on its Web site, a company spokesman said. "Girls Gone Wild" had offered to pay Dupre $1 million to pose nude in a magazine it plans to launch but, after discovering the old footage, the company withdrew its offer. Last week, Spitzer resigned as governor of New York after news surfaced he had paid for a sexual encounter in Washington, D.C. The New York Times revealed that Dupre was the prostitute he had hired. A "Girls Gone Wild" video crew met Dupre in Miami in 2003 and she stayed with them for a week shooting videos, the spokesman said.
