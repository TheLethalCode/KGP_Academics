 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed returned home early Thursday after attending the OIC conference in Dakar, Senegal, and making a stopover in London, an airport official said. Nurul Islam, chief security officer at Zia International Airport, said Fakhruddin arrived at 2:00 am by a British Airways flight. The chief adviser left for Senegal on March 11 to attend the Dakar summit of the 57-strong platform of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. The chief adviser afterwards travelled to the UK and exchanged views with Bangladeshi expatriates on his way back home. He also met with British prime minister Gordon Brown at Downing Street and discussed bilateral issues for a better bonding between the two nations. At a meeting in London, the chief adviser called upon Bangladeshi expatriates to help build a stronger economy, and said relations between Bangladesh and the UK are multidimensional and evolving. He thanked the Bangladeshi community in the UK for their relief contributions after Cyclone Sidr hit the southern coast in November. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekher Ahmed Chowdhury, who accompanied the chief adviser, is expected to hold a press briefing Thursday on the outcome of the visit. bdnews24.com/
