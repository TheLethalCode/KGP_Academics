 MADRID, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho has been left out of the Barcelona squad to visit Valencia for their King's Cup semi-final second leg, the Primera Liga club said on Wednesday. The Brazil forward missed the 2-2 draw away to Almeria in the league on Sunday, with coach Frank Rijkaard saying the player was injured. After a scan on an adductor muscle in his right leg, the club's medical services said there was no evidence of an injury to the muscle or tendon and that Ronaldinho was suffering from "medical problems". He returned to train with the rest of the team on Wednesday morning but failed to make the squad. Yaya Toure and Gianluca Zambrotta returned to the side. Lionel Mesi, Deco, Rafael Marquez and Giovani dos Santos are injured. Barca enter Thursday's game at the Mestalla with the scores level at 1-1 from the first leg
