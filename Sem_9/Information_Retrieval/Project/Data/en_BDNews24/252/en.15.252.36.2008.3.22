<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Some 118 BNP leaders Saturday demanded the release of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina before March 26, the Independence Day. They also demanded that Khaleda's two sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman be freed. In a press briefing held at Khandaker Delwar Hossain's residence, BNP joint secretary general Selima Rahman placed the demand within a 10-point charter. "Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina's only 'crime' has been to head the two major political parties of the country," Selima said. "The government has detained them on charges of corruption because they did not agree to remain outside the country according to the wishes of the caretaker government." "Khaleda Zia's two sons are awaiting death in jail. They will not escape from the country if they are released," the joint secretary general claimed. Former BNP lawmaker Md Shahjahan said: "We want Khaleda Zia and her family to be freed immediately. We hope the government will create a favourable atmosphere for elections by releasing the two leaders." The other demands also include announcement of a timeframe for national elections ahead of local government elections, lifting of the state of emergency, distribution of essentials such as rice, pulses and flour at prices within people's reach, introduction of food-for-work programmes for the rural people and fair price cards for low-income earners in the city. Questioned by reporters, Md Shahjahan said: "The matter of harmony within BNP is in the hands of Saifur Rahman and Hafizuddin Ahmed. Let us see what they do." "The grassroots workers of BNP are with Khandaker Delwar Hossain. They (Saifur and Hafiz) have to accept the reality." The party will send the chief adviser a memorandum on the release of their chairperson in a day or two, Shahjahan said. bdnews24
