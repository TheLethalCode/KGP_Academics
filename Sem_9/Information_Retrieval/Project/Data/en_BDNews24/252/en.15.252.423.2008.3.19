 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of England said it isn't aware of a problem at any British bank, in a rare response on Wednesday to market speculation that HBOS or another big name faced trouble as the financial market crisis deepens. "No meetings have taken place or been scheduled to discuss problems with any institution in the UK," a BoE spokesman said. HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender through its Halifax brand, also dismissed the speculation, saying it had an "exceptionally strong balance sheet" and continued to access wholesale funding. Its shares slumped as much as 17 percent to a record low of 398 pence earlier on Wednesday, and by 1113 GMT were still down 10.5 percent at 430p. Shares in rivals Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley also both fell over 5 percent as dealers cited talk that higher funding costs were heaping pressure on banks facing a UK economic slowdown and more potential losses on risky U.S. assets. The chatter reflects a jittery mood still swirling around the UK banks, dealers and analysts said. A 3/4-point cut in U.S. interest rates late on Tuesday offered only brief respite for stocks. The latest sell-off is also likely to prompt an investigation by the Financial Services Authority, according to a person familiar with the situation. He said stocks are swinging wildly on false speculation, giving speculators the opportunity to profit from selling the shares "short" before buying them back later. The BoE spokesman said rumours that the central bank's Governor Mervyn King or any other senior executive had cancelled a trip to the Far East due to a possible problem were "complete fantasy". King deferred a trip to England's West Midlands on Tuesday to monitor general market developments after the weekend bail-out of U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns, he said. A crisis at Northern Rock six months ago was sparked by its failure to raise funds in wholesale markets following a credit crunch, and this week's fire sale of Bear Stearns has heightened concern there could be more casualties. A spokesman for HBOS said: "We're a very diversified business with an exceptionally strong balance sheet." As the biggest savings provider in Britain it has access to "a deep pool of retail deposits", he said, adding: "We continue to access wholesale markets whenever we feel it is appropriate to do so. We are one of the best names in the capital markets." HBOS shares have lost over half their value since the end of July, and have tumbled 40 percent this year alone, compared with a 15 percent fall for the UK bank sector since the start of the year. Analysts said concerns about the impact of a slowing UK housing market and commercial property market, its exposure to US Alt-A mortgages, and rising funding costs had hurt HBOS. The interbank cost of borrowing three-month sterling hit a fresh high for the year on Tuesday, rising for an 8th successive day to 5.97250 percent. Lending has slowed amid worries about counterparty risks, making banks wary about lending to one another. The BoE said on Wednesday it had not made any loans through its standing facility in the previous trading sessi
