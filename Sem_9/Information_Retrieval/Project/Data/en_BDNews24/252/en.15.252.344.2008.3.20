 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com) Foreign Adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Thursday urged business communities in Malaysia and Bangladesh to help workers overcome harsh labour condition in Malaysia. "Some of our workers face harsh condition in Malaysia. I urge the chambers of the two countries to solve the problems," Iftekhar said while inaugurating an exhibition of Malaysian products at Hotel Sheraton. Mentioning some progress in the matter, the foreign adviser said: "The Malaysian government has assured us that the Bangladeshi workers will be able to switch from one company to other." Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia were not previously able to join a new recruiting agency other than the original, according to that country's labour laws. As the workers could not switch, the recruiting companies were reportedly free to exploit the overseas workers. Over 3 lakh 85 thousand Bangladeshis works in Malaysia, according to figures of the ministry of expatriates' welfare and overseas employment. The foreign adviser also said the government was thinking of signing a free trade agreement with Malaysia. Referring to a huge trade gap, the adviser said Bangladeshi exports to Malaysia amounted to about $70 million, while Malaysia's exports here totalled over $360 million in 2006. He urged the Malaysian government to take necessary steps to narrow the trade gap. The "Showcase Malaysia 2008" exhibition was organised by the joint Bangladesh-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BMCCI). A total of 67 Malaysian companies are taking part in the exhibition. Home secretary Abdul Karim, Malaysian high commissioner Dato Abdul Malek bin Abdul Aziz and BMCCI secretary general Syed Moazzem Hossain also spoke at the exhibition's inauguration. bdn
