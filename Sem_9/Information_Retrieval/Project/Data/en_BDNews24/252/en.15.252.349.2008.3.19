<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  The leading Dhaka clubs have recently decided not to recruit national football captain Hasan Al Mamun in the upcoming professional football league following his comments against club officials. "No club will rope in Hasan Al Mamun for the upcoming professional football league following his heinous comments against his guardian- like club officials," read a statement Wednesday. It said that the decision was made on March 17 at a meeting of eight top Dhaka clubs, including Abahani, Mohammedan, Muktijoddha and Brothers Union. It was reported that Mamun told a national daily on March 14, "the country's football is hostage to the clubs and the government doesn't look after it just because it is a sport. The government should detain persons responsible for it." "It is not only a violation of decency and courtesy, but also a disgrace to the clubs, and we condemn and protest his comments," said the club statement. However, Mamun, denying the allegation, said, "I was misquoted and I have already protested the story and apologised to the club officials, who are like my guardians." "Now, I am on the way to meeting the clubs officials to make them understand that it is not possible for me to make such comments against them," added the national defender.
