<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will play five one-day internationals against Pakistan in Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad and Karachi, said a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official. "The Bangladesh team will play their first two games in Lahore followed by matches in Multan, Faisalabad and Karachi. The Twenty20 game will also be played in Karachi." PCB spokesman was quoted as saying by the Daily Times Thursday. The PCB have arranged the series after Cricket Australia decided to postpone their tour to Pakistan because of security fears, which have escalated since the death of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December. He was also quoted, "The Bangladesh Cricket Board has agreed on the tour which is being arranged to fill the gap caused due to Australia's pull-out from their scheduled tour earlier this month." The report also said that the Tigers would arrive in Pakistan to play five ODIs and a Twenty20 International between April 6 and 22. Bangladesh are currently involved in a three-match one-day international series against Ireland and have already clinched the series Thursday with a match to go. The third and final match will be held on March 22 at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
