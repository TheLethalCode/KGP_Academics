<TITLE> Lithuanian's disappearance dogs EU-Russia ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brussels, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The disappearance of a Lithuanian businessman in Russia has added a new snag to efforts to launch long-stalled negotiations on closer ties between the European Union and Moscow, EU diplomats said. Lithuania is the last country holding up a mandate to start talks on a wide-ranging strategic partnership agreement spanning trade, economic development, energy, human rights and political cooperation, after Poland signalled it will lift its veto. The main cause is Moscow's suspension of oil supplies to a Lithuanian refinery since 2006, ostensibly for pipeline repairs, after a Polish company bought the plant. But diplomats say Vilnius has now added the case of Stanislovas Jucys, a Lithuanian businessman and CEO of a Kaliningrad-based construction company with a majority stake in Lithuanian hands, who disappeared last April. Lithuanian media have speculated he may have been kidnapped and killed over a business dispute or after refusing to pay protection money to criminals in the Russian Baltic province -- an exclave inside EU territory. Lithuania raised the issue at a meeting of EU ambassadors on the negotiating mandate on Wednesday. "Lithuania has offered Russia its assistance and to send experts to help the investigation. But unfortunately Russia has not informed us about the circumstances of the case yet," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Violeta Gazauskaite. "Regretfully, we have not seen the sort of cooperation you would expect from a neighbour." Russian diplomats were not available for comment. Jucys' replacement was killed a few months later, and the company was taken over by a Russian firm. "This disappearance should be a concern not only for Lithuania, but also for the European Union, because he was also a citizen of the European Union," said a senior Lithuanian diplomat, who declined to be identified. Warsaw blocked the opening of EU-Russia negotiations in November 2006 over a Russian ban on imports of meat and other food products from Poland. But it has signalled it will drop its veto after Moscow lifted the embargo and the EU agreed to annex a statement on energy security to the mandate. Diplomats said EU president Slovenia was still hopeful of getting the mandate approved at a foreign ministers' meeting on April 28 after a strategic discussion on future relations with Russia at an informal session in Slovenia next week.
