 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - Hasina is scheduled to appear in court Sunday for a hearing in the graft case involving the setting up of three barge-mount power plants, a senior jail official said Saturday. Deputy inspector general of prisons Maj Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "She has not said anything regarding her court appearance up to now; so we suppose she is going to court tomorrow (Sunday)." "She is set to appear in court straight from Square Hospital and then be returned to the hospital." "Square Hospital authorities will submit a report to court, though not the final one, on how many tests Hasina has undergone since her admission to the hospital," Siddiqui said. Professor Sanwar Hossain, chief of the doctors' panel treating Hasina at the hospital, told bdnews24.com that there would be some further tests carried out on Sunday. He was doubtful whether the final report on Hasina's health, which hospital authorities are supposed to present Sunday at a press conference, would be ready on time. bdnews24.com
