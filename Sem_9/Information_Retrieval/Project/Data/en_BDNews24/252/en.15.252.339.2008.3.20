 BERLIN, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich scored two second-half goals to beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0 in the German Cup semi-final on Wednesday. France playmaker Franck Ribery and Miroslav Klose scored to lead the home side to victory over Wolfsburg, with former Bayern coach Felix Magath in charge, and into the final next month against Borussia Dortmund. Bayern, who went into the game on a two-match losing streak, went ahead when Ribery caught up with a through ball from Germany striker Klose on the hour and beat Diego Benaglio with a crisp low shot between the Wolfsburg goalkeeper's legs. Six minutes later an unmarked Klose tapped in from the right after Benaglio was only able to knock down a Lukas Podolski shot from the left, keeping alive Bayern's hopes of three titles this season in the German Cup, Bundesliga and UEFA Cup. Dortmund beat second division Carl Zeiss Jena 3-0 in the first semi on Tuesday
