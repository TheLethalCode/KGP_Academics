 ALMATY, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan's first kosher restaurant opened its doors for business on Wednesday in what Jewish community leaders said was a symbol of their culture's revival in the mainly Muslim Central Asian state. Kazakhstan, a steppe nation of 15 million with nomadic roots, has prided itself on being relatively tolerant towards other religions compared with other ex-Soviet states. Kazakhstan's chief Rabbi Yeshayah Cohen recited a prayer and greeted community members as the brick-and-wood tavern, called "Kosher" and financed by private investors, opened in the Kazakhstan's financial capital Almaty.

Jewish communities have coexisted with Kazakhs and Uzbeks for 2,000 years. The political upheavals of Soviet rule made more than a million of Jews abandon their homes across the former Soviet Union to look for better lives in Israel and Western Europe, although there are no official numbers on Central Asia. Community leaders in Kazakhstan said some are now coming back, lured by Kazakhstan's double-digit economic growth and echoing a similar trend in Russia. "Jews always felt at home here, even in Soviet times," Ichay said.
