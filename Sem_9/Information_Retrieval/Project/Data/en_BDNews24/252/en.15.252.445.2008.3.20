<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest nightclub operator, Luminar Plc, said on Thursday trading so far this year had been tough and that it was cutting the number of new clubs it planned to open by 2010. Shares in the firm, which runs chains such as Oceana, Liquid and Lava, fell 7.7 percent to a five-year low of 269 pence by 1043 GMT, valuing the firm at 290 million pounds ($579 million). Britain's clubs and bars are struggling with a downturn in consumer spending at a time when revellers face higher bills and living costs. "With trading likely to deteriorate further over the coming months and with consensus forecasts also likely to move down, we think Luminar shares will underperform even despite the group's attractive value," Numis Securities analysts said in a note, cutting their rating on Luminar's stock to "Hold" from "Buy". Luminar said like-for-like sales from its continuing businesses within the dancing division were up 1.6 percent in the year ended Feb. 28, with like-for-like sales from its branded clubs up 4.8 percent. It said results for that period would be in line with expectations. An average of 10 analysts' forecasts compiled by Reuters Esimates is for pretax profits to fall 3 percent to 29.7 million pounds. "Given the current market conditions the board has decided to focus only on sites in prime target towns that are expected to deliver excellent returns," Luminar said in a statement. The group added that the tighter focus on venues would reduce its capital spending requirements by 12 million pounds in 2008-9 and 10 million in 2009-10. "The decision to tighten up the capital expenditure programme is sensible and leaves flexibility to accelerate when market conditions improve," Greg Feehely, analyst at Altium Securities said in a note. Luminar, which runs smaller pubs and live music venues as well as bigger clubs, said it would reach a target of 110 venues during 2010, below the 116 it had proposed before. The firm has struggled to attract smokers since the ban on smoking in clubs and bars in England and Wales in July 2007. It said clubs without a "good smoking solution" were being outperformed by more smoker-friendly venu
