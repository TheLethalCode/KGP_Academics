 Washington, March 20 (bdnews24.com)The US Wednesday urged Bangladesh caretaker government to start dialogue with political parties ahead of year-end general elections. The US extended support to the ongoing anticorruption drive and underlined the need for lifting the ban on political assemblies. "While the government's progress on updating the voter list and combating corruption is encouraging, we urge the government to move forward on its dialogue with political parties and to remove restrictions on freedoms of assembly and the press," Tom Casey, deputy spokesman for the US State Department, said in a press briefing. "The United States urges the Bangladesh government to uphold its commitment to hold free, fair, and transparent elections by December 2008," he said. Stressing the elections by the December deadline, Casey referred to the reaffirmation of the polls by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in the March 18 joint statement with British prime minister Gordon Brown. "Political parties must be able to participate fully in a democratic process," Casey said. bdnews
