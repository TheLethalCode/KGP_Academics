 BEIJING, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese police opened fire and wounded four protesters this week in unrest in a Tibetan community in the western province of Sichuan, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. Citing police sources, the state-run news agency said police acted in self-defence when they fired on protesters on Sunday. It is China's first admission its security forces have caused injuries in their crackdown on anti-government demonstrations. Tibet authorities also said they had arrested dozens of people involved in the wave of protests that have swept the mountain region and prompted Beijing to pour in troops to crush further unrest. China's response to last week's violence -- which it says was orchestrated by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader -- has sparked international criticism and has clouded preparations for the Beijing Olympics in August. Earlier on Thursday, in a phone call with her Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice "strongly urged" China to show restraint toward protesters, and to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama. China says 13 "innocent civilians" were killed in riots last week in Tibet's capital Lhasa that capped several days of peaceful protests. Exiled Tibetan groups say as many as 100 Tibetans have died. Mindful of the legacy of its military crackdown on pro-democracy protests on Tiananmen Square in 1989, China says its security forces in Lhasa exercised "maximum restraint" and did not use lethal weapons. But the Xinhua report makes clear the same did not apply in other parts of western China, where it has been sealing Tibetan areas from foreigners and tightening security. State television broadcast on Thursday pictures of protests in Sichuan and Gansu provinces, both home to Tibetan communities, which showed men on horseback shouting Tibet independence slogans, burning cars and raising the Tibetan flag. The report said the situation was now calm and showed pictures of barricades and police in riot gear. In Gansu's Gannan region, eight police and three government officials were injured in the unrest, it said. In Kangding, a Tibetan town in Sichuan, roads were crowded with troops who blocked most travel. Notices on walls warned locals not to protest and to stay away from the "Dalai clique". ARRESTS In Lhasa, the prosecutor's office said 24 people faced charges of "endangering national security as well as beating, smashing, looting, arson and other grave crimes" in Friday's riots, the Tibet Daily reported. They were the first arrests since rioting erupted across the remote region. Some outside groups say hundreds of Tibetans may have already been detained, and the China News Service reported Lhasa has broadcast wanted pictures of more suspects. "The facts of the crimes are clear and the evidence is solid, and they should be severely punished," a Lhasa deputy chief prosecutor, Xie Yanjun, said. Xinhua reported that so far more than 170 people involved in the riots have given themselves up. "Most of the people who surrendered themselves were ordinary members of the public who did not understand the true situation," it said. China's unyielding response to the unrest has brought demands for a boycott of the opening ceremony for the Aug. 8-24 Games from pro-Tibetan independence groups and some politicians. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said there was no change in U.S. President George W. Bush's plans to attend the ceremony, and said the spotlight on Beijing could be a good thing. "... That way the Chinese can hear how people feel and then maybe have an opportunity to either explain their position or maybe even change the things that they are doing," Perino said. The Olympic torch relay across 19 countries that starts next week, and which will also pass through Tibet, is also likely to be dogged by protests. "READY FOR TALKS" A special sitting of the European Parliament is expected to take place next week and many EU lawmakers are calling for some kind of European action over the Olympics, ranging from a snub of the opening ceremony to an outright boycott of the Games. The Chinese government has resisted international calls for dialogue over the unrest and expressed serious concern that British Prime Minister Gordon Brown plans to meet the Dalai Lama during a visit to Britain in May. "If those acts can be tolerated, is there any law in the world? Is there any justice in the world?" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a news conference when asked to respond to a call for dialogue from Pope Benedict. The Dalai Lama, speaking in his exile home in the Indian town of Dharamsala, said he was ready to travel to Beijing to meet Chinese leaders, calling on Tibetans to end the violence. Beijing has long said it would meet him only if he forsakes claims to Tibet's independence. The 72-year-old monk says he just wants greater autonomy for his homeland. China has struggled to convince the international community that the Nobel Peace Prize winner orchestrated the violence and its own policies are free from blame. In Hungary, police detained one person after a window in China's embassy was broken by a stone hurled during a rally of about 200 people calling for freedom in Tibet, the state news agency MTI said. In San Francisco, officials are investigating a minor fire that charred a metallic roll-up garage door of the Chinese consulate but did not cause any structural dama
