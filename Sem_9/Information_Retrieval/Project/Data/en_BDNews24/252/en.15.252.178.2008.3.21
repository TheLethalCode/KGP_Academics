 Washington, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Friday she had telephoned Sen. Barack Obama to apologize for the fact that three State Department contract workers improperly looked at his passport files. "I told him that I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if I learned that somebody had looked into my passport file," Rice told reporters at the start of a meeting with Brazil's defense minister.
