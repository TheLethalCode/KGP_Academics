 RABAT, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Morocco called on Algeria on Thursday to normalise relations between the North African neighbours and reopen the border closed 14 years ago. Rabat's move came two days after Morocco and Algeria-backed Western Sahara's Polisario independence movement ended a fourth round of talks near New York without narrowing differences on Africa's longest-running territorial dispute.
