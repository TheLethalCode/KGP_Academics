 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)The government Wednesday granted the Sector Commanders' Forum (SCF) permission to hold its March 21 convention to drum up support for the trial of alleged war criminals. "The government has given us permission to hold our convention on March 21," retired major general Jamil D Ahsan, coordinator of the SCF, told bdnews24.com. The police emphasised that the convention must be peaceful and the members must not violate the guidelines set under the state of emergency. "We have repeatedly assured the government that the convention will be peaceful," said Jamil, who picked up the permission letter from the police Wednesday. The SCF had applied to the police to hold the convention on March 16 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. But the government rejected the SCF application on March 13. Later, the forum vowed to hold the convention at any cost saying it would hold the convention at whatever spot the police and the law enforcers obstructed. bdn
