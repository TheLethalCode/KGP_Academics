 LONDON/MADRID, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Airways said on Wednesday it had bought about another 3 percent of Spanish flag carrier Iberia, taking its stake to 13.15 percent, and would look for chances to buy more shares. Iberia stock jumped on the news and at 1136 GMT was up 2.9 percent at 2.49 euros, the only European travel stock gaining after rival easyJet issued a profit warning. BA said it bought about 28.7 million Iberia shares at an average of 2.34 euros. At that price, the acquisition would have cost a total of about 67 million euros ($105.3 million). "This purchase reflects the strategic importance we attach to our relationship with Iberia and our continued confidence in its management," said BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh. "We will consider further opportunities to increase our stake." Iberia, which made net profit of 328 million euros last year thanks to its highly profitable Latin American routes, declined to comment on BA's share purchase. BA, which has a partnership with American Airlines, has long wanted to beef up amid ever fiercer competition. News of its Iberia buy comes days after larger rival Air France-KLM launched a bid for loss-mired Alitalia. Last year, BA and private equity group TPG looked at buying Iberia, offering an indicative price of 3.60 euros a share, but they pulled out when savings bank Caja Madrid bought out other shareholders to take its stake to 23 percent. When BA joined the TPG consortium, it said it would not put any more of its own money into Iberia and ruled out making an independent bid for the company which has a code-sharing deal with BA on flights between Britain and Spain. Since then, Iberia's shares have lost about a third of their value as the takeover premium evaporated given Caja Madrid's stake-building and the effect of the credit crunch on funding and as higher oil prices threatened airlines' earnings. "BA raising its stake is going to unleash M&A speculation on Iberia again," said one Madrid-based trader. Last month, Walsh said BA was in talks with Caja Madrid about the future of Iberia and would try to strengthen relationships at the Spanish airline, which is part of the One World alliance with BA and American Airlines.
