 LONDON, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somerset batsman Marcus Trescothick announced his retirement from international cricket with England due to health problems on Saturday. "My desire to play cricket is as strong as it ever was. But, due to the problems that I have experienced, travelling abroad has become extremely stressful for me," he told Somerset's Web site (www.somersetcountycc.co.uk). Trescothick has long suffered from a stress-related illness and pulled out of England's 2006 tours to India and Australia, where the tourists were thrashed in the Ashes series. The problems recurred again recently, leading to his withdrawal from the county's pre-season tour to Dubai, Somerset said in a statement. "I have tried on numerous occasions to make it back to the international stage and it has proved a lot more difficult than I expected," the 32-year-old former England opening batsman said. "I want to extend my playing career for as long as possible and I no longer want to put myself through the questions and demands that go with trying to return to the England team. "I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing for England, and I am very proud of having been selected for 76 test matches and over 120 ODIs. "It has been a great privilege to represent my country and I am grateful to the game of cricket for giving me the opportunity to excel at a sport that I enjoy so much." Trescothick said he would now "concentrate all my efforts on playing well for Somerset. It is a very big season for the club and I am looking forward very much to playing a full part." In his 76 tests, Trescothick scored a total of 5,825 runs, at an average of 43.79. He played in 122 one-day international innings, getting 4,335 runs, with an average of 37.37
