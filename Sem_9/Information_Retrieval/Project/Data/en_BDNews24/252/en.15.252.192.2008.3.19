<TITLE> Prospect of April rate cut in Britain rises </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chance of a British interest rate cut next month rose sharply on Wednesday after news a top Bank of England official had turned dove in a turbulent market. With global markets in turmoil, central bankers cancelled speeches they were due to make around the country and stayed in London to monitor the crisis more closely. The Bank of England took the highly unusual step of responding to market speculation by saying that it was not aware of any problem at any British bank as the financial market crisis deepened. The big surprise of the day was the revelation in the minutes of the March 5-6 Monetary Policy Committee that John Gieve, the BoE's financial stability supremo, had joined arch-dove David Blanchflower in calling for a pre-emptive cut. "Given further deterioration in market conditions since the beginning of March and signs of tighter lending standards we now believe that a majority of members will judge that risks have tilted sufficiently to the downside to warrant a 25bp rate cut at the April meeting," said Peter Newland at Lehman Brothers. Sterling fell after the minutes were published as investors priced in rate cuts sooner than expected. Markets are already expecting as many as four quarter-point cuts this year but nothing as drastic as the savage slashing of rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve as it fights fears of a global recession. GIEVE TURNS DOVE Gieve, whose job is to monitor fluctuating markets and keep the British financial system on an even keel, decided it would have been better to act sooner rather than later because of the risk of Britain catching cold from a U.S. recession.

The BoE has a remit above all else to keep inflation at 2 percent and policymakers don't want markets to get ahead of themselves in predicting too many cuts as price pressures are rising strongly. The majority were worried that soaring food and energy prices would soon push up inflation, already half a percentage point above the central bank's target. The weakness of the pound, which hit a 11-year low in trade-weighted terms this week, was adding to inflation worries for the economy at large but is boosting manufacturers. A survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed manufacturers' orders book unexpectedly picking up thanks to better export demand. Another factor to hit the pound on Wednesday was softer than expected average earnings data as financial sector bonuses this year were lower than in 2007. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose Labour Party's popularity has slumped to a 25-year low in opinion polls, sought to calm voters worried about a tighter mortgage market and soaring food and energy prices. He warned of a tough time for the global economy and financial markets, but, writing in The Sun newspaper, said the British economy was more resilient than ever before and was able to weather the sto
