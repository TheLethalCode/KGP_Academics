<TITLE> 4.4 quake rattles Dhaka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  A mild quake rattled the capital city of Dhaka shortly after 7pm Thursday. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 4.4 on the Richter scale, was also recorded in Narayanganj, Mymensingh and Tangail, Meteorological Department chief Samarendra Karmakar told bdnews24.com. Syed Humayun Aktar, a geology professor at Dhaka University, said the quake's epicentre was located 93 kilometres north-northwest of Dhaka. Prof Humayun based his data on readings from the earth observatory at the university. The professor said there was a risk that the earthquake might be a preamble to a larger quake. bdnews24.com's Narayanganj correspondent said the quake was felt twice in the town: "Many panicked residents came out of their homes after the quake jolted the town for a second time." The most recent major quake in Bangladesh jolted the southeast region of the country on Nov 7 last year. The Meteorological Department described last November's event, centred around Roninpara, about 70km southeast of the Chittagong Seismic Observation Centre, as "a strong earthquake" measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale. Bangladesh, part of the Bengal basin at the confluence of India, Burma and Eurasia, lies in one of the most seismically active zones of the world. However, a relatively long period of "rest" from any major seismic activity, and high attention paid to other disasters such as cyclones and floods, say experts, have led to neglect of disaster preparedness for earthquakes -- the most destructive of all natural disasters. The Bangladesh Earthquake Society has warned in the past that a major earthquake centred on Dhaka or in its close proximity could destroy 28 percent of buildings and structures in the capital. bdnews24.c
