<TITLE> Chad censured for forcing out French correspondent </TITLE>

 Dakar, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An international press freedom watchdog has criticised Chad's government for effectively forcing the only permanent foreign correspondent in the country to leave by withdrawing the French journalist's work permit. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Sonia Rolley, who reported for Radio France International and the Agence France Presse news agency, left N'Djamena on Thursday because the government suspended her accreditation. The decision followed an assault by anti-government rebels against the capital N'Djamena early in February, which Rolley, 27, was one of the few correspondents to report on the spot as it was taking place. She had worked in Chad since October 2006. President Idriss Deby's government suspended Rolley's accreditation when a state of emergency was declared in the landlocked former French colony on Feb. 14 after the rebel raid. The government gave no public explanation but her work permit was not renewed when the emergency, which allowed authorities to control media coverage, was lifted on Sunday. "Chadian authorities clearly want to silence a prominent correspondent whose coverage was widely followed at home and abroad," CPJ executive director Joel Simon said in a statement issued late on Friday. CPJ said it had written to President Deby earlier this month to express alarm at increasing government restrictions against Chad's independent media. The group said fear of government reprisals, threats, the closure of a prominent radio station and amendments to the press law criminalising critical coverage had prompted at least 14 Chadian journalists to flee into exile in recent weeks. International human rights groups have accused Chadian security forces of arbitrary arrests and of abuses against civilians in the wake of the fighting in early February around and in the capital, which Deby said killed some 700 people. Under pressure from France and the European Union, Deby has announced the launch of an investigation into the events of the Feb. 2-3 rebel attack on N'Djamena, during which several prominent opposition leaders were taken from their homes by uniformed soldiers. At least one is still missing. Chad has in the past often accused neighbour Sudan of backing and directing cross-border attacks by the rebels from Sudanese territory, a charge routinely denied by Khartoum, which says Deby has supported rebels in Sudan's Darfur region. Deby and his Sudanese counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir signed a non-aggression pact last week in Dakar, Senegal, the latest in a string of bilateral peace accords.
