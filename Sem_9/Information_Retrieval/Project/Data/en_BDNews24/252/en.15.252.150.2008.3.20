 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Thursday sentenced Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar chairman Atiqullah Khan Masud to seven years in prison for fraud. Judge Khondokar Kamal Uzzaman of the Special Judge's Court-9, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises, also sentenced Rajuk official ATM Quamruzzaman to seven years in jail. The court slapped a combined fine of Tk 8.70 crore on the two. Masud, also editor of Bangla-language daily Janakantha, is in jail, while Quamruzzaman is on the run. Joint forces arrested Masud on March 7 last year. Anticorruption Commission deputy assistant director Mahmud Hassan on Sept 30 last year filed the case with Motijheel Police Station against the accused for their roles in approving the design of a building illegally. According to case details, Atiqullah submitted a design of a 15-storey building to be constructed at Segunbagicha to Rajuk. But he managed to collect a fake approval with the help of two Rajuk officials Quamruzzaman and Sohrab Miah. The two officials obtained profit of Tk 8.70 crore. Three individuals were made accused in the case though the name of Sohrab Miah, was taken off the charge sheet. The same court on March 6 and March 9 sentenced Masud to seven years in jail in two other fraud cases. bdnew
