 SEATTLE, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Starbucks Corp outlined long-awaited plans to turn around its business on Wednesday, but a new coffee roast and loyalty program for frequent customers failed to excite investors, who sent shares down nearly 3 percent. Starbucks said it will woo cash-strapped consumers by roasting coffee a new way, investing in new espresso equipment, and delving into new categories, such as the health and wellness business by the end of the year. But Chief Executive Howard Schultz, who has said stores need to become less like chains, told the annual meeting that the US economy was in a tailspin, and there was no "silver bullet" for Starbucks, whose stock has dropped 40 percent over the last 12 months. He said Starbucks would not use the state of the economy as an excuse. Earlier this year, Schultz said Starbucks would close underperforming stores and cut its 2008 new store plan in the United States to 1,175 from 1,600, while increasing the number of international store openings by 75 outlets to 975. In January, sales at established US stores fell 1 percent. On Wednesday, Schultz said Starbucks' plan offered solutions to "reaffirm our coffee authority" and make the chain feel less corporate. For instance, Baristas will be able to see customers over new low machines. A new coffee blend is scheduled for an April debut, and a Web site, http://www.mystarbucksidea.com, will allow customers to submit ideas to the company and to vote on them. Under the loyalty program due to begin in mid-April, consumers will purchase their coffee, but extras like caramel sauce or soy milk will be free, Starbucks said. Schultz also apologized for Starbucks' recent performance. "I humbly recognize and share both your concern and your disappointment in how the company has performed and how that has affected your investment in Starbucks," Schultz told investors. "I promise you this will not stand." The decline in US customer traffic in November was the first in Starbucks history. Cash-strapped consumers are cutting back on Starbucks $3 to $5 coffee drinks as the costs of gasoline and other essentials rise, while competitors nibble away at different segments of the $25 billion-plus US specialty coffee market that Starbucks carved out. McDonald's Corp has aggressively entered the drip coffee market and plans to roll out more expensive espresso drinks. Starbucks now has about 10,000 US stores and some 5,000 international locations. The brand has become such a part of mainstream life that some analysts say it is struggling to offer consumers something special. Shares of Starbucks were down 3.29 percent at $17.64 late Wednesday afternoon on the Nasd
