 ROME, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second-half goals by Mauro Camoranesi and David Trezeguet gave Juventus a 2-1 win at Serie A leaders Inter Milan on Saturday, while second-placed AS Roma beat Empoli 2-1 to move within four points of the champions. Portugal midfielder Maniche pulled one back for Inter seven minutes from time to set up a tense finish after Brazilian Maicon had danced through the Juve defence. Earlier on Saturday, Christian Panucci headed 10-man Roma to victory shortly after Simone Perrotta was sent off in the 57th minute, giving them 64 points from 30 games, six more than third-placed Juve. Empoli's Sebastian Giovinco had levelled after Max Tonetto's first-half opener. Fiorentina consolidated fourth place, worth a slot in the Champions League qualifiers, by beating 10-man Lazio 1-0 at home thanks to Giampaolo Pazzini's second-half goal. AC Milan remain four points behind the Florence side in fifth after Alexandre Pato gave them a 1-0 win at Torino. After Inter had created the better first-half chances at San Siro, Camoranesi fired Juve in front four minutes after the break although television replays suggested the midfielder picked up Cristian Molinaro's pass from an offside position. French striker Trezeguet ran onto a loose back header by Argentine defender Nicolas Burdisso and volleyed home to double Juve's advantage in the 63rd. Alessandro Del Piero, who on Saturday equalled Gaetano Scirea's record of 552 appearances for Juventus, wasted three good chances to make it 3-0 before Maniche's goal. Maniche then came close to equalising when he hit the post in stoppage time. Inter coach Roberto Mancini was upbeat despite the defeat. "We have an advantage, we have eight games left, hopefully we'll regain some players this week and I think we can win all eight," Mancini, who was without injured midfielders Patrick Vieira and Esteban Cambiasso, told Sky television. In heavy rain at the Stadio Olimpico, fullback Tonetto fired Roma ahead in the 36th minute after being set up by captain Francesco Totti's smart backheel. Giovinco was rewarded with a goal five minutes after the break following his eforts in the first half, during which he hit the post with the latter of three fine strikes, only for Panucci to give the home side three precious points. In Florence, Fiorentina pressed hard after Lazio midfielder Massimo Mutarelli was sent off in the 37th after two bookings in quick succession, although the Romans were dangerous on the counter attack. Pazzini settled the game with a right-footed shot from the edge of the area 13 minutes from time. European champions Milan came close with free kicks by Andrea Pirlo and Clarence Seedorf in the first half in Turin, while Alberto Gilardino and Pato squandered good chances. After the break, Seedorf hit the bar and Gilardino fluffed another fine opportunity before 18-year-old Brazilian Pato tapped the ball in after 66 minutes
