 SYDNEY, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stephanie Rice and Emily Seebohm both set world records on the opening night of the Australian Olympic trials on Saturday. Rice demolished American Katie Hoff's 400 metres individual medley record while Seebohm broke Hayley McGregor's mark for 50 backstroke, an event not contested at the Olympics. The 19-year-old Rice established herself as the early favourite to win gold in Beijing when she stopped the clock at four minutes 31.46 seconds, slashing 1.43 off the previous record of 4:32.89, set by Hoff at last year's world championships in Melbourne. "This is amazing, I really didn't know I was going that fast," Rice said in a televised poolside interview. "It's unbelievable, to break a world record has been my great goal since I was a baby." Rice, whose boyfriend Eamon Sullivan set the 50 freestyle world record last month, burst on to the international swimming scene at the 2006 Commonwealth Games when she won the 200-400 medley double as a 17-year-old. She finished third in both events at last year's world championships but hacked almost six seconds off her personal best to break the world record. "I would have been happy just going to the Olympics," she said. "When I was younger I always wanted to be someone special who people looked up to...but I always knew that I was going to be a swimmer because I loved it so much." Seebohm, 15, came within 0.01 of breaking the world record during a Catholic schoolgirls meet in Brisbane earlier this month. McGregory broke the record a few days later but her mark only lasted 13 days. Despite breaking the record, Seebohm needs to finish either first or second in the 100 backstroke -- an Olympic event -- to make the team for Beijing. The two records overshadowed the performances of two of Australia's best-known swimmers, Grant Hackett and Libby Trickett (nee Lenton), who is competing for the first time under her married name. Hackett, who struggled last year after undergoing shoulder surgery in 2006, won the 400 freestyle in 3:43.15, his fastest time in three years. Craig Stevens finished second to secure his place in the team four years after he gave up his spot to his good friend Ian Thorpe, who stumbled at the blocks and was disqualified, and went on to win the gold. "I will take this one," Stevens said. "I was ducking and weaving (the media last time) but this is a different situation and Ian sent me a text just wishing me all the best." Trinkett, who won five gold medals at last year's world championships, posted the fastest time in the semi-finals of the women's 100 butterfly, just ahead of Jessicah Schipper. She said the pair would have a crack at Inge de Bruijn's world record on Sunday night. "I would love to see it go down, whether it is by me or by Jess or someone out of the woodwork, it is eight years old and it is time for a change," she said
