<TITLE> Tigers look to seal ODI series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh are looking forward to sealing the three-ODI series with a match to go when they take on Ireland in the second one-dayer at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Thursday. "We all eye to clinch the series through winning the second match tomorrow," Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful told reporters at a pre-match briefing in Mirpur Wednesday. "We are walking forward to the series win after a long time and it will be not tough for us if we can play our potential like on the first one-dayer," said the Bangladesh skipper. Bangladesh have won seven series -- three against Zimbabwe, two against Kenya, one against Scotland and a tri-nation series involving Bangladesh, Bermuda and Canada. "We didn't do well against South Africa in recent series, but now everyone wants to win the series against Ireland. So, it is very important for us to clinch it," said Ashraful. Tuesday's eight-wicket win over Ireland was certainly a sort of boost and a big relief for the Tigers, who had been going through a bad patch in one-day international since their stunning triumph against South Africa in the ICC World Cup in the West Indies last year. The Bangladesh skipper reiterated that they felt no pressure and all were keen to execute their game plan tomorrow also. "We tried to play in line with game plan Tuesday and we couldn't execute some sort of plans there and we all will try to apply the plan in the next two matches," said the 24-year old cricketer, who along with Shahriar Nafees steered Bangladesh home with an unbroken 130-run third wicket partnership. Ashraful wants to see the batsmen return among runs ahead of the Bangladesh tour of Pakistan, winning the next two games against the Irishmen. Asked why they failed to play to their potential against top-ranked teams, Ashraful said, "We have been working to deal with new method of the new coach and it will take some more time." Fit-again Aftab Ahmed also appeared at the briefing and said he thought that nothing extra was there in the Irish bowlers in the first match. "They were just waiting for when Bangladesh batsmen made mistakes as they had been bowling an accurate line and length," said Aftab, who threw away his wicket despite a promising start. The stylish top-order batsman promised he would try to notch a big total in the next two matches after concentrating on the game plan. The team management gave the bowlers, all-rounder and opener Shahriar Nafees rest from Wednesday's practice, but batsmen Ashraful, Aftab, Junaed Siddique, Raqibul Hasan, Nazimuddin Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah Riad had nets. The visitors didn't practice Wednesday.
