<TEXT>
 DUBLIN, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Acquisitive Irish building materials group CRH Plc will enter the Indian market after agreeing to buy 50 percent of cement maker My Home Industries Limited (MHIL) for 290 million euros ($456 million). Dublin-based CRH, which has used acquisitions to grow into one of the world's six biggest suppliers to the construction industry, said on Thursday that it expected to deal to be completed in the second quarter of 2008. "CRH and the existing owners will jointly manage MHIL and both parties will have equal board and management representation," it said. Last week the group agreed to buy U.S. concrete paving maker Pavestone for $540 million. Having spent 2.2 billion euros on 78 deals in 2007, CRH has said it hopes to at least maintain the same level of acquisition spending this year. Since its formation in 1970 through the merger of Ireland's Cement Limited and Roadstone Limited when the group had annual sales of 26 million euros, CRH has grown into a global player employing about 80,000 people in 32 countries and generated revenue of almost 21 billion euros ($33 billion) last year. CRH's primary markets are in Europe and the United States but it has increasingly been turning its attention towards Asia and said in January that it had agreed to buy 26 percent of China's Jilin Yatai Group for about 200 million euros. The company said on Thursday that privately owned MHIL's operations consisted of three cement plants at Mellacheruvu village in central Andhra Pradesh and a grinding plant under construction near Vishakapatnam on the state's coast. MHIL's current annual cement production capacity is 3.2 million tonnes and is expected to increase to 4.2 million tonnes on completion of the new plant in early 2009, CRH said. CRH said Hyderabad-based MHIL is the second biggest supplier of concrete in Andhra Pradesh. "MHIL is one of the most modern cement producers in India with excellent reserves and a strong management team," CRH Chief Executive Liam O'Mahony said in a statement. "As a first investment in India, we are delighted to be associated with such a strong company and look forward to developing the business with our partner as the Indian economy expands," he add
