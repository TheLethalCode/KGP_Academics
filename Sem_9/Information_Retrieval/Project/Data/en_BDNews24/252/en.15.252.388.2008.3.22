 Taipei, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan went to the polls on Saturday to elect a president who could usher in a new era in relations with political rival China in one of the hottest potential flashpoints in Asia. Taiwan's more than 17 million voters will choose a successor to President Chen Shui-bian, an anti-China firebrand who steps down in May and who has repeatedly angered Beijing with his pro-independence rhetoric. China has claimed self-ruled Taiwan as its territory since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has pledged to bring it under its rule, by force if necessary. Frank Hsieh's ruling Democratic Progressive Party favours formal independence while Nationalist Party candidate Ma Ying-jeou wants reunification once China embraces democracy. "Whether you vote for Hsieh or for Ma, be sure to vote for Taiwan," Chen told reporters after voting with his wife. "...Don't let Taiwan become the next Hong Kong. Don't let Taiwan become the next Tibet." The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese troops marched into Tibet, the scene of anti-Chinese rioting last week, in 1950. The polls close at 0800 GMT and a result is expected a few hours later. The election has drawn keen international attention, with the United States, Russia and Britain criticising a referendum on U.N. membership, to be held alongside the vote, which they believe could upset the delicate balance with China. Whatever the referendum result, U.N. membership is out of the question with just 23 countries recognising Taiwan, and with China a veto-wielding permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, recognising "one China", but remains the island's biggest ally. Two U.S. aircraft carriers are in the region for training exercises. China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait in 1996, trying to intimidate voters during an election. "China hopes the United States and Japan will carry out their promises of not supporting 'Taiwan independence' or Taiwan authority's proposed 'referendum on U.N. membership'," Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said in an interview with Russia's Interfax news agency. In Taiwan, a faltering economy is a priority with voters. "Domestic issues, such as the economy and corruption, are bigger than China or foreign policy," said Ralph Cossa, president of the U.S.-based think tank Pacific Forum CSIS. The two candidates have toughened their stances on China following Beijing's crackdown in Tibet, but to help the economy, both advocate more direct flights, tourism and investment opportunities between Taiwan and China. Ma advocates a common market with China. "I'd like to see us become the Switzerland of the east, not the Cuba of the east," he told a campaign rally late on Friday. Hsieh says that could cause Taiwan to be flooded by Chinese labourers and shoddy products, and the island may end up suffering the same fate as Tibet. On the campaign trail, both camps have marshalled tens of thousands of people at noisy rallies up and down the island. Both have trotted out groups of attractive young women to get attention and have run television commercials that play on voter fears such as China or a government fractured by bickering. Yet voters are smarter, more practical and more fatigued than ever by politicking, analysts say. "For me, the key topic is economic improvement," said Taiwan voter Mei Yi-ying, 60. "Most of us at our age want to work."
