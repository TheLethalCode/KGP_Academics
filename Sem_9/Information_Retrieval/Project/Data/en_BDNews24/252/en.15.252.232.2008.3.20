<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand pace bowler Kyle Mills has been ruled out of the third test against England after breaking down during training on Thursday. Mills had a scan on a niggling injury behind his left knee on Monday and declared himself fit before practice on Thursday but he broke down after bowling about two overs in the nets. Mills said he had sustained the injury during the first Twenty20 international against England in February. "It's something I haven't had before. I've had strains and tears before and I know what they feel like but this is just at the back of the knee," Mills told reporters. "It all started in the Twenty20 game back at Eden Park (which) is sand based and I dove into it and got jammed up really. "Ever since then it has been niggling me. Plus the heavy workload in the first three days of the last test, it got tired there towards the end." SLIGHT TEAR Mills said the scan had revealed a slight tear in his left calf muscle, which was causing the pain behind his knee. "I don't have an issue with my calf muscle at all. It feels fine. It's just the inflammation around that tear that is giving me some problems around the back of my knee." Teenager Tim Southee could be handed his debut after being called into the side following the second test loss at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. New Zealand, however, are contemplating taking two spinners into the test, with off-spinner Jeetan Patel vying with Southee for a place in the team. England batsman Andrew Strauss, who played with Southee for Northern Districts, said the 19-year-old had a lot of ability. "He looks like a really good talent and he does swing the ball a bit," Strauss said. "He'll be pretty excited if he makes his debut." While New Zealand have lost one frontline bowler, England's James Anderson has declared himself fit after he twisted his ankle playing soccer during the second test. Anderson, who took five wickets in New Zealand's first innings in Wellington, is still in discomfort but said it would not prevent him playing in the deciding match with the series level at 1-1
