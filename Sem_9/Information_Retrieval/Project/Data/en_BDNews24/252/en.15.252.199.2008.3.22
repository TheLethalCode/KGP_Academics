 Sylhet, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Five people died and more than 200 people were injured by a tornado that ripped through four upazilas in Sunamganj in the early hours of Saturday morning. All five were killed when their houses collapsed on them. Over 1,100 houses were damaged by the deadly twister, said district relief and rehabilitation officer Mozammel Hossain, though witnesses say the figure is higher. Local reporter Mahmudur Rahman Tarek said a heavy storm accompanied by hail began about midnight, shortly after which the tornado hit. Power supply to Sunamganj remained cut for 15 hours in the wake of the tornado after it destroyed the Chhatak-Sunamganj power line.
