 HONG KONG, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold, other metals and commodities fell sharply on Thursday as doubts about the global economy seeped into asset classes that hit record highs earlier this week. Asian shares slid on renewed credit crisis fears. Bonds in Asia gained, as risk aversion returned to the region a day after investors cheered hefty US interest rate cuts and resilient results from leading US investment banks. The dollar was mixed in choppy trade, as hopes of averting a slowdown in the United States, the world's largest economy, appeared dashed, though volumes were reduced as markets in Japan were closed for a public holiday. "We're seeing a return to reality with regard to the situation in the US," said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at CommSec in Australia. "The trend in the US remains the same, credit markets remain tight and possible writedowns can continue." The MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan fell 2.5 percent by 0212 GMT. The index dropped to its lowest since August earlier this week before rebounding on Wednesday. Shares in Australia dropped 2.8 percent as resource firms such as BHP Billiton, the world's biggest miner, slumped, while shares in China were down 2.5 percent. Markets in South Korea and Singapore fell more than 1 percent, while Taiwan's main stock index dipped 0.2 percent. Concerns about a financial credit crisis returned after Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday it sued a US bond insurer to stop it from backing out of credit guarantees, fuelling speculation the US investment bank may need to take further writedowns. Asian stocks have had a volatile week that started with worries about more casualties following the fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan & Chase But markets perked up mid-week following the US Federal Reserve's rate cut and not-as-bad-as-expected results from Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers GOLD SLUMPS Metals extended a sharp fall from the previous session amid concerns that a U.S.-led economic slowdown could undermine global demand. Analysts saw a shift to US Treasuries after a US government regulator cleared the way for the country's housing finance agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump up to $200 billion into the distressed US mortgage market. "Commodities was the one area that had been untouched by the credit chaos, but that seems to be changing," said Robert Rennie, chief currency strategist at Westpac in Australia. Gold tumbled more than 2 percent in Asian trade to its lowest level in more than a month as funds cashed in after pushing the metal to a record $1,030.80 an ounce on Monday. Bullion was last traded near $930 after hitting a session low of $922.90, the lowest since Feb. 20. Metals from platinum to silver had been routed a day earlier, with gold falling 6 percent on Wednesday in its biggest one-day percentage drop in nearly two years. The falls spread to commodities, with the Reuters-Jefferies CRB Index hitting a 1-month low on Wednesday. US crude futures also fell after slumping in the previous session. US crude for May delivery was off 57 cents at $101.97 a barrel. The April contract hit a record $118.80 on Monday. The dollar was pinned at 98.90 yen little changed from New York's close and well off Wednesday's high of 100.44. The US currency was trading at $1.5584 per euro compared with $1.5608 in late US trade. The global market uncertainty lifted some Asian bonds, with Australia's three-year contract up 0.105 to 93.98, and the 10-year contract up 0.115 to 94.0
