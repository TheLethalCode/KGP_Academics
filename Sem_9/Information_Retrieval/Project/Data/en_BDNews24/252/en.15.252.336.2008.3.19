 NEW DELHI, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian cricket board said on Wednesday that fielding coach Robin Singh would be retained for the home test series against South Africa, denying media reports that said he would be fired. "Yes, he will be there. We will put out a release on this," board secretary Niranjan Shah told Reuters when asked about the reports. He did not elaborate. The Hindustan Times reported that Gary Kirsten, who has taken over as India coach before the series against his home country, had told the board that Singh's services would not be required. The former India all-rounder joined the team along with bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad last year following their shock first-round exit from the World Cup in the West Indies. Prasad and Singh had a dispute with the board over their involvement with the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL), due to be launched next month, the paper said. The first match of the three-test series starts in Chennai on March 26
