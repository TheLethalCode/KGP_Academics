 GENEVA, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese forces targeted civilians in air and ground attacks on villages in Darfur this year, the United Nations human rights office and the UN-African Union (AU) mission in Darfur said on Thursday. In a formal report, the mission said 115 people had been killed and 30,000 driven from their homes in the attacks in which helicopter gunships and fixed-wing aircraft were used and pro-government militia were involved. The assaults in January and February in western Darfur "amount to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law....(by) failing to distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives," the report said. The report was issued in Geneva by the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, and the joint mission in Darfur, UNAMID, which took over peacekeeping in the region from the start of this year from a purely AU force. The attacks, three on the village of Saraf Jidad in January, and others on the villages of Sirba, Sileia and Abu Surouj on February 8, came during a major military push by the Sudanese government against rebels in the area, it said. There was no immediate response from Khartoum. Earlier actions by the insurgent Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), which says it controls much of western Darfur, had already been denounced by an independent commission to be violations of a 2004 ceasefire agreement, the report added. On Tuesday, JEM said it had fought off a major assault by Sudanese forces in west Darfur. BEGAN IN 2003 The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when non-Arab rebels took up arms. Outside experts say 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have fled their homes, but Khartoum says the scale of the fighting is exaggerated and only 9,000 have died. The report, which said there was extensive looting after Sudanese attacks and listed "consistent and credible accounts" of rape committed by uniformed men during and after the attack on Siraj, was compiled by UNAMID human rights officers. It said the scale of the destruction of property, "including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of military strategy." Among the dead were elderly and disabled people, women and children, the report said. Many of the local people were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Chad, where there are already large numbers of refugees from Darfur. The report said homes, clinics run by relief organisations, community centres, water towers, schools, food depots and shops were systematically vandalised "and in many cases burned to the ground, sometimes with their occupants still inside." UNAMID had been unable to investigate reported ground and air attacks on the town of Jebel Moun and nearby areas in late February in which civilians were also reported to have died, the team said, because the Sudanese authorities refused it access. Although the monitors were allowed in on March 1, a week after the last assault, the earlier refusal was in breach of Khartoum's duty to allow UNAMID officials freedom of movement under an accord with the U.N. in February, the report add
