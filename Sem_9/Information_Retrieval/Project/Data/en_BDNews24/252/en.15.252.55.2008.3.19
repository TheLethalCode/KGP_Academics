 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)The government has cancelled its preshipment inspection contract with Switzerland-based Cotecna for its alleged violations of regulations. The National Board of Revenue Wednesday issued a press statement, saying the order would come into effect soon. The government signed the contract with Cotecna in 2005 for three years, which covered the inspection of imported goods. Cotecna, founded in Switzerland in 1974, had been awarded two of the five geographical zones. It has offices in Dhaka and Chittagong. According to a new arrangement, the government assigned BIVAC International (France) for the geographical zone of China, Thailand, Korea, the Philippines and Cambodia. SGS Societe Generale de Surveillance (Switzerland) will cover the zone of Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Solomon Island, Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea for preshipment inspection activities. The two companies have been assigned to carry out the responsibilities until Aug 31. A PSI company offers trade facilitation and security services, including inspection of goods prior to shipment and at destination, verification and certification of quality standards, valuation and tariff code classification of products. bdnews
