<TITLE> Quarishi questions motives of SCF </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - Progressive Democratic Party convener Ferdaus Ahmad Quarishi has raised questions about the motives of sector commanders in holding a national convention to drum up support for war crimes trial. "They did not demand such trials of any political government since 1971," Quarishi said at a press conference at the party's Segunbagicha office Saturday. The Sector Commanders Forum held a national convention Friday at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "It must be scrutinised whether they have any political interest," the PDP convenor said. He said it would be difficult to identify war criminals: "The history needs to be searched thoroughly to find evidence against them." "A further consideration is how and when war criminals would be tried." Quarishi took a dig at foreign diplomats saying they had breached diplomatic norms by making unwise remarks. The PDP leader also opposed demands that the state of emergency be lifted. In his written statement, Quarishi said those who called for withdrawal of the state of emergency actually wanted to thwart the ongoing drive against corruption and the legal process. "Some are talking of lifting emergency right now. They talk of polls, but actually polls are not their target." He said fugitive criminals would create an unbearable situation in the country if the emergency was lifted. Quarishi, however, criticised the government for its failure to rein in prices of essentials. He said that the government could have imported rice at half price if the initiatives had been taken up to eight months ago. "Lack of prudence by government officials is responsible for the crisis. I think they failed on this matter," he said. He asked the Election Commission to decide immediately which elections, local or national, would be held first and make the decision public. On the release of detained political leaders, Quarishi said the courts would decide the fate of those who faced specific charges. bdnew
