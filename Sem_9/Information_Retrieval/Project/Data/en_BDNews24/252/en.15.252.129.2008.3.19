<TITLE> Temporary governor to head BoJ as lawmakers bicker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Parliament failed on Wednesday to agree on a new central bank chief, leaving a temporary governor to take the Bank of Japan's helm as central banks around the world work together to combat the credit crisis. Opposition parties that control the upper house vetoed a second former top finance ministry bureaucrat put forward by the government for the job. That left Governor Toshihiko Fukui, due to retire in a few hours, with the job of appointing incoming Deputy Governor Masaaki Shirakawa as temporary governor. This means the world's No.2 economy has no permanent central bank head as global market turmoil continues and as major central banks take coordinated action to curb the credit crisis and steady gyrating currency, bond and stock markets. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said he felt deeply responsible for the empty BOJ post, but did not say when the government would submit its next nominee for the job. "It's not easy to select someone for such a position as Bank of Japan governor," he told reporters. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Democrats blamed each other for the vacancy in the central bank leadership, the first since 1923, and one analyst questioned the future of the prime minister himself. "Fukuda has now twice in a row put forth someone with experience at the Ministry of Finance, which the Democrats don't like. This has raised questions about Fukuda's sense," said Takehiro Sato, an economist at Morgan Stanley, adding that the prime minister may not last until mid-year. "The first time, the criticism focused on the Democrats, but this time the criticism towards Fukuda and the ruling party is growing." At his last news conference before officially stepping down at midnight (1500 GMT), Fukui acknowledged that a prolonged vacuum could be problematic. "It is obviously doubtful that any organisation or company can operate favourably for long without a head," he said. RATE CUT IN APRIL? Still, the acting BOJ head may not be totally hamstrung, and investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday that it expected a rate cut next month even if Shirakawa is still in charge. "The turbulence surrounding the new governor and deputy governors need not be a major impediment to an emergency rate cut or April easing," it said in a research note. Japanese interest rates are a near rock-bottom 0.5 percent, but Goldman said the country had probably been in recession since the last quarter of 2007, with U.S. economic weakness and abrupt rises in the yen seen as adding impetus for a rate cut. Financial markets are pricing in around a 30 percent chance of a rate cut by June and nearly 70 percent chance by the end of the year, although most economists say they expect no BOJ move this year. Fukuda's difficulties in coping with gridlock in parliament have eroded his public support, and the BOJ debacle has boosted an opposition drive to force an election. "They want political confusion and to bring about an election. Their priority is to create political upheaval," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told reporters. Japanese media were scathing about political paralysis in a parliament where the ruling coalition has an overwhelming lower house majority, but opposition parties control the upper house. "The lack of policies of Prime Minister Fukuda and the irresponsibility of Democratic Party leader (Ichiro) Ozawa have given birth to an outrageous, directionless drama in which the people are ignored," the Nikkei business daily said in an editorial. "The loss of confidence in Japan among the international community will be immeasurable. And the Fukuda administration will suffer a big blow." Opposition parties rejected the two nominees put forward by the government because they were both former top finance ministry bureaucrats. "We said from the beginning that the BOJ personnel should not be an object of political feuding and that a vacuum should not be created. The government's clumsy handling is to blame for the result today," said Kenji Yamaoka, a senior Democratic Party lawmaker. TWO DEPUTIES, NO SHERIFF Parliament last week approved Shirakawa as deputy governor, and on Wednesday it approved a second deputy governor -- current BOJ board member Kiyohiko Nishimura. Underlying the succession crisis is a rapidly weakening US economy that prompted the Fed to slash interest rates by 0.75 percentage point on Tuesday, with Wall Street expecting more to come. Conditions are also worsening in Japan, where the Reuters Tankan, a monthly survey of business sentiment, has hit a four-year low among manufacturers. "As some in the market doubt if the BOJ could take such swift action if its top post is left vacant, a new governor must be decided as soon as possible in view of uncertainties over the economic outlook," said Tatsushi Shikano, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securiti
