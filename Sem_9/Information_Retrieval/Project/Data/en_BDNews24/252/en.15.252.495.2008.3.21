<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)Recitation organisation Kanthashilon on Friday organised a two-day cultural programme in memory of the late founder of Chhayanaut, Waheedul Huq, at the Central Public Library. The programmes on the first day included discussions, dance, music and recitation. The presence of the students of Chhayanaut and Kanthashilon, cultural personalities and music lovers gave the venue a vibrant look. At the function, Abriti Parishad president Asaduzzaman Noor said, "Waheedul Huq was a musician, a scholar of language and recitation, a teacher and a genuine Bangalee. Those who came in contact with the publicity-shy Huq transformed into a cultural awakening." Prof Khan Sarwar Murshid lamented that it seemed Waheedul Huq had failed to inspire the present-day people although he had worked with language all his life. He regretted the substandard language being used in TV dramas and advertisements. Prof Murshid also said at least the country's president to university teachers should be able to speak standard Bangla. "Common people will follow them," he said. Artist Qayyum Chowdhury urged all to spread the thoughts of Waheedul Huq among all. On the first day's programme, Sammilito Sangskritik Jote president Nasiruddin Yusuf Bachchu, Bangladesh Group Theatre Federation secretary general Jhuna Chowdhury and Jatiya Kabita Parishad president Habibullah Sirazi were present as guests. Writer Syed Shamsul Haq will deliver the Waheedul Huq memorial lecture on the second day Saturday. Waheedul Huq who established Kanthashilon in 1984 died on Jan 27, 2007. bdnew
