 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi listeners in six cities other than the capital will be able to listen to BBC World Service's broadcasting on FM band by mid-April. BBC's broadcasting is currently available at FM 100 in and around Dhaka city. BBC and Bangladesh Betar, the state-owned radio station, signed an agreement Wednesday to put the new arrangement in place. BBC World Service announced their deal from a press conference in the city's Sonargaon Hotel, where Neil Curry, BBC's head of business development for the Asia-Pacific, and Sabir Mustafa, head of BBC Bangla Service, spoke. The deal will enable them to broadcast on FM band in six cities: Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur and Comilla. "BBC has always tried to provide its listeners with reliable news and views of current affairs. And the Bangladeshi listeners as well rely on us for ages," he said. BBC Bangla also airs upcoming and current programmes other than news. "We are always trying to give our listeners something more than daily happenings. We are successfully broadcasting interactive events such as BBC Shanglap," he said. A platform was built to exchange "views among common people, politicians and other policymakers". Nodipothe Bangladesh (Bangladesh by river) had depicted what Sabir said were the problems and hopes of the people here. He said a negotiation was on with the Election Commission to produce programmes on local government and national elections. BBC is likely to start broadcasting in at least one of the six cities on Mar 26. But people across the six cities will be able to listen to programmes by April 14, he said. Usually FM band covers a 30-35 mile radius. Since Bangladesh is a flatland, it may cover another 10-12 miles. Neil Curry told reporters that Bangladesh Betar would receive an annual fee of 46,000 pounds from the three-year agreement. "Bangladeshi listeners rely on our services and surveys found out that they want more of our services. So, the BBC considers Bangladesh a very important market and hopes to further expand services over here," he said. Listeners of Chittagong can tune in to BBC World Service at FM 105.4 while the services will be available at FM 102,105 and 101.2 in Khulna, Sylhet and Comilla respectively. Audiences of the northern cities of Rajshahi and Rangpur would be able to listen to BBC World Service broadcasting at FM 105 and 105.4 respectively. bdnews
