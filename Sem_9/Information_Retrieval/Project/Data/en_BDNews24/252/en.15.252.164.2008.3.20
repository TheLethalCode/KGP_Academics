<TITLE> Zeta-Jones in romantic comedy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK (Reuters/Hollywood Reporter/bdnews24.com) - Catherine Zeta-Jones will star as a single New York City mom in Bart Freundlich's not-yet-titled May-December romantic comedy. Zeta-Jones' character captures the eye of her new neighbor, a 25-year-old man. The project seems to mirror an aspect of real life for the 38-year-old Freundlich, who's married to Julianne Moore, nine years his senior. The film is set to shoot April 17, and casting hasn't been finalized for the male lead. Romantic comedies are familiar territory for both the star and the writer-director. Zeta-Jones starred in "Intolerable Cruelty" and "No Reservations," while Freundlich helmed "Trust the Man," starring Moore.
