 Veronica Brown LONDON, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors called time on the rush to commodities over the past week with repatriated profits helping lift an ailing dollar, while stock markets sagged as bank stress dominated sentiment. Flagship precious metal gold tumbled to a one-month low as investors cashed in on a surge that had taken bullion to a record high above the $1,000 milestone. But analysts said the bull run could easily resume after the upcoming Easter break. Spot metal fell as low as $904.65 per troy ounce from $944.20/945.00 quoted late in New York on Wednesday, heading for its biggest weekly loss in a quarter of a century, and down some 12 percent from Monday's record $1,030.80. Similarly, oil and base metal price losses deepened on fears that global consumption could contract if the United States slipped into recession. Crude was battling to stay above $100 a barrel after a hefty sell-off in the previous session. Analysts said hefty profits seen in commodities markets already this year were proving too hard to resist in the current uncertain global climate. "Any trend, even the best one, is subject to profit-taking and commodities had been performing very well," Commerzbank commodities analyst Eugen Weinberg said. The temptation to cash in on gold has been particularly compelling, given a rise of almost 50 percent in prices since August 2007 when the global crisis in credit markets erupted. The drive out of commodities revived the fortunes of a sickly dollar, helping lift the U.S. currency further from this week's record lows versus the euro and a basket of major currencies. Analysts said it was too early to call an end to the dollar rout, which has also seen it sink to record lows versus the Swiss franc as well as 13-year troughs against the yen. "The dollar is holding up remarkably well ... and I am wondering if the steep fall in commodity prices is causing stress among leveraged names and creating a short-term demand for dollars," said Neal Kimberley, head of FX sales at BTM-UFJ in London. "Another scenario is that we are merely seeing Europe reducing dollar shorts ahead of the Easter break. This is also highly plausible and possibly short-lived," he said, adding that longer-term investors might be tempted to use the dollar's rebound to sell into again. The euro was down 1.25 percent at $1.5435, well off Monday's record high of $1.5904 but still almost 6 percent higher on the year to date. The dollar also gained around 1 percent to 99.67 yen and rose back above parity versus the Swiss franc to 1.0138 francs. DOWNBEAT STOCKS Derailed basic resource prices drove mining and energy shares lower, but the ongoing global crisis in credit markets was the biggest underlying factor behind stock market jitters. Credit Suisse shares were down almost 10 percent after the Swiss bank cautioned it was unlikely to be profitable in the first quarter due to big debt writedowns. Shares in German bank IKB were also down 10 percent after it said it expects to announce further writedowns. The European Central Bank and Bank of England pumped 15 billion euros and 5 billion pounds, respectively, into the banking system on Thursday via short-term loans to help tide banks over the holiday period. See The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.3 percent at 1,222.27 points, trimming earlier losses, while the MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan was down 2.16 percent at 427.12. "The market is still driven by uncertainty," said Britta Paech, portfolio manager at M.M. Warburg. "We continue to battle with the financial crisis and it'll stay that way for a while."
