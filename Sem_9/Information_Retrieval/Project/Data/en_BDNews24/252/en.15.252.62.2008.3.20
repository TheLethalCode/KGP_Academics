 Harare, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition party on Thursday accused President Robert Mugabe of abusing his position to rig next week's election by changing the law to let police escort voters to polling booths. Top police officers have come out in public to back Mugabe, facing the strongest challenge to his rule on March 29 because of defections by senior ruling ZANU-PF party officials and a deepening economic crisis. The election law was changed last year to bar police from coming within 100 metres (yards) of polling stations to ensure they could not influence the vote. The change followed South African-brokered talks between the ruling party and opposition. But Mugabe used his presidential powers this week to reverse the change so police officers would be able to assist illiterate and disabled voters in polling booths. "One of the players is now acting like a referee and pretending to be a competitor. Are we really in an election or are we in a contest already decided by one man?," Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the larger faction of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), told a news conference. Mugabe will also be facing ruling party defector Simba Makoni in the presidential vote, being held alongside presidential, parliamentary and municipal elections. He has branded his opponents as Western puppets and prostitutes. SHORTAGES Zimbabweans suffer from the world's highest inflation rate -- officially over 100,000 percent -- and chronic shortages of food, fuel and foreign currency, but opposition divisions have increased Mugabe's chances of keeping power. U.S.-based Human Rights Watch also accused the government this week of using violence to intimidate opponents and using state subsidised food to gain an advantage. Tsvangirai said opposition concerns over the electoral process -- such as irregularities on the voter register -- had not been addressed. He complained of limited access in state media and said some of his party's rallies had been blocked. The party said the distribution of polling stations was skewed in favour of Mugabe's rural strongholds. It also said it was worried that presidential votes might be counted centrally rather than at polling stations -- making it easier to cheat. "I will not be part of an illegal process," Tsvangirai said, making clear he would not accept the result of such a count which did not take place using the normal procedure. Zimbabwe has banned vote observers from countries critical of Mugabe and an observer mission from countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) said on Wednesday it believed the atmosphere was conducive to a fair poll. "It does not appear likely that anyone in SADC would have the guts to stand up to Mugabe," said Tendai Biti, a top official in Tsvangirai's faction. "It is therefore not a surprise that the SADC observer mission in Zimbabwe can state that the election will be free and fair despite gross and evident electoral abuse."
