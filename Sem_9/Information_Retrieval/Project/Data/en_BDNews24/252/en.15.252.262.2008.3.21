 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Losing seamer Kyle Mills and all-rounder Jacob Oram to injury does not make New Zealand underdogs heading into the third test against England, according to captain Daniel Vettori. Mills and Oram, arguably New Zealand's two best bowlers in the series, were ruled out of the match at Napier's McLean Park with calf and hip injuries respectively. Teenage pace bowler Tim Southee was drafted in to replace Mills, while all-rounder Grant Elliott comes in for Oram. Both will make their debuts in the deciding match starting on Saturday. "I don't think you can say that," Vettori told reporters on Friday when asked if his side were now underdogs. "We won't be conceding any tag. "We are going out there to play the game. We're not playing for a draw, we're trying to win." Vettori, however, did concede the batter-friendly pitch at Napier would be tough on Elliott and Southee. "It'll be tough on them making their debuts on a wicket that won't help them. "But we have all acknowledged they have some talent and were the next in line. It's just an opportunity for them to step up and show what they're worth. "As a New Zealand side we have always gone through injuries and it has allowed guys to step up and they have put in performances that have led them to being in the team for a very long time," he said. "It's something we hope Grant and Tim do as well because they both have the talent." England captain Michael Vaughan said his side would be aiming to pressure Elliott and Southee. "They will no doubt be nervous, but we will respect them. If there is an opportunity to get on top of any bowler we will take that," said Vaughan. "We always try to start the game very well and get ahead on day one. That's what we'll be doing, no matter who we are playing against. "It's an opportunity for us, but New Zealand are a canny team and play good streetwise cricket." England have two injury concerns with Paul Collingwood undergoing treatment on a calf problem and James Anderson struggling with a twisted ankle. Anderson suffered the injury playing soccer during the victory in Wellington. If both players are passed fit England are likely to play the same 11 that won the second test by 126 runs. New Zealand won the first match in Hamilton by 189 runs. England (probable): Michael Vaughan (captain), Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Tim Ambrose, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, James Anderson, Monty Panesar. New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (captain), Jamie How, Matthew Bell, Stephen Fleming, Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Brendon McCullum, Grant Elliott, Tim Southee, Jeetan Patel, Chris Marti
