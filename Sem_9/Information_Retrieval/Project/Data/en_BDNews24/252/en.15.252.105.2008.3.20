 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scottish and Southern Energy is to increase its domestic power prices by an average of 14.2 percent and gas by 15.8 percent from April 1, the company said on Wednesday. The company, the last of the big six suppliers to announce price hikes this year, blamed soaring wholesale energy prices for the rises in household rates. "Energy supply in the UK is changing dramatically, with companies having to operate in volatile markets, which reflect depletion of North Sea oil and gas fields, soaring global demand for all types of energy and over $100 a barrel for oil," Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE's energy supply director said in a statement. "These pressures are compounded by the rising transmission, distribution and environmental costs which suppliers have to meet. You cannot resist indefinitely the impact of these issues and I am sorry that all of this has culminated in the price rises we are announcing today." Npower, owned by Germany's RWE was the first major household energy supplier in Britain to announce double-digit price increases at the start of January, followed by French-owned EDF Energy, British Gas, Scottish Power and E.ON. SSE said in mid-January it would not raise prices until at least March 30 and has fulfilled that promise, just, while remaining one of the cheapest suppliers. "SSE is still the cheapest dual fuel supplier in the UK - so new customers who switched to them for a better deal have no need to panic," said Mark Todd, director of switching site energyhelpline.c
