<TEXT>
 ROME, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi, ahead in the campaign to become Italy's prime minister in April's election, backed a rival bid to Air France-KLM's offer for Alitalia, sending the stricken airline's shares soaring. The media mogul said late on Wednesday as he left a birthday party that Air France-KLM would pull out and leave the field free to Alitalia's local rival, Air One, to return with a new offer backed by banks, and possibly even by his sons. One Alitalia union dismissed the talk as election rhetoric, while Alitalia's chairman, talking to unions, warned that a bid backed by banks would weigh on the carrier's debt. Still, Berlusconi's comments further complicate Air France-KLM's plans to buy Alitalia, which are already in danger of falling apart due to a maelstrom of criticism from unions, politicians and Milan's airport operator. The Franco-Dutch carrier has warned it will walk away if all obstacles to the deal are not resolved in two weeks and wants the winner of Italy's election -- who opinion polls suggest is likely be Berlusconi -- to sign off on it as well. "This operation would be backed by a string of banks, among them maybe Banca Intesa whose board should decide tomorrow, and other business leaders which could also include my sons," the media tycoon and conservative opposition leader said. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's biggest retail bank, denied it had any plans to discuss Alitalia at its board meeting on Thursday to approve its 2007 results. The stock market rejoiced. Shares in Alitalia were suspended in Milan in early trading after investors bid about 60 percent more than Wednesday's closing price, or as much as 0.5 euros. UNIONS The Air France-KLM offer for the nearly bankrupt Italian airline values its shares at 0.1 euros each, but also includes a bond buy-back and a 1 billion euro capital increase. Alitalia Chairman Maurizio Prato told unions at a Thursday meeting that the Franco-Dutch carrier's bid was essentially a "take-it-or-leave-it offer" -- leaving little room for changes. Air One has challenged in court Air France-KLM's exclusive talks to acquire Alitalia backed by Italy's outgoing centre-left government, but so far without success. Privately owned Air One's rival bid, reported to be worth 1 cent per share, was backed by Intesa and politicians who wanted Alitalia to remain in Italian hands. The UIL Transport union said it would prefer a deal with Air France-KLM and that it did not believe in speculated bids that arrive at "last minute". "They are political and electoral proposals," said Giuseppe Caronia, the union's secretary-general, on the sidelines of a meeting between the airlines and unions. "It's better to go ahead with Air France-KLM. We can't take the risk of letting Alitalia go bankrupt." Guglielmo Epifani, the leader of the bigger CGIL union, which represents Alitalia workers from units including its troubled ground-services division, earlier called Air France-KLM's offer "blackmail" and urged the Italian Treasury, which holds 49.9 percent of the carrier, to postpone the sale to allow a new government to decide on it. Any Italian consortium, if it existed, should go ahead and make its offer, Epifani told an Italian newspaper. The unions set a new meeting for March 25 with Air France-KLM CEO Jean-Cyril Spinetta to discuss the deal furth
