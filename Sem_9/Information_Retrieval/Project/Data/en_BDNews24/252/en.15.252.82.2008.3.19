 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank Wednesday directed all banks to halt loan repayments disbursed among poultry farmers for one year, in an effort to help them make up for the losses caused by avian influenza. Bangladesh Bank in a circular asked the banks to halt collections of interests on the loans for six months. The central bank directive came as it said a rehabilitation programme was urgent to make up for the losses in the sector ravaged by the rampaging bird flu. The circular suggested intensifying loan disbursement activities for people directly or indirectly affected by bird flu. Terms and conditions of downpayment applicable to loan rescheduling could be relaxed on the basis of bank-customer relations to distribute fresh loans in the poultry sector, BB said. The central bank also asked the banks to consider if loans could be given on a lower interest rate and asked for tight monitoring to guard affected poultry farmers from harassment when they come to take loans. The retail banks were asked to send the details of poultry loans to the central bank every month like farm loans. bdnews
