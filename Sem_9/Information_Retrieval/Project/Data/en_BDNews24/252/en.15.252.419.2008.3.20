<TEXT>
 ROME, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan moved seven points clear at the top of Serie A on Wednesday despite drawing 1-1 at Genoa, after second-placed AS Roma lost 3-2 to Lazio in a thrilling city derby. A late Marco Borriello goal earned Genoa a point after Honduran striker David Suazo scored in the 12th minute for Inter, who had Portuguese midfielder Pele sent off for a second yellow just before halftime. Roma were sunk by a stoppage-time winner from Lazio's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami. Goran Pandev and Tommaso Rocchi also scored for Lazio with Rodrigo Taddei and Simone Perrotta on target for Roma. Third-placed Juventus have 55 points from 29 games, 13 fewer than Inter, after being held to a goalless draw at struggling Empoli. Fiorentina stay fourth and in control of Italy's final Champions League qualification slot despite losing 2-0 at Napoli, for whom Argentine striker Ezequiel Lavezzi hit a double. Fifth-placed Milan remain four points behind the Florence side after losing 2-1 to Sampdoria at the San Siro. Inter had looked comfortable after Suazo tucked away a sweet Zlatan Ibrahimovic cross until Pepe's harsh red card. The home side then laid siege to Inter's goal in the second half and were rewarded five minutes from time when Borriello scissor-kicked home the rebound from a Julio Cesar save to claim his 17th league goal of the season. Roma took the lead just after the half hour against lazio when a Behrami clearance ricocheted off Taddei's chest and into the goal. Macedonia striker Pandev equalised for Lazio shortly before the break and Rocchi drilled home a penalty just before the hour after Rolando Bianchi was felled. Italy midfielder Simone Perrotta then made it 2-2 and Roma had looked the more likely side to score a winner before Behrami's snatched it for Lazio. At the San Siro Christian Maggio fired in from short range and midfielder Gennaro Delvecchio wriggled past Alessandro Nesta and slipped the ball home to put Sampdoria 2-0 up at halftime. Andrea Pirlo hit the inside of the post with a free kick for Milan and Alberto Gilardino had a good shout for a penalty turned down after the break. Alberto Paloschi headed in a cross from fellow 18-year-old Alexandre Pato to deservedly pull one back with 19 minutes left. Gennaro Gattuso came close to snatching a late equaliser, but sixth-placed Samp hung on to move within a point of the European champions in the standings despite having defender Stefano Lucchini sent off for a second yellow in the closing stages
