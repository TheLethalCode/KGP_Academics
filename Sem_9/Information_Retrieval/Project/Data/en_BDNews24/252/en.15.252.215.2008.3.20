<TEXT>
 BERLIN, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich face a tough test at home to third-placed Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday after ending a two-match losing streak with victory over VfL Wolfsburg in the German Cup semi-finals. After stumbling 2-0 at lowly Energie Cottbus and losing to Anderlecht in the UEFA Cup last week, Bayern beat Wolfsburg 2-0 on Wednesday, outplaying the team with the league's best second-half record. Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said the defeat at Cottbus, when his team were outclassed by a relegation-threatened side, was a blessing in disguise for Bayern, who have lost only three matches in all competitions this season. "Losing at Cottbus was a warning signal for us," said Hitzfeld, whose team have a five-point lead over second place Hamburg SV. Hitzfeld also welcomed the return of Argentine defender Martin Demichelis, who was outstanding against Wolfsburg. Hitzfeld had suspended Demichelis before the Cottbus match after he refused to play midfield. "He apologised to me on Monday and said he screwed up," Hitzfeld said. "After that it was clear that he deserved to be back in the lineup. That's why I let him play. He was full of energy after coming back and really wanted to prove something." Hitzfeld also left Germany internationals Bastian Schweinsteiger and Philipp Lahm on the bench against Wolfsburg after their poor performances at Cottbus. Leverkusen have not won at Bayern in 19 years, picking up just one point in 13 trips to Munich. But they are on form and, like Bayern, have 13 points from six matches since the end of the winter break. In other games, Hamburg SV travel to Wolfsburg, who have won six of their last eight league matches and with 16 points are the league's top club since the break. Hamburg, however, have only lost one of their last 19 matches in all competitions
