<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)The government has moved to appoint vice-chancellors to public universities through open advertisements by abolishing the so-called panel system, an adviser said Thursday. In case of the post of a vice-chancellor remaining vacant, the next person in the hierarchy will act as vice-chancellor until the appointment of a new VC. The system will apply gradually to the appointments of Pro-VCs and treasurers of the universities, according to a decision taken at a meeting at the education ministry. A search committee earlier formed to find vice-chancellors for different public universities took the decision at the meeting, chaired by education secretary Md Momtazul Islam. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman attended the meeting as a special invitee. The new system will apply to 25 public universities now under the faculty-search panel. Of the total 29 public universities, Dhaka, Rajshahi, Jahangirnagar and Chittagong universities are run in line with the 1973 University Ordinance. Academic activities of Rangpur University, Jessore University of Science and Technology and Barisal Shaheed Ziaur Rahman University have not begun. Posts of five vice-chancellors, 17 pro-vice- chancellors and six treasurers have been lying vacant. After the meeting, the adviser told reporters that the search committee had been formed to create an atmosphere for good governance and transparency and Thursday's meeting decided to extend the duration of the committee. The adviser said the decision had been taken to include two administrative officials or civil-society representatives on the committee as additional members to make it more effective. Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud will be co-chairman of the committee. bdnew
