<TEXT>
 Beijing, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese official media condemned Western news coverage of unrest in Tibet on Thursday, in a commentary that accused the reports of being "hostile" towards China ahead of the Beijing Olympics. China says the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, masterminded a wave of protests that were capped by a riot in Tibet's capital Lhasa last week and were followed by anti-government demonstrations in ethnic Tibetan parts of China. "While we highly appreciate the efforts of the global media in seeking facts and providing accurate, objective and timely reporting, we are somewhat disappointed to find, from time to time, rather biased news coverage," the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary. Xinhua singled out a New York Times editorial headlined "China Terrorizes Tibet", which said that "China had a chance to shine for its Olympic coming-out party and is blowing it". The Games open in Beijing on Aug. 8. The Xinhua piece asked why the violence in Lhasa, which the Chinese government says killed 13 and which saw mobs looting and setting fire to shops and public buildings, was "being used by some people in the West against China". "Is it because they really know too little about China and China's Tibet; whatever they know always comes from the so-called 'Tibetan government-in-exile' and other anti-China cliques?" the report asked. China has barred foreign reporters from Lhasa and from parts of Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai provinces that have also seen unrest, in some cases detaining crews and escorting them out of the areas. The Dalai Lama, a 72-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who has lived in exile in India since a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule, had won sympathy from the naive who do not want to see development in the remote mountain region, the report said. "Right as their claims to preserve the Tibetan culture may sound, the hidden intention behind their calls is for Tibet to maintain its status quo and remain a stereotyped cultural specimen for them to enjoy," it said. The piece repeated China's position that the Dalai Lama's call for autonomy, rather than full independence for Tibet, was tantamount to an end to Chinese sovereignty over the region and over ethnic Tibetan parts of western China. "This is not the right attitude to reopen dialogue," it concluded
