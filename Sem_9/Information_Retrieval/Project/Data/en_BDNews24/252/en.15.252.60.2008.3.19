<TITLE> Petrobangla upbeat on 'keen interest' in gas block bidding </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Petrobangla said Wednesday it had seen good initial interest from international oil groups for its planned auction of offshore gas blocks. Petrobangla last month issued tenders for international oil companies (IOCs) to explore 28 offshore gas blocks in the Bay of Bengal. "The response from the IOCs (is) more than our expectations, and so far 15 firms (have) bought documents at a cost of $7,500 each," Jalal Ahmed, chairman of state-run Petrobangla, told reporters. Officials said the firms included Thai PTT Exploration and production PTTE.BK, Australia's Santos International, Singapore-based Pearl Energy, ConocoPhilips, China's CNPC International, Japan's Nippon Oil Exploration, India's ONGC Videsh and Canada's Talisman Energy. The IOCs are to get up to nine years for exploration in deep sea blocks and eight years for shallow sea blocks. Bangladesh's offshore area has been carved up into 30 blocks ranging from 2,611 square kilometers to 7,703 square km. The country has some 13.54 trillion cubic feet of proven and recoverable gas, but faces a serious crisis in five years if it is unable to produce it from new fields, officials say. "Demand for gas is increasing at a rate of 10 percent every year and is expected to reach at 5,700 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) in the year of 2025," Jalal said. Bangladesh now supplies up to 1,738 mmcf of gas daily against a daily demand of 1,833 mmcf, officials said. Jalal said Bangladesh would expedite the tender process as existing gas reserves were depleting fast and would sign production sharing contracts in October so that exploration could begin by next winter. "We will require about 24 trillion cubic feet of gas over the next 17 years to achieve the economic growth at the rate of 7 percent," he added.
