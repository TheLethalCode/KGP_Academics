<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all rounder Andrew Flintoff said he hopes to return for England's home test against New Zealand at Lord's on May 23. The 30-year-old has not played a test for England since last January in Australia because of continuing problems with his left ankle which was operated on for a fourth time in October. However, he came though Lancashire's pre-season match against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi, scoring 51 and bowling four overs. "I would love to play a test match at Lord's, but the one thing that I am not going to do is get carried away," Flintoff was quoted as saying on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Web site (www.ecb.co.uk) on Saturday. "I know that if I want to play for England, then I have got to be fit. I won't be able to just walk back into that side. "I have got to focus all my energies on playing for Lancashire. If I can stay fit and perform, then I would hopefully be in the shake up." Flintoff said he still had some way to go to reach full fitness. "Everybody tells me I am at 70 per cent, but I don't know - I might be at 72," he said. "I am certainly not hitting the crease as hard as I would like, but it feels good and easy.
