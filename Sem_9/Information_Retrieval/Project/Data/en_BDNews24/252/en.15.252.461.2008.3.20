 Stockholme, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, under threat after angering Muslim groups with her work, arrived in Europe on Wednesday after spending months hiding in a safe house India, a representative said.

Last month, she was rushed to a hospital in New Delhi after her blood pressure plummeted from an overdose of medicine to control high blood pressure. Nasreen spoke earlier this week of leaving India for either France or Germany.
