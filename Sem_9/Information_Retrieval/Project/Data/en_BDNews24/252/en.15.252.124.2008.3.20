<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker administration is considering forming a National Security Council to tackle law and order issues and national disasters, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff said Thursday. Potential members of the council include the president, the prime minister, the leader of the opposition and representatives of the armed forces, the adviser told reporters in his land ministry office. Ariff, who is also land adviser, failed to say when the national security council might come into being. "The matter is being discussed. No draft proposal on the formation of such a council has reached the law ministry or the cabinet from the home ministry," said Ariff. The adviser, however, confirmed the Truth Commission would be formed in a month: "It seems that the Anticorruption Commission does not have any reservations about it." The Truth Commission, also known as the 'accountability commission', is intended to facilitate legal investigations and trials. bdnews24.c
