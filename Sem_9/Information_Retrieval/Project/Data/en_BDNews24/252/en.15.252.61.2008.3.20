 Ankara, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's ruling AK Party should not try to change the law to avoid being closed down by state prosecutors, the leader of the main opposition party said on Thursday. A top prosecutor asked the Constitutional Court last week to close the AK Party and ban 71 party officials, including the prime minister and president, from politics for five years for allegedly trying to build an Islamic state in secular Turkey. The AK Party, which has Islamist roots, denies the charges. The court is weighing whether to take up the case but Turkish media say the AK Party is considering legal or constitutional changes that would make it harder to close down political parties. "There is a legal case underway. Changing the law now would not accord with the notion of a state based on the rule of law," Deniz Baykal, leader of the staunchly secularist Republican People's Party (CHP), told private broadcaster CNN Turk. "The AK Party is trying to tailor the constitution to suit its own needs ... This is not right." The head of Turkey's Court of Appeals, whose chief prosecutor launched the case against the AK Party, also warned the government against taking measures that could undermine the independence of the judiciary. "If there is no judicial independence, there can be no rights and freedoms," appeals court chief Hasan Gerceker told a televised gathering of judges. "Nobody can put pressure on the courts." Turkey's secular elite, which includes the judiciary, army generals and university rectors, believes the AK Party is trying to undermine the separation of state and religion. The centre-right, pro-business AK Party denies this and says the indictment filed against it is politically motivated. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has reacted angrily to the lawsuit, vowing to fight what he calls an attack on democracy. He is the most popular politician in Turkey and his party won 47 percent of the vote in last July's parliamentary election. "I believe we will continue our democratic struggle in a mature and intelligent way, we will continue within a legal framework," Erdogan told party supporters on Thursday. Turkish newspapers suggested on Thursday Erdogan might try to change the law so that only parties guilty of inciting violence or racism could be banned. Another proposal would require any party ban to be approved by parliament, where AK has a big majority. The indictment has raised the risk of prolonged political uncertainty in Turkey, a candidate for European Union membership with a fast-growing economy, at a time of increased anxiety among investors because of the global credit crunch.
