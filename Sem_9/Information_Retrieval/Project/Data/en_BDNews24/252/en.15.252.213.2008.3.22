 Islamabad, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The party of assassinated former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, which is set to lead a coalition government, will announce its candidate for prime minister on Saturday, party officials said. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) which won the most seats in a Feb. 18 parliamentary election, is led by Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, but he is ineligible to stand for prime minister as he is not a member of parliament. "The consultation process within the party and with the coalition partners on the nomination of the prime minister has been completed," Raza Rabbani, a deputy secretary general of the party, told reporters. "The chairman will announce the final decision," he said, referring to the son of Bhutto and Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who has returned to Pakistan for a short break from Britain where he is studying. The 19-year-old was appointed chairman of the PPP after his mother's assassination on Dec. 27 but has said he will complete his studies at Oxford University before entering politics. There is speculation the PPP will nominate a stop-gap prime minister, and Bhutto's widower will take over the post after he gets into parliament by winning a by-election. Another party official said the announcement was due at about 9 p.m. (1600 GMT). President Pervez Musharraf has asked the National Assembly to reconvene on Monday to elect the prime minister and the PPP's choice is all but guaranteed to win the vote with the support of its members and coalition allies. The small pro-Musharraf Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) said it was withdrawing its candidate for prime minister and would vote for the PPP candidate to show goodwill. But the main pro-Musharraf party, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which came a poor third in the election, said it would be fielding a candidate whose name would be announced on Sunday. Musharraf will swear in the prime minister on Tuesday and the government is expected to be sworn in later in the week. Musharraf has few allies left in the assembly after their defeat in the election. The president, who came to power as a general in a 1999 coup, appears increasingly isolated, and there is intense speculation over how long the U.S. ally will be able to hold on to power. The incoming government has pledged to pass a resolution to reinstate Supreme Court judges whom Musharraf dismissed in November out of fear that they could rule unconstitutional his own re-election in October by the previous assembly. CANDIDATES Makhdoom Amin Fahim, a senior aide to Bhutto and top party official, had been favourite for prime minister but his prospects dimmed after the PPP's main coalition partner, the party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, objected to his contacts with Musharraf. Other candidates include Yousaf Raza Gilani, Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar and Shah Mahmood Qureshi. They are all from the central province of Punjab, whereas the PPP's stronghold is the southern province of Sindh. Gilani, a PPP vice chairman, was National Assembly speaker from 1993 to 1997, during Bhutto's second term as prime minister. He later spent four years in prison on charges of making illegal government appointments that he said were politically motivated. Mukhtar defeated Musharraf ally Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, chief of the PML, in the election. Qureshi is president of the PPP in Punjab. Several Pakistani television stations said Gilani would be the nominee but party officials declined to comment. The election saw the PPP emerge with the most seats in the 342-member National Assembly but not enough to rule alone. Sharif's party came second. Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf deposed in 1999, and Zardari have agreed to form a coalition with a small regional party and a religious party.
