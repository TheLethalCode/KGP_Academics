 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The parents of Madeleine McCann won 550,000 pounds in libel damages on Wednesday from newspapers that repeatedly alleged they killed their missing daughter and covered up her death.

"This was no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family," he wrote in his blog. "The stories were not merely speculative, but laced with innuendo." The McCanns believe their daughter was abducted from their flat while they had dinner with friends at a nearby restaurant. They hired private investigators to help find their daughter after police named them as suspects in September. The investigation dominated newspaper front pages and TV bulletins for months, with many stories questioning the role of the girl's parents in her disappearance.
