<TITLE> Cypriots to remove barricades in landmark deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nicosia, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rival sides on divided Cyprus were preparing to dismantle a poignant symbol of half a century of division in a move diplomats hope will improve the climate for new peace talks. Greek and Turkish Cypriot authorities said they would start work from Monday, removing a barrier from the main commercial district of Nicosia that has split the United Nations-patrolled medieval city into two since 1958. "If everything goes to plan we could expect the road to reopen March 31, or possibly April 2 or 3," Greek Cypriot town mayor Eleni Mavrou told Reuters. On the northern side, Turkish Cypriot mayor Cemal Bulutoglulari said: "As far as we are concerned we are ready." Removal of the barricade on Ledra Street is part of a landmark deal brokered on Friday between Greek Cypriot leader Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to resume peace negotiations within three months. It was their first meeting since Christofias was elected to the Cypriot presidency last month on a pledge of pushing for reunification. Peace talks stalled in 2004 when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. settlement blueprint accepted by Turkish Cypriots. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded in response to a brief coup carried out by Greek-Cypriot extremists at the urging of the military then ruling Greece. The island is represented in the European Union by its Greek Cypriots, who can block Turkey's own hopes of joining the bloc for as long as a peace deal is elusive. Nicosia, a city of about 250,000, has long suffered under partition. Its bustling Greek and Turkish Cypriot commercial sectors are separated by a no-man's-land of booby traps, empty shops and abandoned homes. Ledra Street, which runs across the dividing line, is now guarded by soldiers on opposing sides, separated by an 80-metre buffer zone of decaying buildings overgrown with weeds and overrun by rats. The European Commission has allocated 100,000 euros to open the crossing. United Nations land mine removal teams were expected in the area from Monday.
