<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Commodities slumped across the board on Wednesday after aid for mortgage markets and a smaller-than-expected US interest rate cut made investors move some money from this year's top asset class into bonds. Stocks on Wall Street remained depressed after oil and gold fell 6 percent each in New York and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities hit a one-month low. But Treasuries jumped, suggesting that some of the money in commodities could have left for bonds after a government regulator cleared the way for US mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump up to $200 billion into the distressed US mortgage market. "A lot of commodity funds seem to be going into T-bills," said Janaki Rao, an interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. "The back off in commodity prices...is leading to yield curve flattening," in Treasuries, added Andrew Brenner, analyst at New York's MF Global Inc, in an email to Reuters. Crude oil prices fell more than $6 on concerns that a big U.S.-led economic slowdown could further undermine global energy demand. U.S. crude fell $6.01 to $103.42 a barrel by 1732 GMT, and down from a record $111.80 hit Monday. London Brent crude fell $4.96 to $100.60. The steep losses come in the midst of a volatile week in commodity and equity markets as dealers try to weigh signs of recession against new interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve to counter a liquidity crisis. The Fed brought key interest rates to 2.25 percent on Tuesday after cutting them by 0.75 percent, against market expectations for a 1.0 percent cut. Since September, it has cut rates by a total of 3.0 percent. "People are looking at the macro picture and are worried about the economy," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president at MF Global in New York. But he added "the wide swings in prices during the past few days point to uncertainty both for bulls and bears." US gold futures plunged from Tuesday's $1,000 level to close below $950 an ounce, hurt by heavy liquidation by funds and a sharp pullback of crude oil prices. Gold futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division ended $59 or 5.9 percent lower at $945.30 an ounce, after reaching a three-week low of $940. "In a bull market, you can get these very sharp downturns. The question for people is how serious a pullback could gold have after it had done so well recently," said Caesar Bryan, portfolio manager of GAMCO Gold Fund in New York, which has $670 million assets under management. U.S. copper futures hit a 4-1/2-week low in response to the rate cut by the Fed and ongoing uncertainties surrounding the health of the economy. COMEX copper for May ended down 11.30 cents, or 3 percent, at $3.6335 a lb, hitting an early trough at $3.6145, its lowest level since Feb. 19. Grains on the Chicago Board of Trade all fell the maximum they could in a session. CBOT wheat for May was down 90 cents at $10.74 per bushel, with back months down 70 to 90 cents. Corn for May was down 20 cents at $5.27-1/4 per bushel, with distant months down 17-20 cents. Soybeans for May fell 50 cents to $12.57 per bushel, with deferred months down 49 to 50 cents. In New York, arabica coffee futures fell to an eight-week l
