 FRANKFURT, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Technology and telecom stocks dragged down European shares on Wednesday as a profit warning by Sony Ericsson and Deutsche Telekom's outlook disappointed markets, while mining stocks fell. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.9 percent lower at 1,230.28 points after a rocky session, hitting its intraday high at 1,255.77 and its low at 1,222.33. The DJ Stoxx index of European telecoms shares fell 3.3 percent with Deutsche Telekom slipping 6.9 percent as an update by Europe's largest telecoms group for its fixed-line unit was perceived by the market as a profit warning. The company however confirmed its overall guidance. Ericsson fell 7.8 percent after its mobile phone handset joint venture Sony Ericsson cautioned first-quarter earnings could fall by more than half. The world's top mobile phone maker Nokia slipped 5.9 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index is down about 18 percent so far this year, and is on track to record its worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2002, as stock markets around the world are hit by worries over the prospect of a U.S. recession and the impact of the global credit crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday slashed U.S. interest rates by a hefty three-quarters of a percentage point to 2.25 percent, lifting U.S. and Asian stock markets overnight. But euphoria wore off in European trading as news of Sony Ericsson's profit warning broke and speculation about further subprime casualties among European banks swirled. Britain's financial authorities also made a rare public move to calm jittery markets, saying they were not aware of problems at any UK bank and would investigate share price moves sparked by unfounded rumours. HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, tumbled as much as 17 percent and closed down 7.1 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland fell about 2.9 percent and Alliance & Leicester shed 2.7 percent. "This has dampened the mood. It shows how nervous the markets are. It also shows that negative news can distract the market from following performances in the United States or Asia," said Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at UniCredit. Recent supporting measures should be seen as a limitation of damage rather than a solution to the underlying problem, he added. UniCredit now expects a slowdown in U.S. economic growth at least in the first quarter of 2008 and potentially expects further to come this year. "We are not talking about a U.S. mid cycle downturn anymore, we are talking about a recession," Schwarz said. TELEKOM SUFFERS Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index was the weakest performer, falling 1.1 percent, mainly due to weaker trading mining stocks such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Anglo American , which each fell around 4 percent as prices for industrial metals dropped. Lower oil prices weighed on shares of major energy companies, including BP and Royal Dutch Shell down more than 1 percent each. Germany's DAX index declined 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 eased 0.7 percent. Deutsche Telekom shares hit their lowest level since March 2003 as trading volumes mounted to almost four times the 90-day average after it said it expected sales and earnings to decline further this year -- however anticipating a slower decline than last year. "The news was not positive and that's deadly in this sort of market environment. The market had hoped for a positive surprise," the trader said. Vodafone was down 2.8 percent, Telefonica down 1.4 percent. Telecom Italia fell, hit by market speculation that the heavily indebted telecoms company could launch a capital increase, which the company however denied. Meanwhile, car stocks bucked the trend and the DJ Stoxx European autos index was up 1.4 percent, with BMW as a stand-out gainer. The world's largest premium carmaker added to the previous session's gains, impressing markets with an upbeat 2008 outlook. "In contrast to our concerns, BMW gave a reasonable 2008 outlook and reported solid 2007 results that make the stock a real bargain at current price levels," UniCredit's Georg Stuerzer wrote in a note to clients. Goldman Sachs also raised its price target for BMW to 49 euros from 43 euros. Strongest positive gainer in the FTSEurofirst 300 index was BNP Paribas, gaining 4.7 percent, while shares of rival Societe Generale drop 7.1 percent after BNP says it won't bid for SocGen, which has been seen as a potential target after suffering a massive trading scand
