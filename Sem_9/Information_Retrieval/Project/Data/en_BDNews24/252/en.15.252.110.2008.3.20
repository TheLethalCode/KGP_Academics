<TITLE> Dollar gains broadly as oil, gold prices tumble </TITLE>

 SINGAPORE, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar firmed against the euro and came near 1-month highs versus the Aussie on Thursday, underpinned by sliding gold and oil prices, falling stocks and in spite of investor anxiety over troubled credit markets. Analysts suspected a combination of factors was behind the US dollar's recovery, including the decline in commodities, the urge among investors to switch from riskier assets back into dollars ahead of the long Easter weekend and the need for the dollar to trim the heavy losses sustained this month. "Expectations of a weak dollar were driving commodities up over the last few weeks," said David Mann, a strategist with Standard Chartered Bank. "Then this week, the need for liquidation of long commodity positions to finance losses elsewhere contributed to the commodity selling. Plus the dollar got to such levels of extreme that we ultimately saw some consolidation." Gold had tumbled to $920.3 an ounce on Thursday, leaving the week's record peak of $1,012 peak far behind. Oil prices had also dived, as had wheat and base metals. The sudden reversal in global commodity prices drove resource stocks down, with MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan shedding 2.4 percent after similar falls in major US stock indices overnight. Anxious investors drove US three-month Treasury rates down to 53 basis points, the lowest in more than 50 years and even under those in Japan. That rate had been 1.20 percent as recently as Friday, but had tumbled since the near-collapse of Bear Stearns fuelled concerns about other possible failures. The dollar climbed to reach $1.5566 per euro up from $1.5608 late in New York, and also firmed against risker carry currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Trading in Asia was choppy with Japan closed for the Spring Equinox holiday and as banks and funds scrambled for dollar funding over the long Easter weekend. Analysts said the shortage of dollars in money markets was also contributing to the dollar's recovery against currencies of current account deficit nations, such as the Aussie, Kiwi and Sterling "You'd expect Aussie and kiwi to get hit worse both because of the commodity price story and the current account funding story," said Barclays Capital currency economist David Forrester. PURELY POSITIONING At the same time, the dollar's rapidly disappearing yield advantage and the drop in equity markets kept it pinned around 99 yen little changed from New York's close and well down from Wednesday's 100.44 high. It also briefly dipped under 1.0000 Swiss franc again. "At the end of the day, the yen is still a currency of choice. It has a current account surplus, it has a negative correlation with equity markets and is a safe-haven currency -- very similar to the Swiss franc," Forrester said. Traders were quick to point out that sentiment on the dollar had hardly improved even if its direction had. The turmoil in credit markets, concerns about a U.S. recession and fears of further insolvency among financial institutions were still a heavy load on the currency. "Commodities was the one area that had been untouched by the credit chaos but that seems to be changing," said Robert Rennie, chief currency strategist at Westpac. Traders reported talk that hedge funds and banks were having to raise cash to meet margin calls by taking profits on their commodity positions. "Essentially, the whole world is short the US dollar and long commodities," said Rennie. "That may be about to unwind. It's not an improvement in dollar sentiment or anything, It's just that pure market positioning could see it rally sharpl
