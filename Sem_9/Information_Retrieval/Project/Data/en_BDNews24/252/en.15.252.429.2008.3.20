 BEIJING, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A record 49.2 percent of Chinese urban consumers think prices are unacceptably high, a quarterly central bank survey of households released on Thursday showed. That was up from 47.6 percent in the previous poll. But only 48.9 percent of those polled expect inflation to increase in the second quarter compared with 64.8 percent who had expected a rise at the time of the previous survey, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said. It attributed the improvement in inflationary expectations to seasonal factors as well as to confidence in steps the government has taken to rein in inflation, which hit a near 12-year high of 8.7 percent in February. The poll of 20,000 households was carried out in 50 cities in mid- to late February. A record 51.4 percent of respondents said the current level of interest rates was appropriate, up from 46.3 percent in the previous poll. The central bank said 35.4 percent of households judged that they needed to save more, up from 30.2 percent, while 27.6 percent expected to invest more in shares and mutual funds, down from 35.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 44.3 percent in the third quarter. "With stock market swings increasing, people's enthusiasm to invest is continuously declining," the PBOC said. Only 14.6 percent of respondents said they planned to buy a house in the next three months, the lowest level in the life of the survey. BANKERS More than half of the 2,850 bankers questioned in a separate survey said they expected interest rates to stay on hold in the second quarter, the central bank said. "Bankers' expectations of interest rate increases have weakened markedly," it said. A record 62.4 percent of bankers judged monetary policy to be "relatively tight," up from last quarter's 54.0 percent. Only 4.1 percent of bankers questioned expected the economy to boil over next quarter; 74.9 percent described the economy as "relatively hot" this quarter, down from 81.2 percent last quarter. An index produced from the survey that measures loan demand rose to 68.9 percent from 66.8 percent three months earlier. Demand for loans was strongest from the agricultural sector, followed by utilities. A third survey found 77.4 percent of 5,485 businessmen polled were confident about the economic outlook, up from 76.8 percent in the previous poll. They mainly cited the success of efforts by the government to stave off overheating. Only 19.3 percent of those polled thought the economy was "relatively hot", down from 21.6 percent three months earlier. However, they pointed to problems such as short supplies of energy as well as rising production and capital costs. An index based on the survey that measures export orders declined to a near two-year low of 2.9 percent; a companion domestic-orders index dipped to 10.9 percent from 13.0 percent. However, businessmen said they were still optimistic about incoming orders next quarter: an index tracking expectations for domestic orders notched a record high of 13.5 perce
