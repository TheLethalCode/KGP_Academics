 BOGOTA, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A left-wing Colombian senator who helped broker the releases of six hostages held by Marxist rebels this year said does not expect more liberations under conservative President Alvaro Uribe.

Uribe refuses FARC demands that he pull troops from a populated area in western Colombia to stage a wider hostage swap.
