<TITLE> West Indies welcome back Sarwan for Sri Lanka series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies return to home international action for the first time since last year's World Cup when they take on Sri Lanka in Guyana from Saturday in the first of a two-test series. Since their poor showing at the one-day showpiece, West Indies have shown sparks of a revival only for disappointment to quickly follow. Following last year's 3-0 test defeat by England, the Caribbean side claimed their first ever test win in South Africa - their first test win since May 2005 - but then lost the next two tests and all five matches in the one-day series. Spinners Sulieman Benn and Amit Jaggernauth are included in the squad for the first time, while captain Chris Gayle has Barbados all-rounder Ryan Hinds back in the side for the first time in nearly three years. The biggest boost though is the return from injury of Guyanese batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan, who will share the top-order pressure with Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul. "It is a pretty balanced team, it's a good all round team, the expectation is high and we're looking forward to it," said Gayle. "Sri Lanka is a good team, they have been playing terrific cricket and it is up to us now to play some good cricket and back our talent," he added. RELIABLE SWING Sri Lanka are without two of their most consistent performers of recent years --Sanath Jayasuriya, who has retired from tests, and explosive pace bowler Lasith Malinga, who is injured. But with the prolific wicket-taking ability of spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and the reliable swing bowling of Chaminda Vaas, Gayle sees no reason to underestimate the Sri Lankan threat with the ball at the Providence Stadium in Georgetown. "They have a good bowling attack without Malinga, they have Vaas and Muralitharan who have been taking most of Sri Lanka's wickets so hopefully we can make the adjustment necessary," said Gayle. Skipper Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara provide the experienced core of the Sri Lankan batting line-up and despite several new faces the captain is hoping for his country's first test win in the Caribbean. "We're very good at home. In our conditions we dominate but away from home we've also been winning games recently. If we can keep competing away from home, challenging ourselves to be better cricketers every day that's the way forward. It's going to be a great challenge," Jayawardene said. The second test follows on April 3 in Trinidad and the tour is completed with three one-day internationals. Squads West Indies  Chris Gayle (captain), Dwayne Bravo, Sulieman Benn, Sewnarine Chattergoon, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Fidel Edwards, Ryan Hinds, Amit Jaggernauth, Darren Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Marlon Samuels, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Devon Smith, Jerome Taylor. Sri Lanka - Mahela Jayawardane (captain), Kumar Sangakkara, Michael Vandort, Malinda Warnapura, Thilann Samaraweera, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Prasanna Jayawardane, Muttiah Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas, Ishara Amarashinghe, Rangan Herath, Thilina Thushara Mirando, Chanaka Welegadara, Nuwan Kulasekara
