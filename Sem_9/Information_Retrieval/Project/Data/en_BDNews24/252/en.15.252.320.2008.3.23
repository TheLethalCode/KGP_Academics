<TITLE> Former US general defends Obama`s patriotism </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Medford, Ore., March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A retired US Air Force general who supports Barack Obama's campaign for the Democratic nomination criticized former President Bill Clinton on Saturday for appearing to question Obama's patriotism. Merrill Tony McPeak told an Obama rally of about 1,800 people in Medford that he was "saddened" by the comments of Clinton, who supports his wife, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. The two senators are engaged in a tight nomination battle, the winner of which will likely face presumptive Republican candidate Sen. John McCain in November at general elections to succeed U.S. President George W. Bush. During a speech in North Carolina on Friday, the former president said: "I think it would be a great thing if we had an election year where you had two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interest of this country," according to media reports. Clinton, who denied his words were meant as an attack on Obama, has played a role in the war of words between the two campaigns and has attracted criticism for appearing to cast aspersions on Obama's candidacy. "These tactics have no place in American politics," said McPeak, a co-chair of Obama's campaign. "Both Barack Obama and John McCain are great patriots who love this country and are devoted to it. So is Hillary Clinton. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat wrong," McPeak said as he introduced Obama. "I am happy and proud that he (Obama) loves this country so much that he would never play that kind of divisive tactics," said McPeak, who was appointed air force chief of staff by U.S. President George H.W. Bush. McPeak, a native of Oregon, is an important backer for Obama because he boosts his credibility on military issues. Obama gave a major speech on race in the United States on Tuesday and says he endured a "turbulent" two weeks, in part because of controversy over sharp denunciations of America made by the former pastor of his church in Chicago. The comments shocked many voters and led some commentators to question Obama's patriotism given his long friendship with the pastor, Jeremiah Wright. On Saturday, Obama called some Wright's comments "dumb." McCain, an Arizona senator who was held as prisoner of war in Vietnam, was abroad this week as part of a Senate Armed Services Committee fact-finding mission that visited Iraq, Israel, Jordan, France and Britain.
