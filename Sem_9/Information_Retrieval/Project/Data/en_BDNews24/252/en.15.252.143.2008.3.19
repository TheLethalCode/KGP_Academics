 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  Businessman Annisul Huq has been elected president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, according to official results released Wednesday. Abul Quashem Ahmed of Tangail Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been elected the first vice president of the apex trade body. Also elected was Abu Alam Chowdhury of Bangladesh Craft and Giftware Exporters Association as vice-president. FBCCI election board chairman Ali Ashraf who announced the names of the winners said the three had been elected unopposed. Golam Dastgir Gazi had signed up for the post of the first vice president and Obaidur Rahman for vice secretary but they had later withdrawn their nominations. Ashraf said opponent MA Rouf Chowdhury, chairman of Bangladesh Edible Oil Refiners' Association, proposed Huq's name as president. Huq said the country's politicians could learn a lesson from the FBCCI polls. "My opponent Chowdhury proposed my name as president. It's an example," he said. The FBCCI has an important role to play in economic development, Huq said. "We will carry out our responsibilities collectively, keeping all disputes aside," he said. Chowdhury also called for unity to contribute to economic development. bdnew
