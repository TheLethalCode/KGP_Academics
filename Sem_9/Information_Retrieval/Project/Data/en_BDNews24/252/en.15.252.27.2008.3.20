 Beijing, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top U.S. trade official on Thursday urged China and other emerging economies to be more bold about opening their markets in order to help get the Doha round of global trade negotiations back on track. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said that, in meetings with Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming, she had urged Beijing to take on a bigger role in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks, which have been going on for more than six years. "Given the incredible benefits that China derives from the global trading system and from the WTO, it is absolutely imperative that China play a responsible role in the Doha round negotiations, and in the WTO in general," Schwab told reporters. "Obviously, developed countries are expected to do more than developing countries, but the emerging markets clearly have a role and responsibility in the Doha round that exceeds the role and responsibility of developing countries in previous rounds." The talks, meant to help spread the benefits of trade more evenly, have missed deadline after deadline as rich and poor countries have argued over the size of concessions they would have to make. Schwab urged emerging economies to do more to lower their applied tariff rates, saying that only by reducing such trade barriers and hence increasing trade flows could developing countries benefit more. "For the Doha round really to meet its development promise, it requires countries like China to make a serious contribution in terms of meaningful market liberalisation," she said. Schwab said one issue she had discussed with Chen was the possibility of working together on a U.S. proposal on the elimination of trade barriers to environmental technologies and services. "It's a terrific example where China and the United States and others really stand to benefit," she said. The United States is also pressing Beijing to provide more access to the financial services sector, including by raising caps on foreign ownership in banks and brokerages. On Friday, Schwab will meet newly elected vice-premier Wang Qishan, who is expected to be in charge of economic and trade relations with the United States.
