<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is planning to impose a number of conditionsincluding minimum age and educational qualificationsfor local observers in the upcoming elections, an election official said Tuesday. According to the proposed conditions, those applying must be above 25 years of age and have passed SSC or equivalent examinations to be considered eligible as election observers, election commissioner Md Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com. "There will also be a condition in the proposed regulations that observers may not express their view before the results are published," Hossain said. "Their opinion sometimes affects the election results. However, they will be allowed to send off their written views to the Election Commission." He said the proposal would be finalised in discussion with the Election Working Group, a coalition of election observation agencies. "This time we will take a tougher line on election observers," Hossain said. The election commissioner said deputy commissioners, district and upazila election officers will verify the neutrality of the observers. He added it would take time to finalise the regulations. The EC had earlier formulated similar regulations in 2007 for the Jan 22 polls. But the proposal was cancelled along with the elections. The EC had given the go ahead to 126,630 observers from Bangladesh and about 150 from abroad prior to the cancelled 2007 elections. Around 218,000 observers, including 215 foreign observers, from 68 non-government organisations observed the 2001 elections. bdnew
