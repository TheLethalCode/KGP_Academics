 Savar, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - Students of Jahangirnagar University blockaded the Dhaka-Aricha highway Saturday, ransacking two buses and setting fire to two more, to protest an alleged attack on students in Gabtali. They eventually cleared their barricade from the highway following police assurance of action regarding the attack. Traffic movement on the highway eased back to normal from about 6 pm. The protestors said at least five JU students travelling on a university bus had been hurt earlier in an attack by the passengers of a pickup van on the Mazar Road in Gabtali. The situation calmed down when university proctor Prof Syed Quamrul Ahsan and Ashulia police assured the students of settling the matter. The drivers of both vehicles had been locked in an argument after the university bus hit the pickup van. The pickup van passengers attacked those on the university bus after they claimed the students slapped the van driver during the argument. Students then began blockading the highway near Dairy Farm Gate at around 3.30pm. Police soon rushed the scene but struggled to restore normal traffic flow. Prof Quamrul Ahsan told bdnews24.com earlier in the day that the authorities were trying to calm the students. He said the students insisted they would not desist from the blockade unless their attackers had been punished. bdnews2
