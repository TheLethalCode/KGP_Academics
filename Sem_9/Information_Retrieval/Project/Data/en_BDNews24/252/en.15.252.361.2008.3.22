The day has been observed since 1951, one year after World Meteorological Organisation was founded, and which has since been honoured as an agency of the United Nations System. Some 188 WMO-member countries and the world's meteorological community observe World Meteorological Day. Bangladesh will mark the day with the Bangladesh Meteorological Department holding a daylong programme at its headquarters in Agargaon.
