<TITLE> "Death threats" to witnesses against Liberia's Taylor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 The Hague, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Witnesses testifying in the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor are receiving death threats, deterring them from speaking in open court, officials say. Three individuals once close to Taylor's regime and who will play a key role in linking him to atrocities in Sierra Leone had received threatening phone calls and letters, presumably from Taylor loyalists, chief prosecutor Stephen Rapp told Reuters. Prosecutors had also received further reports of witness intimidation in Liberia and Sierra Leone despite protection schemes, and as a result some who were to have appeared in open court will now seek to give evidence privately and anonymously. Some witnesses received death threats, a court spokesman said. "We want people to testify in open session so the public hears it, but it can put them at risk. This concerns us a great deal," Rapp said in an interview late on Wednesday. Taylor, once one of Africa's most feared warlords, faces charges of rape, murder, mutilation and recruitment of child soldiers during Sierra Leone's 1991-2002 conflict. Prosecutors say Taylor, who has pleaded not guilty, wanted to plunder neighbouring Sierra Leone's diamonds and destabilise its government by controlling and arming rebels. Last week the court heard graphic details of atrocities from Joseph "ZigZag Marzah" a former Liberian militia leader who said Taylor had ordered countless murders and acts of cannibalism. Rapp said judges had ruled Marzah must testify in open session having balanced the threat to his security with the accused's right to a fair and public hearing. Despite Marzah having described killing more people than he can remember, including pregnant women and babies, he, like other witnesses will not face prosecution himself. The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is trying only those deemed most responsible, and prosecutors have had to assure some of those giving evidence they will not be charged. TRIAL ON TRACK Prosecutors, who began their case in January, expect to finish in eight months time having called a total of 72 witnesses and presented written evidence from a further 70 victims of the atrocities. "It is going well ... but it is still remarkable given we have to bring people on a 10,000 km round-trip," Rapp said. The trial, a landmark as for the first time a former African head of state finds himself in the dock, is being held in The Hague after fears it could stoke instability in West Africa. "I was concerned that there might be continued efforts to obstruct proceedings ... but the trial is being fought well by both sides," Rapp added, referring to the trial's abortive start last June when Taylor boycotted proceedings, arguing he did not have adequate funds for his defence. Rapp said experiences in Sierra Leone had lessons for the Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) currently facing a dilemma over whether to drop its arrest warrants for Ugandan rebels in order to further peace efforts in the country. "There is no peace without justice. We learned that in Sierra Leone," he said. "It was a fake peace, the rebels didn't want to disarm. Victims said how former ex-combatants came back, swaggered around and humiliated them. That didn't bring peace." Peace arrangements must include accountability, he said. "But international courts have to recognise different ways of allowing that accountability."
