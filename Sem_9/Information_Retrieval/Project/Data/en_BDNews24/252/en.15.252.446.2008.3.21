 WINDHOEK, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea's number two on Friday helped inaugurate a new state house built by his country in Namibia, underscoring the leading uranium producer's ties to the reclusive communist state. In a ceremony on the 18th anniversary of independence, President Hifikepunye Pohamba said Namibia enjoyed vital support from North Korea, under international pressure to abandon its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for aid. "Co-operation between our two countries has been growing over the years and one aspect of this has been the participation of Korean citizens in the construction of this building," he said. Kim Yong-nam, president of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, started a three-country African tour on Thursday in Namibia, the world's fifth-largest uranium miner. North Korea watchers said the search for business was the focus of the impoverished country's diplomacy and would be an important part of the visit to Africa, which will also take Kim to Angola and Uganda. China has led an Asian investment push into Africa as it seeks natural resources for its booming economy.

The southern African country recently announced it would develop plans to enrich locally mined uranium in conjunction with the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The top U.S. negotiator with North Korea said this week that Pyongyang was not yet ready to provide an accurate description of its nuclear programmes but he expects them to do so eventually. A 2005 accord under which North Korea agreed to abandon all its nuclear programmes in exchange for economic and diplomatic benefits has been bogged down by Pyongyang's failure to produce a declaration of its nuclear programmes by the end of last year. Kim's visit to Namibia came in for criticism from local human rights activists and newspapers, which expressed reservations because of alleged human rights abuses in North Korea and questioned whether the trip would attract investment. "There have been some concerns raised about the timing or even the need for this project. In this regard, I wish to say that this is a national asset which belongs to no one else but the people of Namibia," said Pohamba. North Korea established diplomatic relations with Namibia when it won independence under Nujoma in 1990. In his speech, Pohamba noted Namibia's social and economic development and political stability since th
