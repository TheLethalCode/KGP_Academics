 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Local government adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal drew attention Saturday to the fact that about 1.25 lakh children still die of diarrhoea every year in the country. Anwarul made his comments as chief guest at a programme to launch a hand washing campaign, to mark World Water Day and International Sanitation Week, at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. The adviser said children who survived a severe bout of diarrhoea often fell prey to malnutrition and other physical problems in the wake of the disease. "Therefore an extensive publicity campaign has to be carried out to create mass awareness about the causes of diarrhoea," said Anwarul. The adviser said the caretaker government has taken a number of steps to ensure the message of improved sanitation reached the masses. Anwarul said he hoped with the launch of the hand washing campaign up to 70 percent of diseases passed on through poor hygiene can be prevented. "The UN has fixed a 100 percent sanitation target worldwide by the year 2015, although the Bangladesh government is working to reach that target by 2010," he said. "The government started with a sanitation coverage area of 33.21 percent in 2003, and has now achieved sanitation coverage of 85 percent." "The full target can be reached in the given time," added the adviser. The NGO Forum, DfID, WHO, UNICEF and the Department of Public Health Engineering jointly organised the function. bdne
