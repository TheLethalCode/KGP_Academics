<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)The economy is "definitely not in a shambles", but it is going through difficult times, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Thursday. The adviser's comment came at a pre-budget views-exchange meeting with editors. As the cry for reviewing subsidies gets louder, raising revenue would be the key, editors of national dailies and electronic media told the adviser. Fuel, fertiliser, food are the top claimants for subsidies, now running into thousands of crores of taka. The adviser said that the social safety net would be stretched as far as possible in the forthcoming budget. The government is facing problems in its efforts to tackle spiralling prices countrywide, Mirza Aziz conceded. The adviser and civil servants claimed credit however for increased revenue during the current fiscalthough one editor wondered whether it was not emergency rule rather than government policy that was forcing people to pay taxes. Mirza Aziz and NBR chief Abdul Majid said efforts would be made to further strengthen the revenue collection machine so that such gains were permanent. "The fear factor" was also mentioned by the editors in this regard. "All undisclosed money is not corruption-tainted," Moazzem Hossain, editor of The Financial Express, insisted. Moazzem also voiced scepticism about the government's poverty reduction strategy being effective under the current climate of economic crisis. Mahmudur Rahman Choudhury, a retired colonel and editor of Bangladesh Today, suggested military spending be brought down. "You could at least do away with the development budget of the military while keeping the maintenance expenses at regular levels," he said. Editor of Prothom Alo Matiur Rahman asked if the high forex reserves could be used to help the people reeling from food shortages. Slow ADP implementation also came under fire from editors. The adviser agreed with the suggestion that the ADP should be brought down to realistic proportions. Following the pre-budget meeting with the editors, Mirza Aziz told reporters at the finance ministry: "Bangladesh is facing the myriad effects of the global increase in food and other commodity prices." "We in the government are making utmost efforts to keep the spiralling food and commodity prices within the reach of the people." "But we're seeing very little success as the nation is passing very hard times over this issue." The social security net will be considerably widened when drawing up the forthcoming budget, the adviser assured, with a view to keeping commodity prices within people's reach. Simultaneously, necessary measures will be adopted to boost agricultural production. Asked to comment on a recent proposal by Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan, to supply 150 million hardcore poor with free food, Mirza Aziz said: "The government isn't considering anything like that at the moment." "The government doesn't even have money enough to supply a kilogramme of rice per person per day for all those people." The adviser said the editors had expressed satisfaction over the government's enhanced revenue earnings. "They also urged the government to take necessary steps to sustain the current trend," the adviser added. The editors also suggested that the government augment agricultural production and initiate agro-based industries, while cutting expenditure in the non-productive sectors, he said. "Detailed discussions were held with the editors over the foreign currency reserves. Many pointed out that the Bangladesh Bank has kept reserves in excess," Mirza Aziz said. "I've cleared the government's position in this regard while talking to them." The finance adviser said five billion dollars was not a vast amount. "One has to keep at least an amount of foreign currency which should be adequate to meet the country's import costs for three months." "What we have now would just suffice to finance three and a half months' imports." Those present at Thursday's meeting included Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, Bangladesh Today editor Mahmudur Rahman Choudhury, bdnews24.com editor-in-chief Toufique Imrose Khalidi and Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamol Datta. On the government side, NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid, commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed, ERD secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan and planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury were among those present. bdnews24.com/
