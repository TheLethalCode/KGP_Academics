 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)The government will finalise the coal policy soon, as the energy and power sector is set to expedite decision-making, a special aide to the chief adviser said Friday. Dr M Tamim, special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of the energy, power and mineral resources ministry, said that 80 percent of recommendations in the energy policy formulated in 1996 had not been implemented in the past 12 years. "Institutional strengthening and financial assistance are a must to make things happen now," he said, speaking as chief guest at a Sheba Bangladesh Foundation roundtable on 'Energy crisis and possibilities'. Tamim said the 1968 Mining Act must be amended and the coal policy should be finalised as soon as possible. Tamim said: "We have to maximise the use of foreign aid and technical assistance in the energy and power sector. We will have to generate 20,000 MW power by 2020 if we want to fulfil millennium development goals." Decisions about all these issues must be taken without delay, he said with a warning that the huge subsidies for the energy sector had posed a serious burden on the government, which threatens to slow economic progress. Dr Mushfiqur Rahman, general manager of Asia Energy, said the government needs to take a few difficult but essential decisions. Mollah A Amzad Hossain, editor of English magazine Energy and Power, said the government should consider the demands raised by civil-society watchdogs and pressure groups and ignore opposition from protectionists in order to help fuel growth. bdnews
