 LONDON, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's largest mortgage lenders are suffering the most from the credit crunch, which has hit their competitiveness more than their smaller rivals, data shows. Less than a third of the top mortgages on the market today come from the country's 10 largest lenders, according to price comparison Web site Moneyfacts.co.uk.

In contrast, troubled mortgage bank Northern Rock, Alliance and Leicester and GMAC all failed to make the top 250. "In a time when many (people) are struggling to find a suitable mortgage, these results show that it is definitely worth looking around for the best deal," added Harvey.
