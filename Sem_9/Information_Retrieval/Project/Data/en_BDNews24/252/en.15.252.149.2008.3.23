 Kabul, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A roadside bomb killed two soldiers from the US-led coalition in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, a US military statement said. Taliban insurgents planted hundreds of roadside bombs in 2007, contributing to a record year of violence that killed more than 6,000 people, nearly 2,000 of them civilians. "Coalition forces, along with Afghan National Security Forces, were conducting a security patrol in the Zharmi District, when their vehicle struck a mine placed on a frequently travelled road", said the statement, issued late on Saturday. More than 200 foreign troops were killed in Afghanistan in 2007 while nearly 30 troops from the U.S.-led coalition and NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have been killed since so far this year.
