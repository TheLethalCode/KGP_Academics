 Moinul Haque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- The Bangladesh Meteorological Department is set for a major overhaul with the introduction of a state-of-the-art weather prediction system. Director of the meteorological department Dr Samarendra Karmaker said Saturday: "We are modernising the meteorological department." "The numerical weather prediction system will be operational by the middle of next year." The met office will then be able to forecast the weather using numerical models, which it hopes will give more accurate and early predictions, Samarendra said. "The new system will predict cyclones, tidal bores, tornados, cold waves and heat waves more accurately, and in good time." Meteorological department deputy director Arjumand Habib told bdnews24.com that modern technology combined with an accurate analysis of forecast data would also go a long way to mitigating the impact of bad weather. Samarendra defended the institution's record of forecasting, pointing to accurate warnings in the past for the super cyclones of 1985, 1991 and 2007. The met office director also stressed cooperation between government and private organisations and increased awareness among the public to reduce the loss of life and damage to property during extreme weather. There are 35 first class meteorological observatories under the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Of these, 10 are pilot-balloon observatories, 14 are agro-meteorological, four are radar stations while the rest are seismic observation centres. The met office said the stations record the temperature, wind speed, wind force, cloud coverage, fog, rainfall and other data every six hours. Deputy director Aminul Islam Bhuiyan said work had started on setting up a further 14 observatories and forecast centres, five first class meteorological observatories and seven agro-meteorological observatories. bdnews24.
