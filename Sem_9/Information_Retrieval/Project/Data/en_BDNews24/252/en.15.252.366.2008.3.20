 NEW YORK, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham said he was humbled to present a lifetime achievement award to Pele at a charity event in Manhattan Wednesday. "For me to be here to present this to the greatest sportsmen of all time, I feel particularly honoured," the Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder told reporters. "This absolutely is a highlight moment for me." The black-tie event, a $1,250-a-plate fundraiser at Gotham Hall, was a benefit for Harlem Youth Soccer. Pele, 67, widely regarded as the greatest footballer ever, blazed a trail for soccer in North American soccer, one that Beckham now follows. After helping Brazil win three World Cups, Pele joined the North American Soccer League's New York Cosmos in 1975. Beckham's first year with the Galaxy was blighted by injury, the former England captain scoring just one goal in eight matches for the MLS team before a knee injury ended his season. However, he insisted he had no regrets over his decision to leave Real Madrid for Los Angeles. "I'm very happy, my family is very happy," said the 32-year-old. "It's been a great move for us." Beckham added that he was relishing the challenge of broadening the game's appeal in a country where basketball, baseball, American football and ice hockey dominate. "Soccer is a magical game. I'm very confident fans here in America will continue to see that," said the former Manchester United midfielder. "There's no reason they can't be as passionate about soccer as they are about every other sport here.
