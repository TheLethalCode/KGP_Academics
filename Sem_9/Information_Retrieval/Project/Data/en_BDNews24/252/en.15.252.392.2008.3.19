 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Growth in British manufacturers' orders unexpectedly accelerated in March as export demand picked up and firms are confident enough about the future to plan sharp price hikes, a survey indicated on Wednesday. The Confederation of British Industry's monthly industrial trends survey's total order books balance rose to +7 from +3 in February. Analysts had expected an easing in growth to +1. The pick up in activity was driven by strong demand for British goods overseas. The export orders balance rose to +3 in March from -8 in February, matching the 13-year high hit in November 2006. "Manufacturing is not only holding up as the wider economy slows but growing on the back of strong exports," said Ian McCafferty, CBI chief economic advisor. "With the prospects for the domestic market uncertain it is important that firms can continue to attract overseas business which a competitive pound will help enormously." Sterling has fallen to its lowest level on a trade-weighted basis in more than decade this month, making British goods cheaper for overseas buyers. Output expectations in the sector remain strong, with the balance rising to +18 in March from +11 -- the highest since June 2007. However, Bank of England policymakers may be concerned about increasing price pressures in the sector as it tries to keep inflation under control despite a slowing overall economy. The prices expectations balance picked up to +25 in March from +22 -- the highest since May 2007. "This highlights the serious inflation pressures that are currently constraining the Bank of England's ability to respond to downside growth risks by cutting interest rates aggressively," said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. The BoE is expected to lower interest rates to 5 percent in the next few months as the credit crunch starts to drag on the economy, but most analysts agree the scope for further cuts may be limited. The survey was conducted between February 27 and March
