<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) -- US charge d'affaires Geeta Pasi said Saturday the issue of holding political dialogues with parties was for the government alone to decide. Pasi said foreign diplomats may hold their own talks with different groups, including political parties and businessmen. But, questioned by journalists following a local community meeting in Gulshan, she said that it was not up to the diplomatic community to say whether dialogues between the government and political parties should take place. The discussion meeting was held during an 'Open Day' programme at Gulshan Police Station, organised to air and share problems of the local community. Pasi said she was attending the function not in a professional capacity but simply as a resident of Gulshan. Gulshan deputy police commissioner Rezaul Alam moderated the programme, while former adviser and former inspector general of police ASM Shahjahan, local ward commissioners Peara Mostafa, Anwar Hossain, Rabeya Alam and local residents addressed the meeting. Shahjahan said the government had started reforms within the police force, and programmes such as Saturday's 'Open Day' were an important step as a bridge between the police and the people. The speakers at the function discussed various problems of the area including traffic jams, free selling of drugs, vandalism of telephone cables and water crises. The function also discussed the activities, obstacles and problems of service organisations such as the city corporation, WASA, RAJUK, Titas Gas and the Power Development Board. bdnew
