<TITLE> Fatah seeks new blood in bid for Palestinian state </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RAMALLAH, West Bank, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The once-dominant Fatah faction is looking for younger members as it struggles to draw popular support from its Islamist rival Hamas, and overcome deadlock in Palestinian peace efforts with Israel. With a survey earlier this week showing support waning for Fatah's leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, the US-backed Palestinian leadership in the West Bank is bidding to recover its political viability. "We don't want members whose pockets are filled with medications. We want an infusion of new blood," said Qaddoura Fares, a member of Fatah who calls for reforming the group, in disarray since its shock loss of legislative elections to Hamas Islamists in January 2006. Abbas is widely expected to convene select members this year, for the first time since 1989, for internal votes at which a "young guard" of grassroots leaders will try to win posts in two key decision-making bodies. Though no date or venue has been set, the conference is seen by Fatah stalwarts as make-or-break for the secular faction. "This conference, if it's convened, would either re-launch the movement or could help fragment Fatah," said Fares. The conference would pit Fares, and other Fatah reformists who grew up fighting and then talking to Israeli occupiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, against Fatah veterans. They founded the faction in 1965 but stayed in the privileged diaspora until the advent of limited Palestinian self-rule three decades later. Fatah's membership rolls say much. The Fatah Central Committee (FCC) and Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC) originally had 21 and 146 members respectively. Now there are 16 and 124, owing to the absence of a mechanism to replace those who died. Surviving FCC members are all over 65 years old. Two are bedridden. The "young guard", waiting for years in the wings, isn't getting any younger -- many of the men are in their 50s. The stakes go beyond intra-Fatah tensions, all the way to the prospects of ever achieving Palestinian independence. CREDIBILITY The survey, by the West Bank-based Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, showed Israeli attacks in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip have boosted the popularity of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. If new presidential elections were held now, it found, Haniyeh would receive 47 percent of the vote compared with 46 percent for Abbas. The centre's previous poll, in December, gave Gaza-based Haniyeh just 37 percent of a potential presidential vote compared with 56 percent for Abbas, whose peace efforts with Israel are opposed by Hamas. Revitalising Fatah could boost its credibility among Palestinians who, disaffected by its reputation for cronyism and paltry progress in negotiations with Israel, shifted support to straight-talking Hamas. Fatah's inter-factional power struggle is especially fraught since Hamas seized Gaza after Israeli troops and settlers withdrew in 2005, leaving Abbas effectively in charge of only the West Bank and rupturing the idea of one Palestinian polity. Hamas is shunned by the West for preaching the destruction of the Jewish state, so Fatah and its leader Abbas are the focus of international hopes for founding a peaceful Palestine. "The conference will witness renewal in leadership and will strengthen Fatah, so that its position will be stronger when it comes to negotiations with Israel or opening dialogue with Hamas," said Nabil Shaath, a veteran member of the FCC. The current strategy of Abbas and his U.S.-trained prime minister, Salam Fayyad, appears to be to improve economic conditions in the West Bank so Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which is under foreign embargo, sour on Hamas rule. Streamlining Fatah could help Abbas in his bid to bring forward parliamentary and presidential elections, though Hamas insists the ballot should be held in 2010 as scheduled. "The conference would aim to rebuild the movement in such a good way as to allow us to press ahead," said Abdallah Franji, an FCC member. The Fatah old guard reluctantly agreed to hold new internal elections in 2005 but the conference was postponed indefinitely. The last such meeting was in Tunis in 1989. Several Fatah officials said Abbas was determined to hold the conference, in Jordan or Egypt, and probably in the summer. For now, Fatah is holding votes in the West Bank and Gaza to assemble a list of around 1,000 attendees for the conference. When and if the event goes ahead, up to half of the 16 FCC members are expected to be replaced by younger candidates, Fatah officials said, especially as some of the older current members will not run for re-election. Dozens of reformist leaders could win their way into the FRC, the officials said. "There will be a change in our favour but the question remains about the size of this change," said Far
