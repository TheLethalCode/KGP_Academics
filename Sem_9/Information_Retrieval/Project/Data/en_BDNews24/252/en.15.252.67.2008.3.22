 Madaripur, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has reiterated that elections would be held by December, but that they cannot be held under a state of emergency. "According to the roadmap that is on my mind, elections will be held by December," the CEC told reporters at a relative's house in Madaripur Friday night. But asked if the election would be held under a state of emergency, the CEC said: "Elections cannot be held amid a state of emergency. We have asked the government to create a congenial atmosphere for the polls." He said that political parties have to be allowed to campaign, meet voters and hold meetings and rallies before the polls. But it is up to the government if it retains some emergency powers rules in the interests of anticorruption drive, Huda said. He said the draft voter list would be published by the end of June and the final one by October. The CEC said he did not see any reason for the polls not to be held by the end of 2008. "We have already registered five crore people as voters. We accomplished this one week before our deadline (April 2)." It would take three months to register the remaining three crore voters, he added. Replying to reporters' comments that the EC's failure to hold polls last time, Shamsul Huda said: "The EC never failed." "Last time, the election was not held due to a particular reason." He then repeated with confidence that the upcoming election would be held in time. bdnews2
