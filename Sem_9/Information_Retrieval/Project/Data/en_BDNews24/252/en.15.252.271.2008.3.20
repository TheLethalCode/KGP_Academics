 Moscow, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the Russia-NATO council to discuss U.S. authorisation for arms supplies to Kosovo, Itar-Tass news agency quoted Russia's envoy to NATO as saying on Thursday. U.S. President George W. Bush on Wednesday authorised arms supplies to Kosovo, saying it would "strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace", according to a document on the White House Web site. "I have addressed NATO's secretary-general with a proposal to hold an emergency informal meeting of the Russia-NATO council to discuss U.S. plans to supply weapons to Kosovo," Tass quoted Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin as saying in Brussels. "They (Washington) say the weapons will help fight terrorism. At the same time, it is namely former terrorists who are in power in Kosovo right now," Rogozin said. "How can you fight terrorism, supplying weapons to former terrorists?" Washington was among the first to recognise Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia last month, despite strong opposition from Russia and Belgrade. "Washington is rushing headlong, violating all international agreements, according to which Kosovo has no right to create its own armed forces," Tass quoted an unnamed source in Russia's government as saying in Moscow later on Thursday.
