<TITLE> Foreigners' remarks on internal politics unlawful: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff has said that speaking of the country's internal political matters by foreigners during their visits here on tourist visa is not in conformity with law. Asked by reporters Thursday whether the law allowed foreigners to come and speak about internal political matters, the adviser said the law does not allow it, but the government has so far showed a lenient attitude. "A bit stronger stance has been taken now," Hassan Ariff said in his weekly briefing. "Foreigners are not being allowed to talk to journalists on political matters of the country. Anybody coming on a tourist visa cannot talk about Bangladesh's internal politics. If we go to any country on a tourist visa, we don't speak on that country's internal matters. And we can't." "Under the existing laws, foreigners coming on business purposes, and especially foreign experts, have to face many problems in getting work permits. The existing law lacks coordination of these matters and will be amended." A meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order held Thursday discussed in detail an amendment to the Foreigners Act. Home secretary Abdul Karim told reporters that the persons concerned had been directed to prepare a report after examining the law. bdnews24.c
