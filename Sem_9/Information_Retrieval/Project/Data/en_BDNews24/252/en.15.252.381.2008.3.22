 Harare, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe accused the main opposition on Saturday of forging a "treasonous" alliance with former colonial power Britain to oust him. The 84-year-old leader is seeking re-election for another five-year term in a presidential race in which he faces former finance minister Simba Makoni and Morgan Tsvangirai, who leads the main faction of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Mugabe, a former liberation hero in power since independence in 1980, took his election campaign to the capital Harare in the final stretch to the March 29 general election, the biggest challenge to his rule since he took office. He told thousands of supporters in an open sports ground in the poor township of Mbare that Britain was sponsoring the MDC in a bid to reverse the seizure of white-owned land for blacks. "It is treasonous for the MDC to continue to help the British so that they have any influence here," Mugabe told supporters in a speech delivered mainly in local Shona. "They (MDC) still look up to the British in this day and age. They want to rule this country, that will not happen as long as we are still alive, those of us who fought the liberation struggle," Mugabe said, predicting the opposition would break apart after the March 29 poll. Mugabe has often resorted to a strategy of attacking his Western foes, mainly Britain, in a bid to deflect attention away from an economy critics say he has left in tatters, analysts say. The combative leader repeated threats to punish British companies that still operate in Zimbabwe for what he said was London's continued meddling in the country's internal affairs. "They have companies here and so they must take care because after elections we will move on them," he told cheering supporters. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF has lost seats to the MDC in Harare and other major towns in elections since 2000, but on Saturday the veteran leader promised his government would ease prices of basic goods. He donated public buses and pledged to equip crumbling hospitals. Urban workers have borne the brunt of an economic crisis that has sent inflation past 100,000 percent -- the world's highest -- and resulted in shortages of food, fuel, water and electricity. Mugabe said foreign-owned companies would be compelled to cede majority stakes to local blacks, adding that businesses were hiking prices to turn voters against his government. "These companies are joking, they don't know us. We ask them, are you with us or you are working for someone else?" Mugabe said.
