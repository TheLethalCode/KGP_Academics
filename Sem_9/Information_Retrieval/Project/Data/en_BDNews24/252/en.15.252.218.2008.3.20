<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  A superb five-scalp from medium pacer Farhad Reza guided Bangladesh to wrap up the three-ODI series with one match to go, inflicting a massive 84-run defeat to Ireland in the second one-dayer Thursday. The Tigers bundled the Irishmen out for 162 in 38.3 overs, after posting a fighting total of 246 for eight in 50 overs as opener Shahriar Nafees and Aftab Ahmed each struck fifty at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla national Stadium. Farhad missed a hat-trick chance in the match but never made a mistake to produce his career best of five for 42, eclipsing his previous best of one for 19 against Zimbabwe in Harare in 2006. The 21-year old pacer caused the main damage, ripping through Ireland's top order and later cleaned up the tail, while duo left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak (3/27) and Shakib Al Hasan (2/16) wiped out the middle to frustrate the Irishmen from levelling the series. The lanky pacer dismissed three Irish batsmen in his last three-over spell conceding just seven runs, after his first 7-over spell read 7-2-35-2, and he finally finished 10-3-42-5. It was the eighth one-dayer series triumph for the Tigers, after three against Zimbabwe, two against Kenya, one against Scotland and a triangular series involving Bermuda and Canada prior to the last World Cup. Irish openers William Porterfield (25) and Reinhardt Strydom (15) showed good enough nerve against the pacers with patient batting, but the introduction of the spinners prompted them to collapse. Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful brought Razzak in the 11th over to break a 42-run opening partnership, and afterwards Farhad began his devastating spell. The young pacer first removed Eoin Morgan (4), having him caught by Nafees superbly at cover, and finished bowling Greg Thompson (1) out. Porterfield, Andre Botha and Alex Cusack were also victims of Farhad. In the middle, Niall O'Brien (18) and Kevin O'Brien (21) produced some resistance to put on 36 runs for the fourth wicket before the fifth wicket between Botha (34) and Cusack (24) added another 52 runs. But, the dismissal of Botha prompted Ireland to slump 162 all out as they lost the last five wickets in 19 runs. Earlier, deciding to bat first, Nafees and Tamim Iqbal got off to a cautious start under cloud-covered skies, but some quickfire knocks from Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful and Mashrafee helped the hosts to recover from their initial stupour to give their bowlers something to aim at. Nafees and Tamim gave a solid 94-run opening partnership, by achieving between 3.3 and 3.7 runs per over. The openers stayed on the wicket till the 26th over before Tamim was removed by Kevin O'Brien for 46 off 84 balls that was studded with three fours and one six. Tamim smashed off-spinner Kyle McCallan for a six over the mid-wicket and tried for the same in the next ball, but holed out of Kevin O'Brien at deep mid-wicket and was deprived of a half-century that would have been his deserved fifth ODI fifty. Nafees, fresh from his unbeaten 90 in the previous match, hit 60 off 92 balls with the help of six fours before he was run out, leaving the side at 135 for two in 35th over. The left-handed opener added another 41 runs for the second wicket with Aftab Ahmed, who played rather blandly but made a timely 61 off just 57 balls that was studded with two sixes and as many fours on way to his 14th ODI fifty. Ashraful and Aftab took the run rate over 4 an over for the fourth wicket before Greg Thompson had Aftab caught by Trent Johnston, reducing Bangladesh to 199 for three in 43 overs. They together put on 64 runs. Bangladesh suddenly slipped to 223 for six, from 199 for three, as Dave Langford-Smith removed Farhad (1), Shakib (2) and Botha dismissed Ahsraful for a 36-ball 38. However, Mashrafee blasted a 16-ball 26 with the help of three fours and one six before he was the third victim of Langford-Smith, who returned three for 43. The third and final match will be held on Saturday at the same venue. bdnew
