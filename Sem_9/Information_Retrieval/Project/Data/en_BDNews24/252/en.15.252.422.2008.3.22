<TITLE> Unemotional Pietersen breaks batting slump with century </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Pietersen's edge through the slips for his 10th boundary brought about little emotion from the England batsman on the first day of the third test against New Zealand on Saturday. He had just scored his 11th test century, which ended a run of 11 innings without a score over 50, and rescued his side's batting after they had slumped to four for three after winning the toss on a batter-friendly pitch. "The match situation (meant) I could not prance around like a cake," Pietersen told reporters after he brought up the milestone. "I was just working in 10s and looking at the scoreboard and trying to get a partnership going. "If we were two down and in a lot better position I may have been a bit more extravagant. "But my head wasn't in that space. I was relieved." England ended the day on 240 for seven after Pietersen's century and an unbeaten 42 from Stuart Broad. Debutant Tim Southee had earlier taken two wickets in his first three overs. Pietersen, who had appeared to be lacking in confidence throughout the series, stroked 12 fours and one six on to the roof of the main stand at McLean Park before he was caught by Jamie How at gully for 129 -- more than 62 percent of his team's run when he was dismissed at 207 for seven. The South African-born batsman had not made a test score in excess of 50 since his 101 against India last August, had admitted he had been going through a batting slump. "I've always said I'm not a robot," he added. "I have to go through a patch where I don't score for a while. "Hopefully that patch is over now and the cricket gods are smiling on me. "(But) I was confident in knowing that I was going through a trot where I wasn't scoring 50s and 100s but I was scoring 30s and 40s, which isn't bad. "When you're going through a bad trot and you're still averaging 30 ...I took confidence from that and knew that with the amount of work I was putting in I would get rewarded at some stage. "Today is a happy day for me
