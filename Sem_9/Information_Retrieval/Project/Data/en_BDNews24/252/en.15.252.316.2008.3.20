 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Thursday issued a ruling that former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman could be quizzed in jail in two extortion cases. The bench of Justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Md Ashfaqul Islam issued the order on Tarique's two appeals for cancellation of the remand orders by the trial court. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on Nov 26 ordered a three-day remand for Tarique in a Tk 4.89 crore extortion case. Businessman Syed Abu Shahed Sohel filed the case on May 4 with Gulshan Police Station. Earlier on Nov 19, the court approved a three-day remand for Tarique in another extortion case. Khairul Bashar, general manager of Abdul Momen Limited, filed another case with Shahbagh Police Station against him for extorting Tk 10.31 crore. Tarique, senior joint secretary general of the BNP, was arrested on March 8, 2007. The HC had earlier frozen the remand orders after Tarique appealed to the court. Barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah, assisted by Barrister Nawshad Jamir, defended Tarique in court. Assistant attorney general Khandoker Diliruzzaman took the side of the government. bdnew
