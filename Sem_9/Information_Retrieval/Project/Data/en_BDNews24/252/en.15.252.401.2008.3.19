 MILAN, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seat Pagine Gialle's shares tumbled more than 20 percent to a record low and its bonds fell on Wednesday after the Italian yellow pages publisher lowered its forecast for the year and suspended its dividend. Seat also declined to confirm its forecast for the years beyond 2008, saying it wanted to first see the results of a new strategy to sell Internet ads separately from print ads. The lack of guidance drew criticism from analysts at a presentation of its 2007 results. "We will need at least six months of operating data before being able to give investors a forecast for the coming years," Chief Executive Luca Majocchi told analysts, adding that he would be able to give an update around November. "In the past we have been too optimistic," Majocchi said. The company has failed to meet its profit forecast for the last three years. "Now we want to be more reliable," he said. On Tuesday evening Seat cut its forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to 610 million euros from 650 million in 2007. Seat had forecast its core profit growing by 4 to 5 percent at a compound annual rate from 2007 to 2010. At 1230 GMT Seat shares were down 21.3 percent at 0.10 euro, a record low, giving the company a market value of about a third of its debt of 3.3 billion euros ($5.19 billion). Volumes were three times the daily average. Britain's Yell Group was doing better, trading 6.1 percent lower in London. Scrapping the dividend would allow Seat to invest in its Internet activities and pay down debt, Majocchi said. Seat, which has focused on print directories and selling Internet ads as an additional product to its core products, aims to change and sell Internet ads as a stand-alone product. About 30 percent of small and medium-sized companies in Italy advertise online with Seat. The company aims to attract another 40 percent of that market for a 70 percent total. PAYING BACK DEBT Seat publishes directories in Italy and Britain and has invested heavily in directory assistance numbers in Italy and France that the public can call, for a fee, to find phone numbers or business listings. Addressing concerns about Seat's ability to pay back its bonds and debt, Majocchi reiterated the company had enough cash even if the Italian economy slows down more than expected. "Now we're expecting 0.5 percent (growth in gross domestic product)," he said. "Even if it's zero we have enough." Seat must pay back 163 million euros this year, 219 million euros in 2009 and 232 million euros in 2010. Majocchi said Seat will have no problems paying its debt down on schedule. Seat is investing in Internet operations to counter flagging sales in its mature print businesses. In particular, Germany will weigh on EBITDA this year as Seat merges its Telegate unit with newly-acquired Klicktel, with EBITDA forecast to fall to about 30 million euros this year from 48 million euros in 2007. Seat estimates EBITDA from German operations will climb back to more than 40 million euros by 2010. Seat's 10-year bond recovered to 80 to 82.5 percent of face value after falling to 79.9 percent, according to traders. The bond stood at 96 percent two months ago. Credit default swaps on Seat, which indicate the cost of insuring its debt against default, were at between 820 to 840 basis points, according to one Milan dealer. Seat and other directory publishers are heavily indebted, so their shares suffer when lending markets tighten up, as in the current financial cris
