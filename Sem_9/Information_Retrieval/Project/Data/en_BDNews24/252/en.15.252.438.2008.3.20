<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell early on Thursday, echoing sharp falls on US markets, as weaker commodity prices hammered miners and oils, but Rentokil Initial jumped after hiring a turnaround team. By 0831 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 0.7 percent or 38.9 points at 5,506.7, having fallen 1.1 percent on Wednesday. The UK benchmark index has lost more than 14 percent so far this year on concerns of a looming US recession stemming from a meltdown in the risky subprime mortgage market. "The market is very nervous," said David Buik of Cantor Index. "The stock market is cheap, but the trouble is that sentiment is appalling, and while sentiment is bad, it is very difficult to do anything about it." Buik said he hoped a scheduled meeting on financial stability between the Bank of England and top UK banks could help stabilise the market. Miners were the worst hit as metal prices fell. BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, Kazakhmys, Lonmin and Vedanta Resources were down between 2.7 and 6.5 percent. Oil shares tracked weaker crude prices, with BP down 1.5 percent and Royal Dutch Shell off 1.4 percent.

But banks were also mostly weaker after the previous session's heavy beating and after Swiss bank Credit Suisse said it was unlikely to post a profit in the first quarter of 2008 due to big writedowns and difficult markets. Barclays eased 0.2 percent, Lloyds TSB dropped 0.6 percent, HSBC slipped 0.3 percent, and Standard Chartered slipped 0.9 percent. Mortgage lender HBOS, which bore the brunt of rumours of banking sector troubles on Wednesday, rebounded 2.9 percent. The credit crisis took another turn in the hedge fund sector. The Financial Times said Endeavour Capital, a $3 billion London hedge fund, lost more than a quarter of its value as it became the biggest victim of the unwinding of a popular Japanese government bond trade. Hedge fund Man Group shed 2.5 percent. But Rentokil Initial jumped more than 20 percent after news that the pest control to parcel delivery firm had hired the management team that turned around chemicals group ICI in a bid to recover from two profit warnings that have hammered its shares. British Airways also bounced 2.4 percent after Wednesday's steep losses and as oil prices eas
