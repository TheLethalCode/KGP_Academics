 TAIPEI, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan's stormy relations with China and recent violence in Tibet are dominating the final hours before the island's presidential election on Saturday, as each side seeks to show it is best qualified to resist Beijing. Ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh, who has trailed in media polls, has pushed a message that to vote for the more China-friendly Nationalist Party candidate Ma Ying-jeou could make Taiwan "a second Tibet". China has claimed self-ruled Taiwan as its territory since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and pledged to bring the island under its rule, by force if necessary. China sent its troops into Tibet, rocked by anti-China rioting last week, in 1950. "This is a choice between a democratic Taiwan and Communist China," DPP newspaper adverts proclaimed on Friday, calling on electors to "protect Taiwan". Not to be left out, Ma slammed remarks by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who offered peace talks this week, calling Wen's comments "arrogant, absurd and self-righteous". Ma was also first to suggest a Beijing Olympic boycott if violence in Tibet continued, though he has disputed Hsieh's claims that Taiwan could become another Tibet. "I think they both try to present the image they are tough on China," said Alexander Huang, professor of strategic studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan. "My hunch is that both sides will be very tough on China." Each has graced candlelit vigils alongside robed monks and local Tibetans for those believed killed by soldiers or police in Tibetan areas of China since protests began on March 10. But Ma's party advocates eventual unification with China, while Hsieh's seeks independence. Hsieh's cartoon TV commercials have lampooned Ma's proposal for a common market with China, showing Chinese workers and poisoned food pouring into Taiwan. AIRCRAFT CARRIERS "What Wen Jiabao says and what Ma says are pretty much the same, right?" Hsieh quipped at a news conference on Thursday. "It's that Taiwan is part of China." In a sign how sensitive the poll is, two U.S. aircraft carriers have been sent to the Taiwan region for training exercises during the election. China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait in 1996, trying to intimidate voters during an election. The United States recognises China, but is Taiwan's biggest ally. "I hope the aircraft carriers are here to send a message to Beijing that people who want free elections are not threatened or intimidated by outside forces," visiting U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher told reporters in Taipei. Russia on Wednesday threw its weight behind ally China, describing Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on whether to seek UN membership as a "political escapade". The initiative, which asks whether Taiwan should seek UN membership as "Taiwan" instead of its formal name, the Republic of China, has also sparked statements of protest from China, Japan, France and the United States. It is a fruitless bid, as China has a veto on the UN Security Council. Ma, known for his clean professional image and strong economic platform, still leads Hsieh in opinion surveys by 5 to 10 percent, analysts say. "It'll be close, but I don't think Hsieh has done enough to win," said Bruce Jacobs, a professor of Asian studies at Monash University in Australia. "I don't think Tibet can change votes." Neither candidate has dropped pledges for regular direct flights to China, for a boost in tourism and for an easing of China investment rules, plans that are seen as ways to shore up a domestic economy beset by inflation and wage stagnation. Yet China trade ties have boomed over the past two decades, with Taiwan firms investing up to $100 billion on the other si
