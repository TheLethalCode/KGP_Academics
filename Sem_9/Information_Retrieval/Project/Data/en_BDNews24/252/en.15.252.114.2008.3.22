<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh whitewashed Ireland in the three-ODI series 3-0, handing a massive 79-run defeat to the visitors in the final one-dayer at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. The Tigers folded the Irishmen at 214 with 4.3 overs to spare, after posting their second highest total of 293 for seven in 50 overs, riding on opener Tamim Iqbal's maiden century. Irish openers William Porterfield (18) and Reinhardt Strydom (37) put up a fight achieving 4.5 runs per over, but two quick dismissals -- Porterfield and Eion Morgan (12) -- slowed down the visitors' run rate. The other Irishmen kept the momentum just above snail's pace but, needing more than 6 runs per over to win, never appeared to decisively chase the target. They appeared mostly to stick to the crease rather than hunting the Tigers, though Niall O'Brien played an entertaining 70 off 74 balls clubbing four fours and one six before being the ninth Irish batsman ousted, by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak who returned two for 51. Four Irish batsmen  Porterfield, Andre Botha (2), Alex Cusack (11) and Trent Johnston (0)  were run out, while Niall O'Brien and Kevin O'Brien (11) survived two close calls, that TV replays showed were actually out, as there was no third umpire. Wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh broke last batsman Greg Thomson's stumps, off an Abdur Razzak delivery, to stop Ireland at 214 all out. Shakib Al Hasan chipped in with two wickets for 46 while Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Mahmudullah took one wicket each for 32 and 41 respectively. Earlier, a maiden ton from Tamim set Bangladesh to post their second highest total in one-day international after their best of 301 for seven came against Kenya at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra in 2006. The 19-year old batsman, who was dropped on 38 by bowler Botha, finally hit 129 before being caught at long-off by Porterfield off Dave Langford-Smith, leaving the side at 260 for six in 47.3 overs. Man of the match Tamim reached the landmark score smashing pacer Trent Johnston for a four through the third-man area. The left-handed opener smashed 15 fours and one six facing 138 balls, putting on a solid foundation of 119 for the opening stand with man of the series Shahriar Nafees. Nafees made a 56-ball 54 with the help of nine sixes before Cusack broke the opening stand. Just one ball later, Cusack removed one-down Aftab Ahmed for a two-ball duck to reduce the hosts to 119 for two in 19.3 overs. However, Tamim pairing with skipper Ashraful (22) added another 51 for the third wicket and put on 82 for the sixth wicket with Mahmudullah, who was just one run short of his maiden half-century. O'Brien removed Ashraful and Raqibul Hasan (2), while Dave Langford-Smith dismissed Shakib (7) triggering a mini collapse in the middle with Bangladesh slipping to 178 for 5 from 160 for three. But Mahmudullah quickfired 49 off 44 balls and Mashrafee blazed a 7-ball 16 to help Bangladesh take their total near the 300-mark as Bangladesh added 102 runs in the last 10 overs. Langford-Smith led the attack with three for 53 while Cusack and O'Brien chipped in with two wickets each for 30 and 58. b
