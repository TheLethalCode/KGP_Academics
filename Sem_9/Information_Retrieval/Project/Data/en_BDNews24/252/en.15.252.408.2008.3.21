<TITLE> Politicians fixated on overseas medical treatment: Yunus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)Politicians generally prefer medical treatment abroad despite the existence of in-country facilities for improved treatment, said Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus Friday. "Our top politicians seem fond of visiting foreign countries for medical consultations or treatment, although improved healthcare facilities exist in our country," Yunus said at an international cancer conference at Radisson Water Garden Hotel in Dhaka. "On the other hand, medical facilities for the multitudes seem inadequate, which the politicians should attend to," he said. The four-day conference, co-organised by the Oncology Club and the Federation of Anti-Cancer Activists of Bangladesh (FACAB), was inaugurated by health and family welfare adviser AMM Shawkat Ali. A number of research papers on cancer management and prevention, cancer treatment facilities and advancements were presented and discussed at the conference. Shawkat said: "NGOs and social organisations can contribute effectively through discharging their social responsibilities jointly or on their own." Addressing the doctors and health workers, Yunus said, "You must earn public trust in the quality of your services through serving them in a responsible manner." "Affordable medicare has to be provided for those who need it most." bdnew
