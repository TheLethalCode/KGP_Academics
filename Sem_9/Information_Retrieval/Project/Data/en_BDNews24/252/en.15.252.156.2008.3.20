<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Thursday the government would not further recruit fourth-class employees as part of efforts to reduce the size of its payroll. The government has already started recruiting data entry operators and system analysts instead, in a gradual move towards building an IT-equipped work environment, he said. However, the adviser said, no existing fourth-class employees would be retrenched. Mirza Aziz mentioned that a large part of the government salary bill is spent on the fourth-class employees. The issue was raised at the adviser's pre-budget discussion meeting with several editors of newspapers and electronic media at the finance ministry. bdn
