<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - A roundtable Saturday asked the government to cancel the proposed right to information act arguing that it might lead to possible harassment or invasion of privacy for non-government organisations. Researcher Syed Abul Maksud told the roundtable, organised by civil rights group Sushashoner Jonno Nagorik (Sujon), that immediate cancellation of the draft act must make way for preparation of a new one. "Such an act has to be prepared so that it protects people's rights as well as the state interest," he said at the roundtable on 'The proposed right to information ordinance and citizen's thought' at the National Press Club. Barrister Amir-ul Islam said whether the act would allow access to information or "harass people" needed to be considered. "It has to be thought how far this act would be applicable for common people and how far the hand of a 'third party' would reach." "We must reflect on whether the act is being drafted for providing access to information or for purposes of harassment." Barrister Amir-ul pointed out that according to the proposed ordinance NGOs must provide information asked for and if they do not do so they will be punished. "The right to information act should ensure citizen's right to get information from government authorities." "Instead government authorities will be able to harass citizens or non-government organisations, according to the draft act," said the lawyer. However, chairman of Transparency International Bangladesh Prof Muzaffer Ahmad countered that NGOs should be made to give necessary information. "NGOs work for the people. Sometimes they take indirect benefit from the government. So the people have the right to have information about them." Barrister Harun-or Rashid said not only NGOs but government organisations aslo should be required to give out information. "The government runs on public money. It is a citizen's fundamental right to know where and how that money is being spent." Syed Abul Maksud said: "Democracy cannot be established without a right to information act." "A high powered committee should have been constituted to prepare the draft of the law," he said, alleging that the draft was prepared by "junior officers" in the government. He proposed the formation of a high-powered committee comprising 10 to 11 persons, including government representatives, politicians, lawyers, journalists, business leaders and other professionals. Sujon secretary Badiul Alam Majumdar, Awami League leader Suranjit Sengputa, former ambassador Waliur Rahman, former diplomat Mohiuddin Ahmed, civil rights lawyer Hameeda Hossain, Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamol Dutta, journalists Muniruzzaman, Mizanur Rahman Khan and Muhammad Jahangir spoke. bdnews24
