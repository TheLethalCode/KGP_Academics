 ISLAMABAD, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Set to lead Pakistan's incoming coalition government, the party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto will nominate its candidate for the premiership by Sunday, a spokesman said. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) is led by Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, but he is ineligible for the premiership because he is not a member of the assembly, and more than a month after a parliamentary election Pakistanis remain unsure over who their next prime minister will be. There is speculation that the PPP will nominate a stop-gap prime minister, and Zardari will move into the slot later. But he will have to win a by-election first. "The last date for submitting nomination papers is Sunday, so naturally the name (of prime minister candidate) will be announced either on Sunday or Saturday," said Zardari's spokesman Farhatullah Babar. Bhutto's 19-year-old son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has returned to Pakistan and is expected to reveal the party's choice. The new prime minister would then be sworn into office on Tuesday. President Pervez Musharraf has few allies left in the assembly after their defeat in an election on Feb. 18. Musharraf, who came to power as a general in a coup in 1999, appears increasingly isolated, and there is intense speculation over how long the U.S. ally will be able to hold onto power. The incoming government has pledged to pass a resolution to reinstate Supreme Court judges who Musharraf replaced in November out of fear that they could rule unconstitutional his own re-election by the previous assembly. Musharraf has asked the National Assembly to reconvene on Monday to elect the PPP's choice. The election should be straightforward, after the overwhelming majority the assembly gave PPP candidate Fehmida Mirza when it voted on Wednesday to make her its first woman speaker. Makhdoom Amin Fahim, a senior aide to Bhutto and Zardari's deputy, had been favourite but his prospects dimmed after Sharif's party objected to his contacts with Musharraf. Other potential candidates include Yousaf Raza Gilani, Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar and Shah Mahmood Qureshi. They all hail from the central province of Punjab, whereas the PPP's stronghold is the southern province of Sindh. Gilani, PPP's vice chairman, spent at least four years in prison on charges of making illegal government appointments. Mukhtar defeated Musharraf's ally Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, chief of Pakistan Muslim League, in the election. While Qureshi is president of PPP in Punjab. The Feb. 18 election saw the PPP emerge with the most seats in the 342-member National Assembly but not enough to rule alone. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's party came second, dealing a crushing defeat to the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League. Sharif, the leader Musharraf deposed, and Zardari signed an agreement this month to form a coalition with a small regional party and a religious party. Like Zardari, Sharif did not stand in the electi
