 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)The foreign ministry Thursday issued a statement in veiled criticism of a "renewed perceptible tendency" by some foreign diplomats to interfere in Bangladesh's internal affairs. The ministry hoped that the envoys would maintain diplomatic norms in performing their professional work. "There has been a renewed perceptible tendency on the part of some foreign diplomats to make remarks in public that a section of the media has perceived to be interference in Bangladesh's internal affairs," the ministry said. "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is of the view that diplomatic norms and standards are well recognised internationally, and feels that it is expected that these should be conformed to by all practitioners of the profession in the international arena," it said. The statement said Bangladeshis had earned independence and sought to guard their sense of sovereignty with "zeal and pride". "The diplomatic agents concerned are urged to take note of this fact, and act in consonance with these sentiments," the statement said. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at a press briefing Thursday declined to comment on whether the ministry had issued the statement after US Charge d'Affaires Geeta Pasi's meetings with political parties ahead of year-end general elections. A few days ago, food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali criticised Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty for his comments on the delay in rice shipments from India. The adviser charged that Chakravarty's comment had gone "out of diplomatic norms", and wrote a letter to the foreign ministry, urging steps about the comments. Chakravarty said Bangladesh had been responsible for the delay in importing rice from India. bdn
