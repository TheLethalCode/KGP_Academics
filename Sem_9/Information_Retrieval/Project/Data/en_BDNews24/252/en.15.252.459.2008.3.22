 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club continued their winning streak in the Premier Division Cricket League when they handed a 45-run defeat to Surjo Torun Club in the sixth round encounter Saturday. Left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo took five wickets as newcomers Surjo Torun folded at 193 all out in 46.1 overs, chasing Mohammedan's 228 for nine in 50 overs at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground. Habibul Bashar (75) and Shamsur Rahman Shuvo (51) together put on 104 runs for the third wicket after Surjo Torun were reduced to 49 for three in 14.4 overs, but the dismissal of Shuvo triggered a mini collapse in the middle. Surjo Torun slipped to 168 for six from 153 for four before Bashar was the eighth batsman out, leaving the side at 191 for eight in 45 overs and Surjo Torun lost the last three batsmen in four runs to see 35 runs short of the target. Earlier, two fifties from Pakistani Aqeel Arshad (52) and Faisal Hossain Dickens (57) and a 43-run knock from opener Imrul Kayes helped the Motijheel-based outfit post a modest total. At Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium, newcomers BKSP handed a 45-run defeat to Sonargaon Cricketers as Raihan Asan (5/24) and Nasir Ahmed (3/31) shared eight wickets to wipe out the opponents innings. Sonargaon were bundled out for 180 in 48.5 overs in reply to BKSP's 225 all out in 49.3 overs. Put in to bat first, BKSP fell in trouble losing opener Latiful Azam (5) and one-down Saimon Ahmed (0), but opener Mohammad Mithun (51) and national discard Mushfiqur Rahim (59) rescued their side to take it to a safer position. Mahmudul Hasan hammered 41 off 66 balls and Raihan Anas hit 24 off 28 balls as country's lone sports educational institute went beyond 200-mark. At Narayanganj Osmani Stadium, Biman Bangladesh and City Club shared points after the match was tied. Chasing Biman's 250 for seven in 50 overs, City Club also ended up at 250 for seven in 50 overs riding on two fifties from Imran Ahmed (85) and Golam Mabud (51). Earlier, put in to bat first, Biman scored 250 for seven as national discards Nafis Iqbal (90) and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel (72) each smashed half-century. They together also put on 143 runs for the second wicket.
