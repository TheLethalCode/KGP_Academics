 BELGRADE, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's neighbours in Croatia, Hungary and Bulgaria dealt a blow to the Serb campaign to overturn Kosovo's month-old independence on Wednesday by announcing they would recognise the new republic. In a joint statement issued in Zagreb, Budapest and Sofia, they said the decision was based on "thorough consideration". They also underlined the importance of protecting the Serb minority in Kosovo's 90 percent ethnic Albanian republic. The Croatia mission in Belgrade, near the US embassy which was attacked and burned by Serb protesters last month, was closed for the day behind new steel shutters. Some Bulgarian families worried about security left Serbia, diplomatic sources said. Police protection at the embassies was at normal levels when the news was broadcast in Serbia. A Hungarian diplomatic source told Reuters there was concern in Budapest about potential attacks on the ethnic Hungarian minority of some 300,000 in the northern province of Vojvodina. "Unfortunately, it can happen (but) independent Kosovo is a reality and recognition cannot be avoided," he said. Serbia's pro-Western foreign minister Vuk Jeremic acknowledged the neighbours' decision "with sadness". "Countries that take this decision cannot have good ties with Serbia," he said in Greece, a traditional ally which has not recognised Kosovo. Canada announced recognition on Tuesday, reiterating the Western case that forcing its 2 million Albanians to rejoin Serbia after nine years under United Nations rule is not a viable option. Over 30 countries have now recognised Kosovo. Serbia's pro-Western President Boris Tadic said earlier this week that already fragile ties with Croatia would suffer. Serbs and Croats fought a war from 1991 to 1995 over the breakup of Yugoslavia. "We want to have the best possible relations with this country and to see it in the EU as soon as possible," Tadic said. "But recognition of Kosovo is certainly not an act of goodwill between neighbours." SECURITY In the Serb half of Kosovo's northern flashpoint town Mitrovica, United Nations police returned to a police station which they were forced to abandon on Monday in the worst riots yet over Kosovo's independence. NATO says the violence was orchestrated by the hardline faction in the Serbian government. The Belgrade daily Blic on Wednesday cited sources as saying hardliner Slobodan Samardzic, the minister for Kosovo, had advocated keeping tensions high. Diplomats say Samardzic had proposed what amounted to the partition of Kosovo at the weekend but the territory's U.N. administration turned down the idea of allowing Serbia to govern Kosovo's scattered Serb enclaves. Diplomats said the triple recognition by the three neighbours would be a wake-up call to Serbia that European recognition of an independent Kosovo was not going away. Belgrade has said it expected it to. Kosovo's deputy prime minister, Hajredin Kuci, told Reuters it was good news for Kosovo "because we need to have good bilateral relations with them". "But at the same time it's very good for the Serbian perception and the people of Serbia that everybody who is in the neighbourhood is recognising the new reality and they are for regional cooperation and EU integration," Kuci added. Serbian neighbours Romania, Bosnia and Macedonia have not yet recognised Kosovo. And Russia, which is Serbia's main ally in its struggle against the secession, shows no sign of softening its stance. Diplomatic sources said Serbia was likely to withdraw its ambassadors temporarily from the latest capitals to recognise Kosovo. But further retaliation was not expected. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica assured members of the Foreign Investor Council that business would not suffer. "Further developing economic relations with states with which Serbia has political problems is the message we wanted to hear and the one we've got," a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters. "We've got guarantees for the stability and safety for our future business activities." Bulgaria and Hungary, both EU members, urged "the earliest possible signing" of a so-called Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the European Union, which would be the first step on the road to ultimate membership of the bl
