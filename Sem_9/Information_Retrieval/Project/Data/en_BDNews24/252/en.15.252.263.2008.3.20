 LONDON, March 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair could return to international cricket in England's three-test series against New Zealand starting at Lord's on May 15. International Cricket Council (ICC) general manager Dave Richardson told Reuters on Thursday the world governing body would soon be making its appointments for series starting after April 1. "England and New Zealand are both teams who seem to be happy with him," Richardson said in a telephone interview from the ICC's Dubai headquarters. "There wouldn't be anything standing in the way of appointing him to that series." Hair, 55, was dropped from the ICC's elite umpires' panel for his role in the 2006 Oval test between England and Pakistan. Pakistan became the first team to forfeit a test when they refused to return to the field after tea on the fourth day of the fourth test because they had been penalised five runs for alleged ball tampering. On Tuesday, the ICC announced Hair had been reappointed to the panel after undergoing a rehabilitation course which included a university course in Sydney. The decision has outraged Pakistan authorities who made it clear after The Oval test that they had lost confidence in Hair. "I just hope the ICC realises the potentially explosive situation it could create by posting Hair for any matches involving Pakistan," Shaharyar Khan, head of the Pakistan Cricket Board at the time of The Oval test, told Reuters in Karachi. PRAGMATIC APPROACH Richardson said the ICC would take Pakistan's reaction into account when appointing Hair to international matches. "We have always followed a pretty pragmatic approach, cricket being what it is with teams getting a bee in their bonnet about a particular umpire," he said. "It's not the first time that's happened. We try to make the appointments which we think will be best for that series. I think we should continue to do that. "I think it is sensible to take the pragmatic approach and to give him an opportunity against teams where the pressure won't be as high." Richardson said the ICC had initially lost confidence in Hair "because of a perceived lack of skill in communication with players". "His manner might have shown he was arrogant and insensitive. Once you realise that you can take steps to make sure that you don't give that perception," he said. "The rehabilitation course he went on was designed to improve communication. He's gone through that and by all accounts has completed the course successfully
