 Taipei, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan voters cast their ballots on Saturday to elect a president who could usher in a new era in relations with political rival China in one of the hottest potential flashpoints in Asia. The polls closed at 0800 GMT and a result was expected within a few hours. The Central Election Commission estimated a turnout of about 75 percent. Taiwan's more than 17 million voters had to choose a successor to President Chen Shui-bian, an anti-China firebrand who steps down in May and who has repeatedly angered Beijing with his pro-independence rhetoric. China has claimed self-ruled Taiwan as its territory since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has pledged to bring it under its rule, by force if necessary. Frank Hsieh's ruling Democratic Progressive Party favours formal independence while Ma Ying-jeou's Nationalist Party (KMT) wants eventual reunification once China embraces democracy. "Whether you vote for Hsieh or for Ma, be sure to vote for Taiwan," Chen told reporters. "...Don't let Taiwan become the next Hong Kong. Don't let Taiwan become the next Tibet." The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Chinese troops marched into Tibet, the scene of anti-Chinese rioting last week, in 1950. Ma told reporters after voting his commitment to Taiwan was not in doubt. "I have always said that if I get elected I will engage with mainland China on many issues, that I will protect Taiwan, not just its identity but its security, to my fullest strength," he said in fluent English. "I have said also many times that Taiwan is not Tibet. Neither is it Hong Kong. So we will keep this democratic country running as it is." The election has drawn keen international attention, with the United States, Russia and Britain criticising a referendum on U.N. membership, to be held alongside the vote, which they believe could upset the delicate balance with China. Malaysia added its voice of opposition on Saturday, with its Foreign Ministry saying the referendum as "a provocative move". Whatever the referendum result, U.N. membership is out of the question with just 23 countries recognising Taiwan, and with China a veto-wielding permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, recognising "one China", but remains the island's biggest ally. Two U.S. aircraft carriers are in the region for training exercises. China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait in 1996, trying to intimidate voters during an election. "China hopes the United States and Japan will carry out their promises of not supporting 'Taiwan independence' or Taiwan authority's proposed 'referendum on U.N. membership'," Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said. In Taiwan, a faltering economy is a priority with voters. "Domestic issues, such as the economy and corruption, are bigger than China or foreign policy," said Ralph Cossa, president of the U.S.-based think tank Pacific Forum CSIS. The two candidates have toughened their stances on China following Beijing's crackdown in Tibet, but to help the economy, both advocate more direct flights, tourism and investment opportunities between Taiwan and China. Ma advocates a common market with China. Yet voters are smarter, more practical and more fatigued than ever by politicking, analysts say. "For me, the key topic is economic improvement," said Taiwan voter Mei Yi-ying, 60. "Most of us at our age want to work."
