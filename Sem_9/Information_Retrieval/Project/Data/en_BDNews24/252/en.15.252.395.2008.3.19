 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Smiths Group posted a 7 percent rise in first-half sales and profit on Wednesday, slightly ahead of analysts' expectations, sending shares in the engineering group up as much as 5.6 percent. Smiths, which makes a range of equipment from medical devices to bomb-detecting X-ray equipment for airports, has no plans to sell any divisions, its CEO said, following persistent speculation by analysts and in the media. New Chief Executive Philip Bowman said Smiths will focus on growing margins over the next two years. Operating profit for the group rose 7 percent to 158 million pounds on sales up 7 percent to 1.09 billion in the six months to Feb. 2. By 1013 GMT Smiths shares were up 0.7 percent at 953-1/2 pence. One trader said the strong early rise reflected relief that the company had not issued a profit warning. Citigroup noted disappointment over weak cashflow and a flat dividend. Citigroup had expected a 15 percent increase in the dividend. But it said in a "buy" note that first half earnings per share of 30.8p were 7 percent above its forecasts. Analysts were also concerned about higher than expected levels of debt. Net debt came in at 675 million pounds ($1.36 billion), around 25 million pounds more than Smiths had guided, broker UBS said in a "buy" note. The interim dividend has been kept flat to save money to fund more bolt-on acquisitions for its booming petrochemical sector parts supplier John Crane and electronic equipment supplier Smiths Interconnect, Bowman said. Smiths announced two small acquisitions of companies which supply equipment to the petrochemical sector on Wednesday. It bought Dutch petrochemical filter maker Indufil, which had sales of 26 million pounds in 2007, and U.S.-based Fiberod, a specialist in oil and gas lifting equipment, which had sales of 12 million pounds in 2007. MEDICAL WORRIES Strong demand for airport and border screening devices continues to offset problems in its medical devices division, where sales will grow less than expected this financial year. CEO Bowman, who was appointed in December, said it will be harder than expected to turnaround Smith's medical division, which contributes around one third of group profit. "The complexity of the supply chain (in the medical division) was underestimated," he told a conference call. "The major problem is meeting customer orders on a timely basis." The division will not hit targeted sales growth of 5 percent in the financial year 2007/08, having reported flat sales in the first half to Feb. 2, the CEO said. The medical division has had particular problems meeting orders of critical care products for UK customers, Bowman said. That is partly because the division's data and information systems are not up to scratch, he sa
