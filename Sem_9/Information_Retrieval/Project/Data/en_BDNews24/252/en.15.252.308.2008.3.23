<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - Former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia would not be able to seek pardon from the proposed Truth Commission, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed told David Frost in a recent television interview. Some restrictions on political activities under the state of emergency would be relaxed before general elections scheduled by December, Fakhruddin said in the interview aired Saturday on Al Jazeera Television. "We have not yet fixed the time. We will be looking at all options when and how the state of emergency will be lifted," Fakhruddin told Frost. On the political fate of Khaleda and Hasina, the chief adviser said the government would accept the court verdict. Asked if people would be forgiven if they come before the proposed Truth Commission and admit their crimes, the adviser said: "That is the idea that they will be forgiven." "But as part of this process, there may be some kind of a restriction on their participation in politics for a limited time." In addition, those who would admit to irregular or corrupt practices within certain limits would be forgiven, the chief adviser said. Frost asked Fakhruddin if the two detained former prime ministers would be able to go through that process as well and be forgiven. Fakhruddin said for those being arraigned or charge-sheeted, the judicial process once initiated would have to be seen through, "and those (people) will not be eligible to really come before such a commission." When Frost asked again more directly if the two leaders would not be eligible for forgiveness because they have already been arraigned, the chief adviser said: "It's not just them." Anyone who has crossed "that sort of threshold" would not be eligible, Fakhruddin said. "That's the thinking now, but it's not yet finalised." On the structure of the proposed Truth Commission, the chief adviser said the caretaker government had looked at similar models in different countries. On the political fate of Khaleda and Hasina, he said it would depend on several factors: "At this point in time they have been arrested and are facing trial in courts. So, the judicial process will go on." "Whatever the decision is from the judicial process we will accept the judicial process." Asked whether the elections will be held by December this year, Fakhruddin said: "Absolutely, that is the deadline. I have said this more than once and the elections will be held by December 2008." The chief adviser said the state of emergency was declared to improve law and order and bring the country back to normalcy. He added that the state of emergency is not being enforced in a strict sense in many areas, citing "press freedom" as an example. He said the Election Commission has announced an election roadmap. "I am absolutely committed and confident that the elections will be held according to the roadmap." Asked whether the number of detained people in Bangladesh has crossed 250,000, as published in some British media, the chief advsier replied the number was much lower at around 75,000 to 80,000. Of them, only a handful of people have been detained under the Special Powers Act, Fakhruddin said. He dismissed the idea when asked by Frost if he might float a political party. The chief adviser said his first duty was to hold free, fair and credible elections and carry out institutional reforms to ensure sustainable democracy in Bangladesh. The interview took place on March 17 during Fakhruddin's recent trip to the UK. bdnews24
