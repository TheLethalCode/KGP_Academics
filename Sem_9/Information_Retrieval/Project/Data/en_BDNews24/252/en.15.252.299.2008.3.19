<TITLE> Hair unlikely to officiate any Pakistan matches says ICC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Darrell Hair is unlikely to officiate at matches involving Pakistan despite being restored as a test and one-day international umpire, an International Cricket Council (ICC) official said on Wednesday. The ICC announced on Tuesday that Hair had been restored to their elite panel but general manager Dave Richardson said the world governing body would act to prevent Hair from standing in matches involving Pakistan. "We would have to take a sensible approach," Richardson told the BBC on Wednesday. "We will probably keep him away from Pakistan matches where we can." Australian Hair, 55, was sacked from the ICC's elite panel of umpires in November 2006 for his role at the Oval in August that year when Pakistan became the first team to forfeit a test. Pakistan refused to return to the field in protest after being penalised for alleged ball-tampering and England being awarded five extra runs. Richardson hinted, however, that Hair would not be barred from officiating in all matches involving Asian teams. ELITE PANEL "It's pointless having an umpire on the elite panel who is excluded from umpiring certain teams," he added. "There are always going to be stages in an umpire's career when he is not flavour of the month but he will come up against an Asian team at some stage. "Darrell Hair, over time, seems to polarise opinion but a lot of his supporters will feel it's justified to bring him back and that he was unjustly kept on the sidelines in the first place." Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq was quoted by the BBC saying he was shocked by Hair's reinstatement. "What more proof did they require that Hair was not fit to stand in international matches?" he said. ICC president-elect David Morgan told reporters on Tuesday the council's decision to reinstate Hair was unanimous. "Darrell Hair is a good, competent umpire and his position will be reviewed after March 31, 2009 as is the case with other umpires at the end of their contracts. It was a unanimous decision (to reinstate him)." The move came after Hair underwent a rehabilitation programme devised by the ICC and umpired less important fixtures
