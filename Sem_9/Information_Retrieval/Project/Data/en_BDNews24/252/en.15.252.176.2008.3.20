 NEW YORK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Citigroup Inc, the largest U.S. bank, plans further job cuts in its securities operations in a bid to cut costs after subprime mortgage and credit problems led to a record quarterly loss. Any job losses would be on top of 4,200 cuts companywide announced in January by Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, and 17,000 announced last April by predecessor Charles Prince. Citigroup has said it ended 2007 with 375,000 employees.

The bank declined to confirm the report. Published reports have said Citigroup might cut tens of thousands of jobs. Pandit has been reviewing the bank's businesses worldwide to explore ways to boost profitability and efficiency. In the fourth quarter, New York-based Citigroup suffered a $9.83 billion loss, hurt by $18.1 billion of write-downs largely tied to subprime mortgages and related securities. Speaking on a January 15 conference call discussing results, Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden called the 4,200 job cuts a "first installment" in what would likely be "a continual stream of efforts that we are making to reduce headcounts in nonproductive areas" and invest in stronger businesses. Citigroup shares closed Wednesday at $20.41 on the New York Stock Exchange. They closed one year ago at $5
