 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)About 1,500 people, including Liberation War sector commanders, Friday ratcheted up calls for the trial of 'war criminals' from a national convention in Dhaka. The Sector Commanders Forum that organised the convention at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre vowed to continue its campaign to pile pressure on the government to start the trial of war criminals. The demand was voiced by SCF chairman retired Air Vice Marshal AK Khandker at the outset of the convention. "People of Bangladesh must hold the trial of the war criminals as soon as possible, because we'll not call off this movement till the trials are held on this independent Bangladesh's soil," he said. The convention kicked off at 9:30 am with the participation of about 1,500 delegates including the Liberation War sector commanders, freedom fighters from home and abroad, intellectuals, teachers, students, civil society representatives and professionals. At the outset, the delegates observed a minute's silence in remembrance of the martyred freedom fighters, which was followed by rendition of the national anthem. Then excerpts from the holy Quran, the Geeta, the Bible and the Tripitaka were read out. On the main dais were seated Justice Habibur Rahman, former chief adviser of caretaker government, professor Anisuzzaman, professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury, SCF chairperson AK Khandker, sector commander retired Maj Gen KM Shafiullah, retired Lt Gen Mir Shawkat Ali and retired Maj Gen CR Dutta. The politicians present on the occasion included Tofail Ahmed of Awami League, Suranjit Sengupta, Rashed Khan Menon of Workers Party, Dilip Barua from Samyabadi Dal, Hasanul Haque Inu of JSD and other eminent personalities such as Birsreshthho Motiur Rahman's wife Mili Rahman. On the occasion, police security has been stepped up and the whole area wears festive looks as national flags and colourful banners and festoons adorn all its facades and corners. In his opening speech, Khandker said, "No government has so far taken any punitive steps against the war criminals. As they remained unpunished, offenders from subsequent generations tended to be compulsively delinquents, defying all social and legal barriers." He said: "The war criminals' trials should be held as soon as possible to ensure justice and holding free and fair national polls. The nation today seems united on barring the war criminals from all elections." Urging all to join hands in the streets voicing demands of holding the war criminals' trials, Khandker said: "We must succeed in doing what we now profess to accomplish so many years after the war." Former army chief Lt Gen (retired) Harun-Ur-Rashid said: "Nations all around us are at this moment trying war criminals in at least 31 places all over the world. We must be able to accomplish it too, or all our anti-graft work and words will seem futile and hollow." bdnews
