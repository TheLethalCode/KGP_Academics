 GLOUCESTER, England, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Flood waters in parts of England were near 60-year highs on Monday, leaving tens of thousands of people without water and electricity where rivers have broken their banks. The Environment Agency issued nine severe flood warnings with large parts of Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire under water after torrential rainfall and river levels in some areas still rising. "I'm afraid to say that I don't think we have seen the peak yet," said the agency's John Harman. "All this water that we have seen ... is now into the river system," he told BBC radio. "Even though the rain has eased off a bit... it's the water in the rivers now that constitutes a threat." The Severn is more than five metres above its normal summer height, swollen by some 5.6 inches of rain over the weekend. The downpours are also threatening Oxfordshire, where 5 inches fell on Friday, the largest daily rainfall since records began for the area in 1968. Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Gloucestershire on Monday and promised more money to help with drainage and flood defences. "What we saw here was a month's rainfall in some places in an hour, something that was quite unprecedented, and put enormous pressure on water and the emergency services," he told reporters. With more wet weather on the way, tens of thousands of people in Gloucestershire were struggling without water and electricity. Bottled water was being handed out by Severn Trent after its pumps at Mythe Water Treatment Works in Tewkesbury, which serves Gloucester and Cheltenham, became engulfed in flood water. About 70,000 properties are without running water, and as many as 140,000 may be affected, said a spokesman. It could be days before pumps are working again, he told the BBC. People living in Cheltenham were being urged to use water sparingly, with only about 20 hours of supply left. About 40,000 homes in the area are without electricity after a sub-station in nearby Castle Meads had to be shut following a surge in the water level early Monday. More than 1,000 people had to spend a second night in emergency shelters after being evacuated from their homes. There have however been no deaths reported from the region. The Environment Agency issued nine severe flood warnings on Monday. It has been criticised for its speed of response to the floods, but Environment Secretary Hilary Benn praised its work. He denied that spending on capital investment in flood defences had been diverted away from the agency's budget, saying it had increased from 300 million pounds to 600 million pounds during the past 10 years. He told the BBC that at least 90 percent of flood defences were in fair or better condition. "They are designed to work to a certain level but if the water level gets above that then they are themselves going to be over-topped," he sa
