<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka has called on Jakarta to increase Bangladeshi imports to reduce the staggering trade gap that favours Indonesia, the Economic Relations Division said in a statement Wednesday. The request came at the conclusion of the first meeting of the Joint Economic Commission of the two countries held in Dhaka on July 23-25. Bangladesh imported goods worth $286 million in 2005-06 from Indonesia while exports to that country were only $21 million, according to government figures. Among the items Bangladesh has asked Indonesia to import in greater quantities are pharmaceuticals, food products, ceramics, saris, knitwear, leather and leather goods, jute products, bicycles and accumulator batteries, the ERD said. Bangladesh has also sought Indonesian potential investment in local industries including jute, garments and ceramics. Although the Joint Economic Commission was established in 2004, this was the first official meeting of the commission. The next meeting will be in 2008 in Jakarta. bdn
