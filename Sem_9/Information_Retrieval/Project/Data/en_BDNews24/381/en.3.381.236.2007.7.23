 LONDON, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA is considering whether or not to get involved in a dispute over the proposed transfer of Carlos Tevez from West Ham United to Manchester United. FIFA met with English FA and Premier League officials on Monday in Zurich to discuss the Tevez affair and whether soccer's ruling body has the authority to settle the matter. "At the end of the meeting, the decision was left with FIFA as to whether they would take on this case themselves or, if not, what the right process would be to resolve it," an FA spokesman said. "We are hoping to hear the decision very soon." The Argentine striker's move has stalled over the question of who should be paid the transfer fee, estimated by the British media at up to 30 million pounds ($61.73 million). West Ham own Tevez's playing registration but his agent Kia Joorabchian says he retains the striker's economic rights and therefore is entitled to any transfer fee. The Premier League have insisted that any deal for Tevez should be between the clubs. West Ham were fined 5.5 million pounds ($11.28 million) in April for breaking Premier League rules which outlaw third-party ownership when they signed Tevez last August. They were allowed to continue playing him after satisfying the Premier League that the third-party agreement with Joorabchian had been torn up. His goals in the closing weeks of the season helped West Ham win their fight against relegation. Though Tevez is keen to move to Old Trafford, West Ham refused permission for him to undergo a medical at United last week. Third-party ownership of football players is common in South America but was almost unheard of in England until Tevez and fellow Argentine Javier Mascherano joined West Ham. Mascherano has since moved to Liverpool. Tevez's contract has also led to a separate controversy involving relegated Sheffield United, who wanted West Ham deducted points over the Tevez affair instead of being only fined in April. The Blades took their appeal to an arbitration panel, which upheld the decision to fine the London club
