 GAZA, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Hamas gunmen in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, Palestinian medics said. They said the bodies of the two men were brought to hospital after they were shot near the site of a former Jewish settlement in Gaza. An Israeli military spokesman said soldiers had opened fire at two armed men as they approached a border fence with Israel. The troops found later both men carried grenades in addition to their guns, the spokesman said. Israeli soldiers often shoot at Palestinians who approach the border with Gaza to try to prevent armed infiltrations, and also periodically launch raids in that area to prevent rockets from being launched at Israeli towns. Hamas, an Islamist group, has controlled the coastal Strip since routing forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement during factional fighting last month.
