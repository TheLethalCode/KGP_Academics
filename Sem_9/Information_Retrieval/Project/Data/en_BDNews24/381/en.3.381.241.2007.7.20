<TEXT>
 Chittagong, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  Lieutenant General Masud Uddin Chowdhury Friday said no-one with corruption ties would be able to escape punishment, with or without their support for reforms. The coordinator of the national coordination committee on serious crimes made the fresh vow in his briefing to reporters after he joined a reunion of the Chittagong Police Institution alumni in the port city. "Anybody linked to corruption will be brought to justice, no matter they support reforms," Masud said. Asked why so-called reformists with graft links were not sued or arrested yet, Masud said a lack of workforce and structural limitations were the key reason. "Those who had abused power will be tried." On the progress of the ongoing anticorruption drive, he said: "The drive seems slow, but the progress is satisfactory. People will see its results in future." Masud ruled out the allegation that the anticorruption drive was part of a process to put the much-talked-about "minus 2 formula" in place. "Those who were arrested or sued were accused of having ties to corruption." "As far as I know, the government didn't harass anybody for political reasons. Everything was done based on allegations," he added. Masud said: "Listing people with corruption ties is a continuous process. We've received many allegations. New names will be added to the list once we are confirmed about the complaints." On Awami League's announcement that the party will not start a reform process before Sheikh Hasina is released, Masud said: "It's up to the Awami League." At the reunion, Masud, a former student of the institution, said: "We have to teach our children to hate corruption for the benefit of the nation. We have to wage a social movement against graft." bdnews
