 DAMASCUS, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A large meeting of Iraqi rebel groups that was due to be held in Damascus on Monday was cancelled at the behest of Syria, delegates said. Hundreds of delegates, including members of the banned Iraqi Baath Party, officers in Saddam Hussein's now defunct security forces and anti-US tribal leaders, had gathered in Damascus to work out a joint programme for groups opposed to the continued presence of US forces in Iraq. "The Syrians gently made it clear that this is not the time for this," a senior Baath Party member told Reuters.

Thousands of Iraqi Baathists and former security figures have made Syria their base since the 2003 US invasion. The Iraqi government says they play a major role in supporting the insurgency. Washington accuses Syria of letting fighters cross its borders into Iraq, a charge Syria denies. Damascus says its influence with rebel forces in Iraq could help the United States achieve an "honourable withdrawal" for American troops. "We should not see a contradiction between raising the gun and negotiating an end to the occupation," a tribal leader from Iraq's western Anbar province addressed the delegates. He acknowledged, however, that the rebel groups lack a unified political fro
