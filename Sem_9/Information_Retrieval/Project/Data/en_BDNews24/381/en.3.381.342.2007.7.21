 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University teachers Saturday staged demonstrations by wearing black badges to classes to protest the arrest of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and alleged harassment of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. The Teachers' Lounge at the Arts Building in the morning had almost all teachers sporting black badges in a symbolic protest against the arrest and alleged harassment. Saturday's protest came after special branch officers Friday interrogated some Dhaka University teachers on their planned move to protest Sheikh Hasina's arrest. Teachers of all political hues grouped in White Panel, Blue Panel and Pink Panel wore black badges. However, some teachers took classes without wearing black badges. Member of DUTA Prof Harun-or Rashid told bdnews24.com all the teachers have spontaneously worn black badges. Security forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in an extortion case, and a Dhaka court sent her to jail rejecting a bail prayer. The teachers under Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA), an outfit of teachers with diverse political leanings, are demanding immediate freedom for former prime minister Hasina. The DUTA Thursday called a meeting and rolled out a five-point charter of demands and proposals. They decided not to join work for half of the day Sunday as part of a two-day programme. In a statement issued Thursday, the DU teachers demanded removal of law adviser Mainul Hosein from the caretaker government for making biased comments in the wake of the arrest of Hasina. The demand for removal of the adviser makes the first call on the government to get him out of the job since it took office in January. In the statement, the association protested an alleged move by the caretaker government to take former prime ministers Hasina and Khaleda "out of the political scene". About Friday's questioning by the police, DUTA secretary Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com, "Some officers of the Special Branch of Police asked me on our programme." "It was not interrogation as such. It was just a discussion," he added. While the DUTA secretary and two other teachers admitted the police inquiry, DUTA president Professor Sadrul Amin told bdnews24.com that he was not aware of it. Professor AK Azad Chowdhury was among the teachers who were questioned. The former vice chancellor with close ties to the Awami League told bdnews24.com some police officers came to his university flat on the campus and asked him about DUTA move. Professor Harun-or-Rashid was the second to be interrogated. "They (officers) asked me if we could reverse the decision. They wanted to know if we had decided on the move in discussion with all teachers," he told bdnews24.com. "They also asked me how we look at the state of emergency," he said. bdnews24
