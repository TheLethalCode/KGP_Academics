 MADRID, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Valencia have signed Spain centre-back Ivan Helguera from Primera Liga rivals Real Madrid, the two clubs confirmed on Friday. The 32-year-old negotiated a release from his contract with the Spanish champions, which still had a year left to run, and signed a three-year deal with Valencia. Helguera, who has been capped 47 times for Spain, won three league titles and two European Cups after joining Real from Espanyol in 1999. He was overlooked at the start of last season by coach Fabio Capello, who reversed his decision to bring him back in from the cold to give him 21 starts during their victorious league campaign. But the arrivals of Bernd Schuster as replacement for Capello, and two new centre-backs in the shape of Christoph Metzelder and Pepe in the close season, left Helguera surplus to requirements. Valencia will be glad to pick up an experienced defender after losing Argentine stalwart Roberto Ayala to Real Zaragoza
