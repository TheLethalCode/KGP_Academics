<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina's daughter-in-law Christine Overmire may come to Bangladesh to fight a legal battle in court for her. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told bdnews24.com by phone that they were thinking about the matter but could not make a final decision. "There are different legal sides to the matter and we are evaluating them all," he said. Overmire works as lawyer in the US. The Awami League seeks ways to fight a legal battle to free Hasina, who was arrested at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in an extortion case. In a press briefing Monday, acting AL president Zillur Rahman said Hasina's lawyers would decide if they would be able to appeal for bail or to quash the charges against her. bdnews
