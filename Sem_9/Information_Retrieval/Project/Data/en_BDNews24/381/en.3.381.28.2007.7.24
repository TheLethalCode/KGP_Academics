 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana Tuesday came down hard on the emergency government for implicating her in an extortion case. She told bdnews24.com by phone from the US: "The caretaker government is not abiding by the law and running affairs following an adage that 'might is right'." In a sharp reaction to the extortion case that was originally filed against Hasina and cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Rehana said: "Nothing can be worse than this. It's an ill-motivated case." "People of Bangladesh will gradually come to understand everything. They can't be fooled for long. I'm sure. "Why should Bangabandhu's daughters resort to extortion anyway if they need money? Look at me, I'm doing a job and my children are all educated and they believe in plain living. Rehana alleged that the case was crafted just to make the Bangabandhu family look small. Azam J Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited, filed the extortion case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station. The case statement named former Awami League minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, cousin of Hasina and Rehana, as the chief accused. Rehana was not initially named in the statement of the case, but the investigating officer dragged her into the chargesheet later. bdnews
