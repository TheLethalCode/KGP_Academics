 NEW DELHI, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A moderate quake occurred in northern India on Monday, with mild tremors felt in the capital New Delhi, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. The 4.9 magnitude quake was recorded at 4:32 a.m. (2302 GMT), with the epicenter near Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand state, 280 km (175 miles) northeast of New Delhi, said the USGS. Local television stations said although tremors had been felt in the capital and other centers such as Meerut and holy town of Haridwar, there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The last major quake in the Himalayan region occurred in October 1991, when a 6.1 magnitude tremor killed around 1,600 people and injured at least 2,000 more.
