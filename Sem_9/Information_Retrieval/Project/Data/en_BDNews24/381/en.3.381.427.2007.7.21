 KABUL, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban movement said on Saturday it had killed the second German hostage after the group's demands were ignored, a spokesman for the militant group said. "The Mujahideen also shot dead the second hostage," Qari Mohammad Yousuf told Reuters by phone from an unknown location. He said the Taliban had yet to decide about the bodies of the pair who the group killed at two different times on Saturday following the expiration of two separate deadlines. The couple were shot dead in Ghazni province which lies to the southwest of the capital, Kabul. The German Foreign Ministry said it had received no independent confirmation that any of the hostages in Afghanistan had been killed by the Taliban. "We are taking these statements very seriously," German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said in a statement. "So far we have no independent confirmation that a hostage was murdered in Afghanistan." He said Berlin was in constant contact with the Afghan government. The two unidentified Germans along with six Afghan colleagues were kidnapped at gun point while travelling in a vehicle on Wednesday in Wardak province which also lies to the southwest of Kabul. German media said the two men were engineers being escorted by their Afghan colleagues when they were taken away. The Taliban demands were withdrawal of German troops serving under NATO in Afghanistan and the release of all Taliban prisoners held by Kabul Before the executions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a newspaper interview published on Saturday said there was no question of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. "We can't give up our efforts now," she was quoted as saying in an interview with Passauer Neue Presse newspaper. "The Afghan people can't be abandoned." A German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman earlier said that Berlin had received no clear evidence that the two Germans were in the hands of the Taliban. At the beginning of July a German was taken hostage and then freed after a week. In October 2006 two German journalists were murdered in the relatively stable northern part of the country where there are over 3,000 German troops stationed as part of a NATO peacekeeping force. The Afghan government said it was not aware of the reported executions of the German hostages.
