 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Wednesday shifted the hearing of the extortion case against Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina to Aug 16 from Aug 15. Metropolitan magistrate Shamsul Alam changed the date in an apparently spontaneous move. Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana resented the fixing of the date as it coincided with the death anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was killed along with most of his family when a handful of army officers staged a coup in 1975. In her reaction, Rehana told reporters in Dhaka by phone from the US: "The case was filed to make the Bangabandhu family feel small." The police pressed charges against Hasina, Rehana and cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim Tuesday in a Tk 3 crore extortion case, filed by Azam J Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited. Security forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in the extortion case. The police implicated Rehana in the case later when a chargesheet was submitted to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. bdnews24.com
