<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina asked people to unite against injustice, a lawyer quoted her as saying Sunday. "People must not lose morale," Hasina was quoted as saying by advocate Sahara Khatun who had visited Hasina in the special jail in the Jatiya Sangsad premises. Sahara said Hasina had reiterated her fear that she might not get justice during the interim government's rule. Hasina's concern was first spelled out, when her lawyer Abdul Matin Khasru met her in jail Friday, the first visit to the former prime minister after she was arrested on July 16. Barrister Fazle Nur Tapash had earlier visited Hasina and spent about 45 minutes from 3.45pm with her Sunday. Sahara said nine cases were filed against Hasina during the rule of the past BNP-led government. Chargesheets were submitted in four cases that are now on trial in the High Court. But she was arrested in the extortion case before submission of a chargesheet, Sahara said. The lawyers said security officials seized a car, a laptop and chequebooks from Hasina's home hours after her arrest on July 16. Barrister Fazle Nur vowed a legal fight against the activities of the government. bdnew
