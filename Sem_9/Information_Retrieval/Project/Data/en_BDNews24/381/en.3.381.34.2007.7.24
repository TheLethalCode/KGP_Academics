 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Tuesday invited Indonesia to invest in potential areas to boost economic ties between the two Muslim-majority nations, officials said. The call came from a meeting of the Joint Economic Commission, Rownak Jahan, deputy secretary of the Economic Relations Division, told bdnews24.com. "We've sought Indonesian investment in sectors such as jute, jute goods, ceramics, garments and embroidery," she said. The matter of choosing potential areas in which the two countries can jointly work for mutual benefit also came up in the discussion, she said. Both the countries need to boost their economic cooperation since the trade volume between them is small. The countries recorded only Tk 509 crore in two-way trade in fiscal 2005-06, according to commerce ministry statistics. ERD secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan led the home-side while Primo Alui Joelianto, director general for Asia-Pacific and African Affairs in Indonesia's foreign ministry, headed the visitors. The first formal meeting between Dhaka and Jakarta held on July 23-25 although the commission was launched in 2004, the officials said. They said both sides had felt the need of a stronger partnership in the private sector to fortify bilateral economic cooperation. The ERD holds a news briefing Wednesday to formally unveil details of the meeting outcome. bdnew
