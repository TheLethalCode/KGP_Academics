 Sydney, July 22, (bdnews24.com) -- The fourth International AIDS Society (IAS) conference started in Sydney Sunday, with important new scientific advances as the main talking point. Organisers have called for greater worldwide anti-HIV awareness to ensure better prevention and treatment as well as an expansion of research projects to fight the global health risk. The conference has become the biggest debating chamber in the world for Aids-related problems, with more than 7,000 people from 133 countries taking part in it. Medical researchers, government representatives, health activists, community leaders as well as people living with the deadly virus are all contributing to the event, held at the Sydney Convention Centre. "Fewer than one-third of people living with HIV in low or middle-income countries have access to lifesaving medication and still fewer have access to proven prevention techniques, such as condoms and sterile syringes. The goal of universal access to health care by 2010 must remain a priority," said IAS president Dr Pedro Cahn at the opening session of the three-day conference. "Science has given us the tools to prevent and treat HIV effectively. The fact that we have not yet translated this science into practice is a shameful failure. Good research drives good policy and programming." The IAS and the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine have recently issued the Sydney Declaration, a statement that urges governments and donors to allocate at least 10 percent of HIV funding to research programmes. The conference stressed that new research investment cannot come at the expense of prevention and treatment programmes and that such investment must not be seen as an additional burden but rather as a critical way of determining what works best and why. "It is our responsibility as researchers, as the drivers of the research locomotive that carry HIV treatments forward, to ensure that clinical and prevention research as well as capacity building and basic science continue to thrive in the most affected countries," said Professor David Cooper, the IAS co-chair. Everyday approximately 11,000 new cases of HIV occur globally every year with around three millions deaths occurring annually. According to the UNAIDS report for 2006 an estimated 39.5 million people live with HIV/Aids worldwide, 37.2 million of them are men, 17.7 million women and 2.3 million children. Some important new scientific findings are being discussed at the conference including the development of new medication for those who have developed a resistance to existing drugs. New biomedical prevention strategies such as the use of innovative antiretroviral drugs are being developed in several countries. IAS 2007 is hosted by the International AIDS Society in partnership with the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine. The conference also incorporates the 19th Annual ASHM Conference. bd
