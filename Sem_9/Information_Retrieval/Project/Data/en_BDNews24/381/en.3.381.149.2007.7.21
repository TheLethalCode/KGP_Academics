 Dhaka, July 20(bdnews24.com)  The government has dropped 89 newspapers from the media list and cancelled publication of more than 30 others, according to the Department of Film and Publications (DFP). Information adviser Moinul Hossain told bdnews24.com, "If their publications are not regular, we do need to keep them." "We have already taken necessary actions against some of these newspapers. The same will happen to the others in phases," he added. "We have dropped 89 newspapers from the media list. Of them, 59 are published from Dhaka," Sanat Kumar Biswas, director general of the DFP, recently told bdnews24.com by phone. Biswas said more than 30 dailies have had their publication cancelled. "Dailies published from Dhaka but with circulations of less than 6000 copies per day and dailies from outside Dhaka with less than 3000 have been deleted from the media list. Dailies published for fewer than 25 days a month have also been dropped," he said. The government is continuing monitoring and evaluating all media enlisted daily, weekly and fortnightly newspapers. The current figure of daily and weekly newspapers in Bangladesh is 345 and 213 respectively. Of them, 131 dailies and 119 weeklies are published from Dhaka. A senior official of information ministry, who did not want to be named, said, "A few people publish newspapers for their personal gains. Once they are media listed, they take advantages of advertisements, newsprint allotments and accreditation cards." He said they continued regular publication for only 90 consecutive days just to be enlisted according to the current policy. Once listed, publications get irregular and come out only when they received advertisements. They even sold their newsprint quotas in the market. People from these publications also allegedly took to 'persuasion business' at the Bangladesh Secretariat after receiving accreditation cards. Recently, 1600 such 'journalists' have lost their cards, the official added. The 89 dailies dropped from the list include Daily Banglar Bani, Amader Dingulo, Naya Jamana, Purbabhash, Ajker Bangladesh, Ajker Janamat, Fashal, Amar Bangla, Al Mujaded, Ekusher Bani, Ghoshona, Shabuj Bangla, Birol, Insaniat, Khilafat, Ushar Bani, Nagarik, Abirbhab, Estehad, Shubhodin and Kolodhdhhoni. bdnews24.com/e
