<TEXT>
 MADRID, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World and European player of the year Fabio Cannavaro has denied reports that he will leave Real Madrid and has said he aiming to help the Spanish champions win a record 10th European Cup this season. "In Italy they have insisted that I'm going to return, but it isn't true," the 34-year-old centre-back told sports daily Marca on Saturday. "I've always said that I've been happy at Real Madrid and in Spain and I'm glad I signed for this team. No one from the club has said that there is an offer for me nor have they said they want to sell me. I'm sure I'll remain at Real." Cannavaro signed for Real from Juventus after leading Italy to victory in the World Cup last year but had a difficult first season with the Primera Liga side. With Real sacking coach Fabio Capello and signing two new centre-backs Christoph Metzelder and Pepe in the close season, there has been speculation that Cannavaro might return to his former club Juventus. But Cannavaro said that although he was grateful to Capello, his future at Real had not been dependent on the presence of the Italian. "I've worked with Capello for three years and I've learned a lot from him. He made me into a winner and I'm thankful to him for that," he said. "But I signed a three-year contract with Real Madrid and not with Capello." The defender admitted to having problems in his first season at Real, but was confident he would recover the form he showed at Juventus in the forthcoming campaign. "It was to be expected that after winning the World Cup and coming to a new country that I would suffer and have problems," he said. "But I've rested up well over the summer, I'm now familiar with Spanish football and I hope to perform at a higher level. "My aim is to help the team with the Champions League, that is the only trophy I have left to win.
