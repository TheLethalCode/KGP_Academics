 MOSCOW, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Soviet Union sold the sacred bells from Moscow's oldest monastery as scrap and they ended up in the United States. Seventy-seven years later, Russia is bringing them home, drawing a new line under its communist past. Charles Crane, a US industrialist and diplomat with a passion for Russian art and culture, bought the Danilovsky monastery's 18 bells from Joseph Stalin's atheist government in 1930 and gave them to Harvard University.

"I want to believe the carillon of these bells in America ... will become yet another symbol of our countries' friendship and unity," said Russian billionaire tycoon Viktor Vekselberg, who helped secure the return of the bells. "Of course, when those bells go we'll all weep because we love them," said Diana Eck, master of Harvard University's Lowell House that has been home to the Russian bells. "But we will also rejoice because these (new) bells are wonderful. They've also become part of our history. We've seen them from birth, from when they were just a design to now, the reality.
