 KARACHI, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board has revised its stance on playing a Twenty20 match against India to raise funds for the Bob Woolmer academy in South Africa. After initially stating a crowded fixture list made it difficult to find time to arrange the match, the PCB said it was now committed to playing the game at any venue and was trying to finalise a date during Pakistan's tour of India later this year. "We fully support the idea of Gill Woolmer to raise funds for the academy. We have confirmed the same to her," PCB spokesman Ehsan Malik said in a statement on Saturday. The 58-year-old was Pakistan coach from June 2004 until he died of natural causes during the World Cup in Jamaica on March 18, one day after Pakistan were shocked by minnows Ireland and eliminated in the first round of the competition. Woolmer's widow, Gill, wrote to the Pakistan and Indian boards suggesting they play a Twenty20 match to raise the funds for the academy in Cape Town, the former England player's dream project. "We will offer all support to Woolmer's family as a tribute to the former national coach," Malik said, adding the PCB would opt for any venue that the host board agreed upon be it the Indian board or the England and Wales one. Gill Woolmer has also suggested that Pakistan play a Twenty20 match in England to raise funds
