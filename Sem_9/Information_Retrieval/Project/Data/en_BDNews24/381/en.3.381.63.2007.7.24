<TITLE> New US-Iran talks on Iraq begin in Baghdad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US and Iranian envoys held rare talks on Tuesday to discuss Iraq's security crisis, with Washington under pressure to stabilise the country before the US Congress receives a crucial report in September. The envoys began a second round of talks in Baghdad on Iraq's worsening security, following up on a landmark meeting in May between the two arch rivals. Underscoring the unrelenting violence, a suicide car bomber killed 26 people and wounded 70 in a crowded market near a maternity hospital in the Shi'ite town of Hilla, 100 km (60 miles) south of Baghdad, police said. Fourteen shops were destroyed in the blast and more than a dozen cars set ablaze. Two suicide bombers killed 105 pilgrims in Hilla, a popular target for such attacks, in March. Sectarian violence and worsening chaos in Iraq has pushed the two countries, which have not had diplomatic ties since shortly after Iran's 1979 revolution, to seek common ground. Iranian ambassador Hassan Kazemi-Qomi and his US counterpart Ryan Crocker met in the heavily fortified Green Zone in the Iraqi capital. Television footage showed the two delegations and an Iraqi government team, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, sitting around white-clothed tables set in a triangle. "Terrorism is hitting all the sects of Iraqi people without exception," Maliki said in opening the meeting. Maliki's fractured government is under growing pressure from Washington to meet a series of political benchmarks aimed at promoting national reconciliation before Congress receives the crucial progress report in mid-September. The first meeting on May 28 ended a diplomatic freeze between Iran and the United States lasting almost 30 years. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari met Crocker and Kazemi-Qomi separately in Baghdad on Monday in preparation for the meeting but the agenda for the talks is still not known. Washington accuses Shi'ite Muslim Iran of fomenting violence in Iraq. Iran denies the charge and blames the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 for the bloodshed between Iraq's majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni Arabs. "One would hope you would see a change in Iranian behaviour," a US State Department spokesman said in Washington on Monday. "It is up to the Iranians." White House spokesman Tony Snow said explosive devices blamed for the deaths of many US troops in Iraq as well as other weaponry were still coming into Iraq from Iran. The United States has been leading diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear ambitions but both sides have long said the talks will focus solely on the violence in Iraq. Kazemi-Qomi called the May 28 meeting "a first step in negotiations" but Crocker had said he was less interested in arranging more meetings than laying out Washington's case that Iran is arming, funding and training Shi'ite militias in Iraq. The US military has previously displayed what it says are Iranian-made rockets, mortars and sophisticated roadside bombs seized in Iraq. Roadside bombs are the biggest killers of US troops in Iraq. Keeping up that pressure, the US military said on Sunday it had detained two suspected insurgents linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Qods Force. Iran does not officially acknowledge the existence of the Qods Force. The second round of talks comes after the Iranian envoy earlier this month made the first consular visit to five Iranians detained by US forces in northern Iraq in January. The US military says the five men are linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards and were backing militants in Iraq. Iran has insisted they are diplomats and demanded they be freed but, like Iran's nuclear ambitions, the subject is unlikely to be raised at Tuesday
