 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina believes the country is heading towards a crisis situation, said former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru after meeting with her Friday. "Hasina feared she might not get justice; she said a camera trial was taking place," Khasru told reporters after his visit to the sub-jail in the Jatiya Sangsad premises. He visited the jail at about 2.30pm Friday, being the first to gain permission from the home ministry to see Hasina four days after her arrest. Khasru is one of the lawyers to defend her in court. Khasru said Hasina complained to him of misconduct at the time of arrest. She was confined for two hours before the arrest, he quoted her as saying. Hasina had also said she could not sleep on the first night in the jail as the makeshift bed she was given was broken. Hasina was quoted by Khasru as saying: "They failed to provide me with security. I was treated badly. I did not expect such behaviour from the government." According to Khasru, Hasina also claimed that the people who had filed the recent cases against her were in hiding. "Mental and physical torture was inflicted on them; they were intimidated," Khasru reported Hasina as saying. Khasru alleged he was forced to sit idle for 20 minutes before visiting Hasina. "After about 25 minutes, the deputy inspector general of prisons asked me to hurry my visit as another visitor was waiting outside." Three plainclothes officers were present during their meeting, Khasru said. Khasru and Hasina spoke about the lawsuits, he told reporters. Hasina told him the cases were preplanned to bar her from taking part in the polls and designed to end her political career. The cases were filed through abuse of power and by defying laws and courts, Khasru quoted her as complaining. Khasru alleged Hasina might not be given a chance to defend herself. He believes that the chargesheet that will be submitted may influence the procedure of the case. "Laws do not allow a case filed more than eight years ago to be disposed of under the Emergency Powers Ordinance," Khasru said. "We hope we will get justice in the High Court. A final report could be made if the investigation could be carried out in line with laws," he said. Earlier in the day, Hasina's uncle Sheikh Akram Hossain and personal assistant Hasan Mamud had tried to visit Hasina but were not permitted to see her. Since Hasina was arrested on July 16, no relatives have been allowed to visit her at the special jail. bdnews24.com
