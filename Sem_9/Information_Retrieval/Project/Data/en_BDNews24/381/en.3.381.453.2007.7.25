 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP lawmaker Naser Rahman, son of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, was sent to jail Wednesday after a five-day remand in a corruption case. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka ordered him into jail as investigating officer Golam Shahrier Chowdhury, a deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission, did not appeal for further remand. Metropolitan magistrate Mizanur Rahman made the order. The ACC on May 27 filed the case against Naser and wife Rezina Naser for submitting a flawed wealth statement to the graft watchdog. bdnew
