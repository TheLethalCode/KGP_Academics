 BUCHAREST, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from Romania's heat wave rose to 15 on Sunday after six more people died in the Black Sea country where temperatures hovered around 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu said. Meteorologists say high temperatures, which could exceed 42 degrees in the southern regions on the Danube river border with Bulgaria, might last until early next week.

A half dozen cars skidded out at the first corner of lap three. And in Switzerland, thunderstorms caused mudslides and floods in cantons in the country's centre for a third day.
