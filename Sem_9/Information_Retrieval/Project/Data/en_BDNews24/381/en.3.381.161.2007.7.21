 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Oli Ahmed Saturday unveiled a new committee of the Liberal Democratic Party to formally split the nine-month-old party into two. On June 27, AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury announced a new 11-member presidium, expelling Oli, a retired colonel, former speaker Shaikh Razzak Ali and 11 others. The party, founded on October 26, 2006, had earlier promised to bring the politics out of the grasp of the Awami League and the BNP. Oli announced an 88-member national executive committee with Razzak Ali as executive president and Jahanara Begum as secretary general. Oli, the president of the party, threw a challenge to Badruddoza Chowdhury, saying his faction embodies the LDP. "We are the mainstream faction of LDP. Prof B Chowdhury, his son Mahi B Chowdhury and major (retired) Abdul Mannan left the LDP," Jahanara told bdnews24.com. "Others and almost all committees including the city unit committees are with us." She said activists of Bikalpa Dhara were with Badruddoza, not of LDP. "We founded the LDP. We are at our home," she said. Jahanara said their party symbol would be kula and the executive committee will approve it in the next council. The new executive committee have 10 presidium members, 17 vice presidents, 10 advisers and four joint secretary general. The presidium members are Jahanara, Alamgir Kabir, Redwan Ahmed, retired major general Anwarul Kabir Talukder, Moni Swapan Dewan, Abdul Karim Abbasi, Ziaur Rahman, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, Ali Kadar and Mukit Khan.
