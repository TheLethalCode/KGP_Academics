<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium members Motia Chowdhury and Abur Razzak Saturday slammed the interim government for taking what they claimed no steps to hold trial for the August 21, 2004 grenade attack. "Old cases against Sheikh Hasina are being revived and new charges brought against her, but the government did not take any steps to hold trial for the grenade attack," Motia said. Razzak said the BNP-led government committed the crime and did not hold trial. The interim government had followed in the footsteps of the past government, he alleged. Motia and Razzak, who only days ago went for each other's throat over Reforms, made the remarks during a visit to see deceased Dhaka City AL leader Ayub Ali Babul, widely known as Swandip Babul, at his Jhigatala home. Babul, who sustained injuries in the deadly grenade attack, died of heart attack Friday night at a hospital in the city. Babul, the president of ward no 48, Dhaka City Awami League, was laid to rest at Azimpur graveyard. bdnews
