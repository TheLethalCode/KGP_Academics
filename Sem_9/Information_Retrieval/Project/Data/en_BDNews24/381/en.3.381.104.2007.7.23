 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  The emergency government has removed or suspended 19 Union Parishad chairmen and 11 members on multiple charges of corruption, an adviser said Monday. "A member will take the reins of the Union Parishad administration in the absence of a chairman," LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal told bdnews24.com by telephone. He said the move aimed to restore transparency and accountability to the Union Parishad system, a key part of the local government. The adviser cited embezzlement, abuse of power, repression of women, illegal migration to foreign countries as the reasons for their removal and suspension from jobs. Iqbal also said the chairmen and members also skipped three straight meetings in a breach of discipline. Banizur Rahman, a spokesman for the LGRD ministry, told bdnews24.com that two chairmen had been removed on charges of corruption and abuse of power. Another two chairmen face charges of skipping meetings and embezzling public funds. And 15 chairmen who were suspended did not attend mandatory meetings. Banizur said joint forces arrested at least 39 municipal chairmen after the emergency government came to power in January. Officials with the LGRD ministry said local government representatives went into hiding after the state of emergency was imposed. Local people pay the price. People face difficulty collecting birth certificates and other documents from the Union Parishad administration and municipalities as chairmen and members are on the run, fearing arrest. The documents are required of people to get their children enrolled in schools and to open bank accounts. bdn
