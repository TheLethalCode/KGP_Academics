 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone's estimated market share in the second quarter of 2007 has dropped one percentage point to 60 percent from the previous quarter, said the company's second quarter results. The largest mobile phone company has blamed the slide on increased capital expenses and marketing costs, which have impacted its pre-tax earnings of Q2. The GP's quarterly revenue growth was marginally positive at 0.26 percent in Q2. It was negative by 6.27 percent in the previous quarter. It roped in 1.867 million customers from April to June this year, by far the second highest quarterly intake. It however has yet to break the quarterly intake record of 2.032 million customers it had set exactly a year ago, in Q2 of 2006. Grameenphone has recorded 13.98 million customers until June. Prepaid customers continue to propel GP's growth and the addition of 1.835 million such customers in Q2 represents a 14 percent quarter-on-quarter growth. The average revenue per user has slumped 31 percent "primarily due to decreasing average prices", the company said. bdn
