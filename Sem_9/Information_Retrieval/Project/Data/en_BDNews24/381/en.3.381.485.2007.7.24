 SINGAPORE, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares inched higher on Tuesday as exporters shrugged off the yen's rise to a two-month high against the dollar, but technology stocks such as Samsung Electronics dipped after weak earnings from a major US rival. Nervous share trading and renewed dollar weakness bolstered save-haven investments, nudging up gold and lifting Japanese government bond futures to another six-week high and US Treasury bonds near seven-week highs. European share markets are expected to head lower after Monday's solid gains as edgy investors hold back awaiting a flood of earnings. Bookmakers see Britain's FTSE 100 down 9 to 17 points, Germany's DAX down 24 to 36 points and France's CAC 40 down 13 to 30 points. The dollar, dogged by persistent worries about the fall-out from the US housing and mortgage woes, gave up most of Monday's modest gains and fell against the yen and the euro. Japan's Nikkei see-sawed in early trade to nudge 0.2 percent higher, helped by a rally in telecom KDDI Exporters such as Sony Corp. and Canon Inc. bounced back after a brief dip after investors decided the yen was still some way below the pain threshold. "Many companies have assumed a dollar/yen rate of 115 yen when drawing up forecasts," said Shinji Igarashi, equity manager, sales department at Chuo Securities. "Investors may get worried if the yen strengthens to 117 yen or so, but it trades at 120 yen and there still seems to be a buffer." TECH CONCERNS In Seoul, the main index briefly spiked above the 2,000-point barrier for the first time, but retreated on concerns about the prospects for the technology sector and closed flat. Heavyweights such as Samsung and LG Electronics fell after Texas Instruments, the world's biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, disappointed with its earnings and fell in after-hours trading in New York. Elsewhere in Asia, stocks posted solid gains driving the MSCI's gauge for regional markets outside of Japan up 0.8 percent to another record high, tracking Monday's 0.7 percent gain Wall Street's blue-chip index Australian shares erased Monday's losses and rose 0.5 percent to another closing high, led by BHP Billiton Ltd. after the top miner reported record production figures. Hong Kong stocks gained 0.5 percent, hitting an intraday high. Taiwan rose 1.3 percent, again a seven-year high, and shares in Singapore climbed 0.9 percent. There was little respite for the dollar despite the US stock market bounce and the US currency hit a two-month low of 120.41 yen and hovered just above an all-time low against the euro US DATA WATCH Concerns about a credit market crunch and wider fallout from the subprime mortgage troubles prompted some investors to unwind yen carry trades, in which the low-yielding yen is sold to invest in higher-yielding currencies and assets, traders said. "The dollar selling is driven by subprime mortgage concerns while the yen's rise is due to some unwinding of carry trades," said Shogo Nagaya, a foreign exchange manager at Nomura Securities. Traders said investors were now waiting for US housing sales and second-quarter gross domestic product data due later this week to show whether the problems in the housing market were affecting broader economic activity. Oil markets offered some respite for investors dreading a scenario where US growth suffers from housing woes but inflation stays high because of costly oil. Oil prices fell for a third day in a row on expectations of rising US fuel stockpiles and after the oil exporting cartel OPEC pledged to pump more crude if needed. London Brent crude fell 28 cents to $76.58 a barrel afer a 78-cent drop on Monday. US crude dipped 28 cents to $74.61 after a 90-cent drop
