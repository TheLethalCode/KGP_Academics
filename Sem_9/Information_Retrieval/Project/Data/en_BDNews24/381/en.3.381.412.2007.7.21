 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  Special branch officers Friday interrogated some Dhaka University teachers on their planned move to protest Sheikh Hasina's arrest. Teachers are set to start their demonstration Saturday under Dhaka University Teachers Association, demanding immediate freedom for the former prime minister. "Some officers of the Special Branch of Police asked me on our programme," DUTA secretary Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com. "It was not interrogation as such. It was just a discussion," he added. While the DUTA secretary and two other teachers admitted the police inquiry, DUTA president Professor Sadrul Amin told bdnews24.com that he was not aware of it. Professor AK Azad Chowdhury was among the teachers who were questioned. The former vice chancellor with close ties to the Awami League told bdnews24.com some police officers came to his university flat on the campus and asked him about DUTA move. Professor Harun-or-Rashid was the second to be interrogated. "They (officers) asked me if we could reverse the decision. They wanted to know if we had decided on the move in discussion with all teachers," he told bdnews24.com. "They also asked me how we look at the state of emergency," he said. DUTA, an outfit of teachers with diverse political leanings, Thursday called a meeting and rolled out a five-point charter of demands and proposals In a statement issued Thursday, the DU teachers demanded removal of law adviser Mainul Hosein from the caretaker government for making biased comments in the wake of the arrest of Hasina. Security forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in an extortion case, and a Dhaka court sent her to jail rejecting a bail prayer. The demand for removal of the adviser makes the first call on the government to get him out of the job since it took office in January. In the statement, the association protested an alleged move by the caretaker government to take Hasina, and another former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, "out of the political scene". Teachers are set to wear black badges to classes Saturday in a symbolic protest against the arrest of Hasina and alleged harassment of Khaleda, the statement said. The teachers decided not to join work for half of the day on July 22. University exams will go on as scheduled. The meeting also called on the government to return a democratic system to the country clearing the way for general elections to take place. bdnews24.c
