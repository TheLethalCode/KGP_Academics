 KABUL, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban movement said on Saturday it had killed two German hostages it was holding after the end of its deadline, and would kill the other in less than an hour if its demands were not met. "I got information from Taliban that they shot dead one of the hostages and the second one will be killed by 1:00 pm (local time)," Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told Reuters by phone from an unknown location. later he confirmed that the other one had been killed after the deadline. He said the two Germans along with six Afghans who were abducted from their vehicle southwest of Kabul on Wednesday were in good condition. German Chancellor Merkel has dismissed the idea that Germany should withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. "We can't give up our efforts now," she was quoted as saying in an interview with Passauer Neue Presse newspaper on Saturday. "The Afghan people can't be abandoned." A spokeswoman for Germany's Foreign Ministry reiterated that Berlin had received no clear evidence that the two Germans were in the hands of the Taliban. She said a special crisis task force at the ministry was working closely with the Afghan government to secure the release of the hostages. At the beginning of July a German was taken hostage and then freed after a week. In October 2006 two German journalists were murdered in the relatively stable northern part of the country where there are over 3,000 German troops stationed as part of a NATO peacekeeping force. The Afghan government said it was not aware of the Taliban ultimatum on the German hostages. The Afghan government drew stern criticism for releasing a group of Taliban prisoners in return for the freedom of an Italian journalist kidnapped in March and the government then said it would not deal with the Islamist movement.
