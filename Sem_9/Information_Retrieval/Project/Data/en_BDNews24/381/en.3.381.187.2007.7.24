 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's leading food and agriculture-based manufacturers are eager to invest in contract and commercial farming in Myanmar. Pran Group, Brac and Bengal Meat have all expressed interest in investing in the agriculture sector in Myanmar, officials say. YoungOne Bangladesh Ltd is also keen to do business there, officials told bdnews24.com after attending a meeting held on July 17 at the agriculture ministry. Bangladesh has been approaching Myanmar since 2004 in an effort to lease land there for farming. Myanmar agreed recently to offer commercial enterprises in Bangladesh some 50,000 acres of land for the purpose. "Now we must conduct a feasibility study," Syed Mahmudul Huq, chairman of the Bangladesh-Myanmar Business Promotion Council, told bdnews24.com. "The private sector has been urging the government to form a high powered standing committee to look into the pros and cons of the matter seriously," Huq said. Under the proposed arrangement, Bangladesh will initially produce such food items as are already imported from Myanmar, according to the agriculture ministry. Currently, Bangladesh imports mainly fish, maize, livestock, pulses and timber from Myanmar. Commerce ministry statistics show that Bangladesh's exports to Myanmar stood at $5.19 million against an import bill of $29.53 million in fiscal 2005-06. "We'll receive land and small farmers in Myanmar, while Bangladesh will provide a guaranteed market, technical know-how, inputs and a margin to the farmers," Huq said. For commercial farming, experts will be hired from Bangladesh to supervise. Myanmar has liberal land leasing policies, said Huq, a founder member of the BMBPC established in 1998. They allow each commercial enterprise up to 5,000 acres of land for plantation, 3,000 acres for orchard, 1,000 acres for seasonal crops and 2,000 acres for aquaculture. There are separate policies for livestock, allowing 5,000 acres for buffalo farming, 1,000 acres for sheep and goat and 500 acres for poultry. "Tax rates and tenure of leases depend on the location of the land," Huq said. A delta region with a population of about 140 million that is growing at 1.8 percent a year, Bangladesh faces acute scarcity of cultivatable land. Human settlement, overcrowding and alternative uses of land are adding to these concerns. In contrast, Myanmar enjoys an advantageous position. The country has yet to harness its resources and effectively reap the seeds of economic progress. Global sanctions on the junta government during the last 17 years have affected the country's development although it is abundantly endowed with natural resources. bdne
