 NUERBURGRING, Germany, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - McLaren's Fernando Alonso won a thrilling and chaotic European Grand Prix on Sunday while championship leading team mate Lewis Hamilton's run of nine podiums in a row came to an end. The double world champion's victory, after a wheel-banging thrust past Ferrari's Felipe Massa just four laps from the finish, left the Spaniard two points adrift of the British rookie in the standings.

Hamilton, who crashed heavily in qualifying on Saturday, skidded off on the third lap but kept the engine running and was able to continue for the re-start -- albeit a lap down on the leaders.

"It's a new experience for me, not having to find my way to the podium," he said. Austrian Alexander Wurz was fourth for Williams, ahead of Briton David Coulthard for Red Bull and Germany's Nick Heidfeld for BMW Sauber. Poland's Robert Kubica was seventh for BMW Sauber and Finland's Heikki Kovalainen took the final point for champions Renau
