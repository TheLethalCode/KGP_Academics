<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Sunday asked the government to explain in three weeks why the decisions to retake an oral test after cancelling the previous result of the 27th BCS exam are not illegal. The court however ruled that the Public Service Commission would go ahead with the planned re-exam on July 29 but asked the official recruiting agency not to publish the result before the case is settled. A two-member panel of judges, justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Zobair Rahman Chowdhury, issued the rule on a writ petition filed by 13 examinees who had passed the test. The petitioners said the final result of the test came out on Jan 22 after all forms of the testwritten, oral and medicalwere over. But the PSC in line with the instruction of the establishment ministry scrapped the result on July 1 without showing reason, according to the petition. On July 12, the commission set the new oral test for July 29. On May 30, the interim council of advisers decided to cancel the result of the oral exam amid reported allegations that the previous BNP-led coalition government had manipulated the test. The petitioners said the establishment ministry had no right to cancel the result after announcement of the final decision. bdnews24
