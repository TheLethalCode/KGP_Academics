<TITLE> The last chance for top-order redemption </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's top order gets yet another shot to redeem itself in the inconsequential third and final one-dayer against formidable Sri Lanka at R Premadasa Stadium Wednesday. Wih series already conceded, Ashraful and his colleagues should try not to lose their heads in an insipid batting display right from the word go that seldom makes a pretty sight. The Tigers' batting has been at an unbelievable ebb in Sri Lanka, which saw them concede three innings defeats in the Test series and skittled out for 164 and 137 in the first two ODIs. The top-order batsmen will certainly want to prove their contention that Bangladesh are far better in one-dayers than in Tests after being routed in three-match Test series right. The team had no training Tuesday, but they took part in stretching and swimming in the morning for an hour and after that coaching staff had individual meeting with batsmen and bowlers, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). The team management has made two changes to the squad that played the second one-dayer. The Tigers will miss pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza for the second straight game, as he is recovering from a sprained ankle. Uncapped Mahmudullah Riad, who bowls off-spin and is a hard-hitting middle-order batsman, is set to take his international bow and will replace Tushar Imran, who made 0 and 4 in the two matches. Opener Javed Omer gets his first match in the ODI series at the cost of off-form Shahriar Nafees, who had retained his ODI place after hitting fifty in the third Test. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful (Captain), Tamim Iqbal, Javed Omer Belim, Mushfiqur Rahim, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah Riyad, Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain and Syed Rasel.
