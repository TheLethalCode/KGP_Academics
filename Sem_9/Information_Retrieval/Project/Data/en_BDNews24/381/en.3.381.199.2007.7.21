 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) - Central bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed Saturday said the recently announced monetary policy would not hike bank interest rates, particularly the long-term ones. "We are alert about the fear of the businesses that bank interest rates may increase on the announcement of the monetary policy," Ahmed told a seminar. The South Asian Free Media Association (Safma) organised the seminar on "Poverty and role of Bangladesh media" at the Jatiya Press Club. Concerns over hike in bank interest rate surfaced after the Bangladesh Bank on July 14 announced a 'contractionary monetary policy' for the first half of the current fiscal. The governor said the policy stance came in the wake of rising money supply and booming reserve despite a cautious monetary policy over the last 18 months. Ahmed said money supply rose to 19 percent in the last fiscal, well above the central bank's assessment of 15 percent. The reserve money also increased significantly to over $5 billion. Banks as well have a surplus liquidity of Tk 10,000 crore. He said the central bank was monitoring the situation, and if necessary, the monetary policy measures would be reviewed on the basis of money supply and reserve money. "We'll ensure that the new measures do not affect the interest rates," he said, adding that the central bank will soon convene a meeting to discuss the issue. President of Bangladesh Economic Association Dr Qazi Kholiquzzman Ahmad and FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain also spoke. Mir Nasir said the private sector would find life difficult if the government simultaneously increased electricity, gas and fuel oil tariffs. The private sector was already suffering from high interest rates for loans, the top business leader said. He said the interest rate in Bangladesh is more than 14 percent while it is 3 percent in China and 7-8 percent in India. SAFMA president Reazuddin Ahmed presided over the seminar. bdnew
