<TITLE> EU consumer chief warns China on product safety </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NANJING, China, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's top consumer protection official warned China on Wednesday the bloc would take measures, even a ban, against Chinese exports if the country did not crack down on makers of dangerous goods. "If there's no improvement, there would be more severe measures," European Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said after visiting a toy test centre and a toy factory in China's eastern province of Jiangsu. "They will pay for it, and it will be very painful. No access to our market is our last resort.'' Kuneva urged China to identify all dangerous goods and show efforts to crack down on wrongdoers in a quarterly report that it has agreed to provide by October. Her first official trip to China, which included a meeting with China's top product quality regulator on Tuesday, is taking place days before a scheduled meeting between US and Chinese officials on the safety of food exports. China faces growing pressure from its trading partners after a series of scares ranging from poisonous pet food ingredients and toxic fish to dangerous toys and contaminated toothpaste. In 2006, China accounted for almost half of the 924 defective products reported by the EU's consumer protection system, RAPEX, which heightened tensions over China's trade surplus with the region. Chinese exports to the EU almost doubled between 2003 and 2006. After visiting the Yangzhou Import & Export Toy Inspection Institute, China's biggest toy test centre, and Yangzhou Rich Arts & Crafts Co., one of its biggest toy exporters, Kuneva said the government-organised tour was a showcase that did not reflect the real situation. "There's still a lot of work that needs to be done in terms of producer control," she said. "We can never compromise on the safety of goods." She added that the EU and China would in future extend discussions on safety from goods to services. "We're still at a very basic stage with China. Very soon, we can talk about quality of services.'
