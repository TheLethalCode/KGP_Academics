 KABUL, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The last king of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir Shah, was buried on Tuesday at a state funeral where thousands bid farewell to the monarch remembered for his peaceful reign who became known as the "father of the nation". President Hamid Karzai, a distant cousin of the king, led mourners following the coffin draped in the black, red and green Afghan flag as it was laid on a gun carriage for the short journey from the presidential palace to a hill above Kabul. A 21-gun salute was fired as soldiers carried the coffin across dozens of red Afghan carpets to the bullet-riddled mausoleum of Zahir Shah's father, draped in black for the occasion, and lowered it into the crypt below. The hill and mausoleum were fought over many times during the civil wars that erupted in the years after Zahir Shah was deposed in a bloodless coup by his cousin in 1973.

Zahir Shah declared Afghanistan a constitutional monarchy in 1964 for which Karzai hailed him as the father of Afghan democracy. Few Afghans clearly remember Zahir Shah's rule in a country with one of the lowest life expectancies in the world and where intervening wars have clouded perceptions. But his 40 years on the throne was one of the most peaceful periods in Afghanistan's recent history where many women worked, drove buses and some even wore mini-skirts on Kabul's streets. When he returned from exile in 2002, many of Zahir Shah's fellow Pashtuns saw the former king as a potentially unifying force that could bring fractious Afghans together, but many also distrusted him and the ageing monarch renounced his throne. In return he was accorded the honorary title of "father of the nation". The former king died in his bed after months of illness on Monday, the last ruler from a dynasty established in 17
