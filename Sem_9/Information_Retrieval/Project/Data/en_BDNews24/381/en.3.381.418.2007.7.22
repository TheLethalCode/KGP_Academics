<TITLE> Pietersen century puts England in command </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Pietersen scored his ninth test century as England set India 380 runs to win the first test on the fourth day at Lord's on Sunday. England were all out for 282 on the stroke of tea in their second innings as Pietersen scored 134 before his pursuit of quick runs saw him play on to his stumps to be the ninth man out. India have only once scored more than 300 to win a test batting fourth. Left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh, who finished off the innings by dismissing Pietersen and then trapping Monty Panesar lbw, claimed career-best test figures of five for 59. Zaheer Khan took four for 79. The situation of the match suited Pietersen and gave him the freedom to play flamboyantly, like the whip through midwicket for four he played even though Shanthakumaran Sreesanth's delivery pitched outside off stump. He went from 89 to 104 next over to Anil Kumble, with a four off the back foot through cover and then a straight six next ball. Pietersen required just 30 deliveries to reach three figures from his lunchtime score of 62. India seemed to have no answer to him as Rahul Dravid had no choice but to set a defensive field and employ a damage-limitation policy. Matt Prior played the supporting role efficiently and ensured his in-form partner was on strike most. When Prior raised the 100 partnership, Pietersen had contributed 71. Prior's innings of 42 from 61 balls ended when he edged Zaheer to the wicketkeeper. Chris Tremlett was bowled next ball, giving him a pair on debut, though Ryan Sidebottom safely blocked the hat-trick ball. Sidebottom, after two fours off Kumble, was caught at slip by Dravid off the leg-spinner. The loss of Prior sparked a good period for India as they reduced England's scoring rate and prevented them from having more time in which to bowl them out. England achieved a first-innings lead of 97 after scoring 298 and bowling India out for 201. India have not won a test series in England for 21 years
