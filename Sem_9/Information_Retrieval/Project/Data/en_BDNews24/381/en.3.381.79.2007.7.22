 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) A record rainfall in the capital Sunday ground morning traffic to a abrupt halt on the waterlogged streets. There has hardly been any respite from the intermittent rainfalls natural in the Bangla month of Sravana during the past four-five days. The rains accompanied by gusty to squally winds have been persisting since morning. The met office said the whole country is affected by moderate to heavy rainfalls due to monsoon, which is likely to continue through the next 24 hours. The flood situation remains unchanged all over the country; in a couple of places, rivers swelled too. The highest rainfall 90 mm in the country for 6 am-12 noon period was recorded in Dhaka and the lowest of 1 mm in Mongla. During the same period, Cox's Bazaar had 58, Teknaf 41, Tangail 23, Mymensingh 10 and both Rajshahi and Ishurdi 13 mm rainfall. The torrential rains causing the upstream rivers swelling and pushing the deluge downstream from the hills in India have flooded Feni, Comilla and Kurigram areas. All over the district of Chittagong has been experiencing moderate to heavy rains, which also is likely to continue. The maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla have been asked to keep the local cautionary signal 3 hoisted. Heavy rains have caused landslides occurring in over fifty hills of Bandarban district sadar, Rowangchhari and Ruma upazilas. The extremely wet weather has caused the commuters and school goers unspeakable bothers and troubles in getting transports and then negotiating knee to waist deep water standing on the roads and alleyways due to drainage congestion. bdnews
