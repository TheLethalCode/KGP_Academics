 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Sudden floods in large swathes of the country might ease with water levels in most of the major rivers receding, a flood forecast official said. Three rivers that crossed the danger mark are still overflowing at four points though, said Ariful Haque, an official with the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC). Haque said the Padma was flowing 1 cm above the danger level at Goalanda point. The Surma waters receded by 14 cm at Sunamganj, 5 cm below the danger level at that point. At Kanaighat, the Surma waters receded by six cm but still were 1 cm above the danger mark. The river Gomti was flowing 111 cm above the danger mark at Comilla point despite receding by 4 cm there. The river waters, however, rose slightly at Devidwar, and were flowing 181 cm above the danger mark there. Moderate to heavy rainfall resumed Monday night in Dhaka and continued until Tuesday morning. The met office said the day temperature might increase slightly across the country. The maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla have been asked to show local cautionary signal 3. Weather official Ayesha Khatun said the local cautionary signals were occasioned by the banks of clouds. The river ports of Dhaka and the south were asked to hoist cautionary signal 2 (two), while other river ports have been ordered cautionary signal 1 (one). The met office said light to medium to heavy thundershowers twined with gusty to squally winds might affect most places of Rajshahi, Chittagong and Barisal, and some places of Dhaka, Khulna and Sylhet divisions. The highest temperature Monday was 33.5 degrees Celsius at Jessore and the lowest 22.2 degrees Celsius at Khepupara. The sun sets at 6:46pm Tuesday and rises at 5:24am Wednesday. bdnews24.com/al
