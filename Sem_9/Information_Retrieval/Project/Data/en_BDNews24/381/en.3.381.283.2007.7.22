 Ankara, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turks voted for a new parliament on Sunday to serve a five-year term amid increased tensions between the AK Party government, which has Islamist roots, and the country's powerful secular establishment. The AK Party is widely expected to win the election but possibly with a reduced majority in the 550-seat assembly. Here is an outline of the main political parties contesting the election and their principal policies. JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (AK PARTY) - The centre-right AK Party swept to power in November 2002 elections, just months after being founded by ex-Islamists led by former Istanbul mayor Tayyip Erdogan. - The party has pledged to continue the pro-business, free market policies that have delivered five years of strong economic growth and falling inflation. It has promised to help small and medium-sized businesses and cut taxes and red tape while keeping a tight lid on state spending. - It vows to reinvigorate stalled political reforms linked to Turkey's European Union membership bid after presiding over the 2005 launch of entry talks. - It wants to overhaul Turkey's military-inspired 1982 constitution to entrench individual rights and freedoms, although it has made no explicit commitment to lift the ban on the Muslim headscarf in universities and public offices. This is a highly sensitive issue for Turkey's secular elite, which distrusts the AK Party. REPUBLICAN PEOPLE'S PARTY (CHP) - The main opposition party, the centre-left but nationalist CHP, is Turkey's oldest and was founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, revered founder of the modern republic, in 1924. - Led by veteran politician Deniz Baykal, the staunchly secularist CHP has campaigned against what it sees as the creeping Islamisation of Turkey under AK Party rule and opposes any relaxation of restrictions against religious symbols and expression in politics, including the Muslim headscarf. - The CHP wants a review of increased foreign ownership in the banking sector and an end to what it sees as the economy's excessive reliance on foreign portfolio investment. - On security and foreign policy, the CHP says it would be more vigorous in tackling Kurdish separatist militants and more assertive in the EU accession negotiations. NATIONALIST MOVEMENT PARTY (MHP) - Founded in 1969, the far-right MHP was a member of the three-party coalition that lost power to the AK Party in 2002. It failed to clear the 10 percent threshold to enter parliament then but could be the third biggest party in the new assembly. - The MHP has focused mainly on the revival of Kurdish separatist violence and accuses the AK Party of being soft on terrorism. It has called for restoration of the death penalty for Kurdish rebels and supports the idea of a military incursion into northern Iraq to crush Turkish Kurdish rebels based there. DEMOCRATIC PARTY (DP) - This centre-right party is essentially a reincarnation of the True Path Party (DYP), founded in the 1980s by former president Suleyman Demirel. The DYP had planned to merge with its rival the Motherland Party (ANAP) for the 2007 election but the plan collapsed in May amid a row over seats. - Led by former police chief Mehmet Agar, the DP is seen as the most suitable coalition partner for the AK Party if the latter cannot form a government alone. But polls suggest the DP may fail to clear the 10 percent threshold to enter parliament. YOUNG PARTY (GENC) - Founded by young businessman Cem Uzan in 2002, Genc has tried to woo younger voters with populist slogans that are often heavily nationalist in tone. It could draw support from the MHP but may struggle to clear the 10 percent barrier. INDEPENDENTS - The new parliament could have up to 50 independent lawmakers, mostly from the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) who are running as independents to beat the 10 percent threshold. The DTP backs more political and cultural rights for Turkey's large ethnic Kurdish population but is viewed by many Turks as a tool of outlawed separatist Kurdish militants.
