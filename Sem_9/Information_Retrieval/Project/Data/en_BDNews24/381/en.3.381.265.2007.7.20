 NEW YORK, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Citigroup, the largest US bank, said Friday that second-quarter profit rose 18 percent, helped by record revenue growth, especially outside the United States, and tight cost controls. Net income increased to $6.23 billion, or $1.24 per share, from $5.27 billion, or $1.05, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 20 percent to $26.63 billion, while operating expenses were up 16 percent. Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1.13 per share on revenue of $24.88 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Profit from international operations gained 35 percent to $3.04 billion, while revenue increased 34 percent to $12.56 billion. The quarter included the early impact of a cost-cutting plan announced in April. It was designed to rid Citigroup of 17,000 jobs to help cut spending by $4.58 billion. Chief Executive Charles Prince said the program is generating "improved efficiencies," as New York-based Citigroup continues to generate a greater portion of business from international operations. Prince faces pressure from many shareholders to boost profit and revenue, and re-energize a long-lagging share price. As at many other US banks, Citigroup increased reserves for loan losses. Credit costs rose $934 million, Citigroup said, including an increase of $259 million in net credit losses and a $465 million charge to boost loss reserves. Citigroup shares closed Thursday at $51.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.
