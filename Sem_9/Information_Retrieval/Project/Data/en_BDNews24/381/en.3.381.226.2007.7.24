 BAGHDAD, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian support for militias who are destabilising Iraq has risen since the United States and Iran held breakthrough talks in Baghdad in May, the US envoy to Iraq said on Tuesday after a fresh round of discussions. Ryan Crocker told a news conference after talks on Iraq's security crisis with his Iranian counterpart that much of the dialogue was "not terribly relevant". "The two months since May have not exactly been encouraging," Crocker said after meeting Iranian ambassador Hassan Kazemi-Qomi for several hours. "The fact is, and we made very clear in today's talk, that over the roughly two months we have actually seen militia-related activities that can be attributed to Iranian support go up and not down." There was no immediate response from the Iranian delegation. Washington accuses Shia Muslim Iran of fomenting violence in Iraq. Iran denies the charge and blames the US-led invasion in 2003 for the bloodshed between Iraq's majority Shia and minority Sunni Arabs. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki earlier urged the two sides to help Iraq and warned that insurgent groups like al Qaeda were moving to other countries after they were hit in Iraq. "We are looking for your support to stabilise Iraq, which does not want to interefere in other countries' business, nor does it want others to interfere in its internal affairs," Maliki said in opening the meeting. The first round of talks between Crocker and Kazemi-Qomi on May 28 had ended a long diplomatic freeze between the two countries. Crocker refused to be drawn on whether there would be a third round. The latest round took place less than two months before Crocker and U.S. military commander General David Petraeus have to present a crucial report to the US Congress on Iraq's political and security progress. Underscoring the unrelenting violence in Iraq, a suicide car bomber killed 26 people and wounded 70 in a crowded market near a maternity hospital in the Shi'ite town of Hilla, 100 km (60 miles) south of Baghdad, police said. Sectarian violence and worsening chaos in Iraq has pushed the United States and Iran, which have not had diplomatic ties since shortly after Iran's 1979 revolution, to seek common ground. Maliki's fractured government is under growing pressure from Washington to meet a series of political benchmarks aimed at promoting national reconciliation before Congress receives the progress report in mid-Septemb
