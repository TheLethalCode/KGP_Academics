<TEXT>
 HANOI, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia ended Japan's bid for a third straight Asian Cup title on Wednesday, Malek Maaz scoring twice in a 3-2 win to send the Saudis into the final. Maaz sent his nation into their sixth final in the last seven tournaments with a superb solo goal, wriggling past three Japan defenders before smashing the ball into the top corner. The Saudis had never previously beaten Japan at the Asian Cup, including defeats in the 1992 and 2000 finals, but they were the sharper team throughout in Hanoi. Saudi captain Yasser Al Qahtani had volleyed his side in front in the 35th minute but Japan took just two minutes to pull level through defender Yuji Nakazawa's towering header. Maaz restored Saudi Arabia's lead with a bullet header two minutes into the second half only for Yuki Abe to equalise again for Japan with an acrobatic volley in the 53rd minute. Saudi Arabia, who lifted the Asian Cup in 1984, 1988 and 1996, face Iraq on Sunday in Jakarta after the Iraqis knocked out South Korea on penalties to reach their first final
