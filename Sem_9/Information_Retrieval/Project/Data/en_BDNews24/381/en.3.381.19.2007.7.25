 WASHINGTON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The senior US commander in Iraq is preparing a plan for military operations that sets summer 2009 as the goal for achieving a sustainable level of security throughout the country, his spokesman said on Tuesday. The draft, developed by Gen. David Petraeus' staff, lays out a series of security-related goals over two years, envisioning US troops in the war zone through 2009.

"Decisions and direction will flow based on that assessment and recommendations from commanders as well as the leadership of this building -- the secretary of defense," he said. Petraeus' spokesman in Baghdad, Col. Steven Boylan, would not discuss troop levels anticipated by the campaign plan. He also would not say whether Petraeus' staff was preparing plans for a possible withdrawal, should Bush change the strategy. The United States added about 30,000 troops to Iraq, bringing the total force to about 157,000, under the current security plan aimed at establishing enough security to allow Iraqi politicians to make progress toward reconciliation. All of the so-called "surge" forces have been in place since June 15. Democrats in Congress, however, are calling for a strategy change leading to withdrawal. Gates met with some senior Democrats in the House of Representatives, including the House speaker and chairmen of the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, on Tuesday to answer questions about Iraq. Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said he did not know if the lawmakers asked about the Petraeus pl
