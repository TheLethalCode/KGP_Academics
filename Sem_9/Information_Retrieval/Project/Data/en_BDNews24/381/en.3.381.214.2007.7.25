<TITLE> Chokers Tigers lose it all </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Colombo, July 25 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh lost Wednesday the third and final game of their Sri Lanka tour by 39 runs to hand the hosts a 3-0 sweep in both test and one-day series. The Tigers lost their way time and again to get all out for 157 in 37.1 overs chasing 197 after outrageously sloppy fielding allowed Sri Lanka to make 196 all out in 39.5 overs in the rain-hit 40-overs a side match at R Premadasa Stadium. Bangladesh were in with a decent chance to prevent a complete rout until Jayasuriya came in to bowl in the 31st over, who returned four for 14 in four overs. His back-to-back four-for landed him the man-of-the-series award. As has been the case with them throughout the entire tour, Bangladesh stopped dead at 157 from 129 for six. Before that, the all-too-familiar top-order collapse saw half of the side gone with only 69 runs on board in the 18th over. Jayasuriya triggered the collapse breaking the promising sixth wicket stand between Tamim Iqbal and debutant Mahmudullah in his first over. Suffering cramps, Tamim danced down the wicket to hit Jayasuriya to Chamara Kapudederaat at deep mid wicket for 55. Debutant Mahmudullah holed out at long on to Upul Chandana off the same bowler for 35. The pair added 60 runs for the sixth wicket stand, with Tamim hitting three fours and one six for his second ODI fifty. Mahmudullah played a patient 54-ball 35. Tailenders Farhad Reza (7) and Abdur Razzak (3) also fell to Jayasuriya as all four batsmen perished to force off the pace. At the beginning, pacer Farveez Maharoof struck double blow in his first two overs to dismiss Javed Omar and Mushfiqur Rahim, promoted up the order, for ducks to reduce Bangladesh to 11 for two. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful and Tamim Iqbal steadied the rocking boat for a while with a 42-run third wicket before Ashraful fell on 20. TV replays showed the Kulasekera inswinger hit Ashraful in the upper pad and was missing the leg stump. But umpire Rudi Koertzen raised his figure to derail the Bangladesh innings again. Earlier, despite some tight bowling from both pacers and spinners, lethargic fielding and dropped catches let Sri Lanka off the hook. Bangladesh fielders dropped no fewer than five easy catches and missed a run-out chance, which proved costly in the 40-overs a side match after Ashraful decided to field first winning the toss. Jehan Mubarak, dropped on 19 by Abdur Razzak off Reza, anchored the innings with a career-best 72 and was adjudged man-of-the-match. He put on 78 with Tillakaratne Dilshan for the fifth wicket and 32 runs with Mahela Jayawardene (20) for the sixth wicket before falling in the final over. Mubarak and Dilshan (39) took the hosts to 139 for five from 61 for four after Bangladesh pace duo of Shahadat Hossain and Syed Rasel made the early inroads into the Sri Lankan batting. They dismissed openers Sanath Jayasuriya (8) and Upul Tharanaga (14). Jayasuriya was dropped on one by Saqib Al Hasan at cover off Shahadat, Chamara Kapugedera (7) on five by Farhad Reza at first slip off Shahadat and Kumar Sangakkara (18) survived a run-out scare on one. But dropping Mubarak and Dilshan proved very expensive. The story could have been different had Mubarak and Dilshan been gone in the sixth over off Farhad, who saw wicketkeeper Mushfiqur drop Mubarak and Razzak drop Dilshan on 19 and 11. Mubarak stuck to the other hand to be run out in the final over while off-spinner Mahmudullah broke the fifth wicket stand bowling Dilshan out for his debut wicket. Razzak returned with three for 47 and Mahmudullah took two for 28. Shahadat, Rasel, Saqib and Farhad grabbed one wicket apiece. bd
