<TITLE> Pakistan bad dream of Iraq-style carnage comes true </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After dinner at the Islamabad Club, a private hangout for the capital's elite, a Pakistani intelligence officer leant across to confide a nightmare haunting the country's security agencies. "We fear that Pakistan could become like Iraq, with all these suicide bombings," the officer said with a lowered voice. That was in March, after a spate of attacks killed close to 45 people. Four months on, following a commando assault on a militant stronghold at a mosque in the capital, the security situation has become so bad that the officer's bad dream appears all too real. On Thursday alone, there were three suicide attacks, killing 52 people. They targeted police, the army, and engineers from China, Pakistan's most reliable and cherished regional ally. Although the Chinese escaped unhurt their police escorts died. Officials say militant soulmates of al Qaeda and the Taliban, encouraged by U.S. failings in Iraq, believe they can destabilise Pakistan, and bring down U.S. ally President Pervez Musharraf by using the same tactics as the Iraqi insurgents. Over two weeks in July, more than 180 people have been killed, mainly soldiers and police, and mostly victims of suicide bombers. To make matters worse a 10-month-old peace deal with pro-Taliban militants in the North Waziristan tribal region on the Afghan border has broken down. The carnage has come at a crucial time in Pakistan's history. Elections are due by January, and Musharraf is enduring his rockiest period since coming to power in a 1999 coup. It leaves the government with a dilemma; appeasement doesn't work, but heavy casualties could backfire too. "We are not planning to surrender. We will fight it out," a top official, who request anonymity, told Reuters on Friday. "We cannot afford to alienate the people like the U.S. government seems to have done over Iraq," he said. "We do not want things to come to such a pass that the people say: "Enough, just make peace with the mullahs, we want peace." CAREWORN, UNPREDICTABLE These days, Musharraf refers to "Talibanisation" and extremism as the greatest dangers to Pakistan. He wants a second term to defeat them and protect a legacy of economic revival and lasting peace with neighbouring India. The general can steer his own re-election through the sitting assemblies before their dissolution in November, but if polls are to be free and fair, as Washington insists, he could end up sharing power with a prime minister not of his choosing. And high-ups in the Pakistani establishment privately fear Musharraf could tire of juggling multiple crises without enough support, and simply quit. "It is a scenario that could happen, if things get out of hand, given the kind of person he is," said one senior official. Musharraf is constantly under pressure from the United States and NATO to do more to wipe out Taliban havens inside Pakistan. He is battered by widespread criticism over an attempt to oust the country's top judge. He has been frustrated by a lack of support from politicians in the ruling coalition throughout the judicial crisis. And he's frustrated by trying to engineer a deal with politicians such as ex-prime minister Benazir Bhutto, angling for a way back from exile and into power. To top it all, he's constitutionally required to quit his beloved army by the end of the year. At least, Musharraf can probably count on U.S. backing. "I guess the administration is going to stick with Musharraf all the way. It is too risky to look for alternatives ... and I would agree with them," Stephen Cohen, South Asia expert at the Brookings Institute in Washington, remarked, adding that Musharraf might not be an ideal leader, just the best available. CROSSING THE RUBICON Musharraf right now is steeling himself for fresh battles. The militants' bomb campaign began after clashes broke out between paramilitary soldiers and militant students outside Islamabad's radical Red Mosque on July 3. The government says 102 people were killed in the subsequent siege and assault on the mosque to crush a Taliban-style student movement that had attracted hard-core militants. U.S. policymakers and Pakistani liberals believe sending in the troops means General Musharraf will now have to stamp out other hotbeds of militancy, and sever closet ties with opposition Islamist parties that have obstructed his liberal agenda and maintained jihadi links. "Now, having dealt with the mosque, it's pretty much, you know, crossing a line and there's no going back," Richard Boucher, US Assistant Secretary of State, told journalists in Washington this week. Bhutto said Musharraf had finally "drawn a line in the sand". "It is the end of ambiguous policies towards terrorism," she told Britain's Daily Telegraph last week. Critics say Musharraf should have dealt swiftly with Islamist militants after joining Washington's war on terror in late 2001, but Pakistan's security agencies were compromised by ties with many of these groups and needed time to disengage. Fixated with al Qaeda, and caught up in Iraq, the United States let Musharraf soft-pedal on the Taliban and go after jihadi groups on a selective basis, because of fears an overt crackdown would spark the kind of retaliation now being se
