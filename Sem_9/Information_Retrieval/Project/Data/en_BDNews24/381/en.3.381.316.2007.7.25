<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdndews24.com)The Saudi government has asked Bangladesh to take back 267 Rohingya refugees who were arrested for travelling to the kingdom on allegedly forged Bangladeshi passports, an official said Wednesday. "The home ministry held a meeting on the issue with representatives of other related ministries," acting foreign secretary Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com by phone. Hossain said the meeting came after the Saudi government had sent a letter to the foreign office here. Officials said Bangladesh would ask its embassy in Saudi Arabia to verify the allegations against the Rohingyas of using false Bangladeshi travel documents. "The government will bring the refugees back once it is convinced," an official told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. "Bangladesh is sincere in its efforts to keep up the image of Bangladeshis working over there," said the official who attended the meeting at the home ministry. Saudi Arabia is home to about 16 lakh Bangladeshi workers. Representatives of the foreign, home, labour, expatriate welfare and overseas employment ministries joined the meeting. Bangladesh has seen a huge influx of Rohingya refugees fleeing widespread repression in Myanmar. In 1992, as many as 2.5 lakh Rohingyas fled over Myanmar's border into Bangladesh to escape persecution. More than 20,000 of them still reside in the original refugee camps near the yanmar border and about one lakh more are living illegally in the surrounding area. bdnews
