 Noakhali, July 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Friday said Bangabandhu has to be placed appropriately in textbooks. "Work on the matter is ongoing," Moeen said at a meeting with local people in Sonaimuri Model Academy in Noakhali. He said other national leaders like Bangabandhu have to be kept in the right place. His comment came amid a government move to recognise independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the "Father of the Nation" and Ziaur Rahman as the "proclaimer of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu" in textbooks for next year. The army chief Friday renamed Bagpanchra Village in the southeastern district Bir Shreshtha Ruhul Amin Nagar after Bir Shreshtha Ruhul Amin, who was born in the same village. General Moeen had earlier laid a foundation stone for Bir Shreshtha Ruhul Amin Library and Museum and planted a sapling there. Nurzahan Begum Nargis, the daughter of Amin, asked the army chief to rename Noakhali Science and Technology University after her father and he said he would consider the matter. Moeen recalled the history of the supreme sacrifice of Amin and said freedom fighters like him responded to the call of Bangabandhu to free the country in 1971. "They dreamed of a happy Bangladesh," he said. He called upon people to unite to help the dreams of freedom fighters come true. "We've to teach the future generation the glorious history of the war of liberation," he said. bdnews2
