<TITLE> Homeless in U.S. find solace in soccer </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The players in blue shirts stretching on a patch of grass in front of the U.S. Capitol could be any soccer team preparing for a match. This group is different, however. The players are homeless or have been on the streets at some point over the last year. They are members of the U.S. National Homeless Soccer Team and are preparing to travel to Copenhagen for the Homeless World Cup against similar teams from 48 other countries. Before their preparation match against the newly formed Washington homeless side, members of both squads stood in a circle on the National Mall and identified themselves. They then went through a joint warm-up session. Some, mostly older men from the Washington team, were quick to point out that they had played soccer only once or twice before. Although the national team had driven 400 miles (643.7 km) from Charlotte, North Carolina for the game, it was not really about winning. "We knew we were going to get smoked," said Washington player Eric, as he watched his much older and less experienced team concede one goal after another to the national squad whose members yelled encouragement in a mixture of Spanish and English. POSTER CHILD Eric said he had concerns about joining the team after hearing about it at the homeless shelter. The army veteran who did not want to be further identified because he had two children and was embarrassed, said he had been worried about being a "poster child" for the homeless by joining the team. Then he came to a training session and had fun. He is now one of the more energetic members, who covers a lot of ground and curses when he loses the ball. Michael Knight, 50, played for the national team at the Homeless World Cup last year in Cape Town and is the only experienced player on the Washington squad. A self-described former "criminal" who lives at a shelter, Knight said soccer gave him a sense of peace and a chance to have fun. "I'm learning to play well with others. As adults we forget how to have fun -- even if you don't win," he said. The members of the Charlotte-based national squad, wearing donated gear and staying at a church in Washington, are more serious about soccer but also want to have fun. Playing gives them a chance to forget some of their hardships. Captain Daniel Martinez from Honduras praised the coaches' efforts to help the players improve their lives and set goals for themselves. "It's a good motivation to keep you away from drugs," said Martinez, 23, who was homeless briefly after moving from New York to Charlotte. Lawrence Cann, a coach and organiser of the national programme, said if he noticed that a player had been drinking or taking drugs he would exclude him from training. "I call people out all the time," he said. "We don't tolerate any drinking or drugs at practice or in games. This is a programme to offer an opportunity to people who don't have it. You can't use drugs on our time." ANNUAL TOURNAMENT Homeless soccer follows street soccer rules, playing two seven-minute halves on a field or court that is smaller than a regulation pitch. Each team fields three players and a goalkeeper, all of whom must be at least 16 years old. About 500 players will play in the World Cup, an annual tournament launched in 2001 to help homeless people turn their lives around. Surveys after the 2006 World Cup showed that 73 percent of the players said they had taken major steps to change their lives for the better by coming off drugs and alcohol, getting jobs and places to live or even going pro in soccer. Cann said the programme put a human face on homelessness. "A lot of people think of them just as winos," he said. "When they see these guys as athletes, their situation is more understandable.
