 LONDON, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Representatives of Argentina striker Carlos Tevez on Tuesday started legal proceedings against West Ham United in a bid to settle their dispute over his proposed transfer to Manchester United. West Ham own Tevez's playing registration but his agent Kia Joorabchian says he retains the striker's economic rights and therefore is entitled to any transfer fee. Tevez's move to the Premier League champions has stalled over the question of who should be paid that fee, estimated by the British media to be worth up to 30 million pounds. World football's governing body FIFA earlier on Tuesday recommended the dispute be settled by the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). West Ham said they were happy for the matter to go to CAS but Joorabchian's companies' Media Sports Investments and Just Sports Inc later issued a High Court writ against the London club. "I can confirm that the companies have today brought High Court proceedings against West Ham United PLC. This afternoon a High Court writ was served on the football club's solicitors," lawyer Graham Shear was quoted as saying by Radio Five Live. "The companies seek the court's intervention to compel West Ham United to release the registration of Carlos Tevez in accordance with contracts entered into with the parties. "We are asking the court to intervene so that Carlos Tevez can be registered to play with Manchester United Football Club as soon as possible." HAMMERS FINED West Ham were fined 5.5 million pounds in April for breaking Premier League rules which outlaw third-party ownership when they signed Tevez last August. They were allowed to continue playing him after satisfying the Premier League that the third-party agreement with Joorabchian had been torn up. His goals in the closing weeks of the season helped West Ham win their fight against relegation. Though Tevez is keen to move to Old Trafford, West Ham refused permission for him to undergo a medical at United last week. Third-party ownership of football players is common in South America but was almost unheard of in England until Tevez and fellow Argentine Javier Mascherano joined West Ham. Mascherano has since moved to Liverpool. The Premier League, who have insisted that any deal for Tevez should be between the clubs, said FIFA's recommendation was the best approach. "The Premier League and FA are grateful to FIFA for considering this issue. We are supportive of the recommendation, that if all parties are in agreement the matter can be referred to CAS," said a Premier League spokesman
