 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Myanmar's deputy minister for foreign affairs U Kyaw Thu arrived in Dhaka Sunday. He is leading a four-member delegation to discuss trade and other issues with Bangladesh. The deputy minister landed at Zia International Airport shortly before noon and was received by foreign ministry officials and the Myanmar ambassador in Dhaka. The Myanmar team will hold talks with the Bangladesh delegation Monday at a state guesthouse, foreign ministry sources said. Direct road links, border trade, contract farming, repatriation of Rohingya refugees, maritime boundary and easing of visa process are some of the issues on agenda between the two countries. Officials said the trip aims to help resolve bilateral issues, particularly those discussed during foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury's official visit to Myanmar in April. Chowdhury had detailed talks on various issues with the Myanmar leadership during his visit. A memorandum of understanding was signed to connect Bangladesh and Myanmar through a 'friendship bridge'. Bangladesh agreed to finance a 23km road from Taungboro to Bawlibazar inside Myanmar while the remaining 120km from Bawlibazar to Kyautaw will be built by Yangon. "The Dhaka meeting will focus on the construction of the proposed road link before signing it finally during Myanmar's construction minister's scheduled visit to Dhaka on July 26," a foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh will also go ahead with a proposal to take lease of Myanmar lands for shrimp farming. The proposal was tabled during Chowdhury's visit. Repatriation of more than 21,000 Rohingya refugees to their homeland will also come up for discussion. bdn
