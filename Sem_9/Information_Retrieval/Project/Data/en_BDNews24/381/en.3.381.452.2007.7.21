<TITLE> Emeka keeps Mohammedan in the hunt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  A second-half strike from Emeka Christina powered Mohammedan Sporting Club to a lone-goal win over Brothers Union Saturday in the crucial encounter of the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The 12th win in 18 matches elevated the black and whites to the top of the 11-team table with Dhaka Abahani Limited, who also have 38 points from 17 matches. Brothers Union, who already have been thrown out of the title race, stuck to the sixth place with 23 points from 18 matches. Nigerian striker Emeka, whose lone goal led Mohammedan to beat the same rivals in their away match, once again came to the rescue of his side on the rain-socked slippery pitch, on which players of both sides could hardly play their natural game. Capitalising on a pass from compatriot Divine Chibuike, Emeka placed the ball to the far post in the 64th minute from inside the box, giving Brothers goalie Mohammad Ali no chance to react. Both teams tried to control the midfield and committed a plenty of fouls that hampered game and referee Mansoor Azad was forced to warn eight players, five from Mohammedan. However, the All-Orange outfit had better ball possession in the first half and threatened the opponents' backline. But they failed to make most of their chances with two efforts by Jalal Uddin and Elijah Obagbemiro Junior wasted. Mohammedan came close to break the deadlock twice, but the Brothers keeper spoiled a well-judged shot from Divine for a corner and an Emeka header went narrowly wide in the first half. After the breather, Mohammedan mounted heavy pressure and took control of the midfield and finally had the last laugh with the Emeka winner in the 64th minute.
