 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)Former communications minister Nazmul Huda shed tears in court Wednesday as he begged for the release of his wife Sigma Huda and proclaimed his own innocence in a Tk 2.4 crore bribery case. He took off his glasses wiping the tears from his eyes, as he claimed: "Mir Zahir Hossain, the plaintiff did give me the money, but it was not a bribe. He wanted to be a 50 percent shareholder of the newspaper." "An agreement was signed in this regard. But joint forces seized those papers with some other documents," said Huda in a statement to the court. He also claimed the papers were not included in the "seized list." The accused couple was brought from jail to the Special Judge's Court-2 at 9.30am to give statements in their defence. "She is innocent, she is intentionally accused in this case," sobbed Huda, speaking of his wife while giving his statement in Judge Amar Kumar Roy's special court. "She is only the publisher of Khoborer Antorale, not the owner of the newspaper," he claimed. "Sigma Huda is an international human rights activist. She holds a dignified designation in an world renowned organisation like the UN," Huda added. According to the case details, Huda is accused of taking Tk 2.4 crore from Mir Zahir Hossain, owner of construction firm Mir Akter Hossain Ltd and elder brother of FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain. The money was allegedly deposited in an account of the weekly newspaper, published by Sigma Huda. Sigma Huda also claimed innocence in her statement to the court. She said, "I am innocent. The charge against me is false, baseless and made-up." Assistant director of the Anticorruption Commission Md Shafikul Islam filed the case for bribery against Huda and his wife on March 11. Charges were pressed on July 5, and 40 witnesses have testified in the case since July 9. bdnews2
