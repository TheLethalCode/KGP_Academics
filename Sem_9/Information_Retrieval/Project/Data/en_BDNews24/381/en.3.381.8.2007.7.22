 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)BNP adviser ASM Hannan Shah and son Shah Rezaul Hannan were freed on bail from jail Sunday, six days after the High Court issued the order. Speaking at the prison gate Hannan said: "I was released after a due legal process, not after any negotiations." The two were released on interim bail from Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur after two months behind bars. A total of nine cases were filed against the father and son. Following an appeal, the High Court ordered a two-month interim bail for the two on July 16. However their release was postponed due to an apparent delay in the bail order reaching the district administration. "I was imprisoned with my son for two months and eight days on charges that were contrived against us. My political position is as good as before," Hannan said. Hannan and his son were arrested on May 14 by joint forces at his new DOHS home after a case was filed by Awami League leader Ruhul Amin from Kapashia. Hannan said he would decide on his future in consultation with the party chairperson. Hannan's wife Nahid Hannan and other son Shah Reazul Hannan received them at the prison gate. bdnews24.com/c
