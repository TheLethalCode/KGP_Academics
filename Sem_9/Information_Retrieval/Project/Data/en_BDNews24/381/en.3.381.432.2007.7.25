<TITLE> Asia shares slide on strong yen, US woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Wednesday with exporters such as Canon Inc. hit by the rallying yen and mounting concerns about the health of the US economy, while falling oil prices weighed on energy stocks. The yen hit a 2- month high against the dollar as investors bailed out of stocks and risky trades financed by borrowing in the Japanese currency. The rush to safety bolstered government bonds and kept gold near 11-week highs. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1 percent to a six-week low, tracking heavy losses on Wall Street, where poor results of blue chip DuPont Co. and a top mortgage lender reignited fears about the broader fall-out from the weak housing sector. "The word is 'fall' as two factors -- a rise in US stocks and a softer yen that helped the market rally -- have turned around," said Yutaka Miura, deputy manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities. Canon fell 2.2 percent, industrial robot maker Fanuc shed 2 percent and Toyota Motor Corp. fell 1.9 percent. OIL STOCKS HIT Japanese oil shares fell 4 percent led by a 5.9 percent drop in Nippon Oil Corp., the country's biggest oil refiner, on the back of falling crude prices. US crude fell 36 cents to $73.20 a barrel by 0230 GMT after it tumbled more than 2 percent on Tuesday in anticipation of a rise in US fuel stocks and after assurances from producer group OPEC it was ready to meet any shortfalls. London Brent crude eased 38 cents to $74.70 after a $1.78 loss on Tuesday. Seoul market also fell, with heavyweight Samsung Electronics down 2.1 percent. But optimism about the South Korean economy after it grew faster than expected in the second quarter helped temper the losses, with the benchmark KOSPI index down 0.4 percent. MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan dipped 0.7 percent after three consecutive record highs, with Wall Street's worst one-day drop since mid-March casting a pall over the region's markets. Hong Kong stocks fell 0.7 percent, Australian benchmark lost 1.2 percent, Taiwan stocks shed 0.5 percent and Singapore fell 0.9 percent. YEN RALLY The dollar regained some ground against the euro and hovered around $1.3812 after hitting another all-time low of $1.3853 on Tuesday. But the US currency, dogged by persistent worries about US credit market problems, sank below 120.00 yen in early Wednesday trade, its lowest level against the Japanese currency since mid-May. "The yen was the weakest currency among the euro, dollar, yen trio until recently," said Tsutomu Soma, a senior manager at Okasan Securities. "But now the dollar is clearly the weakest, with market players expecting it to fall further." Volatile share and currency markets and heightened uncertainty about the performance of the world's biggest economy have bolstered safe-haven investments. Japanese government bond futures hit a seven-week high early on Wednesday, while gold hit an 11-week high in late New York trade before coming off a bit in Asia. Analysts said investors' focus on the likely fall-out of a US housing market crisis on the world's biggest economy meant US existing home sales data due on Wednesday and new homes sales due on Thursday will be key for further market direction.
