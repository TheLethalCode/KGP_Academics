<TITLE> Tigers try to be positive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will try to be positive despite the abyssmal batting debacle in the series opener when they take on Sri Lanka in the crucial second one-dayer at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo Monday. Bangladesh, who lost the Test series 3-0 without anything to show for, slipped Friday from 45 for no loss to 56 for five to be bundled out for 164 all out. The bowlers did a great job by restricting the hosts to a moderate 234 for six at P Saravanamattu Stadium. "I am ready to accept all the blame. All the other batsmen have reasons for their dismissals but there was no excuse in my case. I can't still believe that we lost the match. What a great opportunity we spoiled," Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful was quoted by cricinfo as aying. Ashraful, however, believes the Tigers' sudden collapse was an exception and they would try to correct the mistakes. "We have lost two-three wickets too quickly after a partnership. We have to be careful about that. Look, five for 11 will not happen every day, it does not happen like that," said Ashraful, whose side had had only fielding and knocking practice Sunday. The Bangladesh skipper, however, is confident to do better and keen to take the opportunities that would come their way Monday. "We have some fantastic talents and we can lift ourselves again. "I was very pleased at the way we kept fighting in the field during the Sri Lanka innings in the first ODI. I want that spirit tomorrow (Monday) also, we have to take the opportunities that come to us. "The players need to support each other more when things are not going for them and we did that Friday. That gives me a lot of confidence going into the next match," Ashraful was quoted as saying by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). The 22-year old, however, thinks the toss could be vital in the match though the pitch looks well. "To the naked eye the pitch looks fine. The grounds staff have told me that the grass on top will be taken out by this evening. However the toss can be a factor in Sri Lanka as there is always movement available early on." The team management have pinned their hopes on the eleven that played the first one-day and Ashraful hinted there might be changes in the batting order. "Depending on the match situation we might adjust the batting order," said Ashraful. Coach Shaun Williams was optimistic about a positive outcome. "It was disappointing the way we lost the match because we were in a position to win it. But I don't want to criticise any individual player because the whole squad is disappointed by the outcome," said Williams. "We were winning until for 60 overs in the first match and then five overs changed everything. This team has the potential and if we can play quality, hard cricket for 100 overs then it is possible to get a very good result," Williams said. Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardne is eying a clean sweep in the one-day series like the Test series. "We want to have a clean sweep in the one-day series just like the Tests," said Jayawardene. bd
