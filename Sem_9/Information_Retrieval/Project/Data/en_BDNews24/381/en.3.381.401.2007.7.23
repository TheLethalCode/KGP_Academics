<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) RAB officers Monday arrested a man with alleged ties to the killing of Supreme Court lawyer Saima Khanam. A team of the elite force led by M Akbar Ali arrested Faizul Islam on Monday morning in the New Market area of the city, and presented him to a press conference at RAB-2 Headquarters in Maghbazar later in the day. Faizul's 'confession in public' added a new twist to the July 17 death of the lawyer as investigators chased leads to the incident. Faizul, who worked as an assistant accountant in the Public Works Department, said he was involved in Saima's murder because she took a total of Tk 12 lakh from him in bribes, promising him jobs. "She did not deliver on her promise, which is why I killed her," Faizul told the press conference. Faizul claimed that Saima could have provided him with a job as she had "intimate relations" with an influential state minister in the previous government. Mentioning the name of the former minister, he said advocate Saima took Tk 5 lakh from him for securing him a police sergeant's post in 2001. A year later, she demanded a further Tk 7 lakh guaranteeing him another job, Faizul alleged. Faizul said he went to the advocate's house on July 17 taking a Tk 150 bond, accompanied by three of his friends. "My intention was to get the money back or to take her signature as a proof that she owed the money to me," he said. He said he had called his friends inside her house when she refused to give the money back and threatened him with police arrest. "At one point, I stabbed her and then my friends killed her," Faizul said. The suspect lived with his family in PWD Staff Quarters in Tejgaon, as his father is also an employee of the department. Saima's father used to be their nextdoor neighbour. "I had been quite close to Saima from my boyhood. I used to call her amma. " M Akbar Ali who was present at the present conference said the RAB suspected Faizul, as his number was the last to be dialled from Saima's phone. "Faizul was also found to be absent from work for two consecutive days following the killing," the officer said. Faizul returned to work Sunday telling everyone that he had been away as he was injured by muggers. This story made him all the more suspicious, according to RAB. The elite force had tailed him for some days before arrest, Ali said. bdnews2
