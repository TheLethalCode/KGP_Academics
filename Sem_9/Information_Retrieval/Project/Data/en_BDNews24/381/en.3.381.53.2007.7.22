 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is going to interview Dav Whatmore's probable successors for the national cricket team in month-end, said a BCB official. "We are going to interview the coaches, whose names are in our short list, from July 27 or 28," said BCB general secretary Mahbub Anam emerging from an executive committee meeting at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur Saturday. "We have already short-listed three coaches, Australians Jamey Siddons and John Harmer and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton," said Anam, hoping that they would be able to appoint a coach in the first week of August. The BCB is searching for a coach after Whatmore, the Sri Lanka-born Australian who coached Bangladesh for four years from 2003 to 2007, declined to renew his contract after the India tour of Bangladesh in May this year. The meeting has also tasked a three-member committee to choose selectors as the Faruque Ahmed-led selection committee's tenure expires on July 31. "The three-member committee, composed of ASM Faruque, Afzalur Rahman Sinha and the BCB general secretary, will submit their recommendations to the board, which will give a final decision on selectors," said Anam. He added the size of the three-member selection committee might be widened due to number of age-based teams and tournaments. The meeting also decided to appoint a new physio in place of Australian Paul Close, whose tenure expires on August 8. The BCB decided to award each player of the national women cricket team Tk 50,000 for ACC Women Cricket title triumph. It also decided that Bangladesh would play a tri-nation Twenty20 tournament involving hosts Kenya and Pakistan on August 31-September 5 in Nairobi. It, however, remains to be seen whether the present BCB committee would survive as sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury earlier said the government was going to dissolve the BCB committee in the third week of this month. "We haven't been informed by the government about the [possible] dissolution of the committee. "The announcement does not hamper the activities of the board and everything is going in the right direction," said the government-appointed BCB president Abdul Aziz, who is also agriculture secretary. bdnew
