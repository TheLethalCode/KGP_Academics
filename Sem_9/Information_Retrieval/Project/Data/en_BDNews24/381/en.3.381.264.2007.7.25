 BUCHAREST, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twelve Romanians died and fire-fighters, soldiers and volunteers battled wildfires across southeastern Europe on Tuesday as a persistent heat wave broke temperature records across the Balkans. Elsewhere in the region, one man died from breathing in smoke in Macedonia and an elderly man died in scorching temperatures on the island of Corfu. Serbia battled 50 forest fires on what meteorologists predicted would be the hottest day of the year, with the temperature topping 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). In Romania, the new deaths pushed the toll from the heat wave up to 30, and 19,000 people have been admitted to hospitals in the region's second devastating hot spell this year. More than 35 people died in Romania, Turkey and Greece in June when the mercury shot up to 46 Celsius. Bucharest tried to cope with sporadic power blackouts under an increased load from air conditioners and fans. But, after forecasts of easing temperatures, health officials downgraded emergency measures from "Code Red". Forests in Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Greece have been ravaged by flames this week, blamed on record-high temperatures after the dry winter. "We hoped a Russian water-bomber would arrive in the morning, but they had to go help in Bulgaria where the situation is critical. And today will be the hottest day of the year," said Predrag Maric, chief of Serbia's police rescue department. Forest fires continued to rage across Bulgaria. Temperatures hit 44 degrees in some southern areas in what meteorologists say was the hottest year on record in the last 120 years. In Macedonia temperatures hit an all-time record of 45 degrees, and many parts of the country had no power. One man died of smoke inhalation in the southern town of Bitola and 200 were evacuated from a suburb. In Bosnia, the town of Citluk, the Adriatic port of Neum and the mountain town of Visegrad declared state of emergency. There were 18 fires burning in Serbia's Kosovo province, and police, forestry officials and soldiers from the resident NATO-led peacekeeping force KFOR battled flames. "We have ordered all fire fighters to work," said Mahir Hasani of Kosovo's Emergencies Department. "There is no day off, no holiday for anybody. We are on high alert." In Greece, a 75-year-old man died on the island of Corfu, authorities said, as temperatures touched 44 Celsius. Greece's health ministry said about seven people were diagnosed with heat stroke and were rushed to hospital. "The situation is under control and the number of patients is very small. But we are on high alert as the next few days are crucial," health ministry spokesman Panagiotis Efstathiou said. In Athens, Greeks and tourists walked with umbrellas and newspapers covering their heads. Many flocked to nearby beaches. "It's like having a sauna without having to pay, a free sauna from God," a woman shopping in Athens told Reuters TV.
