 WASHINGTON, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi security forces will need years of mentoring and support from US forces, a senior US commander said on Friday, warning against an American withdrawal before local forces can operate independently. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Walter Gaskin, commander of US troops in Iraq's vast western Anbar province, said attacks there had declined sharply over the past year. But he said Iraqi security forces still needed more experience so a US withdrawal does not allow al Qaeda to regain ground. "I see that experience happening every day, but I don't see it happening overnight," said Gaskin, speaking by video link from Iraq. "I believe it's another couple of years in order to get to that." "And that's not a political answer. That's a military answer, and what it takes to train the young men and get the leadership that they need to be able to do what the army does -- protect its borders and provide for the sovereignty of this nation, to provide assistance to what's going on as far as counterinsurgency." The United States has boosted force levels in Iraq to about 158,000 troops under a plan aimed at establishing enough security to allow progress on political benchmarks seen by Washington as critical to long-term stability. The so-called "surge" force has been in place for about a month, but Democrats and some Republicans have stepped up calls for a strategy change leading to withdrawal. Democrats note that more than 3,600 U.S. soldiers have been killed in the war, now in its fifth year. Senate Republicans, warning a troop pullout would embolden terrorists and increase the risk of attack on the United States, this week blocked a Democratic proposal to force President George W. Bush to withdraw combat troops from Iraq. Gaskin commands operations throughout Anbar province, where violence has ebbed after local Sunni Arab tribes joined together and turned against Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Anbar is now held up by US political and military officials as a sign of progress toward reconciliation throughout the country. But security improvements should not lead to a reduction in the US force in Anbar, Gaskin argued, saying that could cede gains to al Qaeda. "We've had some real major fights twice in Fallujah, once out in Al Qaim, where we have actually gone in and eliminated al Qaeda, but because of the requirement to have forces other places, we have pulled out," Gaskin said. "The key to this is having persistent presence." According to Gaskin, the number of attacks in Anbar has declined steeply from a year ago. From July 13 to July 19, 2006, Anbar saw 428 incidents, including small-arm fire, indirect fire, rocker attacks and roadside bomb attacks. In the comparable period this year -- July 12 to July 18, 2007 -- that has dropped to 98 incidents, he sa
