<TITLE> Arab ministers in Israel for land-for-peace talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian and Jordanian envoys opened the first talks in Israel over a landmark Arab land-for-peace plan on Wednesday, saying they hoped to create conditions that will lead to a Palestinian state. The one-day visit to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv was the first by representatives of the Arab League to promote the peace plan, which is meant to spur Israel to cede all occupied land in exchange for full Arab recognition of the Jewish state. "We are extending a hand of peace on behalf of the whole region to you, and we hope that we'll be able to create the momentum needed to resume fruitful and productive negotiations" between Israel, the Palestinians and Arab states, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdelelah al-Khatib said in Jerusalem. Khatib and Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit urged Israel to consider the Arab plan. "Time is of the essence," Gheit told Israeli President Shimon Peres. Gheit and Khatib also met Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ahead of talks with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Tony Blair ended his first visit as international envoy to the Middle East on Wednesday after saying he saw a "moment of opportunity" for peace. But the former British prime minister offered no specifics in public. The land-for-peace initiative offers Israel normal ties with all Arab states in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, creation of a Palestinian state and a "just solution" for Palestinian refugees. Israel sought to cast the arrival of the Egyptian and Jordanian envoys as a potential turning point in relations with the Arab League, which has long shunned the Jewish state. Arab diplomats played down the gesture. Egypt and Jordan already have full relations with Israel, and despite U.S. and Israeli appeals to expand the number of Arab participants in the talks, Saudi Arabia and other Arab League members with no formal ties to the Jewish state have refused to take part. Olmert has said he sees positive points in the Arab peace initiative. But Israel opposes the return of Palestinian refugees to their former homes in what is now the Jewish state and wants to hold on to major settlement blocs in the West Bank. Peres, whose role is largely ceremonial, was non-commital about the plan itself. "I don't think that you can achieve peace in one meeting or two meetings. But the first steps are very important and we should continue to act in goodwill," he said. The United States has been pushing Olmert to move ahead to "serious" negotiations over border issues with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who dismissed a unity coalition with Hamas last month after the Islamists seized control of Gaza. In a shift, Israeli officials said this week that Olmert was ready to start discussing in "general terms" core issues, including borders, with Abbas. But the officials made clear it was premature to start detailed final-status negotiations. Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported on Wednesday that Olmert was proposing talks with the Palestinians about "an agreement of principles" that could establish a Palestinian state. The so-called principles could include establishing a Palestinian state on some 90 percent of land in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, the newspaper said. Israel would also propose linking the West Bank to coastal Gaza with a tunnel, and a territorial exchange that would permit the Jewish state to keep major Jewish settlement blocs in the land it captured in a 1967 war, the newspaper said. Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, would neither confirm or deny the Haaretz repo
