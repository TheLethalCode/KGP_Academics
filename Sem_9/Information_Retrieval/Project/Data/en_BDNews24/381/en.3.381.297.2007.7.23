<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Pietersen said his 134 that ensured England were well placed for victory on the penultimate day of the first test against India on Sunday was the best of his nine test hundreds so far. It was Pietersen's third century in a Lord's test and although he has six test scores higher than his latest effort, other elements meant more to him, shown by the animated way in which he celebrated three figures by jumping up and down and waving his bat to the crowd. "I would probably rate that as number one," Pietersen told reporters. "The conditions were as testing as I have known in test cricket or county cricket. "You could see by my celebrations how happy I was. That was a really difficult day for batting, last night and this morning. After lunch the conditions were a bit better." Pietersen's comments were indicative of the quality bowling from Rudra Pratap Singh, who took a test best five for 59 and Zaheer Khan, who claimed four for 79. He raced from his lunch score of 62 to 103 in just 30 deliveries, dominating a crucial century partnership with Matt Prior. "I like to entertain and have fun," said Pietersen. "But setting my team up in a test match is always the most important thing to me." By the close India were 137 for three chasing 380 for victory. Pietersen defended his comments before the match that he was feeling jaded because of England's relentless schedule. He suggested that whatever state he was in, it would not impact on his performance. "Every single time I turn up for an international or a training session I am always committed and my preparations are instrumental to the way I perform," he said. "I've never shied away from work.
