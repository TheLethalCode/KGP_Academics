 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) -- An anticorruption taskforce Wednesday seized a second bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, nine days after she was arrested on extortion charges. Hasina's chauffeur Alauddin Rana drove the car (Dhaka Metro Gha 11-6364) to Dhanmondi Police Station, accompanied by taskforce members, from Sudha Sadan. Hasina's special assistant Hasan Mahmud told reporters that the taskforce members seized nothing else. "It's mysterious why the car was seized. I don't find any reason." Security forces seized Hasina's another bullet-proof car on July 16 when she was arrested at her Sudha Sadan home. Mahmud referred to the August 21 grenade attacks what he said Hasina had survived "thanks to a bullet-proof car". "That car went out of order. And Awami League leaders and activists living abroad bought Sheikh Hasina two cars with their funds," he said. Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain who went to Sudha Sadan with the taskforce members said: "Well, you can say the car was seized on suspicion. We just drove the car out of the garage. Another car had been seized earlier." The two seized cars were brought to Bangladesh in the MP quota in the name of two lawmakers who did not buy cars, said Hasina's aide Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury. The car the taskforce seized Wednesday was imported in the name of Sirajul Akbar and the car seized on July 16 was imported in the name of Zahid Ahsan Russell, he said. bdn
