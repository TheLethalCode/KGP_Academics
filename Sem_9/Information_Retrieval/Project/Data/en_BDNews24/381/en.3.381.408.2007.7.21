<TITLE> Businesses seek more time to set up ETPs </TITLE>

 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) Business leaders Saturday asked the government to extend the deadline to set up effluent treatment plants, which they said needed time. A meeting comprising business leaders of different sectors held at the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry appealed to the government for more time. The makeshift government had directed industries in March to set up the ETPs by October 31. The government instructions said the industries must establish the ETPs to effectively treat the effluents they produce. However, business leaders say that different industries require different types of ETP and accordingly they need more time to properly establish the plants. According to the Department of Environment, more than 1200 industries discharge about 35,000 cubic metres of waste that lead to serious environmental pollution and health hazards. Although Bangladesh has a low level of industrialisation, unplanned proliferation of industrial units and industrial waste flowing onto agricultural land are a cause for concern. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain said the government should extend the time limit in consultation with the stakeholders considering the gravity of the matter. He appreciated the government initiative to deal effectively with industrial effluent. Environment activists claim the soil along the rivers Buriganga in Dhaka, Shitalakhya in Narayanganj and Karnaphuli in Chittagong is severely polluted by the effluent of industries located on their banks. Mir Nasir chaired the meeting attended by BGMEA, BKMEA, BTMA and other relevant associations. bdnews
