 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) The Supreme Court Monday gave the government five more weeks to free the judiciary from the executive wing of the state. A full court hearing headed by Chief Justice Md Ruhul Amin in the morning extended the time after the government appealed for eight weeks to complete the process. The court set August 27 for hearing the case. In seeking time, attorney general Fida M Kamal explained to the court that the position of judicial magistrate had been created and approved, but the necessary financial approval had not arrived. Barrister Amirul Islam opposed the government getting more time. He argued that complications were being created on the pretext of 'appropriate authority' in implementing the decision to separate the judiciary from the administration. bdnews2
