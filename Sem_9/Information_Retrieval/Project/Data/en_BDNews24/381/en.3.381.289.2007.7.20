 RABAT, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Moroccan Islamist charged with leading a cell that plotted to overthrow the country's monarchy said on Friday the accusations were trumped up by an "apostate dictatorship". Taking the witness stand for the first time after almost a year behind bars, Hassan Khattab said he only knew a handful of the 49 other suspected members in the courtroom in Sale near the capital Rabat. "The Moroccan regime is an apostate dictatorship. But that does not mean I want to unsheath my sword," Khattab said, before launching a verbal attack on Morocco's ally the United States. "The United States is imperialist," he said. "I say to Bush we are coming to attack you. One day we will manage to wipe you out." The 50 have been behind bars since they were rounded up in swoops on five towns in August last year and charged with belonging to a terrorist cell named Ansar el Mehdi (Mehdi Partisans) that undermined public order and collected money to fund attacks. Prosecutors say they wanted to topple the monarchy that has ruled Morocco for almost five centuries and set up an Islamist state. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison. "I have nothing in connection with most of these people," said the bearded Khattab, dressed in a white tunic and turban. "Some of them were my clients when I carried out exorcisms. I treated them to remove demons from their bodies... Others were fellow members of an association, the "Life Givers", which gave lessons in the Koran and Islam. The others I do not know." The government has said the capture of Ansar el Mehdi proved the existence of an increasingly sophisticated menace to the kingdom of 30 million. The mass trial has faced numerous delays as the judge rejected requests by some of the accused to defend themselves and defence lawyers complained about cameras in the chamber. A hearing in March descended into chaos when defendants hurled abuse at the judge over the repeated delays, stated their innocence and said the charges were trumped up to please the United States. Early this month, the Interior Ministry raised its security alert level to the highest rating of "maximum", suggesting an attack by Al Qaeda-linked radical Islamists was imminent. Human rights groups have accused the Moroccan authorities of abusing the rights of arrested people. Many, they argue, were detained on unfounded suspicion of links to terrorism. The government denies any abuse and says anti-terrorism trials in Morocco are fair and respect the rights of defendan
