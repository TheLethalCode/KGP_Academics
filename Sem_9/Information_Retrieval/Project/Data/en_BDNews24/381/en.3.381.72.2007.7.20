 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina is ready to submit her wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission, her income tax lawyer Muniruzzaman said Friday. "She talked to me about the ACC's letter requesting her to submit a wealth statement, and handed over a six-page form from the Anticorruption Commission," advocate Muniruzzaman told reporters after he visited her at the sub-jail near the parliament buildings where she is being detained. Hasina was "fine," according to Muniruzzaman, who along with former AL law minister Abdul Matin Khasru were the first to be allowed to visit Hasina since she was arrested on July 16. "We will submit her wealth statement within the given time," said Muniruzzaman. On July 17, the ACC asked former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to submit their wealth statements within seven working days from notification. Hasina received the ACC directive on July 19 at the sub-jail where she is being held. Asked why lawyers are being allowed to visit Hasina when none of her relatives are permitted to visit the detained leader, deputy IG of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that it was important that she submit her wealth statement to the ACC. "Submission of a wealth statement by Hasina is urgent. That's why we have given permission for her lawyers to visit," he said. The former prime minister was arrested on charges of extortion involving Tk 3.0 crore, in a case filed by Azam J Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited. A Dhaka court ordered her detention following a hearing the same day. She is currently being detained in a sub-jail located near the parliament building where she had led both the ruling and opposition benches since 1991. bdnews24.
