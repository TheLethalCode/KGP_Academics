 Dhaka University, July 22 (bdnews24.com)- Dhaka University teachers Sunday went on a five-hour strike ending at 1pm while students joined a daylong strike enforced by Bangladesh Chhatra League to demand release of detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. "Teachers took up the abstention programme unitedly. I thank and congratulate all teachers on that score,"Professor Sadrul Amin, president of Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA), told bdnews24.com. "The caretaker government might reconsider some of its actions," he said. Regular examinations, however, are being held but the presence of students on the campus was poor. DUTA, an outfit of teachers with diverse political leanings, observed the abstention also protesting alleged harassment of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. The teachers wore black badges to classes Saturday in a symbolic protest as part of a two-day programme. DUTA Thursday called a meeting and rolled out a five-point charter of demands and proposals. In a statement issued the same day, the teachers demanded removal of law adviser Mainul Hosein from the caretaker government for making biased comments in the wake of the arrest of Hasina. A huge number of policemen and women as well as plainclothes intelligence personnel were deployed by the government to closely patrol the university area. "Our strike is not to oust or push the government in any manner. One must understand, it is only an effort to show the government how things should be handled in a crisis. "We are observing the abstention so that the government might consider amending its mistakes," former DUTA general secretary professor Md Akhtaruzzaman told bdnews24.com. Professor Harun-or-Rashid, a DUTA leader, said: "This government is breaching the constitution. According to the constitution, the aim of the caretaker government is to hold elections within 90 days of its assuming office, which they have already transgressed. "The government has to make efforts towards creating a conducive political environment and there is no alternative to democracy in this country." KM Tanimuzzaman, a second-year student of economics, said, "Our teachers have taken up the abstention programme as a token of unity and solidarity." "We are aware that it might prove harmful not to attend classes in the semester system. We hope the teachers will take compensatory classes to help us make up the loss," Billal Al Azad, a first-year student of Islamic history, said. bdnews24.
