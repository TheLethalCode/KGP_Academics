 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan (Reuters) - A roadside bomb wounded five paramilitary soldiers on patrol in Pakistan's restive North Waziristan tribal region on Monday, government officials said. Violence intensified in the region bordering Afghanistan after militants scrapped a peace deal with the government two weeks ago. The remote control bomb struck a vehicle carrying the soldiers in the Dosali area, some 40 km (25 miles) south of Miranshah, North Waziristan's main town. After the blast, a local government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, that he saw several helicopter gunships circling the area. The incident happened hours after two rocket attacks on a security post in a nearby town late on Sunday night. Pakistan's Waziristan region has long been regarded as a safe haven for al Qaeda and Taliban militants sheltered by militant ethnic Pashtun tribesmen.
