<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Myanmar moved further to striking a deal on contract farming as the two countries ended talks on a "positive note" Monday, an official said. Acting foreign secretary Touhid Hossain told reporters that Bangladesh would send a delegation to the neighbouring Southeast Asian country next week for further talks. His comment came after Myanmar's deputy minister for foreign affairs U Kyaw Thu led a four-member delegation to Monday's talks at the Padma state guesthouse. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury had detailed talks on various issues with the Myanmar leadership during his visit in April. In a statement Monday, Chowdhury said: "Foundation in developing our bilateral relations was laid during my visit to Myanmar in April. "Today we have discussed progress on a range of subjects including increased trade and need to resolve Rohingya issues finally and amicably." Officials had earlier said the trip was aimed to help resolve bilateral issues. A memorandum of understanding was signed to connect Bangladesh with Myanmar by a 'friendship bridge'. Bangladesh agreed to finance a 23km road from Taungboro to Bawlibazar inside Myanmar while the remaining 120km from Bawlibazar to Kyautaw will be built by Yangon. The foreign secretary said the Dhaka meeting focused on the construction of the proposed road link before signing it finally during Myanmar's construction minister's scheduled visit to Dhaka. A deal will be signed on July 27, he said. On the repatriation of more than 21,000 Rohingya refugees to their homeland, Hossain said they do not want to return home. "We are trying to make them change their minds," he said. Hossain said the meeting also focused on imports of gas from Myanmar. bdn
