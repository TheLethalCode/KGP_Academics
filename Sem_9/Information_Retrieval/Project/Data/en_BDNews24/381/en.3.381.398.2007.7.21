 PRISTINA, Serbia, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The West's decision to discard a UN resolution on the fate of Kosovo and pursue more talks will not stop the breakaway province's steady march to independence from Serbia, Kosovo politicians and analysts said. The United States and Europeans shelved the draft on Friday because of opposition from Russia, an ally of Serbia that has for months frustrated their efforts to steer the secession of the Albanian-majority province through the United Nations. Instead, envoys of the Contact Group on Kosovo -- the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia -- will meet next week to discuss launching another 120 days of shuttle diplomacy between Belgrade and Pristina. It is unclear whether the Contact Group -- an ad hoc body where no one country has a veto -- would then make a decision, or the issue would return to the UN Security Council as has been suggested by European Union policy chief Javier Solana. The EU, which would take over the province under the draft resolution, wants a UN mandate to avoid internal divisions. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders had anticipated that the UN would fail to reach consensus. They said they preferred UN-sanctioned independence but would not wait forever. "Taking the Kosovo process out of the United Nations and into the Contact Group is meant to unblock the process," a senior government minister told Reuters. "In the end, it will bring independence. We expect recognition from several states, and after that, the issue would come back to the United Nations with many more arguments and Kosovo would be officially recognised by the Security Council." Political analyst Dugajin Gorani said this was "the only way out from the deadlock," and noted that lack of a UN vote would not necessarily impede Kosovo's function as a state. "Kosovo will be in the same position as Taiwan," Gorani said. "By the end of this year, it will be recognised by several states, but will have to wait a long time to get a UN seat." NO RUSSIAN VETO Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million people are ethnic Albanians, has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombs forced out Serbian troops who were killing and expelling Albanians in a two-year war with guerrillas. Kosovo Albanians say they cannot be forced back into the arms of Belgrade. Serbia, which sees Kosovo as the cradle of its Orthodox faith, rejects its secession. Although the UN draft resolution did not call for Kosovo's independence, it followed several key provisions of a supervised independence plan devised by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, who negotiated with both sides for 13 months without success. Belgrade welcomed its withdrawal as a "victory". But there was also concern that the Contact Group, where Russia has no veto, would swiftly recommend independence for Kosovo. "A decision on the status of Kosovo can only be taken by institutions such as the Security Council, because only thus will it conform with international law," said Serbia's President Boris Tadic. Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku has already floated the idea of the province declaring independence on November 28. To reassure the EU, which says it needs a legally binding mandate to deploy its largest ever civilian mission, Ceku said Kosovo's parliament would vote to invite the Europeans in. bdn
