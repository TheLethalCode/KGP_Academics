<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) -- India Sunday repeated its request for a transit through Bangladesh saying it will help narrow the trade deficit between the two countries. "We are seeking a big favour. It's a concern not only for India but also for Bangladesh. We want Bangladesh to grow faster. There is no conspiracy to see Bangladesh poor and undeveloped," India's state minister for commerce Jairam Ramesh told a press conference in Dhaka. India, which has been pressing for a transit through Bangladesh to transport its commodities to its northeast region over 30 years, has yet to get clearance. "If we have a transit, it will help Bangladesh reach 14 million people in northeast India," Ramesh said. The minister said trade between Bangladesh and northeastern India takes place through "informal trade". "Let's make informal trade formal and transit will help formalise this trade," he said. Official trade between the two countries currently favours India. India exported $1,848.71 million to Bangladesh against imports of $241.96 million from Bangladesh in fiscal 2005-06. He also sought positive responses for large investment proposals such as Tata, access to Chittagong's Newmooring Container Terminal and an open land custom station on Mizoram border. The Indian minister also made a proposal to form joint venture projects with Bangladesh to deepen economic cooperation. Ramesh who joined the inauguration of Bangladesh-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry called on president Iajuddin Ahmed and foreign affairs, finance and shipping advisers. The Indian minister noted bilateral trade gap and various other trade-related issues such as non-tariff barriers, restrictions on foreign direct investment from Bangladesh for security reasons and zero-duty imports of 8 million garment items. Ramesh said Bangladeshi exporters would be able to export 8 million garment items a year if a memorandum of understanding is signed. "A MoU is now awaiting a final approval by Bangladesh. I hope it would be signed very soon," he said. It will increase Bangladesh's export earnings by $50-70 million a year, he said. The Indian minister demanded a positive response to Tata's $3 billion worth investment proposal. "Tata's investment will bring Bangladesh $1 billion due to exports of steel, urea and coal to India a year," he said. Ramesh referred to India's tariff reduction under Safta and said India will import 86 percent of Bangladesh's items without any duty from Jan 1, 2008. "We will also review our sensitive list. It will allow more Bangladesh products to enter India," he said. Ramesh said Bangladesh's exports to India are not increasing because of Bangladeshi exporters' inability to increase exportable commodities. "Our exports are increasing due to Bangladesh's dependence on a few Indian items," he said. bd
