 Ankara, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turks voted for a new parliament on Sunday to serve a five-year term, with the ruling centre-right AK Party expected to win most seats in the 550-member assembly. Here are some facts about the election: - Polling stations opened at 7 am (0400 GMT) in eastern Turkey and at 8 a.m. in western regions, including the capital Ankara and the largest city and financial centre of Istanbul. - Polling stations close at 4 pm in the east and at 5 pm (1400 GMT) in the west. - There are no exit polls and there is a ban on reporting results until 9 pm (1800 GMT) when first unofficial results are expected. The approximate number of seats won by each party should be clear by late Sunday. The High Election Board is not expected to publish official results before Friday, July 27. - Some 42.5 million Turks have the right to vote, out of a total population of 74 million. About 4 million young people will be voting in a national election for the first time. - A total of 14 political parties are contesting the election. The total number of candidates, including independents, is 7,395. - To enter parliament, a party must gain more than 10 percent of votes cast nationally. This is one of the world's highest thresholds and prevents many smaller parties being represented in the assembly. Opinion polls suggest only three parties -- the AK Party, the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) and nationalist MHP -- will enter parliament, along with at least 25 independents.
