<TITLE> Pressure on to launch movement to free Hasina: Zillur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) Grassroots activists are mounting pressure on the party to launch a movement to free Sheikh Hasina from jail, according to acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman. "Activists want to launch a movement. But I have told them it is too early to do so. We will take to the streets only in the proper context," Rahman told reporters at his Gulshan home Monday. Zillur repeated his demand for Hasina's release and said: "We are going ahead with our plan to fight a legal battle in court." He said Hasina's lawyers would decide whether they are able to appeal for bail or the quashing of charges against the former prime minister. Security forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in an extortion case, which she has rejected as false. Pressed to comment on the government's alleged reluctance to arrest leaders and activists of a certain other political party despite clear charges, Zillur said that there should not be a double standard in the country. The AL presidium member expressed hopes for Hasina's freedom. "If we get a fair trial, we'll get justice. And Sheikh Hasina will be freed." Zillur said the Awami League would not focus on party reforms while Hasina was in jail. bdnews2
