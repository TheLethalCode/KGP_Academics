 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com) -- IDC's preliminary results show that the Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) PC market totalled 14.3 million units in the second quarter of 2007, representing an 11 percent sequential growth and a 22 percent year-on-year growth. "Except for Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Taiwan, all the countries grew year-on-year," the analyst farm announced Friday saying: "Total 2Q07 shipments for the region came in five percent higher than IDC's initial forecasts." IDC director Bryan Ma said: "Portable PCs, in particular, picked up the pace again this quarter with year-on-year growth rates not seen in over a year." "Across the region, portables grew faster, thanks to retail promotions and channel fulfilment in markets like China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Vietnam. At this pace, we can expect the 2007 notebook market to clear 17 million units with ease." There were no changes to the Top 5 PC vendor rankings in 2Q07. Market leader Lenovo's strong notebook growth in China helped the vendor to achieve double-digit growth rates both sequentially and year-on-year. HP's regional market share expanded to 16 percent in large part thanks to its focus on China, while Dell held onto its third place position. Acer stayed ahead of Founder in 2Q07, as the former vendor's robust growth in portables helped it to widen the regional lead it held over the latter. bd
