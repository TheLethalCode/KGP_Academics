<TEXT>
 Nepal, July, 20 (bdnews24.com/BBC)--A 10-year-old girl who is worshipped as a living goddess in Nepal has had her title reinstated after defying tradition and visiting the US. Temple authorities at her home town say that she will not be stripped of her title because she is willing shortly to undergo a "cleansing" ceremony.

"It was a lovely opportunity for her," said Ms Whitaker. "It was a great experience when American children told Sajani about their lives and she told them about her life." Living goddesses are selected from the Buddhist Shakya family - the same caste which Buddha came from - and must follow certain rules, such as being kept in a dark room without crying.
