 Sun Jul 22, JOHANNESBURG (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former South African president FW de Klerk has been implicated by apartheid-era security officials charged with attempted murder for allegedly approving their actions, the Sunday Times weekly reported. Adriaan Vlok, former minister of law and order, and ex-police chief Johann van der Merwe, were both charged last week with the attempted murder of cleric Frank Chikane, now a trusted adviser to President Thabo Mbeki. The Sunday Times said Vlok and van der Merwe were angry that they are the only ones being held accountable for atrocities committed under white minority rule and have implicated De Klerk and his former cabinet officials in submissions to prosecutors. De Klerk was South Africa's last white president and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace prize with Nelson Mandela for fostering racial unity and securing the country's smooth transition from apartheid to the first all-race poll in 1994. Speaking on behalf of De Klerk, Dave Steward said he believed there was no truth to claims that Vlok had damning revelations to make about South Africa's last white president. "We have no reason to believe the claims are true. It does not worry us. Mr. De Klerk has nothing to hide," Steward, executive director of the FW de Klerk Foundation, told Reuters. Vlok and Van der Merwe are accused of poisoning Chikane, a high-profile anti-apartheid activist when he was general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, with toxins laced in his underwear. Chikane fell ill but survived. Three lower-ranking police officials are also charged in connection with the case, which is due to be heard in a Pretoria court on August 17. After the charges were announced last week, De Klerk said that any prosecutions of apartheid-era officials should be approached with sensitivity and even-handedness due to the possible negative impact on national reconciliation. Vlok, one of the apartheid regime's hardliners, raised eyebrows last year when he apologized and washed Chikane's feet in an apparent act of contrition. Chikane, who serves as the Director-General in Mbeki's office, accepted the apology as sincere while others doubted Vlok's change of heart. Criticized for failing to tell everything he knew about the actions of security forces, Vlok was the only former apartheid cabinet minister to testify before the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which ended its work in 2003. He received amnesty for his role in a series of bombings that targeted anti-apartheid activists. Thirteen years after the end of white minority rule, many blacks remain bitter that apartheid's worst enforcers were never prosecuted or forced to answer for their crim
