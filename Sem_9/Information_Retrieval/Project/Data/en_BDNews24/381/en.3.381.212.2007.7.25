 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com) -- A Biman flight that came from London landed at Zia International Airport about 12 hours late, because of Tuesday's bad weather, a spokesman said. The flight, BG014, scheduled to arrive in Dhaka at 8:00am did not get a clearance from the airport control tower in Dhaka to take off from Dubai airport as the rough weather battered the country, the airline's spokesman Khan Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com by phone. The flight flew from Dubai hours behind schedule but could not land at ZIA, Hossain said. It was then diverted to Chittagong but had no luck there either because of heavy rain coupled with strong wind. The flight then flew to Sylhet and landed at Osmani International Airport. After a brief stopover there, it returned to Dhaka at 8:30pm. bdnew
