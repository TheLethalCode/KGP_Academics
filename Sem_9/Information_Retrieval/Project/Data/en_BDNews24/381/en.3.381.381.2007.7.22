 ANKARA, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turks began voting for a new parliament on Sunday with the ruling centre-right AK Party widely tipped to win a fresh five-year mandate. Here are details of Turkey's leading politicians: PRIME MINISTER TAYYIP ERDOGAN - Erdogan, 53, is AK Party leader and Turkey's most popular and charismatic politician. He has presided over strong economic growth and the historic launch of European Union membership talks since becoming premier in early 2003. But he is deeply distrusted by Turkey's secular elite because of his Islamist past. A former mayor of Istanbul, he served a short jail sentence in 1999 for reading a poem deemed too Islamist at a public rally. His wife Emine wears the Muslim headscarf. A pious Muslim, the father of four is known for his love of soccer. FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAH GUL - Erdogan's loyal deputy, Gul, 56, has earned international respect as an architect of Turkey's EU membership bid. Gul was the AK Party's presidential candidate in an election in parliament which opposition parties blocked. They objected to Gul because of his Islamist past and the fact his wife wears the Muslim headscarf. Gul insists he remains his party's candidate for the top job. The new parliament will have to elect the next president. Gul has studied in Britain and speaks English. He is seen as more polished and cosmopolitan than Erdogan. CHP LEADER DENIZ BAYKAL - Baykal, who turns 69 this week, is veteran leader of the main opposition, staunchly secular Republican People's Party (CHP). Liberals accuse him of taking the centre-left party down a more nationalist path. Baykal was foreign minister in 1995-96. He studied at US universities but has been a fierce critic of US foreign policy in Iraq. In the election campaign, he has tried to depict the AK Party as bent on undermining Turkey's secular system of government and boosting the role of religion, charges Erdogan denies. MHP LEADER DEVLET BAHCELI - Bahceli, 59, is head of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and has long been active in far-right politics. The former economist moderated his tone after taking his party into a 1999-2002 coalition government. Keen to get back into parliament after failing to win seats in 2002, Bahceli has used aggressive nationalist rhetoric, calling for an army incursion into northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels there. He has also called for the restoration of the death penalty. DP LEADER MEHMET AGAR - Agar, 55, heads the conservative but secularist Democratic Party, heir to the True Path Party which served in several governments in the 1980s and 1990s. The ex-police chief was involved in the 1996 Susurluk scandal which exposed shadowy ties between lawmakers, Kurdish rebels and the criminal underworld. He has recently urged moderation in tackling the Kurdish issue. GENC PARTY LEADER CEM UZAN - Uzan set up his populist, right-wing Genc or Young Party shortly before the 2002 election and won a surprisingly strong 7.5 percent of the vote, though not enough to enter parliament. With his boyish looks and populist slogans he has attracted support especially among younger voters. He is from the wealthy but controversial Uzan family. His father and brother, accused of fraud and embezzlement, have been on the run from the law for several years. Uzan says the charges are politically motivated.
