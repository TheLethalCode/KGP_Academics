<TITLE> Seagate CEO 'stunned' by Web storage growth </TITLE>

 SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Web videos and surging Internet growth are spurring Internet demand for computer storage much faster than expected by the world's largest computer hard-disk drive maker, Seagate Technology Chief Executive Bill Watkins said on Friday. Terrorism fears are spawning demand for retaining surveillance video, Watkins said in an interview a day after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. As a result security is playing a larger role in the company's revenues. Seagate is shipping about three times as many disk drives to Internet services companies than it is to large corporate customers such as banks and insurers, he said. "I was stunned by the amount of storage going into that space," Watkins said. "This trend will continue. That's one of the things that we believe, going forward, is going to be a good source of growth."

Web search leader Google Inc, Yahoo Inc and other Internet services companies operate dozens of data centers around the world that provide the infrastructure to power Web services including online video, e-mail and Internet search. Such `server farms', as they are known, are filled with rows of computer servers, data storage and network systems, many using Seagate hardware. Google said in June that it planned to spend $600 million to build a data center in western Iowa, the latest in a network of server farms holding the hundreds of thousands of computers that run its Web services. Seagate reported on Thursday fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share before certain items of $1.01 and revenue growth of 8.5 percent to $2.74 billion, beating analysts' average estimates. On a conference call with analysts, company executives said they expected industry pricing declines to continue, but at a slower rate than in the quarter ended in June. Watkins said he expects quarterly industrywide unit shipments of hard-disk drives to increase about 15 percent sequentially, driven by demand for notebook computers and storage-demanding Internet applications such as online videos and pictures that are sent between users and devices. "Everything is being impacted by this content distribution model," Watkins said of the trend of ever-larger amounts of data being stored online. "More and more content gets moved around
