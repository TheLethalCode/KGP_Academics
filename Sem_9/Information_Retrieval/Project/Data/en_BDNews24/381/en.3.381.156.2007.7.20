 UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Europeans have decided not to call a UN Security Council vote on Kosovo's future status and instead will initiate talks between Belgrade and Pristina, Britain and the United States said on Friday. At issue is a European-American sponsored draft resolution that Moscow says will lead to Kosovo's independence from Serbia, which it opposes without Belgrade's consent. In view of Russian opposition, Britain's UN Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry told reporters before Council consultations that "there is not much point putting the resolution forward" unless Russia changed it mind at the past minute. Asked why they would not force Russia to use its veto power, Jones Parry said, "We don't want high drama which might have a consequence in the region. We have got to be responsible. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the sponsors would issue a statement later but the idea was to have the Contact Group of Balkan advisors conduct 120 days of negotiations outside of the Security Council because that "process has been blocked" in the council. The group is composed of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States and Russia but no country has veto rights. "We hope that during the course of those negotiations, the parties will come to an agreement," Khalilzad said. But no one has said what would happen after the 120 days.

Under the draft resolution, the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia would resume negotiations for 120 days. After the talks, the United Nations would hand over the administration of the province to the European Union, removing the issue from Russia's influence. NATO troops would stay on. Another way ahead was for Pristina to declare independence, ask the United Nations to leave and invite the Europeans into the province. But a unilateral declaration could lose European support. In Prisina, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku called on parliament Friday to declare unilateral independence from Serbia on Nov. 28 because of the stalemate between the West and Russia at the United Natio
