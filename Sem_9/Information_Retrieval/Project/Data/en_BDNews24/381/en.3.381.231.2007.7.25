 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) - The interim government has requested the World Bank to release funding already earmarked for the current fiscal year as well as money not yet received from last year. No additional funding is being sought, officials said Wednesday. Economic Relations Division officials said the government's opinion is that projects currently have a significantly increased capacity to absorb funds for their implementation. "If we can continue the ongoing absorption capacity we deserve to make an additional claim from them [WB], compared to the outgoing fiscal year," ERD additional secretary Shaheedul Haque told bdnews24.com. An increase in the use of funds rose markedly in the March-to-June period in the last fiscal year, with the momentum looking set to continue this year. "We demand an inflow of the shortfall between last years commitment and the disbursement we received," he said. According to the ERD, the International Development Agency (IDA), the WB's arm for soft loans, has only disbursed $363 million out of its commitment of $710 million for the FY 2006-07. In 2005- 06 the disbursement was $556 million. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam met with a top-level team from the WB at Radisson Water Garden Hotel Tuesday. Following the meeting a private television channel and some newspapers claimed that the government had sought additional funds from the WB to finance the budget deficit. Officials stressed that there have been no behind the scenes demands made for fresh funds as some media outlets had claimed. ERD officials said the adviser only asked the WB to consider the government's current absorption and project implementation capacity. A WB official, asking not to be named told bdnews24.com: "It was a brain-storming meeting for WB officials, to get them up to speed on the Bangladeshi situation." The adviser declined to comment on the issue when contacted at his planning ministry office Wednesday. The Bank has earmarked a further $852 million in the current year, for Bangladesh, according to their 4-year country assistant strategy (CAS) paper. The WB has committed to give a total of $2965.5 million between FY 2005-06 and 2008-09. ERD statistics show that Bangladesh's claim from the WB will stand at about $1.5 billion for the current fiscal year, including that in the CAS. "There is no way we can get that amount from the WB in a single fiscal year while the total disbursement by all donors hovers at an average of $1.5 billion a year," another ERD senior official told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. Senior World bank officials as well as regional and country officers represented the multi-lateral lending agency, led by Bangladesh country director Xian Zhu. bdnew
