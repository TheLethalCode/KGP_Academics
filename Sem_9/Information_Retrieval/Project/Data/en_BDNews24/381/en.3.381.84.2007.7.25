<TITLE> Australia PM turns 68, says age not election issue </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister John Howard will turn 68 on Thursday and on the eve of his birthday defended his ideas and policies for the nation's future, saying age will not be an issue at elections expected within months. But many commentators believe generational change will loom large at the election with Labor opposition leader Kevin Rudd, who is streets ahead in opinion polls, turning 50 this year. "I accept that I will be 68 tomorrow. No man or woman can mock the passage of the years," Howard told Australian television on Wednesday night. "People will judge me on the contribution I have made to the country and my capacity to continue to lead it," he said. Howard, already Australia's second-longest serving prime minister, will become the second-oldest prime minister, behind the ruling Liberal Party's founder Robert Menzies, who was 71 when he left office in 1966. But opinion polls suggest the government is headed for defeat at elections due before the end of the year, with Howard at risk of losing his own seat. The opposition says his government is out of touch on key issues such as climate change and housing affordability for young buyers. While the economy has boomed during Howard's four successive terms, living costs have also soared. Howard said Labor was trying to make age an election issue. "What really matters is the age and relevance of the policies and ideas that I put forward," he said. "I will challenge anybody from the other side of politics to argue effectively that the age and relevance of their ideas for Australia's future are superior to mine." Some commentators have suggested Howard has held on to power too long and should now hand over to his heir apparent, Treasurer Peter Costello, to give the conservatives a chance of winning a fifth straight election. Howard's mantra is he will remain prime minister as long as his party wants him and that it is in the party's best interests. Howard has won previous elections with a tough stand on security and will celebrate his 68th birthday with a lightning visit to East Timor on Thursday, where he will meet Australian peacekeepers and hold talks with President Jose-Ramos Horta. He will then visit the Indonesian island of Bali on Friday, where he is set to hold talks with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and open a hospital built in memory of the victims of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings. AGE ISSUES Over the past six months, Labor has attacked Howard's age by portraying him as old fashioned and out of touch, compared to its youthful new leader. Labor has run television and Internet ads attacking Howard for being slow to react on issues such as climate change, with Australia alongside the United States refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol or set binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Political analyst Nick Economou said attacks on Howard's age would not work, as the prime minister, who power-walks every day, still had plenty of energy. "He's still a robust man. He's a fighter," Economou, from Monash University, told Reuters. In a bid to counter perceptions he is not up with modern culture, Howard a week ago launched an environment policy on the popular youth Web site YouTube, although reaction was negative. Over the past month, the media has scrutinised every Howard slip for signs of ageing, including Howard forgetting the name of an election candidate, and tripping on a visit to a radio station, blamed on a slippery floor rather than unsteady legs. "I am not walking away from my age," said Howard. "I am fit and healthy. But it's for other people to make a judgement about the age and relevance of my ideas." The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said leaked Labor Party focus group research found voters believed Howard was "past his used-by date" and should retire, with an editorial saying the prime minister needs to overcome his age problem. "As he turns 68 this week, the PM must make a convincing argument that his age is not a barrier to his running the country as well as he ever has," the paper sa
