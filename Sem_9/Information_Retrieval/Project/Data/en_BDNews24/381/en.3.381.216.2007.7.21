 HANOI, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yuji Nakazawa blasted in the decisive spot kick to lift Japan to a 4-3 victory on penalties over Australia to reach the Asian Cup semi-finals on Saturday. The match finished 1-1 after extra time and Japan goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi saved from Harry Kewell and Lucas Neill before Nakazawa smashed home Japan's fifth penalty to send his side through. Striker John Aloisi had put the Socceroos in front in the 68th minute, pouncing from close range after Japan's defence had failed to deal with Kewell's fizzing low corner. But Japan struck back just three minutes later when Eintracht Frankfurt forward Naohiro Takahara smashed a left-foot shot in off the post for his fourth goal of the tournament. Australia's situation was further complicated when Vince Grella was controversially sent off for catching Takahara in the face with his arm in the 76th minute. Japan never took full advantage with Celtic's Shunsuke Nakamura going closest to the winner by forcing a superb reflex save from Mark Schwarzer in the last minute of extra time. But Nakazawa's successful spot kick triggered wild celebrations from the Japan players and avenged their crushing 3-1 defeat by the Socceroos at the 2006 World Cup. Japan play the winners of Sunday's quarter-final between Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan in the last four. The semi-finals take place on Wednesday
