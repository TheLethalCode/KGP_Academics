 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Heavy torrential rains and rolling waters from hills over the past week have left nearly a million people, according to an unofficial count, marooned in parts of the country, raising the spectre of a prolonged flood. Unremitting rains have flooded hundreds of acres of croplands and low-lying areas in Kurigram, Feni, Pabna, Noahkhali, Chuadanga, Chapainawabganj, and the hilly district of Bandarban. Amid a late Saturday weathercast that heavy rains will continue over next 24 hours across the country, officials feared another string of sufferings would continue to batter the people in the affected regions. Saturday was the third day of near-nonstop rain in Kurigram that saw water level in 15 rivers including Brahmaputra, Dharla and Dudhkumar rise to flood 14 villages. Swelling waters breached the dam at Thanahat union in Chilmari upazila, endangering nine villages. An official of Kurigram Water Development Board told bdnews24.com within 48 hours the water level rose by 62 cm in the Dharla river, 13 cm in Brahmaputra and 29 cm in Dudhkumar. In Feni, the river Muhuri was flowing 45 cm above the danger line, while road links between Feni and Parshuram remained under water Saturday. Darbarpur union parishad chairman Nizamuddin told bdnews24.com that 140 families took shelter at different schools in the area. An official of the local Water Development Board said the dam on the river Muhuri developed cracks at 15 points and a breach caused floods in 20 villages of the Phulgazi and Parshuram upazilas. Phulgazi upazila nirbahi officer Mohammad Ali said the local administration in cooperation with Red Crescent distributed dry food among the victims. Four days of almost continuous rain caused low-lying areas to be flooded in three upazilas of Pabna district. About 1000 acres of cropland was inundated. Heavy rain caused water logging in many parts of the district headquarters, said additional deputy commissioner of Pabna Maniklal Banik. In Noakhali, river links between Hatia and Nijhum islands remained cut off since Friday. Hatia upazila and parts of Subrnachar and Companyganj upazilas were heavily flooded, while heavy storms and downpours hit Hymechar upazila. Parts of Chuadanga district witnessed waterlogging with 5,227 hectares of cropland going under water. In Chapainawabganj, floods were also reported in low-lying areas as the water level in the rivers Padma, Mahananda, Punarbhaba and Pagla rose. Road communications between Bandarban and the rest of the country were snapped Saturday amid reports that the water level in Sangu and Matamuhuri continued to surge. About 50 hills in the district collapsed because of heavy rains, as huge chunks of mud buried many parts of the main roads that connect the district headquarters to the rest of the region. The standing waters have submerged many homes in the tiny town, residents said. bdnews24.com/c
