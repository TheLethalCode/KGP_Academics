<TITLE> AL undaunted by Hasina chargesheet: Zillur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Tuesday said his party was not daunted by the charges pressed against Sheikh Hasina. "What we are worried about is whether she would get justice or not," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home, hours after the police submitted a chargesheet against Hasina, sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim in an extortion case. The AL leader said lawyers would appeal to the High Court to quash the case against the former prime minister. "We'll battle it out in court, but the trial must take place in an open court." Zillur said his party would not accept an in-camera trial that shuts people from the courtroom during the proceedings of the case. On the chargesheet, he said: "I don't understand why Sheikh Rehana has been named in the case. She was not accused in the case. They (government) are doing whatever they want to do." Zillur ruled out any rift in the Awami League. "We're more united than ever before. We're in favour of reforms. Maybe more reform proposals will come in. But we cannot reform the party when the party chief is in jail." The AL leader demanded that the government free Hasina, arrested on July 16 in the extortion case, which she rejected as false. "We had faced worse days than this," he said. "It's not a bad day for the Awami League at all. There is a good side to the whole thing. People realised that the cases were crafted with ill intent." bdn
