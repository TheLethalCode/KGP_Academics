 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina would be allowed to see relatives she wants to in the jail, a senior jail official said Saturday. "Her relatives will be allowed to meet her in turn. We will ask her whom she wants to meet and will give permission in line with her preference," deputy inspector general, prisons, major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters Saturday afternoon. He said Hasina was keeping well. "Her blood pressure was normal. Doctors checked her health in the morning." Siddiqui said relatives could meet a prisoner once a week. But lawyers will be allowed to meet her Sunday as she was to submit her wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. Earlier two televisions were sent to the special jail in the Jatiya Sangsad premises for Hasina Saturday. Faruk Hasan, president of Awami League, Canada unit, and Dhaka City AL leader Misbahur Rahman Ratan took a 21-inch television to the jail housed in the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Hasina's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad and personal assistant Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury took another television. Deputy jailer Farruk Hasan received the televisions. Major Siddiqui said Hasina would be allowed to watch only state-run BTV. bdnews24.
