 TOKYO, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea's nuclear negotiator said on Saturday the North should be provided with light-water reactors in exchange for disabling its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, Kyodo news agency said. Kim Kye-gwan was speaking to reporters at Beijing airport after the latest round of six-party talks on dismantling its nuclear weapons programme ended the previous day without setting any new deadline. Kim also said Pyongyang would need to consider how far trust had been built before deciding whether to include details of its nuclear weapons programme in a declaration of its nuclear secrets it is required to provide in the next phase of the deal.
