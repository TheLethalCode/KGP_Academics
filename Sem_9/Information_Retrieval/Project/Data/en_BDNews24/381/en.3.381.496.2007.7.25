<TITLE> Saviola bears no grudge against Barca </TITLE>

 MADRID, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid striker Javier Saviola does not bear a grudge against former team Barcelona despite a bitter send-off by club president Joan Laporta. "I'm grateful to Barcelona, to my team mates and coaches there," the Argentine forward told sports daily Marca on Wednesday. "I was there for six years and left on good terms with everyone, that's why I was so surprised by what the president said." Laporta was upset by Saviola's decision to join Barca's arch-rivals on a free transfer earlier this month after spending most of his final season at the Nou Camp on the sidelines. "As a professional you can't criticise him, but his contribution in terms of trophies was zero," said Laporta. "I hope he has the same success as he had at Barcelona." But Saviola said Laporta's comments had not soured his view of his former team. "He (Laporta) has got his business over there in Barcelona and I'm now in a different team. I don't hold any grudges.... I will be happy to score against Barca but I will always respect them.
