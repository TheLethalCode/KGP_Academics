 Colombo, July 23 (bdnews24.com) - Sri Lanka clinched the three-match ODI series 2-0 with a match to spare when they handed a five-wicket defeat to Bangladesh in the second one-dayer at R Premadasa Stadium Monday. Tillakaratne Dilshan (20) and Jehan Mubarak (0) remained unbeaten to take the hosts to 141 for five in 31.1 overs after skittling Bangladesh to 137 in 46.5 overs. The hosts, however, survived a hiccup as they slipped to 79 for four, but Chamara Silva and Dilshan steadied the boat by putting on 57 runs for the fifth wicket. Silva pulled Mohammad Ashraful to Aftab Ahmed at deep midwicket for 36 with Sri Lanka needing only two runs to wrap up the one-day series. Syed Rasel had Mahela Jayawardene (6) caught by Aftab, who jumped to his right to take a superb catch at midwicket while Sanath Jayasuriya cut Abdur Razzak to Aftab at backward point for 24. Pacer Shahadat Hossain, who was hit by opener Upul Tharanga for three consecutive fours, gave the Tigers the first breakthrough when Thraranga edged him to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim for a 25-ball 28. Kumar Sangakkara then edged Syed Rasel to by for six to leave the side at 58 for two. After being put in to bat first, another top-order debacle saw Bangladesh bundled out for a paltry total with Jayasuriya and Lasith Malinga sharing seven wickets. Sri Lankan pacers Lasith Malinga, Farveez Maharoof and Dilhara Fernando tore the Tigers to pieces as the trio together conceded just 54 runs in overs 25 to take four key wickets in the slightly overcast conditions in Colombo. Malinga ripped took three for 22 and off-spinner Sanath Jayasuriya wrapped the hapless tails with four for 31 on way to claim 300 ODI scalps. Jayasuriya--who had scored 12,084 runs in 396 matches prior to this one--is the only player in history to have scored over 10,000 runs and taken 300 wickets. He is the ninth player in ODI history to take 300 wickets. Maharoof returned with one for 11 in eight overs with three maidens while Fernando, who had tough luck not to get wickets, gave away 21 runs in as many overs. Bangladesh never recovered after having slipped to 26 for four in 14.1 overs and though a brief resistance from Mohammad Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed briefly raised hopes of a fightback, in the end the stand just guided the visitors beyond the triple figure. The pair put on 61 runs for the fifth wicket before Ashraful cut to wicketkeeper Sangakkara off Jayasuriya for 29 after being dropped on nine by Chamara Silva at gully off Dilhara Fernando. Aftab topscored with 47 before he pulled Jayasuriya to Mahela Jayawardene at midwicket. The stroke-maker, dropped on 34 by Silva at extra cover off Fernando, hit two boundaries facing 85 balls. Saqib Al Hasan (15) was only the third Bangladesh batsman to have double-digit figures before being bowled by Malinga Bandara. Jayasuriya had Rasel caught by Jehan Mubarak to wrap up Bangladesh innings in the 46.5 overs. Tearaway Lasith Malinga had opener Shahriar Nafees (6) caught by Mahela Jayawardene at the second slip, yorked Tamim Iqbal (3) and then removed Mushfiqur (0) with Sangakkara taking a brilliant one-handed catch in successive overs to reduce the visitors to 13 for three in 7.2 overs. Bangladesh made one change to their squad with Shahadat coming in for injured Mashrafee Bin Mortaza0 Sri Lanka stuck to the squad that won the first one-dayer. Bangladesh squad: Mohammad Ashraful, Abdur Razzak, Aftab Ahmed, Farhad Reza, Javed Omar, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shahadat Hossain, Shahriar Nafees, Saqib Al Hasan, Syed Rasel, Tamim Iqbal and Tushar Imran Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene, Malinga Bandara, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando, Sanath Jayasuriya, Faveez Maharoof, Lasith Malinga, Jehan Mubarak, Kumar Sangakkara, Chamara Silva and Upul Tharanga bdnew
