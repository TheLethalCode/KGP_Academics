 Ankara, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey, a Muslim country and secular democracy seeking European Union membership, elects a new parliament on Sunday for a five-year term. Here are some of the main issues facing voters. ECONOMY - Under the centre-right AK Party government, the economy has grown by more than seven percent annually, inflation has fallen to single figures and foreign investment has soared. But the gap between haves and have-nots has widened sharply and unemployment remains high. Officially it stands at around 10 percent, but some economists believe the real figure is much higher, especially in poor rural areas. A strong lira currency and interest rates of 17.5 percent have hurt businesses and consumers. Opposition parties have criticised the sale of banks and other firms to foreign investors and complain about high government debt. SECURITY - The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), branded a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies, has stepped up attacks on military and civilian targets, especially in Turkey's impoverished, mainly Kurdish southeast. The attacks have sparked calls for a Turkish army incursion into Iraq to crush PKK rebels based there. One party leader has demanded the restoration of the death penalty to help fight the PKK. Apart from the PKK, ultra-right and far-left groups sometimes stage violent attacks. Turks also complain of a big rise in crime in the main cities. IRAQ - All Turkish political parties are critical of US policy in neighbouring Iraq, which they believe is leading towards the creation of an independent Kurdish state that could fan separatism among Turkey's own large Kurdish population. Turkey has chilly relations with the US-backed Baghdad government due to Iraq's failure to crack down on PKK rebels in the north. RELIGION - The ruling AK Party, which has Islamist roots, wants to ease restrictions on religious symbols and expression, including the Islamic headscarf. Turkey's powerful secular elite, including army generals, resist such reforms, believing they will erode the separation of state and religion. The Islamist-secularist debates have dogged the parliament's efforts to choose a successor to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a staunch secularist. The secularists have blocked the AK Party's candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a former Islamist whose wife wears the headscarf. A top priority for the new parliament will be to elect a new president. EUROPEAN UNION - Despite the launch of membership talks in 2005, Turks have turned fairly eurosceptic and the EU has not been a major issue in the campaign. No party has explicitly called for the suspension of Turkey's EU bid, but nationalists are very critical of what they see as Brussels' biased approach to Ankara on issues ranging from human rights to Cyprus. All parties oppose any concessions on Cyprus unless the EU makes good on promises to lift trade restrictions against Turkish Cypriots on the ethnically partitioned island whom Ankara backs. Many Turks also strongly resent EU criticism over the country's human rights record and continued curbs on freedom of expression.
