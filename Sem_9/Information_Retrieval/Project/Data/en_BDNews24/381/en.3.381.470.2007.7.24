 KUALA LUMPUR, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi goalkeeper Noor Sabri Abbas is delighted that the team's surprise run to the Asian Cup semi-finals has helped lift the spirits of his beleaguered compatriots back home. "As you know, the situation is critical in Iraq," Abbas told reporters on Tuesday. "We have been keeping in touch with friends and relatives and everybody is celebrating the fact that we are in the semi-finals. "They are watching on TV and getting information on the Internet and we really want to do well for the people of Iraq. "We have a really good chance to make history for Iraqi football and the whole country is behind us." Iraq meet South Korea on Wednesday, with the winner going on to face either Saudi Arabia or Japan in Sunday's final. People in Iraq have to deal with violence and bloodshed on an almost daily basis because of the continuing conflict and coach Jorvan Vieira said he hoped success at the Asian Cup would help unite the country's factions. "We all know what is happening in Iraq, but we also know that the people in Iraq love football," he said. "We can unite the people behind the team, whatever group they belong to because, at the end of the day, they are all Iraqis.
