 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Sunday said his party would back any movement to free Sheikh Hasina, but ruled out waging a joint movement with the BNP. "We are fighting a legal battle to free Sheikh Hasina. If she is freed by a legal battle, any movement will be irrelevant," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home. He welcomed the demonstration of Dhaka University teachers to protest the arrest of Hasina and 'harassment' of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. He said a steering committee and a legal-aid committee would be formed by Sunday to fight the 'false' extortion case filed against the Awami League chief. Regretting a government restriction on visitors to Hasina, Zillur said: "It's painful. I hope the government will allow relatives to visit her in jail." "Joy (Sheikh Hasina's son) wanted to come to Bangladesh with lawyers. But I asked him not to," he said. He made it clear that he was not in touch with any diplomat since he got the AL presidency. Zillur deplored the emergence of the Progressive Democratic Party despite a ban on political activity. "What is the justification of continuing a ban on political activities when a new political party is formed? We cannot hold meetings because of the ban, but a new political party comes out," said Zillur, the former LGRD minister. "Law should be applied equally". The AL presidium member alleged that the government had resorted to arresting and harassing leaders and activists of the AL and its front organisations. He demanded that the government stop such 'harassment' and release those behind bars. Zillur congratulated Pratibha Patil on her election as India's first female president. Zillur went to ZH Shikder Women's Medical College and Hospital to see ailing AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed. bdnews2
