 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange hit a new high at Tk 2.75 billion Sunday amid a surge in the shares of banks, pharmaceuticals and power companies. High turnover and price hike in the issues drove the benchmark index DGEN up. "It appears that new funds and new investors are coming in. The surge in turnover and prices indicates that the market is driven by liquidity. If new issues enter, the market will get momentum," Ziaul Haque Khondker, managing director of ICB. A credit extension facility by merchant banks and entry of new investors largely contributed to the rally in fund inflows, analysts said. In the six months to June, as many as 4,66,000 beneficiary owners accounts were opened. It is almost twice the total BOs at 2,39,000 in January-December 2006. Aggressive buying of shares of banks and power companies spiked their prices. Pharmaceutical stocks recorded a sharp gain after the ACI reported rise in its half-yearly earnings. Cement sahres also moved up. Price of general insurance stocks went up on anticipation of good regulatory regime after the approval of new insurance laws. Life insurances, however, slumped on profit-taking. Khondker, the ICB chief, said some issues have become overvalued. "Except those, the current trend in the market is okay," he said. The DGEN surged to at 2398.07, up 58.70 points or 2.50 percent over the previous day. The DSI or all-share price index added 31.93 points or 1.66 percent 1945.74. The DSE-20 blue chip index climbed 55.89 points or 2.67 percent to 2144.49. Gainers outnumbered losers at 116 to 64. Some 21 issues held steady. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied on a sharp rise in energy and pharmaceuticals stocks. Turnover on the CSE also increased to Tk 478.25 million from Tk 450.30 million Thursday. A total of 66 gained, 35 lost and six issues finished unchanged on the CSE. On the DSE, BRAC Bank emerged as the leader in turnover at Tk 213.86 million and surged 7.63 percent to Tk 966. Behind it was Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, which added 3.15 percent to Tk 605.75.
