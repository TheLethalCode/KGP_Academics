 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) - A senior army official is tipped to become president of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), run currently by agriculture secretary M Abdul Aziz as president. "Major General Sina Ibn Jamali is likely to be the BCB president," a senior official with the youth and sports ministry, who spoke in return for anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the media, said Wednesday. "A government circular naming the new BCB president is likely Wednesday. It would be declared soon if there is no declaration Wednesday," the official said. He added the government had agreed in principle to appoint Jamali to the top office of the Bangladesh's most affluent sports body. Jamali commanded the 24th Infantry Division based in Chittagong until he was transferred to Dhaka as the chief of general staff in Bangladesh Army recently. The Iajuddin Ahmed-led caretaker government appointed agriculture secretary M Abdul Aziz in the place of former BNP lawmaker Ali Asgar Loby, who resigned his post. The Fakruddin Ahmed-led emergency government's move to purge the board of politicisation has seen the back of 17 elected BCB officials including general secretary of the BCB executive committee Mahbub Anam. A National Sports Council official, speaking in return for customary anonymity, said Aziz, the makeshift BCB supreme, Thursday asked the NSC to fill out positions left vacant following the en masse resignations. bd
