 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) - The interim cabinet Saturday approved The Electoral Rolls (Amendment) Ordinance-2007 in principle to empower the Election Commission to formulate electoral laws, a spokesman said. In a meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his Tejgaon office, the cabinet also decided to scrap the section of a 1982 ordinance that had provisioned for preparing voter identity cards. Syed Fahim Munaim, press secretary to the chief adviser, in a post-meeting briefing said the cabinet approved addition of Upazila Parishad to the ordinance's local government section. The amendment will get some other new provisions including making of a new voter list with photographs and a database using digital technology, Munaim said. The commission will update the electoral roll in every January, the press secretary said, referring to the amendment. If somebody is interested to collect the copy of the voter roll, the commission will supply the names of the voters excluding the photographs, Munaim said. The commission will hang the main list in election offices and in polls centres, he said. "Since a database will be available, it will be easy to identify a voter," he said. The cabinet also approved changes to the Acid Control Act-2002. The changes will increase number of members of a central council to deal with acid crimes. The inspector general of police, law secretary and social welfare secretary will be the members of the council from now on. The government will be able to co-opt anybody in the committee, if necessary, according to the changes. The council of advisers also decided to settle a dispute with a computer company of the Netherlands over an agreement to procure computers worth about Tk 100 crore. It discussed how the government could settle the matter outside the court since a case remained pending against the government. The government earlier scrapped the deal prompting the company to sue it for compensation. The cabinet asked the Bangladeshi envoys to Belgium and the Netherlands to take the lead in ending the dispute. The government had struck the deal with the company to procure 10,388 computers for 3,382 educational institutions under a project funded partly by the Dutch government. But the government scrapped the deal after the prices of computers increased. Later, the company took the government to a Netherlands court, which is set to announce the verdict on Sept. 11. Munaim said the government wanted to settle the matter outside the court before the court verdict. He said some Tk 3 crore had already gone down the drain from the state coffers in dealing with the case. The Local Government and Cooperatives Division also presented a report on its activities before the cabinet, Munaim said. bdnews24.c
