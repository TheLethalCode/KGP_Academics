 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The establishment ministry has initiated an administrative process to reinstate an acting secretary to the Prime Minister's Office, who was removed by Khaleda Zia's government, an official said Tuesday. AHM Nurul Islam, the then acting secretary, was removed on June 3, 2004. He faced charges of plotting against the latest political regime. But the charges were not proved and the Khaleda administration used Public Servants (Retirement) Act against Islam. The law empowers the government to force a public servant into retirement after 25 years in office. Establishment secretary Abdus Salam Khan said Tuesday that his office had already sent a proposal to the law ministry to reinstate Islam. "We'll send the proposal to the chief adviser as well after getting approval from the law ministry," Khan told bdnews24.com by phone. Islam had denied the charge of conspiring against the Khaleda government and later told the media that he had been victimised. He also sought intervention from the High Court to get his job back. Islam appealed to the secretary of the establishment ministry in November last year to return him the job, sources said. bdnew
