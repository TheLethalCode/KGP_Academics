 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com) - Unidentified assailants killed an officer of the National Security Intelligence (NSI) in Mirpur late Thursday, police and family said. The body of Sheikh Atiar Rahman, deputy assistant director of the NSI in Kushtia, was found near the Nam flats at Mirpur-10 intersection, Kafrul police chief Shamsuddin Ahmed said. His family said that he could have fallen to muggers while he was on the way to his Sabujbag residence after returning from Kushtia by bus. After arriving in the capital's Kallyanpur area by a bus of Hanif Paribahan from Kushtia at around 8:00 pm, Atiar phoned his brother-in-law Golam Mostafa to say that he was coming home by a CNG-run three-wheeler. But local people found his body at around 11:00 pm at a roadside place near the Nam flats. Local people with the help of Kafrul police immediately rushed Atiar to a nearby private clinic and then to the state-run National Heart Institute at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar where doctors declared him dead. The victim had marks of injury in parts of his body including the neck, police said. Police sent the body to the morgue of Dhaka Medical College Hospital Friday for autopsy. bdnews245.com
