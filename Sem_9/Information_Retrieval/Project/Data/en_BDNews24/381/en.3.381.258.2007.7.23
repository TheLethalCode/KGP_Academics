<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Pro-reform BNP leaders harshly criticised Khaleda Zia Monday for her accusation that Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and others have "an agenda to split the BNP". The BNP chairperson accused Bhuiyan of becoming a divisive figure within the party in his role as leader of the 'reformists'. BNP adviser ZA Khan hit out at the former prime minister for saying: "I may take steps to downsize Mannan Bhuiyan." The chairperson made her remarks during a recent teleconference with BNP activists living in Australia. Khaleda also said: "Their agenda is to split the BNP. The reformists are doing this simply to hide their own past misdeeds." Khan spoke to reporters following a meeting with the BNP secretary general at his Gulshan home. "We want reform in the party to put an end to autocratic decision-making in the guise of democracy," he said. "In the past, leaders such as Professor B Chowdhury and Major (retired) Mannan were ousted from the BNP using a centralised decision making authority. "No-one should through stones in a glass house. The chairperson's comments are giving rise to concern within the party. "We want to consolidate the party's strength, which has been waning for the past five years. During this time the party has virtually detached itself from Ziaur Rahman's ideology. "How can we meet the chairperson when she calls us traitors and threatens to expel one of us? However if she invites us we must all go to her." On Khaleda's threat to expel Bhuiyan, Khan said: "The chairperson cannot decide these matters unilaterally. "Everyone in the country knows that those who are opposing us have abused their power and authority over the last five years. "We are working towards a party free from corruption." BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain told bdnews24.com: "The BNP chairperson's comment is sad and objectionable. If she wants to expel from the party those who worked hard, people won't call it a right decision." bdnews24.co
