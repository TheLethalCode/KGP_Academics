 KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq reached their first Asian Cup final on Wednesday night, beating South Korea 4-3 on penalties after an action-packed semi-final had ended goalless after extra time. Noor Sabri Abbas was Iraq's hero when he saved Korea's fourth effort from Yeom Ki-hun. After Ahmed Menajed had made it 4-3 to the West Asians, Korean Kim Jung-woo hit the post to send the Iraqi players into ecstasy. It was the vanquished side's second penalty shootout in four days, having overcome Iran 4-2 in Sunday's quarter-final after another goalless 120 minutes. Iraq will meet either Saudi Arabia or Japan in Sunday's final in Jakarta
