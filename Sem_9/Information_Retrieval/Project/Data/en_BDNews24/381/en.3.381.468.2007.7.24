 Chittagong, July 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Former vice chancellor of Chittagong University Abdul Karim died at age 79 in the port city Tuesday, his family said. The famous historian had long been suffering from old-age complications, his youngest son Syed Aminul Islam told bdnews24.com. Professor Karim was rushed to the Cardiac Care Hospital in Panchlaish after he suddenly fell sick Tuesday morning. He died at 3.00pm in hospital where he had been treated for two weeks earlier, Islam said. He was survived by his wife and two sons. His home village is in the district's Banshkhali upazila. The family will burry him in the city's Garibullah Shah Mazaar after three janazas at Baitul Falah Jam-e-Mosque, starting at 9.30am Wednesday. Professor Karim joined Dhaka University as a lecturer before he went to the UK for his PhD. In 1966, he joined Chittagong University as chairman of the Department of History. He held the post of professor emeritus in the CU history department until his death. He served as vice-chancellor of the same university in 1975-1981. Professor Karim was awarded the "Ekushey Padak" in 1995 and earned numerous awards at home and abroad for his excellence in profession. A writer of more than 100 books, Karim also researched the history of Dhaka. The teacher was a fellow of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and visiting professor of the World Spiritual University of New York. "The nation has lost a scholar," said ex-colleague and sociologist Anupam Sen. "His work on the Sultani reign is still considered a masterpiece. His works became part of the academic syllabus in many Indian universities. In fact, he was more popular in West Bengal than in Bangladesh," Sen said. President Iajuddin Ahmed phoned the family to express condolences. CU vice-chancellor Badiul Alam paid homage to the late teacher. "His death means an irreparable damage to the nation," Alam said. The CU authorities announced Wednesday a holiday to honour the late teacher. bdnews24.com/a
