 KABUL, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban movement said on Saturday it had killed one of the two German hostages it was holding after the end of its deadline, and would kill the other in less than an hour if its demands were not met. "I got information from Taliban that they shot dead one of the hostages and the second one will be killed by 1:00 pm (local time)," Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told Reuters by phone from an unknown location.
