 PARIS Fri Jul 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain and France said on Friday they would push for the UN Security Council to quickly authorise thousands of troops and police for Darfur and told Khartoum to act fast on the crisis or face more sanctions. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told a news conference they would dispatch their foreign ministers to UN headquarters in New York to pressure the council's disputing members into reaching an agreement fast. "We cannot wait another month before the resolution is passed by the United Nations and we cannot wait more months before we see action on the ground that makes the situation better today than it has been for the last few years," Brown told reporters after their first meeting since taking office. The council is considering a five-page draft resolution sponsored by Britain, France and Ghana that Sudan and several council members say contains too many references to humanitarian and other issues, including a threat of "further measures" if any of the parties "fail to fulfill their commitments or cooperate fully". Without the resolution, which would authorise up to 26,000 troops and police from the African Union and United Nations, U.N. member states will not commit personnel to Sudan's violent Darfur region. Estimated to cost more than $2 billion in the first year, the operation is an effort to quell violence in the western Sudanese region where more than 2.1 million people have been driven from their homes and an estimated 200,000 have died. The violence flared after mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in 2003, accusing Sudan's government of neglecting the remote, arid western region. Khartoum mobilized brutal Janjaweed militias to quell the revolt. Khartoum denies supporting them, and puts the death toll at 9,000. Brown and Sarkozy said they were prepared to go to Darfur after the resolution was passed to speak to the people involved and to monitor progress in the peace process. Brown added that Paris and London would work for an immediate ceasefire. "We are even ready, if the resolution were voted, to go to Darfur, Chad and Sudan together," Sarkozy said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said there was a "successful" first round of talks with international envoys in Tripoli, Libya, on Sunday in an effort to get a dozen splintered rebel groups to come to peace talks with the government. "We will be prepared to contribute substantial sums in economic support as soon as a ceasefire makes it possible for us to make possible economic development in that area," Brown said. He added that he and Sarkozy would keep a close eye on Khartoum to ensure it was taking the steps necessary to ease the suffering of Darfur's people. "We will be strong in saying that unless action is taken we will be prepared to consider as individual countries a toughening up of sanctions that will put pressure on the regime to make the changes that are necessary," Brown said. Sarkozy said the pair would lobby other key players, such as Sudan's ally China, to ensure action was taken quickly. "That is what we are trying to do -- mobilize energies as far as the Chinese to obtain results. We cannot guarantee success. But what Gordon and I guarantee is that we are determined to shake up the system," the French president
