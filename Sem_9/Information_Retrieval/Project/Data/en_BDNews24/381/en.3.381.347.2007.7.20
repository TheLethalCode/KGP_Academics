 Barisal, July 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein Friday said all people tied to corruption could not be brought to justice even in five years. "Corruption pervaded every sphere of society. If all corrupt people are brought to justice, no citizens will be spared," Mainul said in a meeting with reporters at Barisal Press Club. He said the interim government was not wiling to prolong the emergency, which he said might put the roles of army in question. "Actions are taken only against those with specific charges," the adviser said, when asked why the names of some former ministers were not on the Anticorruption Commission's list of graft suspects. He said the government had no hand in the arrest of Sheikh Hasina. "Police can arrest somebody once a case is filed," he said. The investigation officer for the extortion case against Hasina felt the accused should be arrested for making a chargesheet, he said. Asked about the government's stance on reformist politicians with suspected graft links, Mainul said if the society could be freed from corruption, a handful of people would turn out to be honest. bdnews2
