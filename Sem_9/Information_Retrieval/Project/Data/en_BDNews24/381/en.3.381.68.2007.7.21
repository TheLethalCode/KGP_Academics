<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Concerned about the trial process of Sheikh Hasina, the Awami League is forming a "Legal Aid Committee" in a day or two to provide her assistance in an extortion case. "The leader has expressed scepticism about a fair trial. We are also concerned. So a 'Legal Aid Committee' will be formed in a day or two to extend legal assistance to Sheikh Hasina," acting AL president Zillur Rahman Saturday said, Speaking to reporters at his Gulshan home, he again said the party has risen over squabbles and rifts and the leaders have closed their ranks in the wake of the arrest of the party supremo. "All of us are now united for her freedom," he said and urged the government to release Hasina with honour. "We are against corruption. But the party president has been arrested on charges of corruption. We request the government to right the wrong if it believes it has made." He welcomed the army chief's statement that Bangabandhu would be given the right honour in the textbooks. "Truth cannot be hidden with lies. The government and the army chief have made the right evaluation of Bangabandhu. We thank them for the initiative." Members of the AL council of advisers Shawkat Ali and Subid Ali Bhuiyan, acting general secretary Mukul Bose and health affairs secretary Dr Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin met Zillur Saturday. Later Mukul Bose told journalists, "The jail authorities did not allow the party president's relatives to see her. This is inhuman and sad. "We are disturbed at the incident. We want immediate release of Sheikh Hasina." Mukul said the ongoing reform process has stalled with the arrest of the party president and would take place in presence of Hasina. He said Zillur asked him to take up programmes on August 15, the day independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated with much of his family. Mukul said the acting chief would talk to the party leaders and workers in the afternoon every afternoon to get their views on the programmes and has already been in touch with Tofail Ahmed who was ill.. Zillur has directed Mukul Bose to write to the Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner in a day or two for permission for the programme and destitute feeding on August 15. Mukul said the government had allowed the BNP to observe the death anniversary of former president Ziaur Rahman on a limited scale and hoped it would also allow them. bdnews24.
