<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  The police Tuesday pressed extortion charges against Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque filed the chargesheet with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka in a Tk 3 crore case filed by Azam J Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited, on June 13. Azam filed the case against Hasina and Selim, but Rehana was implicated in it later by the investigating officer of the case. Metropolitan magistrate Shamsul Alam accepted the chargesheet and set the next date for hearing the case for Aug 15. The home ministry on July 16 brought the case under emergency powers rules, which means that lawyers cannot seek bail for the accused from the trial court. In line with the emergency rules, the court has to complete the trial of the case in 45 days from the day charges are framed against the accused. Security forces arrested the former prime minister at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 and a Dhaka court sent her to jail the same day. Selim, also Awami League presidium member, arrested at his Banani home on May 29, is also in jail. Rehana lives in London. Rehana told bdnews24.com by phone from the US that the case and formal charges were designed to "harass" them. "The caretaker government is not abiding by the law and running affairs following an adage that might is right," she said. In instant reaction, Hasina's lawyer Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com that the charges were pressed in a hurry. "It all shows that the emergency government is no different from the past partisan government," he said. "Everything was designed to stop us appealing to the High Court for quashment of the case." The 59-year-old former prime minister who has been running up against a rash of cases was virtually besieged at home before she was arrested. The CMM's Court on June 14 asked police and the immigration to stop Hasina going abroad for the sake of investigation into two extortion cases against her. She was scheduled to fly to the US on June 15 to see her relatives. Hasina was charged with murder on April 11 while she was in the United States. On April 22, a Dhaka court issued an order to arrest Hasina in a murder case filed by a Jamaat-e-Islami leader. The murder case involves the deaths of four protesters belonging to BNP ally Jamaat-e-Islami in an Oct 28 political riot in Dhaka in 2006. On April 9, Tajul Islam Faruk from Habiganj filed a Tk 3 crore extortion case against her. On June 13, businessman Noor Ali filed a Tk 5 crore case with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina and Selim. bdnews24.com/pb/ahd/ad/1631 hours bdnews
