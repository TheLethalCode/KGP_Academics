<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actress Lindsay Lohan, wearing an alcohol-monitoring bracelet from her last stint in rehab, was arrested for the second time in a month on Tuesday, accused of drunken driving and drug possession after a bizarre, predawn car chase, police said. The 21-year-old performer, who stars as a stripper abducted by a sadistic killer in her latest film, 'I Know Who Killed Me,' which opens on Friday, already faces a drunken-driving charge following a car crash in Beverly Hills two months ago. She was taken into custody in the coastal city of Santa Monica about 1:30 a.m. and was released from jail after posting $25,000 bond, according to police. She is due back in court for arraignment in both cases on August 24. Lohan's lawyer issued a statement hours later saying the actress had suffered a relapse and she was 'presently receiving medical care.' Her apparent return to rehab forced the cancellation of a planned guest television appearance Tuesday on NBC's 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,' where she was to have promoted her new movie, a spokeswoman for the show said. Shooting on her next film, 'Poor Things,' starring and produced by Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine, has been delayed since late May to accommodate Lohan's substance abuse treatment, a source close to the production told Reuters. Police said they encountered the actress in a parking lot after the mother of Lohan's personal assistant called them on her cell phone to report she was being pursued by Lohan in an automobile. Police Lt Alex Padilla said at a news conference the assistant had just quit her job hours earlier. 'AFRAID' OF LOHAN "(Lohan) was trying to catch the mother of her personal assistant. Why she was trying to catch her, we don't know," Padilla said. "The mother was afraid. ... She called the police because she wanted to make sure everything would be OK." Padilla said Lohan was accompanied in her sports utility vehicle by two friends, who were questioned and released. Lohan was detained after failing a field sobriety test. Police said she later registered a blood-alcohol level of about 0.12 percent, well above the California limit of 0.08. The actress was booked on suspicion of drunken driving, cocaine possession, bringing a controlled substance into custody and driving on a suspended license. Padilla said a small amount of cocaine was found in her pants pocket during the booking process. Just last Friday, Lohan turned herself in to Beverly Hills police to face charges of drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident in connection with a May 26 car crash. In that case, she lost control of her Mercedes-Benz sports car, drove into a hedge, then left the scene. At the time, police said they found a small amount of what they believed was cocaine in the car. The crash in May led Lohan to check herself into a rehab center for the second time in a year. She left earlier this month after 45 days and was wearing an alcohol-monitoring bracelet on a voluntary basis, her spokeswoman said. Padilla said she was still wearing the ankle bracelet when arrested on Tuesday morning. "Unfortunately, late yesterday, I was informed that Lindsay had relapsed," her attorney, Blair Berk, said in a statement. "The bracelet has now been removed. She is safe, out of custody and presently receiving medical care." Meanwhile, producers of 'Poor Things' said they planned to announce "details on a start date for movie in the very near future." There was no immediate word on whether Lohan would remain in the ca
