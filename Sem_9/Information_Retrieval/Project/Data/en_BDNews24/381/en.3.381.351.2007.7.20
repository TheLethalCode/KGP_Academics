 ISLAMABAD, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber rammed a paramilitary checkpost killing four people in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal region on Friday, the latest attack in a wave of violence sweeping the country in recent weeks. "Four people including a paramilitary soldier and three civilians have been killed," a security official told Reuters. Six people, including three civilians, were wounded, he added. A wave of bomb attacks has swept across Pakistan, killing more than 180 people, since the army's siege and assault earlier this month on the Lal Masjid or Red Mosque complex, a militant stronghold in the capital, Islamabad. While militants are believed to be avenging the mosque assault, pro-Taliban fighters have abandoned a peace pact in North Waziristan, adding to concern over a deteriorating security situation in the volatile northwest.
