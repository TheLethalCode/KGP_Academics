 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  The police have formed a three-member committee to probe the alleged maltreatment of Sheikh Hasina during her arrest on July 16, the country's police chief said Monday. Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told bdnews24.com: "A committee was formed to probe the allegations. Nobody complained to me. I did it myself." Additional police commissioner for Dhaka Moniruzzaman is leading the probe team, which has been asked to turn in its report in four days from the day it was formed. Two other members of the committee are assistant inspector general of police Zahirul Islam and deputy police commissioner Abdul Malek. Hasina's lawyers raised allegations of maltreating Hasina when she was taken to court after arrest from her Sudha Sadan home. Hasina's lawyer Abdul Matin Khasru visiting her in the special jail in the Sangsad Bhaban complex Friday claimed that she had complained of maltreatment during the arrest. The media ran pictures of the former prime minister being mobbed by scores of security officers and hundreds of her adherents in an apparent security breach. In a statement, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said Hasina deserved better as former prime minister than what happened to her. bd
