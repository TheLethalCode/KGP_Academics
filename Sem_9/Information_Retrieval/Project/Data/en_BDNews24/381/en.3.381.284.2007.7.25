<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Adviser MA Matin Wednesday said the caretaker government did not take any laidback approach to deal with Jamaat-e-Islami leaders and activists with suspected corruption ties. The chairman of the national coordination committee on serious crime responded to a question on why Jamaat leaders or activists were not arrested in the ongoing anticorruption drive. "Well, questions surfaced over the issue. It just may be that Jamaat leaders were not involved in corruption," he said. Matin, also communications adviser, told reporters in his office that the government was determined to hold elections by 2008 and took measures to prevent corrupt people participating in the polls. "I don't see any difference between a reformist and the one who is not when it comes to corruption. "We'll find out people who have allegations of corruption against them and step up their trial in the court of law," Matin said when asked to comment on reforms and reformists. Asked whether the anticorruption taskforce would investigate wealth of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the adviser said: "I know the Anticorruption Commission served notices on them. The taskforce will conduct investigations if the ACC asks for help." bdnews24.com/mk
