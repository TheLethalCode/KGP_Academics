 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Monday reissued warrants of arrest against former BNP minister Shajahan Siraj, wife Rabeya Haider and their son Rajib Siraj Apu in 11 separate tax-dodging cases. Dhaka senior special judge Md Azizul Haque first issued the arrest warrants against the three after the National Board of Revenue filed the cases on July 16. The court Monday reissued the arrest warrants and ordered authorities to attach their property as the police failed to arrest them in line with the earlier court order. The police have been instructed to file a report on the warrants on July 29, according to the court order. bdnew
