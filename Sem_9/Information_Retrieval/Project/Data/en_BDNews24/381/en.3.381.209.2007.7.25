 LIMA, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former midfielder Jose del Solar was named as the new coach of Peru on Tuesday, replacing Julio Cesar Uribe who was fired last week after four months in the job. The appointment was announced by Peruvian federation director Juvenal Silva in a radio interview from Chile, where Del Solar, 39, currently coaches Universidad Catolica. "We had a meeting to fine-tune the details," Silva told the RPP radio station. "We agreed that the task is to qualify Peru for the next World Cup." Del Solar, who became Peru's fifth coach in the last three years after Paulo Autuori, Freddy Ternero, Franco Navarro and Uribe, played for a number of clubs including Universitario in his homeland and Tenerife and Valencia in Spain. He was also a regular for Peru for several years. He began his coaching career with Sporting Cristal in Lima before joining Universidad Catolica. Uribe was fired after Peru lost 4-0 to Argentina in the quarter-finals of the Copa America in Venezuela earlier this month. His second stint in the job lasted only seven games and produced two wins, one draw and four defeats. After his first game in charge, a 2-0 defeat away to Japan, Uribe was fined 30 percent of a month's wages for going to a nightclub after the match. Peru, once a force in South American football, have not qualified for the World Cup since 1982
