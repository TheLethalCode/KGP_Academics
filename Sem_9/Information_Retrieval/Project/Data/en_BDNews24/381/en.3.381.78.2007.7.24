 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  The student front of the Awami League Tuesday renewed their demand for Sheikh Hasina's freedom and burned an effigy of the law adviser in protest at his remarks over the arrest. A bdnews24.com correspondent came across 15-20 Chhatra League activists of the Dhaka University burning Mainul Hosein's effigy and chanting slogans at 9:45am in front of the Institute of Social Welfare and Research. Some DU Chhatra League leaders set alight the effigy. They, however, left the scene immediately apparently to evade police and intelligence officers in plainclothes. Police had no clue. "We don't know anything about the incident," Shahbagh sub-inspector Morshedul Islam told bdnews24.com. Despite heightened security on the campus, the officials knew nothing one and a half hours into the incident. The student front's university chapter president Sheikh Sohel Rana admitted the incident. "Our protest will continue," he told bdnews24.com. The AL's student wing has called for protests in the district headquarters across the country Tuesday. Some recent comments by the law adviser over Hasina's arrest sparked a wave of criticism among Awami League adherents. The Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA) Thursday announced their protest plans despite reported pressure from authorities. The teachers Saturday wore black badges to classes to condemn the arrest of the former prime minister and abstained from work for five hours Sunday. The Chhatra League also enforced a daylong strike at the university to demand immediate release of the leader. bdnews24.co
