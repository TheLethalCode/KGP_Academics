 RAMALLAH, West Bank, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tony Blair said on Tuesday he saw "a sense of possibility" in the Middle East in his first visit to the region as an international envoy but cautioned against expecting any peace breakthrough soon. The Quartet of peace brokers -- the United States, European Union, United Nations and Russia -- has asked the British former prime minister to present in September an initial plan for building ruling institutions for a future Palestinian state. Blair, in his first public remarks since starting his mission on Monday, said he came "to listen, to learn and to reflect" in preliminary talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. "I think that even from the conversations I've had there is a sense of possibility," Blair told a news conference after meeting Israeli President Shimon Peres. "But whether that sense of possibility can be translated into something -- that is something that needs to be worked at and thought about over time," he said. Blair held talks later with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose secular Fatah faction lost control of Gaza to Hamas Islamists in fighting last month. Blair ends his visit with a private meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Diplomats said Blair's limited mandate could expand later into a more direct peacemaking role, an idea backed by Abbas's aides. Many Israeli officials are cool to the prospect. "The mandate of Prime Minister Blair is motivated and generated by the objectives and not by the verbal mandate that he's given," said Abbas aide Saeb Erekat, in an apparent allusion to the goals of peace and Palestinian statehood. Peres, a Nobel Peace laureate, hinted at a political mandate for the 54-year-old Blair, credited with successful peacemaking in Northern Ireland. "He has on the one hand to see what can be done to advance the political matter and the economic affairs and to permit the Palestinians to build political institutions," said Peres, whose post is largely ceremonial. "WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY" Peres, 83, said Blair faced "one of the most responsible and demanding tasks of his career" and there was "a real chance for his success". "I think there is a serious window of opportunity to advance peace," Peres said. "I don't know the duration of this opportunity. I'm afraid it's not too long." Hamas, which has spurned international demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and accept existing interim peace agreements, has said Blair must deal with the Islamic movement and avoid "double standards". Blair shunned the group during the visit. Nabil Abu Rdainah, another Abbas aide, said the Palestinians hoped to take advantage of Blair's personal relationship with US and Israeli leaders. "If that is going to help our political horizon, that would be good," Abu Rdainah said. Blair was due to wrap up the visit to Israel and the West Bank on Wednesday and then travel to Gulf states. He plans to return to the region on September 1, Erekat said, before attending a Quartet meeting and a Middle East conferen
