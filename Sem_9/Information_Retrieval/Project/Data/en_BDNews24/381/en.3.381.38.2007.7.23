 ISLAMABAD, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leaders cranked up pressure on President Pervez Musharraf on Monday, after doubts were cast over his re-election plans by the Supreme Court's reinstatement of a judge seen as a symbol of resistance. The head of the opposition Islamist alliance resigned from the National Assembly in protest against "one man rule", marking a decisive break in the so-called military-mullah alliance that had helped General Musharraf consolidate power after taking over in a coup eight years ago. Qazi Hussain Ahmed said the gap between the people and army had been widened by military operations in trouble spots round the country, including the siege and storming of Islamabad's Red Mosque earlier this month to crush a Taliban style movement. At least 102 people were killed in the Red Mosque operation, while Islamist militants have killed more than 180, mostly police and soldiers, in revenge attacks often using suicide bombers. Musharraf has said he has no intention of imposing a state of emergency, though rivals fear he might use the deteriorating security situation to justify the measure and extend his own rule. The All Parties Democratic Movement (APDM), which groups major opposition parties except ex-premier Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), announced on Monday it would launch a nationwide anti-Musharraf campaign from August 9. Bhutto, whose PPP is the most liberal of Pakistan's mainstream parties, said she would strike a deal to help Musharraf get re-elected only if it ensured fair parliamentary elections were held on time, according to Britain's Sunday Times newspaper. In further fallout from Friday's Supreme Court decision to reinstate the chief justice after over four months of suspension, the government's top lawyer, Attorney-General Makhdoom Ali Khan, has resigned, a senior official said. U.S. ally Musharraf controversially aims to be re-elected by the current assemblies in September or October, but is going through his rockiest period in power. He is also constitutionally obliged to give up his role as army chief by the year-end, while parliamentary elections are expected by December or January. INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY There are fears in government that Supreme Court judges, having asserted the independence of the judiciary by restoring the chief justice, could allow constitutional challenges to Musharraf's re-election, resulting in a political gridlock. The opposition is expected to challenge Musharraf's right to get elected by the same assemblies, and while still army chief. "Now, efforts are being made to prolong military rule through parliament," Ahmed, president of the six-party Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), wrote in his resignation letter. "In this situation, my considered opinion is that keeping my seat would be unfair to the mandate of representing people in these institutions." Musharraf can get elected by a simple majority in the national and provincial assemblies, but a walk-out by the opposition would undermine his legitimacy. Bhutto, whose PPP is the single largest opposition party, has been in talks with Musharraf's emissaries for months, however, about the possibility of reaching a power-sharing deal. She said Musharraf was weakened by the Supreme Court's decision, and allying with him could cost her votes. "He has lost his moral authority. His popularity rates are down and it would be very unpopular if we saved him," Bhutto told the British Sunday newspaper. It reported that "the only circumstances in which she might still consider an arrangement would be if she felt it was necessary to guarantee fair parliamentary elections on time". Some analysts believed, however, that this was probably posturing and a deal remained highly likely. Bhutto has said before that the combination of herself and Musharraf could turn a rising Islamist tide in Pakistan. She told the newspaper she could come back as early as September to end almost a decade living in self-exile. She wants graft charges against her withdrawn as part of any de
