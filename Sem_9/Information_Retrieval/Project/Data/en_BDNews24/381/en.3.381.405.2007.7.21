 Islamabad, July 21 (bdnews24.com/BBC) - Musharraf 'respects' court ruling Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has said he will fully accept a court decision to reinstate the country's chief justice. Iftikhar Chaudhry was suspended by the president in March amid claims of corruption, but the Supreme Court on Friday quashed all charges. Mr Chaudhry has now become a focus of opposition to Gen Musharraf. Gen Musharraf, who seized power in 1999, is facing mounting criticism of his rule and a wave of violence.

But critics say the government has not shown similar zeal in pursuing more serious charges - such as financial embezzlement and property fraud - against other top judges. They have been accusing the president of plotting to remove an independent-minded judge to forestall legal challenges to his plan to ask parliament for another five-year term in office. Mr Chaudhry's suspension in March triggered mass protests. He has become a highly controversial figure in recent months as he has toured the country. Although he has not directly criticised Gen Musharraf, his campaign road show has definitely taken on the feel of a political campaign, the BBC's Dan Isaacs in Islamabad says.
