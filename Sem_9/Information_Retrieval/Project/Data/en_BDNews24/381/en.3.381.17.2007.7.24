<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina will seek more time to submit her wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission, her lawyer said Tuesday. The wealth statement has been prepared for Hasina to sign, income tax lawyer Khondoker Muniruzzaman said, after visiting the detained former prime minister in the special jail in the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Muniruzzaman said Hasina was handed a letter seeking an extension of the deadline by seven days to turn in the statement to the graft watchdog. The lawyer said Hasina would send the letter to the ACC through jail authorities after signing it. Muniruzzaman quoted Hasina as saying she had been surprised to know that her sister Sheikh Rehana was charged in the same extortion case she had been arrested for. "Why was she charged? She was not in Bangladesh at the time," Hasina was quoted by Muniruzzaman as saying. On Tuesday, relatives of Hasina waited for hours in the Jatiya Sangsad area but were not allowed to visit her. The jail authorities however accepted their offerings for Hasina. Police set up a temporary box on the Jatiya Sangsad premises to receive applications from those wishing to visit Hasina in jail. The box was open for two hours from midday. The former prime minister was arrested on July 16 and is being detained in the special jail. bdnew
