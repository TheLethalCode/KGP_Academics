<TITLE> Govt mulls operator for Biman: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  The government will soon float an international tender inviting a private operator to run Biman Bangladesh Airlines, an adviser said Wednesday. "The operator will find ways and give advice to the civil aviation ministry to turn Biman into a profitable company," civil aviation adviser MA Matin told reporters. The move to find a private operator for the loss-making national airline came after its corporate body, Bangladesh Biman Corporation, became a public limited company with a new name, Biman Bangladesh Airlines Limited. "To make Biman profitable, we need more aircraft. Even if we make orders for more planes, we won't get them before 2012," he said. The government has plans to lease planes to keep flights up and running on some routes in a stopgap measure, Matin said. Matin, who is also communications adviser, said Bangladesh and Myanmar would sign a road agreement Friday. The adviser will sign the deal on behalf of Bangladesh and Myanmar minister for construction Major General Saw Tun will represent his country. A 25km road that will cost Tk 141 crore will connect Bangladesh with its closest neighbour in Southeast Asia. The deal will open a broader path for Bangladesh to get connected with Thailand and Malaysia by road. bd
