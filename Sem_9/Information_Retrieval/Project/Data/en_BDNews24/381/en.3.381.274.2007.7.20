<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahajote (BJHM) Friday demanded that the BNP champion the Hindu community's demand for 50 seats in parliament for its members. A 20-member BJHM delegation met BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan in the morning at his home and placed the demand. "We have claimed 50 parliament seats from the BNP secretary general. The Awami League has used the Hindus in the past, without offering any special privileges to the community," BJHM adviser Gobinda Anil Dey said to reporters after their meeting. "We welcome Mannan Bhuiyan's reform proposal as a 'revolutionary and positive' gesture against the current backdrop." Former student leader Suranjan Ghosh told bdnewsd24.com,"We want the political trends to change. We expect that the secular BNP secretary general will uphold our legitimate demand." Other members of the delegation included Gobinda Pramanik, Manoj Kumar Mandal, Anil Dey, Gouranga Lal Mandal, Gopal Chandra Mistri, Uttam Saha and Kartik Mandal. Another 30 student leaders led by Dhaka University Chhatra Dal international affairs secretary Sayyid Iqbal Titu met the BNP secretary general. The student leaders said they had discussed the proposed reforms with Bhuiyan. As usual, BNP lawmakers and district level leaders from Bogra, Sirajganj, Madaripur, Faridpur, Noakhali, Sunamganj and other places came to meet Bhuiyan at his home Friday. bdnew
