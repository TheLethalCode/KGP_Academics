<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) general secretary Mahbub Anam resigned Tuesday apparently under pressure from the government which has vowed to purge the country's wealthiest sporting body of politicisation. Anam, however, cited his intention "to help the government reform the board" as the reason for stepping aside after being in the key position for two years. Later, at a news conference, he said 10 other BCB officials had followed suit and turned in their resignation letters. When asked if they had resigned under pressure from the makeshift government, one of the BCB executives who resigned on condition of anonymity said, "You are smart guys, so you should have to understand it." Sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury last month told the media that the government was going to dissolve the BCB committee in the third week of July to depoliticise the board. Chowdhury in an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com early this month said, "There are so many allegations against the cricket board, whose members tour abroad at the board's expense." "Besides, there is a question about different commercial contracts they have signed," he added. Anam tendered his resignation to BCB president M Abdul Aziz, who is the agriculture secretary, at his ministry. The president accepted his resignation. "He (Mahbub) has mentioned in his resignation letter that he has stepped down to help the government reform the cricket board," Aziz told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Anam met the sports adviser at the Bangladesh Secretariat before he submitted the resignation, BCB sources said. National Sports Council (NSC) secretary Aminul Islam Khan said they would form an ad-hoc committee Wednesday if all the members resigned Tuesday. Islam said the size of the committee would not go beyond 15 members. Anam later called the other BCB officials to an emergency meeting at the Dhaka Club. Officials present at the meeting also agreed to resign following in the footsteps of the general secretary. They are vice-presidents Shah Nurul Kabir Shaheen and Aziz Al Kaiser, joint-secretaries Reazuddin Al Mamun and Rafiqul Islam and treasurer Afzalur Rahman, members ASM Faruque, Sailab Hossain Tutul, Mohiuddin Bulbul, Quaiyum Chowdhury and Syed Farhad Ahmed. "The talk of a reform in the BCB is being discussed for a few days and we have agreed on the reform which is what the government wants and we have decided to step aside to help the government," Anam told reporters emerging from the meeting. "Members outside Dhaka have started faxing in their resignations," claimed Anam . He said Shaheen Aftabur Reza Chowdhury and Siraj Uddin Mohammad Alamgir of Chittagong and Asaduzzaman Khasru of Barisal had already sent their resignations. Last week, vice-president Gazi Golam Dastagir and member Kabir Ahmed Bhuiyan had quit and their resignations were accepted in the July 21 board meeting. The NSC earlier withdrew their nominees Firoz Mahmud and Khandoker Jamiluddun from the 31-member executive committee, and Ahmed Iqbal Hasan lost his member post due to his being absent from 10 successive board meetings. bdnew
