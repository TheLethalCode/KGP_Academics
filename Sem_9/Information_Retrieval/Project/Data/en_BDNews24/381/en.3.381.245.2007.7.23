 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks plunged Monday, dampened by the capital market watchdog's directive that sent five companies to the spot market to trade. The Securities and Exchange Commission also suspended financial adjustment facilities for B, G and N shares to rein in a steady surge. "It has lost its pace after the SEC instruction. We have to observe the trend for the next couple of days," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh. The SEC directed trading of shares of AB Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Summit Power, DESCO and BRAC Bank on the spot market. The directive took effect from Monday. It also withdrew the money adjustment facility, a facility that allows investors to buy a share the same day with the money they get from selling another. The SEC also suspended financial adjustment facilities for the B, G and N shares, to be effective from July 29. "It's an intervention. Its results will show us whether such intervention is good or bad," said Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of Imtiyaz Husain Securities. The DGEN or general index shed 42.27 points or 1.76 percent to 2355.90. The DSI or all-share price index lost 32.31 points or 1.66 percent to 1913.43. The DSE-20 blue-chip ended almost flat at 2143.97, down 0.52 points or 0.02 percent. Losers beat gainers 110 to 70.
