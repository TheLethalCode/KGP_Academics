 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Under-19 team tasted their first victory in the tri-nation cricket tournament when they handed a 46-run defeat to Sri Lankan counterparts at P Sara Stadium in Colombo Monday. After deciding to bat first, Bangladesh made a moderate 204 all out in 48.4 overs. Ashraful Aziz (35), skipper Mahmudul Hasan (32), Taposh Ghosh (27), Mithun Ali (27) and Ronny Talukder (18) were notable scorers to propel Bangladesh to beyond 200-mark. In reply, Sri Lanka were bundled out for 161 in 46 overs as Mahmudul grabbed three wickets for 20. Taposh, Nasir and Rubel chipped in with two wickets each for 21, 26 and 27. Bangladesh's first match against Sri Lanka was wasted out due to rains and they suffered from a 99-run defeat against India in their second match.
