<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Founder joint secretary general of BNP Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi Sasturday formally launched a new party styled Progressive Democratic Party (PDP). This is the second party to have been floated in the political stream during the state of emergency that bans all forms of politics. On July 19, former Jatiya Party leader Shawkat Hossain Nilu unveiled National People's Party from a press conference. Quarishi, the co-ordinator of the PDP, announced the party's name from a news conference in the morning at the Segunbagicha office of his little-known newspaper Daily Deshbangla. Quarishi, the editor of the inconsequential paper, urged the caretaker government to lift ban on indoor politics in phases by August. Most of the top leaders of the new party came from Jatiya Party. Besides, some leaders were from BNP, the Awami League, Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Janata League and Liberal Democratic Party. Quarishi, also the editor of the inconsequential daily, urged the caretaker government to lift ban on indoor politics in phases by August. "In the next parliament elections we will present 300 honest and efficient candidates to the nation. We are hopeful we will win," he said. Quarishi wished success of the ongoing anticorruption drive. "This is the first time powerful people of Bangladesh politics and administration who had always remained beyond law have been brought to justice. The whole nation is surprised to hear hair-splitting stories of corruption at the upper level of the state machinery." "Top-level leaders have been giving sensational information about their own corruption and misrule..." He demanded punishment to the corrupt. "Care should be taken so that no innocent person faces harassment in the anti-corruption drive. Unnecessary panic and intimidation have to be stopped. "The government should go ahead with dealing with serious crimes. If unnecessary panic spreads over trifling matters the on-going anti-corruption drive may be hampered." On how he viewed the arrest of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, he said, "There is nothing to be happy with somebody's arrest. I think those who revel at somebody's arrest show a lack of taste." Asked about his party's stand on the anti-liberation elements, Quarishi said,"Those who you are seeing in the press conference are all freedom fighters. "So you understand what our stand will be. We want an end to the politics of division. We want to start politics of coordination." On how logical the launch of his party was amid the state of emergency, he said, "Though indoor politics is banned all of us are doing everything informally. "Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia and (Abdul) Mannan Bhuiyan all are speaking. We are also availing ourselves of the opportunity. "An adviser to the caretaker government has said politics is going on. However, we want the matter to be lawful." Former ministers Kamrun Nahar Jafar, Tajul Islam Chowdhury, Kazi Feroz Rashid, Sheikh Shahidul Islam, Noor Mohammad Khan, retired colonel MA Gaffar, former state minister Abul Hasan Chowdhury, advocate Fazlur Rahman, Maulana Sakhawat Hossain, Golam Sarwar Milon, retired major general NA Rafiqul Islam and Anwarul Haque were present in the news briefing. bdnew
