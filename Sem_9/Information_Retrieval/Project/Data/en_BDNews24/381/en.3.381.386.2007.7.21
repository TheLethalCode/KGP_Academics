<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - James Anderson, playing his first home test for three years, claimed career best figures of five for 42 to help England bowl India out for 201 on the third morning of the first test at Lord's on Saturday. India, resuming on 145 for four, failed to close on England's first innings 298 and lost their last six wickets for 46 runs, collapsing as England had done on Friday. England, eight without loss at lunch after facing two overs, now have the opportunity to extend their lead in good batting conditions before setting the tourists a target. Anderson sparked India's capitulation by bowling Saurav Ganguly with the 34th ball of the morning, a delivery that swung in to the left-hander when he had 34. That was 155 for five. Ryan Sidebottom removed nightwatchman Rudra Pratap Singh before Anderson persuaded the dangerous hitter Mahendra Singh Dhoni to glide a catch to Ian Bell at gully for a duck. The score was then 175 for seven. Anil Kumble, who has the reputation of staying at the wicket and frustrating bowlers as he did in Nagpur when England toured India last year, batted for 24 minutes before Sidebottom trapped him lbw for 11. VVS Laxman, capable of bailing his team out of trouble as on many occasions in the past, was unable to hold off England's charge and edged Sidebottom to wicketkeeper Matt Prior for 15. With India nine wickets down, there was then a shoot-out between Anderson and Sidebottom with a five-wicket haul as the prize. Anderson, 25 this month, won the contest to have his name inscribed on the Lord's honours board when Zaheer Khan mishit a hook and was caught by Andrew Strauss at first slip. It was Anderson's third five-wicket test haul and first in four years. The impressive Sidebottom, though, finished with figures of four for 65
