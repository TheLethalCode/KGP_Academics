 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has said the chargesheet against his mother and his aunt Sheikh Rehana was preplanned. Sajeeb told bdnews24.com by phone Tuesday that his mother and Sheikh Rehana had been implicated in a false case. "My aunt has been living abroad for 10 years and her name was not on the list of the accused in the case. So it is clear that the case was false and preplanned," he said, hours after the police had pressed extortion charges against Hasina, Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Sajeeb accused advisers and army officers of trying to find ways to taint the Bangabandhu family. The Awami League is now the biggest political party of the country and vested groups are intent on harming the party, according to Hasina's son. bdnews2
