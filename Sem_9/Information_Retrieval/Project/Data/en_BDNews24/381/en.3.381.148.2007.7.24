<TITLE> Weary Saudi players prepare to face Japan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HANOI, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A hectic travel schedule has left Saudi Arabia's players struggling to shake off the effects of jet-lag ahead of Wednesday's Asian Cup semi-final against defending champions Japan. Saudi Arabia's Brazilian coach Helio Cesar dos Anjos claimed the gruelling travel arrangements had handed Japan an unfair advantage heading into Wednesday's match. Japan booked their place in the semi-finals by beating Australia on penalties on Saturday but because they were already in Hanoi, they did not have to move camp. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, spent the whole of Monday travelling from Indonesia to Vietnam after their quarter-final win over Uzbekistan in Jakarta on Sunday night. Anjos said his players had arrived in Hanoi on Monday night feeling tired and weary after the long trip from Indonesia but there was no point in complaining. "Yesterday Japan were training and preparing for the game while we were travelling for a marathon 12 hours to get here," Anjos told a news conference on Tuesday. "This is a problem but we cannot use this as en excuse. We just have to get out there and play the game." Saudi Arabia and Japan have dominated the Asian Cup for the past two decades, with each country winning three of the last six tournaments. Saudi Arabia won the title in 1984, 1988 and 1996 while Japan were crowned champions in 1992, 2000 and 2004, beating the Saudis in the first two of those finals. "We are the two powerhouses of Asian football," Anjos said. "Both teams know each other very well. We have similar styles and techniques so it will be a game of details." Saudi Arabia beat Japan 1-0 in their first qualifying match last year but Japan won their return match 3-1 and Anjos said they were the favourites to win in Hanoi. "We expect to have a lot of problems against Japan," he said. "They are the best team on the continent. They are very good, but we are not afraid either. "We all have the right to dream. We are happy to be in the semi-finals but we want more.
