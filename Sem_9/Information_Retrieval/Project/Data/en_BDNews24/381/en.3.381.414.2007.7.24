 ZURICH, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world governing body FIFA has referred the proposed transfer of Carlos Tevez from West Ham United to Manchester United to the Lausanne-based Court of Aribtration for Sport (CAS). A FIFA spokesman said on Tuesday FIFA had recommended that West Ham and Tevez go to CAS to determine who owns the Argentine's transfer rights. "FIFA has recommended that the (English) Football Association and Premier League advise West Ham and Tevez to seek arbitration," the spokesman said. "FIFA's legal specialists feel that the best approach in the interest of all parties and for the fastest solution is to go to CAS." Tevez's move has stalled over the question of who should be paid the transfer fee, estimated by the British media at up to 30 million pounds ($61.73 million). West Ham own Tevez's playing registration but his agent Kia Joorabchian says he retains the striker's economic rights and therefore is entitled to any transfer fee. The Premier League, who have insisted that any deal for Tevez should be between the clubs, said FIFA's recommendation was the best approach. "The Premier League and FA are grateful to FIFA for considering this issue. We are supportive of the recommendation, that if all parties are in agreement the matter can be referred to CAS,," said a Premier League spokesman. Though Tevez is keen to move to Old Trafford, West Ham refused permission for him to undergo a medical at United last week
