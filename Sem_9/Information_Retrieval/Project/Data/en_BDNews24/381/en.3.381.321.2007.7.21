 ROME, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in central Italy arrested three Moroccans on Saturday after finding films and Internet downloads at a mosque they believe was used for training militants for "terrorist acts". Police in Perugia said they believed the men, one an imam, had used a mosque at Ponte Felcino, on the outskirts of the town, as a training camp for international terrorism. Materials seized included instructions on how to fly a Boeing 747. "The investigations documented how the suspects ... were undertaking a laborious and in-depth operation of instruction and training in the use of weapons and combat techniques suitable for terrorist acts," the police said in a statement. Police said they were seeking a fourth Moroccan. Among the Internet files were instructions on handling poisons, explosives and sending encrypted messages via computer. Police said there were also "instructions aimed at aspiring mujahideen to get safely to conflict zones". Interior Minister Giuliano Amato congratulated the police and said the possible use of a mosque by militants was a serious concern. "This shows the necessity to pay close attention to a place which should only be used for religious activity," he said in a statement.
