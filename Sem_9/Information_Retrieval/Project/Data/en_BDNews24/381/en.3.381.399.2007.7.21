<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Sramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal general secretary Nirmal Sen Saturday said the launch of the PDP a few days after Sheikh Hasina's arrest would make people suspect a link between the government and the new party. He was skeptical about the future of Ferdous Ahmed Quraishi's new political party. The veteran politician, however, saw Quarishi's launching the political party as a bold step. "He formed the party with some people who are known but widely criticised. Their ability to give anything to the country is very much in doubt. Quraishi himself will be criticised as well," Sen said. A founder joint secretary general of BNP, Quraishi Saturday launched a new party named Progressive Democratic Party (PDP). Quarishi had better waited for some days for the launch, he said. This is the second party to have been floated in political stream during the state of emergence that bans all forms of politics. bdnew
