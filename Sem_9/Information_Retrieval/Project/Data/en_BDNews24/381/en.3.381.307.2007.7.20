 Brahmanbaria, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  The surviving member of the Mymensingh family that reportedly committed suicide en masse was brought to Dhaka for medical treatment from Brahmanbaria Thursday. Merazunnahar Mobi, the only immediate family member to survive the incident, has been admitted to the National Mental Health Institute. She was earlier admitted to the Labaid hospital in Brahmanbaria Tuesday. While leaving the hospital in Brahmanbaria, Mobi said the tragedy that struck nine members of her family was a "pre-planned killing," not a suicide. She demanded punishment of the "killers". Mobi believes that harassment by hostile neighbours might have compelled her family to choose the path of suicide or they may even have been pushed in front of the speeding train. The Brahmanbaria police chief told reporters after meeting Mobi that she can file a complaint if she wishes. bdnews24.com/co
