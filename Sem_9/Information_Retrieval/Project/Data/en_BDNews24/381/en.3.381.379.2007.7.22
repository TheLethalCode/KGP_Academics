<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) -- The labour ministry has blacklisted 58 garment factories for breaching compliance rules as workers are deprived of wages, appointments and identity cards. The ministry also warned another 250 garment factories of taking legal action unless they follow all compliance rules by August 31 in line with a previous agreement among workers, factory owners and the government. The deadline to implement the tripartite agreement will also apply to the blacklisted factories to avoid legal action. LGRD and labour adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters after a meeting that they would take action against the factories if they failed to follow the guideline. Senior ministry officials, BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury and representatives from different organisations attended the meeting. The government has recently tightened its grip on the factory owners as the main export-earning sector experienced violent labour unrest in the recent past. Pressure from overseas retailers and consumers, and global trade unions also prompted the government to go for a tough measure for fear of losing edge on the international market. Many experts feared the sector could suffer a huge setback in the post-quota regime if the compliance issues are not followed properly. The BGMEA president told the meeting that 1,585 factories out of 4,425, which are registered with BGMEA, had already shut their businesses because of various hurdles in the sector. Over past three to four months alone, at least 332 factories stopped production. Chowdhury said 2,001 factories fully gave all benefits to the workers until May in line with labour laws. From May to July 22, another 111 factories implemented the rules while 308 factories are yet to implement the guideline. He said the troubled factories could not implement the rules by the government-fixed June 30 deadline because they face a shortage of funds and non-cooperation from banks. He said they were trying to solve the problem and hoped they would be able to fix the hurdles in one and a half months. The labour adviser said the factory owners had already implemented many pledges and they would get more time to follow the rest. "If the owners fail to use the scope, action will be taken against them," the adviser said. "The government won't hear any excuse after that and there will be no alternative." Replying to a query, the adviser said the country's main export earning sector was suffering from about 30 percent of manpower shortage against demand. The workers from the closed factories have already got jobs in other factories, and the BGMEA has been training workers with the help of the government to overcome the shortage, Chowdhury said. The country's garment sector annually earns about US$8 billion in exports that employs about 2 million workers, mostly women. bdnew
