<TITLE> Now Google wants to be a telco </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Martyn Warwick London, July 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The Cookie Monster, whose gargantuan appetite simply cannot be assuaged no matter what it eats, having gobbled up much of the Internet is now about to get its teeth into telecoms. There is even the possibility that before too much longer there might even be such a things as a Google phone! Over the weekend, the giant web company disclosed that it will be a bidder in the upcoming auction of a swathe of US wireless spectrum. Google says it is willing to bid at least US$6.4 billion as it seeks to become a mobile operator, but will do so only if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accepts and imposes a set of rules that would certainly be favourable to the search engine company but that have already been flatly rejected by other, established cell phone operators. Google's gambit is to put pressure on the FCC in the remaining few days before the regulator published the parameters under which the tranche of 700MHz spectrum, newly freed-up by TV broadcasters going digital, will go on the slab. The auction itself will take place in January 2008. The established US wireless carriers are understandably wary of what Google is up to and deeply suspicious of its motives. Verizon Wireless has dismissed Google's demands as "tantamount to corporate welfare" for the search engine company while AT&T refers to Google's "requirements" if it is to join the spectrum auction as an "all or nothing ultimatum" that should be ignored. Meanwhile, Steve Largent, the head of the wireless industry trade group the CTIA says Google is trying to get the auction "rigged with special conditions in its favour." AT&T and the others do have some friends in high places in this regard. Kevin Martin, the chairman of the FCC, has himself already refused two of Googles four proposed "conditions". However, Mr. Martin has also indicated that he has some sympathy with Google's two remaining "suggestions" and so the door to the auction room remains ajar. In point of fact, Google has already spent millions of bucks on mobile technology in an effort to be ready quickly to go beyond the mobile search and mobile map services it currently offers. However, the company has been reticent on exactly what it plans to do and only last week CEO Eric Schmidt, in a presentation to Wall Street analysts, parried questions about the company's mobile ambitions with the bland and non-commital response, "We are looking carefully at wireless and are thinking about what we want to do there." Yeah, well, we knew that much already. Pressed on the issue, Schmidt did go so far as to stress that Google considers it of prime importance that a network should permit any device to have access to it, and those devices should provide users with a portal to the complete Internet rather than a subset of it. To knowing nods and winks, the CEO added that were such circumstances to pertain, mobile phone subscribers would become "significant consumers" of online advertising on a cellular handset. Lest we forget, online advertising is Google's core business and the company's bread and butter and the Google would be delighted if it could subvert the existing mobile business model and subsidise both voice and data calls by advertising. Thus the company's vision of the wireless future is very much at odds with that of the established operators. Google looks forward to the day when consumers will be able to buy a handset at almost any kind of retail outlet and would then be free to sign-up with any mobile operator and put any software from any source onto their cell phones. Such a notion is absolute anathema to the likes of AT&T and Verizon who are determined to maintain the lucrative (for them) status quo. It seems likely that the FCC's decision on the rules for the spectrum auction could determine the mobile and wireless Internet access landscape in the US for a generation. Google, and other ISPs too, say the auction, that is expected to raise at least $10 billion, should break the cosy broadband duopoly that the fixed-line telcos and cable companies have carved-out for themselves. In the Google world, the top bidder for approximately 33 per cent of the spectrum on offer would adopt an "open access" policy that make it available to resellers on a wholesale basis and under "nondiscriminatory commercial terms". Further, it would allow consumers to use any handset and access any mobile Internet service over the network without requiring the permission of the operator. This is a revised but markedly similar version of the "network neutrality" proposals put forward by ISPs in regard to America's fixed line networks. The ISPs aren't doing too well in that regard and like their fixed-line brethren, the mobile carriers similarly oppose the wholesale terms proposal, saying that it would "Undermine the business model of the traditional wireless industry." The trouble is that the US wireless operators regard the dead hand of duopoly control as their birthright. They do everything they can to keep power over the customer in their own hands in a way that would not only be unacceptable but also unthinkable in other parts of the world. For example, they decide what features their subscribers may have access to and use from the vast menu of capabilities built into mobile handsets by the manufacturers; they also determine what software can be uploaded and how it can be used. Then they tie-in consumers with long and onerous contracts of Kafka-esque complexity and round the whole lot off with some swingeing and extremely expensive penalty clauses for subscribers who want to take their business elsewhere. And let's remember this is the USA, the supposed bastion of individual choice and freebooting competitive capitalism. If the same thing applied in, oh, let's say Cuba, for example, you can bet that the US media would be up in arms about the abysmal treatment of the huddled masses. Strange that they're not doing the same thing on their home turf. Or maybe not given the power of the established wireless and cable lobby it's not strange at all? One particularly questionable, nay, devious and nasty tack being taken by Verizon Wireless in its determination that Google's proposals shall not pass is that were the carrier be required to open its network to handsets that Verizon itself has not approved and that therefore "cannot reliably communicate with law enforcement" would prove a grave and intractable problem "in an era of national security concerns". Of course it wouldn't, but Verizon's subtext is, "Stay with us or you'll let terrorists in". Samuel Johnson was right when in April 1775, a year before the US Declaration of Independence, he said, "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel." A couple of weeks ago, Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, chaired a house hearing on wireless innovation and consumer protection. It was lobbied against hard by the established cellular operators. During the hearing Markey held up an iPhone as the perfect example of how the mobile service providers maintain a hammer-lock on the sector and exert "far too much control over the features, functions and applications that wireless gadget makers and content entrepreneurs can offer directly to consumers." He than asked, "Why is it that AT&T imposes a two-year contract with a US$175 early-termination of contract fee even though the cost of the phone has not been subsidised and the consumer can't even take it to use with another network provider." Now that's a damn good question. Needless to say, AT&T has signally failed to answer it. Google may be turning into a monster, but the US mobile operators and their grudgingly accepted cable company cousins are equally ugly, and equally greedy.
