<TEXT>
 CARSON, California, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham's hotly anticipated debut for Los Angeles Galaxy is unlikely to take place against Chelsea on Saturday, although a final decision will be made on the day of the match. The England midfielder, signed by the Galaxy from Real Madrid on a $32.5 million five-year deal, has been struggling to recover from an injury to his left ankle. "David's feeling a lot better but we will have to wait until game day (to make a decision)," Galaxy head coach Frank Yallop told reporters at the team's home stadium on Friday. "He won't play a big part in the game, we know that, but we are hoping he can get some time on the field. "He is desperate to play and wants to make his stamp on why he came over here to play." Yallop said the Galaxy's entire coaching staff, in consultation with Beckham, would decide whether the former England captain would make his debut against FA Cup holders Chelsea. Beckham played no part in Galaxy training on Thursday, instead spending his time with the team's physiotherapist and working out in the gym. Although the 32-year-old has responded well to treatment since he arrived in Los Angeles last week, his ankle is still swollen and he does not want to run the risk of a setback. "I am here for five years, not just for Saturday," Beckham told ESPN television during coverage of Thursday's MLS All-Star game against Celtic. "It's more important to me personally that my ankle is right and I don't think it'll be right for the game." Beckham twisted his ankle playing for his country against Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifying match last month. He aggravated it in his final appearance for Real 11 days later when his former team clinched the Spanish league title
