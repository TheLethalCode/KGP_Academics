 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  The police Tuesday sued up to 30 unnamed students for burning an effigy of law adviser Mainul Hosein on the Dhaka University campus, a police officer said. A group of DU students tied to the Awami League burnt the effigy demanding former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's freedom, in a public demonstration banned by emergency powers rules. An officer with the Newmarket Police Station, assistant sub-inspector Rafiqul Islam, told bdnews24.com that violations of the emergency powers rules had been mentioned in the case. Sub-inspector Manirul Islam of the same police station filed the case, which will be investigated by officer-in-charge Golam Kibria. The student front of the Awami League Tuesday renewed their demand for Hasina's freedom and burnt the effigy of the law adviser in protest at his remarks over the arrest. Up to 20 activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League joined the demonstration and chanted slogans at 9:45am in front of the Institute of Social Welfare and Research. The AL's student wing has called for protests in the district headquarters across the country Tuesday. Some recent comments by the law adviser over Hasina's arrest sparked a wave of criticism among Awami League adherents. The Dhaka University Teachers' Association Thursday announced their protest plans despite reported pressure from authorities. The teachers Saturday wore black badges to classes to condemn the arrest of the former prime minister and abstained from work for five hours Sunday. The Chhatra League also enforced a daylong strike at the university to demand immediate release of the leader. Security forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in an extortion case. bdn
