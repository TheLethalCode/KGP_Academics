 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP adviser ASM Hannan Shah Monday welcomed the speech given by Sajeeb Wazed Joy after the arrest of Sheikh Hasina, saying it had a tone of "unity in politics". He also said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's speech on Hasina's arrest expressed her political aptitude. "I'm proud of her for what she said," he told reporters at his home. Hannan said he also wanted reform in the party. "Our leader also wants reform. But any proposal on reform must be placed on the party forum." Hannan and son Shah Rezaul Hannan were freed on bail from jail Sunday, six days after the High Court issued the order. They were arrested on May 14 by joint forces at his new DOHS home after Awami League leader Ruhul Amin from Kapashia filed a case. Another BNP adviser, ZA Khan, described Hannan's bail as a victory of law. "We hope that Hannan Shah will also want reforms. To restore democracy and weed out corruption from the BNP there is no alternative to reform," Khan said at Bhuiyan's Gulshan home Monday. bdnews24
