<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) Pro-reform BNP leader AHM Mofazzal Karim Saturday said they would press on with council leaving Khaleda Zia in the cold if she refused to allow the crucial meeting. "If permission is not available the party constitution provides for alternative steps. In that case the council would be held without the chairperson." The BNP chairperson's adviser said secretary general Abdul Manna Bhuiyan would meet her to take permission to hold the party's council. The so-called pro-reform leader made the remarks to reporters after meeting Bhuiyan at the latter's Gulshan home in the noon. "The reforms are not aimed at dropping anybody; these are the demand of the leaders and workers of the party. "However, if anybody gets dropped in the reform process, we have nothing to do." Asked what they would do if the chairperson took action against the reformists on charges of anti-constitutional activities, he said, "We are following the constitution. We are not afraid of the threat of action." "Reform to the party is a must for preparing the party to contest the elections." He said they were doing everything in line with the party constitution and that reforms were designed to best serve the party. On chairperson Khaleda Zia's statement in a recent teleconference with the expatriates, Mofazzal said her statement had created confusion in the party. "We are trying to get in touch with the chairperson." A delegation led by France chapter of BNP Abdul Malek met Bhuiyan on Saturday. The delegation handed him a letter signed by 155 BNP leaders in France supporting the reform proposals. Former lawmakers and district leaders from Khulna, Patuakhali, Barisal, Rajshahi, Joypurhat, Meherpur and Bogra districts also met the secretary general. bdnews
