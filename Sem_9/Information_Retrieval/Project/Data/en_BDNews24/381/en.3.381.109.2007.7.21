<TEXT>
 ROME, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb scare at Rome airport caused Alitalia to evacuate all 165 passengers on a plane bound for London on Saturday, but after searching bags for explosives the flight was allowed to proceed with a four-hour delay. The alarm was raised by an anonymous phone call which said there were explosives on board flight AZ-203 which was due to take off from Rome's Fiumicino airport at 1:35 pm (1135 GMT). Police and fire services surrounded the plane while luggage was removed and searched but nothing suspicious was found. The passengers were allowed back on the flight and the plane was due to make a delayed take-off between 1530 and 1600.
