 ANKARA, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's ruling AK Party won a resounding election victory Sunday, giving the pro-business, Islamist-rooted party a mandate for reform but potentially setting the stage for renewed tensions with the secular elite. The result is a moral triumph for Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who called early parliamentary polls after losing a battle with the establishment, which includes army generals, who did not want his ex-Islamist ally as head of state. With nearly all votes counted, the AK Party won 47 percent, almost half as much again as in 2002, but a more united opposition means it may end up without many extra seats. Only two other, secularist parties crossed the 10 percent threshold into parliament -- the nationalist-minded Republican People's Party (CHP) on 20 percent and the far-right National Movement Party (MHP) on 15 percent. A score of mainly Kurdish independents were also seen winning, the first Kurds in the 550-seat assembly since the early 1990s. "Turkey's stability will continue," senior AK Party lawmaker Salih Kapusuz told Reuters, saying the party would now govern alone for a second five-year term in a country of 74 million that stretches from the EU east to Iran and Iraq. The parties argued over economic reform, how to deal with Kurdish separatist violence, joining an unenthusiastic European Union and religion's place in a modern Turkey. Voters seem to have dismissed opposition warnings that the AKP secretly sought an Iranian-style theocracy, despite mass rallies this year in defense of the rigid state-religion divide in Turkey, one of the Muslim world's few democracies. "The controversy which we witnessed about secularism versus Islam has not materialized," Sami Kohen, a columnist for liberal daily Milliyet, told Reuters. "The message given by the electorate is that we are happy with economic progress and European (Union) policy." Erdogan, due to speak later on Sunday, has presided over an economic boom and in a sign of market cheer at the outcome -- one of the strongest mandates in recent Turkish history -- the lira gained almost 2 percent on the dollar in early Asian trade. MORE REFORMS Economists said Turkey's most popular politician, 53, could now continue free-market policies and kick-start stalled EU membership talks, despite growing disillusionment in Turkey towards joining the bloc. "This is the best-case scenario for markets ... The question now is how is the establishment going to react and this is something the markets are going to be worried about," said analyst Simon Quijano-Evans. The army views itself as the ultimate guarantor of Turkey's secular state and has ousted four cabinets in 50 years, most recently an Islamist-minded predecessor of the AK Party in 1997. "I don't think (the army) is happy but they're not going to roll the tanks out. They will explore means of making themselves felt, bearing in mind it's a government with a strong mandate," said Semih Idiz, a leading Turkish columnist. The next government will quickly face new challenges. It must find a compromise candidate for president -- and tread carefully to keep the army at bay, speed up EU-inspired reforms or risk an economic backlash, and decide whether to send the army into northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels based there. Turkish security forces have been battling PKK Kurdish rebels since 1984 in a conflict that has cost more than 30,000 lives. Violent clashes have increased over the past year. That prospect increasingly worries the United States which, in early foreign reaction, called the poll a success for democracy according to CNN Turk TV.
