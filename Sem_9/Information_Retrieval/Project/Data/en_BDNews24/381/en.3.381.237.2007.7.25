<TITLE> Britain proposes tightening border controls </TITLE>

 LONDON, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain promised tighter border controls on Wednesday and resurrected counter-terrorism proposals that have irked Muslims and divided lawmakers. In his first major statement on security since he took over from Tony Blair last month, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said failed car bomb attacks in London and Scotland two weeks ago marked the 15th attempted terrorist plot in Britain since 2001. "Our priority ... is a Britain strong in security, robust in our resolve, resilient in response, so that as a nation we both defeat terrorism and isolate violent extremism, wherever we confront it and whatever its source," Brown told parliament. Britain faced a threat from 30 known plots and 200 militant cells, many linked to al Qaeda, were being monitored, he said. The focus of Brown's new proposals was strengthening security at ports and airports, which critics say is a weak link that allows militants to come and go with ease. A unified border force will be created, all passengers will be subject to electronic screening and biometric visas issued to all applicants from March next year, Brown said. The government will also consult on allowing terrorism suspects to be quizzed after they have been charged and allowing phone tap evidence to be used in court cases, both of which are currently banned. The most controversial aspect was the proposal to extend pre-charge detention times for terrorism suspects, a highly emotive issue since the July 7, 2005, suicide bomb attacks by four British Islamists on London which killed 52 people. Blair suffered his first defeat in the House of Commons (lower house) two years ago over plans to allow police to hold suspects for up to 90 days, following a rebellion by lawmakers in his Labour Party. Instead, parliament agreed on a compromise deal which means they can be detained for up to 28 days. Brown said this limit needed to be extended because of the complexity of investigating plots with international links, and has suggested a 56-day maximum instead, with the process overseen by judges and parliament. "There is, I detect, a growing weight of opinion ... that there may be some circumstances in which detention beyond 28 days could be necessary," Brown said. He is hoping any new laws would have cross-party support but the main opposition Conservative Party said there was no evidence to support the change. Civil rights groups argue that holding suspects for longer periods of time, and then possibly releasing them without charge, would alienate Britain's 1.7 million Muslims. Human rights lawyer Imran Khan, who has represented a number of suspects involved in terrorism cases, said the 56-day limit had been "plucked out of the air" for political expediency. "There's a feeling particularly in the Muslim community that they are being targeted specifically," he told BBC radio. "My fear is more legislation is going to increase the problem and not solve i
