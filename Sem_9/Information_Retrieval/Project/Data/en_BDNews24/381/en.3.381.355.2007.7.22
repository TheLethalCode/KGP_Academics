 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh and China Sunday agreed to pursue Myanmar to allow its territory to establish a road link between the countries. "We have no reservation to set up a road link. We will ask Myanmar to allow us to establish the link," commerce adviser Mirza Azizul Islam said. His remarks came after a 12-memeber Chinese delegation led by its assistant commerce minister Wang Chao met him in his office. The adviser called upon the Chinese delegation to work to narrow a ballooning trade gap between the two countries. Talks on setting up the road from Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan province in China, to Teknaf have been in progress over the last three and a half years. "We made the proposal over three years ago. The government of China also is interested to have a road link with Bangladesh," commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The adviser referred to about $2.0 billion in trade deficit that favourd China and said: "We have asked them to invest more here." "We have assured them of allowing imports of textile and leather products that they will manufacture here. The delegation promised us to consider the issue," he said. Mirza said opportunities of exporting jute and jute goods, leather and leather goods, frozen foods, pharmaceutical products and cement to China exist. bdnews24.com
