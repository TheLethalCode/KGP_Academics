RAB sub-inspector Matiur Rahman sought seven days' remand from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for interrogation of the suspect. In his remand request, the sub-inspector said Faizul had confessed to police and other agencies to killing Saima. Faizul had also explained the motive for the killing. Remand was required to question Faizul about his other accomplices in the murder and about the allegations of extortion made by Faizul against Saima, the court was told. Faizul was presented to a press conference Monday at RAB-2 Headquarters in Maghbazar after arrest. His 'confession in public' added a new twist to the July 17 death of the lawyer as investigators chased leads to the incident. Faizul, who worked as an assistant accountant in the Public Works Department, said he was involved in Saima's murder because she took a total of Tk 12 lakh from him in bribes, promising him jobs.
