 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)Those wishing to visit Awami League president Sheikh Hasina in jail have to seek permission from the Special Branch of Police, a top prisons official said Monday. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of prisons, told reporters gathered near the special jail where Hasina is detained that relatives of Hasina would shortly be able to visit her. "They must take permission from the Special Branch of Police, and Hasina, too, must give her permission to allow them in," he said. "Hasina is well," he added at about 5.30pm after making his regular visit to the former prime minister. Krishak League president Mirza Abdul Jalil had earlier tried to visit Hasina but was refused permission by the authorities. He told reporters that party reform and council meetings are dependent on Sheikh Hasina's release. "Nothing will happen until Hasina is freed," he said. Sheikh Hasina's in-laws Hasibul Kabir Manju and Ahmed Firoze Kabir were also denied permission to visit Monday, while Hasina's protocol officer and some party workers brought her dry foods and fruits that security forces would not accept. Major Siddiqui said authorities were not allowing people to visit Hasina for security reasons. The former prime minister was arrested on July 16 and is being detained in a special jail in the Jatiya Sangsad premises. bdnews
