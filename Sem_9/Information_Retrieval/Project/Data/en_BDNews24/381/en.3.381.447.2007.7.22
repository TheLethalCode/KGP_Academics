 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed Sunday sought tariff-free access for goods to the India's market, an increase in Indian investment and a cut in trade deficit with the next-door neighbour. The president made the call at the inaugural ceremony of the Indo-Bangla Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka. "Bangladesh has many important trading partners including India, China, and Japan. However, the trade deficit with India is much higher than it is with any other countries." The solution, according to Ahmed, is to export more commodities to India. "In the era of globalisation and free-market economies, all countries face huge competition. After the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) this competition increased even more." "Competition has helped develop the Bangladeshi economy. However, we must work harder to achieve development and prosperity for the national economy," Iajuddin said. "At present the environment for investment is good. Foreigners can invest in many sectors, such as medicine, melamine, garment, frozen foods, ceramics, leather and jute. "These commodities have great potential in the international market." "We have great natural beauty, including one of the longest sea beaches in the world and the Sundarbans forest. We can profit by telling the world about our countries' beauty." "That is why we need multiple-entry visas and tax-free access to the [Indian] market. We hope India will help us in this matter," Iajuddin said. Abdul Matlub Ahmed, IBCCI president, presided over the event. bdnews24
