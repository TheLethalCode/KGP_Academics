<TITLE> China`s Hu links a stable Tibet to a stable country </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stability in the occasionally restive region of Tibet, where many remain loyal to the exiled Dalai Lama, has a bearing on the stability of China as a whole, newspapers on Friday quoted President Hu Jintao as saying. The Dalai Lama, 72, fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Communist rule, but remains the single most important influence in Tibetan life. The atheist Communist Party has competed against him for the loyalty of his people. March 10 marks the 49th anniversary of his exile. "Tibet's stability has to do with the entire country's stability, Tibet's safety has to do with the entire country's safety," Hu told Tibetan members of parliament on Thursday. China's presence in Tibet has become yet more controversial ahead of this year's Beijing Olympics, which activists hope to use to draw global attention to the plight of the predominantly Buddhist region. Critics say China continues to repress Tibetans' religious aspirations, especially their veneration for the Dalai Lama, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner whom China denounces as a separatist. Periodic rioting by monks has been brutally crushed. China has defended itself, saying it has spent billions of dollars to develop Tibet and improve the living standards of the impoverished Himalayan region. President Hu said "efforts should be made to transform the mode of (Tibet's) economic growth". He did not elaborate. Critics have warned of environmental degradation as Tibet rushes to enrich itself and catch up with the rest of the country. Hu, who doubles as Communist Party and military chief, praised the hard work of cadres in Tibet in a sign Tibetans would not be given more say in their own affairs. Politically the Party should "fully trust" Han Chinese cadres in Tibet, tremendously support their work, warmly care about their lives and set strict standards to prevent abuse of power and corruption, Hu said. But Hu also said the work of grassroots cadres from all ethnic groups in Tibet was difficult and the Party should "care about them more, support them more and help them more".
