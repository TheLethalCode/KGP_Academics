 GENEVA, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour, who confirmed on Friday she would leave her post at the end of June, said that countries cannot trample fundamental freedoms when fighting terrorism. In remarks clearly directed at the United States and its allies, the former UN war crimes prosecutor said that the use of torture and secret renditions must be fully disclosed. All detainees are entitled to due process and access to the courts, according to Arbour, who has drawn fire from Washington for her blunt criticism of its counter-terrorism methods since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on America. "Let me emphasise once again the need for respecting human rights, as well as for greater transparency and accountability, when countering terrorism," Arbour told the UN Human Rights Council, presenting a final annual report of her four-year term. "This requires maximum possible disclosure regarding practices of particular concern, including the use of torture and international transfers of detainees, as well as accountability for illegal actions," she said. Allegations of secret US activities including extraditions, known as "rendition", have circulated for years. A European investigator said last year he had proof Poland and Romania hosted secret jails for the Central Intelligence Agency. Britain, the leading U.S. ally in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said last month for the first time that Washington had used British territory to transfer terrorism suspects. The U.S. record on torture, including use of the controversial method of water boarding to simulate drowning during interrogations, has also been widely condemned. There are still about 275 detainees at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Most have been held for years without being charged and many have complained of abuse. BIGGEST STRUGGLE Arbour, a former Canadian Supreme Court judge, said that her biggest struggle in the U.N. job had been convincing governments to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice. "Impunity for human rights violations is still present in all regions of the world and poses a serious challenge to the pursuit of justice," she said. In her four years in the job, Arbour's candour has been attacked by some countries, but she told a media briefing ahead of the speech this was "inevitable". "I tend to distinguish between criticisms that have a certain validity to them, especially those expressed in good faith, and those which often don't have much merit," she said, adding that she was not being forced out. The UN rights boss, who visited 20 countries including Iran in the past year, said the independence of the judiciary and the fate of activists had been major concerns on her tour. In a parting shot at some Council members, she said in her speech that "allegations of bias, hypocrisy and dereliction of duty" against her or her staff were "outside the acceptable range" of debate. "Such statements demean the Human Rights Council and betray the good faith efforts of all those working in the United Nations on very difficult and divisive issues," she said. But Pakistan's envoy Masood Khan immediately took the floor on behalf of Islamic countries to flag gaps in her annual report and signal they would demand a say in future field offices. "Recent incidents of defamation of religion and efforts by Sudan and Sri Lanka to ameliorate the human rights situations in their countries should have been mentioned," he said. Most of the United Nations' 47 human rights field offices were in developing countries, creating "an imbalance", Khan said. Sweden was among several Western countries to take the floor to praise Arbour's "untiring strength and independence". U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has to appoint her successor and the UN General Assembly must endorse his choi
