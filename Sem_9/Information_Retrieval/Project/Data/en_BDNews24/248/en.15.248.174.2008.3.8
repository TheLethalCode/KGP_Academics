 London, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Post Office is in talks with a local English council to allow it run a number of post offices, a spokeswoman for Britain's Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) said on Saturday. With thousands of loss-making post offices set to close under government plans to put the network on a sounder footing, Essex County Council (ECC) wants to reopen and run a number of branches. "We are aware Essex County Council is in talks with Post Office Ltd, but we are not involved in the talks ourselves," said the BERR in a statement. "This is a matter for Post Office Ltd and ECC to work through themselves." Essex hopes to produce a financially viable model for post offices by possibly running them out of libraries or schools. "We've put in place a budget of 1.5 million pounds over the next three years," Stephen Castle, Essex's cabinet member for economic development, told the BBC. "In the next few weeks we hope we can reopen 15 or 16 post offices. "We're not talking about a long-term replacement of a government subsidy with a local subsidy," added Castle. "This is about a three-year window to work with these post offices and after that they become self sufficient. "Are there other more innovative ways of providing these services? I don't think the government and the Post Office have taken the time to think outside the box." As well as negotiating with the Post Office, Essex has been in talks with another 15 councils over its initiative. "We're very willing to work with Local Authorities and other groups who want to fund, and provide premises and staff for, additional services in their community and are actively pursuing these ideas at the moment," said the Royal Mail in a statement. As many as 2,500 post offices are set to close as the government attempts to tackle losses of 3.5 million pounds a week across the network of over 14,000 branches
