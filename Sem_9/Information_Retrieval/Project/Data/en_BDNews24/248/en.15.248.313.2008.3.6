 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnew24.com)  The telecoms ministry has planned region-wise rates for telephone calls, a government official said Thursday. "We are taking steps to provide our subscribers with better services," acting telecoms secretary Iqbal Mahmud told bdnews24.com. He said the ministry was reviewing a proposal by the BTTB to lower the call rates. They have also planned to provide 20,000 high-speed internet connections tagged with telephone lines in Dhaka. The internet services will see an expansion in phases across the country after reviewing initial response from the subscribers, he said. Iqbal said the separate call rates would be fixed in upazila, district and divisional levels. "If they are provided with the facilities the revenue of the BTTB will increase, it will not have to depend on the government," he said. He said the ministry would move toward implementing a proposal for rural connectivity, and the broadband internet connections would be ensured in six months. The BTTB will have to install some equipment in its digital exchange, he said. The connection will be given through "asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)", for which subscribers will have to use internet modem that will cost Tk 4,000 to Tk 5,000, the secretary said. The BTTB is currently providing dialup internet connections. The bill rate of the internet will also be cut. BTTB general manager (finance) Dr Abu Sayeed Khan said that they had proposed Tk 0.25 per minute for a local call. He said they also proposed Tk 1,000 as connection fee for a BTTB phone in all districts and upazilas, including Chittagong. Dhaka will be an exception. Currently, an NWD call charges Tk 0.75 for 30 seconds and Tk 1.50 for per minute. The phone call in the same district is treated as local call. In terms of local call the bill for seven minutes during peak hours and 10 minutes during off-peak hours is Tk 1.50. But one can talk in the same rate for five minutes during peak hours and eight minutes during off peak hours in Dhaka and Chittagong. bdnews
