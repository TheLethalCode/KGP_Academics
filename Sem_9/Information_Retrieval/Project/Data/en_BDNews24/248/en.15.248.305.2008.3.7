 TEHRAN, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A hardline senior cleric urged Iranians on Friday to turn out in force for a parliamentary election next week and frustrate the United States and its allies who he said wanted a low turnout. Ahmad Khatami, a member of the Experts Assembly with the power to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader, called on people to disappoint Iran's "enemies" by ensuring a high turnout in the March 14 poll.

Washington accuses Iran of sponsoring "terrorism" and trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran denies the charges. The crowd of worshippers broke into repeated chants of "Death to America", denouncing the Islamic republic's arch-foe.
