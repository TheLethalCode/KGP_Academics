 Hong Kong, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell more than 2 percent on Friday as fears of more credit-related losses hit financial shares and a record low dollar routed exporters. The combination of a worsening global credit outlook and signs of a weakening U.S. economy kept investors on edge, sending the dollar to all-time lows against both the euro and a basket of currencies, and a three-year low against the yen. Making it worse, oil prices held near a record $106 a barrel on the back of the falling U.S. currency, reinforcing concerns that surging commodity prices will fuel inflationary pressures at a time of slowing global growth. Bonds across the region gained, with Japanese government bond futures hitting a 2- year high as investors opt for safety. "There are still serious concerns about credit markets, particularly about where the U.S. economy is heading," said Tony Russell, senior equities adviser at ABN AMRO Morgans in Australia. "We're probably close to re-testing our lows seen earlier this year." The MSCI measure of Asian stocks excluding Japan fell touched its lowest since Feb. 12, and was trading down 2.6 percent at 0406 GMT. The index is heading for a weekly loss of close to 5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei average hit a six-week low and was down 3.3 percent, while shares in Hong Kong and Australia were down more than 3 percent each. Stocks in South Korea and Singapore were down more than 2 percent each, while markets in China, and Taiwan were down over 1 percent each. JAPAN SLOWING TOO Shares of financial firms dropped after Thornburg Mortgage Inc, a high-profile U.S. mortgage lender, said it failed to meet a margin call, sparking fears the mortgage lender might go bankrupt. Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ lost 3.8 percent, while South Korea's Kookmin Bank was down 2.5 percent. "Credit fears are spreading. Things like that probably won't be over after one or two cases and investors are worried there will be more," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities in Japan. Some economists believe the United States, Asia's biggest export market, has already slid into recession and that Japan is not far behind, challenges that will have to be faced by the new central bank governor of the world's second-biggest economy. Media reports on Friday had tipped that person to be deputy Bank of Japan governor Toshiro Muto. The BOJ left interest rates steady at 0.5 percent in a unanimous decision on Friday. Exporters were also pressured as Asian currencies firmed against the ailing dollar, with Toyota Motor Corp losing 3.6 percent and Hyundai Motor Co down 2.3 percent. Stronger Asian currencies can hit earnings from abroad when converted into Japanese yen or South Korean won, and erode export competitiveness. STAGFLATION? The crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage market is being felt worldwide, with data on Thursday showing U.S. home foreclosures hit a record late last year. Concerns about a slowing global economy are being compounded by surging commodity prices, leaving some central banks around in the world dealing with the prospects of slowing growth yet rising inflation, known as stagflation. The Federal Reserve runs the risk of feeding inflation if it concentrates too much on protecting the U.S. economy from a slowdown, St Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole said on Thursday. The problem is being felt in Asia as well. The Bank of Korea on Friday left interest rates steady for a seventh month in a row, with the central bank's governor noting increased chances of slowing economic growth but inflation growing above its forecast this year. The euro rose as high as $1.5396, its highest level since its launch in 1999, after the European Central Bank played down the prospects of an interest rate cut, but last traded at $1.5377, little changed from late U.S. trade. The dollar also fell to an all-time low of 72.849 against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies and a new three-year low of 102.45 yen. U.S. crude futures were steady at $105.45 in Asian trade, close to the record $105.97 hit on Thursday, on the back of a weak dollar and a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to hold output steady. But bonds gained, as they tend to do in uncertain times, with Japan's March 10-year futures rising as high as 139.50, their highest since September 2005.
