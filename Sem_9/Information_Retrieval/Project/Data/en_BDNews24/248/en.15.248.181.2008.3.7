 SARAJEVO, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb ex-policeman pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of killing and persecution of non-Serbs in southeastern Bosnia early in the country's 1992-95 war. The state war crimes court indicted Krsto Savic, wartime police chief in the southeastern town of Gacko, for involvement in the arrest and killing of 80 Muslims from the eastern Kalinovik area in the summer of 1992. "I am not guilty on any count of the indictment," Savic told the court. According to the indictment, Savic commanded a police unit that looted and destroyed homes and harassed or arrested Muslims from the Gacko and Kalinovik areas. "On August 5, 1992, all detained men, around 80 of them, were allegedly loaded on trucks and taken away, after which they were executed," the indictment said. Milko Mucibabic, another Bosnian Serb ex-policeman who was accused of involvement in the arrest and torture of Muslims and Croats in the southeastern town of Nevesinje, also pleaded not guilty. Mucibabic was also charged with illegal manufacturing and trade of weapons and explosive substances. Dozens of people have been convicted at the court, set up to allow the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to focus on the most serious abuses of the conflict in which around 100,000 people were killled. Dozens more are on trial. Most of the defendants are Bosnian Serbs but they also include Muslims and Croa
