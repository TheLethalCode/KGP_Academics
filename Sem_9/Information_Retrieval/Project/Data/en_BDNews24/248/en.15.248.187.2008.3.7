 JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki can no longer govern effectively after losing the leadership of the country's ruling party, ANC leader Jacob Zuma was quoted as saying on Friday. Zuma defeated Mbeki at a party election in December and is likely to become state president when Mbeki must step down in 2009 if he defeats corruption charges in court.

While Mbeki appears to be keeping a low profile these days, Zuma acts like the man who will rule South Africa, despite the prospect of being imprisoned if he loses the court case.
