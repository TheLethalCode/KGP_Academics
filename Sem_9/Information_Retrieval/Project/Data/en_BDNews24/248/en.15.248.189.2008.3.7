 BRUSSELS, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission has suspended some farm aid to new European Union member Bulgaria over suspected fraud for the first time since it joined the bloc in January 2007, a spokesman said on Friday. "We have suspicions there may have been some malpractice," EU agriculture spokesman Michael Mann told a daily news briefing, saying the sums involved were not large. "It's really just the principle more than anything." The funds involved were part of pre-accession aid for the period 2000-2006 allocated for investments in processing and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products, the last part of which may be spent up to 2009.

It appeared to be the first time that Brussels had suspended any aid to one of the new central and east European countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The Commission decided last year not to invoke so-called safeguard clauses under which it could have withheld up to 25 percent of farm payments to Romania and Bulgaria, despite concerns about alleged graft. However, an EU official said Brussels was looking closely at how all European money was being spent in both countries. "We are auditing both Romania and Bulgaria extremely carefully. The fact that we didn't go ahead with the safeguard clause doesn't mean we can't go back if we see abuses," he said. The letter from the director-general of the EU executive's agriculture department did not spell out the alleged abuses, which have been under investigation by the EU's anti-fraud agency OLAF since 20
