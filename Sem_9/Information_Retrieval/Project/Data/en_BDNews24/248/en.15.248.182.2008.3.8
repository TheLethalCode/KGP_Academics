<TITLE> Impoverished Haiti joins Latin American Rio Group </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Santo Domingo, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Rio Group of Latin American nations admitted impoverished Haiti as a member on Friday, strengthening regional ties with a volatile Caribbean nation struggling to overcome economic and political gridlock. The poorest country in the Americas, French- and Creole-speaking Haiti had long been excluded from regional groups as it battled decades of political upheaval, dictatorship and military rule. It was admitted to the Caribbean Community (Caricom), an economic grouping of mostly English-speaking countries and territories, in 2002. The election of President Rene Preval in 2006 helped stabilize Haiti two years after populist leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted in a rebellion by armed gangs and former members of the disbanded army. Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis, who led a Haitian delegation to the Rio Group summit in the Dominican Republic, said the integration was an important event for his country as it faces tough challenges. Eighty percent of Haiti's nearly 9 million people live in poverty. "It is a great thing for Haiti to integrate with the Rio Group because those who share some of the same problems and struggles you are facing are more likely to understand your needs, feel your suffering and try to help," he told Reuters. The Rio Group was formed in 1986 in Rio de Janeiro to represent Latin American interests as an alternative to the U.S.-dominated Organization of American States. The group includes Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
