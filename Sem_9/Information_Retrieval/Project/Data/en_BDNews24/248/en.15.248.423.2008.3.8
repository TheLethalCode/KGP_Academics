<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com) The central and northwestern region of the country remains highly vulnerable to infection by the Nipah virus, recent research has said. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and the ICDDR,B jointly conducted the research, which found that Jan-May is the peak time for the spread of the deadly virus. The research has revealed at least five Nipah outbreaks in the country between 2001 and 2005, all occurring between the months of January and May. The research was carried out by earmarking a region for surveillance where Nipah outbreaks have repeatedly been reported. Director of ICDDR,B Dr Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "The 'Nipah Belt' region has often been hit by the virus since 2001. We identified cases of person-to-person transmission." "Bats also carry the virus," Dr Mahmudur said. Ten hospitals were involved in the research. The study shows nine areas in the 'Nipah Belt' were badly hit by the virus since 2001. At least 90 people died among 131 infected people in the marked region. According to the Directorate of Health, a dozen people have been infected by the deadly virus during the last week in Faridpur and Thakurgaon. Six of the infected people died and three are being treated in Dhaka. The study suggested basic preventive measures such as washing hands after contact with a patient infected by the virus. The virus was first detected in the Nipah region of Malaysia in 1998-1999, from which it took its name. At least 100 people died in Malaysia in the original outbreak. bdnews
