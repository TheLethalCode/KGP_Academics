<TITLE> Report speaks of 'novel' fraud in Saudi Arabia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 07 (bdnews24.com)A government probe report has mentioned a new way of cheating adopted by a section of Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia. "Before returning from Saudi Arabia, the workers destroy their legal documents and surrender to the police as destitute. The police then house them in deportation centres and the Saudi government sends them back to Bangladesh at its own expense," the report said. "Thus they don't have to pay airfare." Expatriates' welfare and overseas employment secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury Friday told bdnews24.com that the Bangladeshis, despite taking the air ticket charge from employers, turn themselves in to police to save the amount. "No doubt such practices have been tarnishing the image of Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia," Matin said. The secretary said the Saudi government was carrying out regular operations against law breakers from no matter what country. He claimed that no Bangladeshis with legal documents was arrested or harassed by the Saudi police. According to the report, prepared by the labour wing of the Bangladesh mission in Riyadh, as many as 616 Bangladeshis had been detained by Saudi police until January. Of them, 286 were arrested on charges of criminal activities. The report also identified the causes of arrest of Bangladeshis: living in Saudi Arabia on a hajj visas, serving a company other than the original recruiting firm, lack of work permit and overstaying. The expatriates' welfare ministry at a recent meeting decided that the minimum wages for Bangladeshi workers must be 55o Saudi Riyal (Tk 10,029) with free meals and accommodation. The wages must be 750 Saudi Riyal if the recruiting company provides only accommodation. The wages must be 950 Riyal if the company does not provide accommodation and meals. If the companies do not pay the amounts, the ministry will not allow Bangladeshis to go to Saudi Arabia, according to the decision. There are over 17.5 lakh Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia. Bangladeshi workers in the kingdom get, in some cases, as low as 330 Riyal a month, but they spend over Tk 3 lakh to get a job there. Low wages are believed to be part of the reason for Bangladeshis getting involved in criminal and illegal activities in Saudi Arabia. The expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry asked the Bangladesh embassy to prepare a report on the status of Bangladeshi workers in the kingdom. bdn
