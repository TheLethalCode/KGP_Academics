<TITLE> No going back on Kosovo, says Ahtisaari </TITLE>

 HELSINKI, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo's independence is irreversible and Serbia is damaging its own interests by not accepting it, former UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari said. "There is no return to the past. Kosovo is now independent and it will start seeking membership in the international financial institutions to improve its economy as its first priority," Ahtisaari told Reuters in an interview. The former Finnish president spent 18 months trying to find a compromise between Serbia and the 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which declared Kosovo independent last month. His plan for independence, with guarantees of Serb minority rights, is now being implemented over the protests of Serbia which has vowed never to recognise its southern province as a separate republic. Ahtisaari said Serbia had lost Kosovo in June 1999 when NATO troops took over the territory to end their ethnic cleansing of the Albanians in a counter-insurgency war. Kosovo has been run by the United Nations ever since. Serbia should now look to the future instead of jeopardising its chances of European Union membership by active resistance. Already by 2005, he said, 47 percent of the Serbian population said in opinion polls they had lost Kosovo. "So population seems to be wiser than the political leadership in that country." Serbia, backed by Russia, says Kosovo's independence is illegal and says it will not recognise an EU mission to be deployed in Kosovo in the coming weeks, replacing the U.N. mission. Ahtisaari said Russia was a constructive member of the six-power Contact Group which guided Kosovo diplomacy for most of the past decade, and had agreed to many statements which it now seemed to have forgotten. "What worries me even more, and I have said it to my Russian friends, is that their behaviour in the Security Council has prevented agreement in the Council and that has undermined ... the role of the Security Council." The Contact Group includes United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- which have all recognised Kosovo. "At the end of January 2006, Contact Group members, including Russia, accepted that the solution for Kosovo had to be accepted by Kosovo. And if 90 percent of them are Kosovo Albanians, we know what the outcomes are," Ahtisaari said. He said it was important for Kosovo to quickly become a member of international financial institutions to get started with infrastructure investments. "They need to become members of international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The UN can come later, that is not so important if some countries are causing a proble
