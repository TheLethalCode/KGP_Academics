Developing countries such as India and China are already trying to reduce their carbon emissions, mainly to save on energy, but have baulked at doing more without technological and financial help from Europe, Japan and the United States. Dervis also said that while the private sector involvement could come from the developing countries themselves, it should be supported by international financing mechanisms. "We must build incentives that if you come up with a technology that does reduce emissions, you profit from it," he said, adding that by doing so rich countries would win as well. "If rich country companies can get some of the emission reductions indirectly by investing in poor countries, you have a solution whereby they continue to produce more profitably at home, but also lead towards cleaner energy wor
