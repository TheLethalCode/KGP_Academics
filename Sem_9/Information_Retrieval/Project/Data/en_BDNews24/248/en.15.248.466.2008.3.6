 Mar 5, LOS ANGELES (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Chinese-born actress Bai Ling, arrested last month on suspicion of shoplifting at Los Angeles International Airport, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to disturbing the peace. The 37-year-old actress, who has appeared in such films as "The Crow" and "Red Corner," faces a fine of several hundred dollars in the case, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office said. She was arrested at the airport on February 13 and booked on suspicion of shoplifting after a gift shop employee accused her of stealing two magazines and a pack of batteries. Born in Chengdu, China, she appeared in Chinese films before moving to the United States in the 1990s and landing her first major Hollywood film role in "The Crow." She is often credited for her performances as Ling Bai. The actress has since had roles in numerous Hollywood movies such as "Red Corner," "Anna and the King" and "Lords of Dogtown." She recently appeared on the U.S. television series "Lost."
