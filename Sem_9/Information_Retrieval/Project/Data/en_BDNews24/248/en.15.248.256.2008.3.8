 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  Patients at a number of hospitals in the capital faced troubles Saturday because of power outages, DESA officials and doctors said. There was no electricity at Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Shaheed Suhrawardy Hospital, the National Institute of Traumatic Orthopoedics and Rehabilitation (NITOR) and the National Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases (NICVD) from Saturday morning. Executive engineer Mujibur Rahman of Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority, Sher-e-Bangla office, told bdnews24.com: "There has been no electricity since morning. We are trying to repair the line." "We are resolving the power problem at Suhrawardy Hospital and NICVD." The two hospitals are on the same premises in the Sher-e-Bangla area of the city. "Then we will move toward NITOR and the Shishu Hospital," Mujibur Rahman said. A DESA official, not wishing to be named, said a cable had caught fire at NITOR at 5.40 am that caused a power failure. Dr Uttam Kumar Barua, an assistant registrar at Suhrawardy Hospital, told bdnews24.com: "Patients have been standing in queues since morning. The power shortage is disrupting the regular medical services at the hospital." "We don't have proper arrangements to operate a generator. But it is necessary for a hospital to carry out emergency medical procedures," Dr Uttam said. Hospital director Dr Khadiza Begum told bdnews24.com: "The power shortage is hampering the normal activities." "The machines which are run by power remain closed at this time." "As the government has stopped the diesel supply to our hospital we cannot operate a generator." Alamgir Hasan, a relative of a patient at Shishu Hospital said: "The patients have been suffering." "The child patients who need oxygen are not being provided with the necessary supply," he told bdnews24.com. bdnews24.c
