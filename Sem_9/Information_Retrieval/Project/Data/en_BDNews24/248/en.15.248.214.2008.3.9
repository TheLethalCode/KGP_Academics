<TITLE> Japan's opposition still opposes Muto as BOJ chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition Democratic Party, which has the power to block the nomination of a new Bank of Japan chief in parliament, said on Sunday it still opposed the government's nominee, current deputy governor Toshiro Muto. A political wrangle over the nomination has dented the government's credibility and raised concern about a policy vacuum -- at a time of global market turmoil and fears of a recession in Japan -- once Governor Toshihiko Fukui retires on March 19. Resistance to Muto centres on the fact that he was previously a vice finance minister at the Ministry of Finance (MOF), a top bureaucratic position. Some opposition lawmakers say appointing such a person would undermine the central bank's independence. "We are not saying all the former finance ministry officials are unsuitable. But Muto is like Mr. MOF, who served as a vice finance minister for 2- years," Democratic Party executive Naoto Kan said on NHK television. "We have been calling for separation between fiscal and monetary policy and we did not support him when he was nominated for deputy governor. That stance remains basically unchanged," he added. Kan, one of several top party officials who will probably decide the Democrats' vote along with party leader Ichiro Ozawa, said the party's final decision would be made after parliamentary hearings to question Muto on Tuesday. But he added: "Unless (hearings) contain new things that require us to change our minds drastically, our basic stance will remain unchanged." The Democrats, along with smaller opposition parties, control the upper house of parliament. Both houses need to approve the appointment of a BOJ governor and deputy governors, so the opposition can block Muto's nomination. TALKS ON AN ALTERNATIVE? Democratic Party Secretary General Yukio Hatoyama was quoted by media as saying on Saturday that party leader Ozawa could hold talks with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on the BOJ leadership if the premier withdrew Muto's name and came up with another candidate. Fukuda said last week he was open to talks with Ozawa. There have been no direct talks between the two since they met last year to discuss the idea of forming a grand coalition. That went nowhere after it caused outrage within the Democratic Party. If Muto is voted down, former BOJ deputy governor Yutaka Yamaguchi has been floated as an alternative. On Friday the government put forward Masaaki Shirakawa, a former BOJ official, and academic Takatoshi Ito as deputy governors. The terms of Muto and fellow deputy governor Kazumasa Iwata also end on March 19. If a replacement is not found for Fukui by his retirement date, a temporary governor would step in. Analysts say it is unlikely that a stopgap governor would take long-term decisions. If parliament approves Shirakawa and Ito as deputy governors, one of them could serve as acting governor. The BOJ law says if the posts of deputy governors are also vacant, the governor's role will be taken on temporarily by an executive director. In that event, Nobuo Inaba, a BOJ executive director, may serve as temporary governor, the Sankei newspaper reported on Sunday.
