 Dhaka, Mar 07 (bdnews24.com)The country's bourses have witnessed rising indices and surging turnover and trade volume over the past week, boosted by heavy buying. Dhaka stocks declined Sunday after investors sold off to lock in profits. Market experts said the fall was anticipated as indices went up on the closing day of the previous week. Indices and turnover started to rise from the second day of the week and continued until Thursday, driven by heavy buying. Analysts termed the trend positive and said the market finally started to shake off the gloomy trend and "weeks of unexpected behaviour". "The market succeeded to ride out the odds it had been witnessing for weeks. The indices went up. Turnover and volume increased and the turnover board showed some new issues, which was a positive sign," said an official of Latif Securities. Meanwhile, some market watchers cited the upward trend ahead of an IPO 'unusual'. Delta BRAC Housing Finance Corporation (DBH) is floating 5 lakh shares at a face value of Tk 100 each and a premium value of Tk 110. IPO subscription closed Thursday. "The market usually remains calm in the pre-IPO phase, as investors sell off or hold their cash to put money in the IPO," said Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed. Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of AIMS of Bangladesh, cited a possible reason for the unusual trend. "Perhaps the funds are pouring in because merchant bankers are now more relaxed about issuing loans after their meeting with the regulator which has led the market to heat up," he had told bdnews24.com. DSE's weekly turnover rose to Tk 12.29 billion from Tk 8.46 billion the previous week. Daily average turnover slipped to Tk 2.45 billion from last week's Tk 1.69 billion. The benchmark DGEN or general index opened on 2931.38 Sunday and rose 59.99 points or 2.05 percent over the week to close at 2991.37 Thursday. The DSI or all share price index was at 2528 on the week's closing day, advancing 51.63 points or 2.08 percent from the opening day's 2476.37. The bourse's blue chip DSE-20 closed at 2294.88 Thursday, up 20.84 points or 0.90 percent from Sunday's 2339.15. Market capitalisation also rose 1.68 percent from the opening day's Tk 804.213 billion to Tk 817.732 billion on the last trading day. The week's often-talked-about issue was the DSE polls to elect four directors. The election was originally scheduled for March 9, but was postponed due to withdrawal of nominations by all the nine candidates. Three candidates withdrew from the race on Feb 24, the last date for withdrawal of candidature, while six pulled out earlieron Feb 20. A new schedule announced from a DSE board meeting Tuesday set the election for May 11. The submission of nomination papers begin Wednesday and will continue through April 10. Nominations may be withdrawn up to April 22. The DSE board holds 12 elected and 12 nominated directors. Four elected directors retire from the post each year to be replaced through direct election. They are elected for a three-year term, according to the DSE constitution. Earlier in the week, DSE's Sunday board meeting deferred its 46th annual general meeting to May 15. As per the DSE constitution the annual election must be held before the AGM, previously scheduled for March 13. The Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms authorised the deferral of the AGM on Feb 28, asking the DSE to hold the meeting by June 15. bdn
