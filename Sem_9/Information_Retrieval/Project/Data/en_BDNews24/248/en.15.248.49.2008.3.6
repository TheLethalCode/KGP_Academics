<TITLE> Australia's Rudd visits PNG to build Pacific ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Port Moresby, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made his first official visit to Papua New Guinea on Thursday to repair ties with South Pacific island nations and promote security and democracy in the troubled region. Rudd received a ceremonial welcome at Port Moresby's main airport from dancers in traditional tribal costume. But security was tight as soldiers patrolled the area. Rudd will meet Prime Minister Michael Somare and is expected to discuss security in PNG, which is struggling to combat violent crime and climate change, which is a major issue with parts of the country threatened by rising sea levels. Democracy in Fiji, which has been ruled by a coup leader since 2006, was another top issue. Analysts said Rudd's trip, the first to the South Pacific since he won power last November after 12 years of conservative rule in Australia, should lead to more cooperation between Canberra and its Pacific island neighbours. "There is a sense in the Pacific that Australia is condescending. Rudd is trying to approach them on the basis of a regional neighbour who is concerned and willing to assist," international relations analyst Michael McKinley told Reuters. PNG is a Melanesian country of about 6 million people from 700 different clan groups, most of whom live a subsistence village life despite the country's vast mineral wealth. Australia is the biggest aid donor to PNG, spending A$355 million ($332 million) a year. On Saturday, Rudd will visit the nearby Solomon Islands, where Australia has about 200 police and troops as part of an international mission sent in 2003 to maintain law and order after the country nearly collapsed. Australia considers PNG, the Solomon Islands and Fiji to be part of an arc of instability due to volatility, crime and ethnic violence in the region. Fiji, for instance, has had a series of coups and army rebellions since 1987. Australia's former government angered Pacific islands nations with its determination to stamp out corruption under an interventionist policy designed to stop states from failing and becoming havens for criminals and foreign militants. Canberra's relationship with PNG broke down in 2006 after a man wanted in Australia on child sex charges evaded extradition after being flown out of PNG on a military aircraft, and with Somare accusing Canberra of interfering in domestic affairs. REBUILDING TIES PNG's Post Courier newspaper said Rudd's visit was an opportunity for both nations to put aside previous tensions. "The new Labor government and PNG government must recourse the colonial mindset to see Papua New Guinea as equal partners in development, security and one of existence through geo-strategic co-existence," the paper said in an editorial on Thursday. The former Australian government under prime minister John Howard had also wanted to send police to PNG to help control crime and violence, but the plan was shelved when the country refused to offer the police immunity from prosecution. Somare's government has put the police deployment back on the agenda since Rudd's election, but wants the police to be under the command of the PNG government. "We very much support an ECP (Enhanced Cooperation Programme) scheme, but by our terms," PNG Internal Security Minister Sani Rambi told the Post Courier newspaper. McKinley, from the Australian National University, said PNG and Pacific island nations were relieved at the change of government in Australia, while talks on sending Australian police back to PNG were a positive step. "The one thing Australia can't afford is to have these places in a state of civil strife," McKinley said.
