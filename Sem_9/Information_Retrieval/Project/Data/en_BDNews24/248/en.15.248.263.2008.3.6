 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has suspended the hearing on the writ petitions filed by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and former Chhatra Dal leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim on the Election Commission dialogue until Monday. A High Court bench of Justice Mirza Hossein Haider and Justice Mamnun Rahman passed the order Thursday after hearing the petitions for a fifth day. Participating in the hearing on behalf of the Election Commission, Dr Kamal Hossain said: "Writ jurisdiction is not an appellate forum for deciding the decision involving the interpretation of the party constitution on internal affairs of a political party." "The political party itself will have to settle its internal feud. This cannot be the subject of a writ petition." Dr Kamal also said: "The High Court issued a rule nisi on the Election Commission to explain why the EC notice on inviting Hafizuddin Ahmed (disputed secretary general of the BNP) to dialogue will not be declared illegal." "The notice has been cancelled later. Besides the date for dialogue, set for Nov 22, has also expired. So the writ petition has become ineffective." The High Court also issued a rule nisi asking the Election Commission to explain why BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain will not be invited to dialogue. "The BNP constitution gave Khaleda Zia absolute powers over the party. If the issue such as this is settled in court it will amount to giving a decision on a political matter. It will not be appropriate for the High Court to do a judicial review of a political matter in writ jurisdiction," Dr Kamal said. Another High Court bench on a writ petition by Khaleda on Nov 18 suspended the efficacy of the letter written to retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed by the Election Commission on inviting him to dialogue. The EC on Nov 5 last year in a letter invited Hafiz to take part in the dialogue on Nov 22. The court issued a rule nisi on the EC and six members of the BNP standing committee to explain why the letter would not be declared illegal and an order will not be issued to invite Delwar to the dialogue. Before the letter was issued, the High Court on Nov 4 on another writ petition by barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim issued a rule nisi on the EC asking it to explain why it would not be directed to invite the BNP to dialogue following law, tradition and party constitution. Senior advocate TH Khan on behalf of the writ petitioner was present in court during the hearing. bdnew
