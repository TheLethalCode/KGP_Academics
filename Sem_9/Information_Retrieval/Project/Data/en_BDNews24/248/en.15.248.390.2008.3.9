 HAMILTON, New Zealand, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's 189-run victory over England in the first test on Sunday was the most satisfying of Daniel Vettori's international career, the captain said. "I think we put in a complete performance for five days," Vettori told reporters. "What we did was bowled well and set up a good total in the first innings. That's the way you go about winning test cricket. "It's something we haven't done that well and to step up and do it against a very good England team and win is probably my most satisfying test win over the long time that I have played." Pace bowler Kyle Mills ripped the top off the England batting order, reducing them to 36 for four at lunch chasing 300 for the victory, before Martin took three wickets in the afternoon session to seal the win. "Looking back on it, every day we won key situations. On the first day we were 190 for five and Brendon (McCullum) came out and took the momentum away," he said of the wickekeeper's 51 off 55 balls. "Then Roscoe (Ross Taylor) and I had a big partnership. Even today we took a little bit of momentum away from England with some quick runs and the declaration. "I think we were on top for the majority of it and we would be a very unhappy team if we weren't in this position that we are now.
