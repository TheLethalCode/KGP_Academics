 SYDNEY, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Returning leg spinner Stuart MacGill has pledged that he will be selected for Australia's tour of the West Indies in May. MacGill, who has been recovering from surgery on his right bowling wrist, is due to make his first-class return for New South Wales later this week. His return to action will be more than welcomed by the Australian selectors, who are without an experienced frontline spinner after Brad Hogg retired following the one-day triangular series. Hogg himself had replaced MacGill in the test side when the 37-year-old underwent surgery to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome. "I've always been on the plane to the West Indies, from my point of view," MacGill told reporters. "I know that might sound a bit arrogant but I think it's really important for me to treat things as business as usual. "When sportsmen start making such a big deal of their goals, it can become all-consuming. My most important goal will be achieved tomorrow -- playing for New South Wales." He added: "I've played a lot more for the Blues than I have for Australia. But by the same token I know that when I'm playing for the Blues I've got a good record and that, I'm pretty sure, will get me an international match every now and then." MacGill admitted he had felt some trepidation before he played club cricket in Sydney. "I was very, very nervous before I bowled a ball because I wasn't sure if I was ready to go yet but very shortly into my first spell I knew I was ready to play state cricket. "I've been pretty keen to go for a couple of weeks now.
