<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 06 (bdnews24.com)The first national haor conference was organised Thursday to search for comprehensive policies to safeguard the system of wetlands in the country and the livelihoods people living off them. The conference also called for the creation of a database on haor resources to preserve and develop the unique wetland ecosystem. Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman, former caretaker government chief, inaugurated the conference. Rahman said creating an appropriate haor development plan would make it possible to harvest fish worth around Tk 1,500 crore from the wetlands in Bangladesh. "The haor environment is seriously threatened today. Neglecting this ecosystem will result in irreparable losses to the country's overall environment and agricultural production," he said. "A comprehensive and integrated haor development policy has to be made to protect the livelihood, culture and heritage of about 20 million people dependent on the 423 haors of the north-eastern region of the country." Rahman, also a former chief justice, said many of the country's rivers and important wetlands had dried up or been seriously degraded due to large-scale encroachment by members of the local elite and inappropriate policies. BUET vice-chancellor Prof AMM Safiullah said irreparable damage had been caused to the haors' biodiversity in recent times. "People living in the haors are plundering the wetlands resources instead of using them in a sustainable manner," Safiullah said. Former finance minister Abul Mal Abdul Muhit stressed the need for integrating haor development plans with the overall national development to ensure economic growth and a reversal of recent harmful trends. bdnews
