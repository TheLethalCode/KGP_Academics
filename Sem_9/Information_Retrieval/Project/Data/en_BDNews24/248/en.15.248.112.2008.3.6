<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme court has granted leave to appeal against a High Court verdict that ruled illegal the appointment of acting law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal. The six-member Appellate Division bench led by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim gave the verdict Thursday on twin applications filed by Awal and the government seeking permission to challenge the HC verdict. The Supreme Court also ordered that the suspension of the High Court verdict would also continue. Appellate Division chamber judge MA Matin on Feb 19 ordered a status quo on the High Court verdict until February 26 on appeals by Awal and the government. The Supreme Court full bench on Feb 26 suspended until March 3 the HC verdict. Earlier on Feb 18, the High Court on a writ petition by retired district and sessions judge Md Aftabuddin declared the appointment of the acting law secretary illegal and without lawful authority. Awal, additional secretary of the law ministry, was appointed acting law secretary on June 28 last year. Aftabuddin, on July 5 last year, filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the validity of the appointment. The High Court on July 7 asked the government and Awal to explain why the appointment would not be declared illegal. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed represented the government at the hearing at the Appellate Division Thursday, while Dr Kamal Hossain and barrister Amir-ul Islam stood for the law secretary. Ajmalul Haq QC participated in the hearing on behalf of the writ petitioner Md Aftabuddin. bdnew
