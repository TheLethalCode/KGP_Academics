<TITLE> Japan govt picks Muto for central bank: lawmaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Japanese government put forward deputy central bank governor Toshiro Muto on Friday as the next head of the Bank of Japan, a senior ruling party lawmaker said, raising the prospect of a showdown with the opposition. A political wrangle over the governor nomination has dented the government's credibility and raised fears of a policy vacuum at the Bank of Japan, whose current governor, Toshihiko Fukui, is due to retire in less than two weeks. The names of compromise candidates had been floated, but Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Takashi Sasagawa said the government had nominated Muto, 64 -- long seen as the government's favoured candidate. He was also the pick of the markets, polls showed, despite the risk the opposition may veto the nomination. Some opposition lawmakers say a former senior bureaucrat such as Muto may be too close to the government. "We have been saying at informal meetings that it would be hard to accept Muto if he is nominated," Kenji Yamaoka, parliamentary affairs chief of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters. The nomination came as the central bank left interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent at Fukui's last policy board meeting as governor. With Fukui's retirement imminent and global markets in turmoil, ministers called for an end to political rows over the appointment. The political deadlock has prompted talk of a policy vacuum if parliament cannot agree who should replace Fukui. "We cannot allow any policy vacuum with the BOJ governor at a time when global economic conditions are unstable," Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga told a news conference on Friday. "I hope both houses of parliament will take the proper steps." RECESSION RISK Opposition parties can block Muto because they control parliament's upper house, which must approve the appointment. If he gets past the political hurdle, Muto will take charge of the central bank at a time when growth in Japan is stumbling, thanks to the credit crunch that has raised fears of a U.S. recession. Some economists say Japan, the world's second-biggest economy, may already be in recession and the BOJ may need to cut its already very low interest rates this year. If a replacement is not found by Fukui's retirement date of March 19, a temporary governor would step in. But it is unlikely that a stopgap governor would be able to take long-term decisions, analysts say. bdn
