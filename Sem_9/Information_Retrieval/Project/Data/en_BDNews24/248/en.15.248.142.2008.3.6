<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has served a show-cause recently on outgoing Mohammad Rafique because of a code of conduct breach. Left-arm spinner Rafique retired from international cricket after the second and final Test between Bangladesh and visiting South Africa in Chittagong. Rafique was asked to reply by Saturday, confirmed BCB cricket operation chairman, Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu Thursday. "It is right that Rafique retired from international cricket, but he is still a contracted player of the board and still has two and a half months of his six-month contract left. So, he is still governed by the board's code of conduct," Lipu told bdnews24.com. On the eve of the second Test against South Africa on Feb 28, Rafique told reporters that he was being forced to retire from international cricket because of a group of people, whom, he said, didn't like him. "I have decided to quit cricket as mark of my protest against a group people in the Bangladesh Cricket Board, who do not like to see me in squads," added the 37-year-old cricketer at a press conference. "These officials who did not allow me to play test cricket for nearly three years, are now back on the board. So, I have decided to quit and I don't want to play on anyone's blessings," said Rafique, the first Bangladesh player to complete the double of 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in one-day internationals and Tests. Lipu said that they also sent some clippings to Rafique including those on his "controversial comments." Asked why they had served the notice so late, the former Bangladesh skipper said, "We didn't want to spoil his concentration on the eve of his last Test and wanted him to complete the match successfully." "But, there is no doubt that his comments were against the spirit of cricket," said Lipu. Rafique has scored 1059 runs and took 100 wickets playing 33 Tests since his debut against India in Dhaka in November 2000. He had made 1191 runs, and grabbed 125 wickets in as many ODIs since his first appearance against India in Sharjah in 1995. bdn
