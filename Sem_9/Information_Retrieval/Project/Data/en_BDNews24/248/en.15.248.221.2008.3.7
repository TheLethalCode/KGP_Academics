<TITLE> Old wounds reopen for World Bank`s chief economist </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Old wounds for the newly appointed World Bank chief economist Justin Lin Yifu reopened on Friday when he was forced to confront his defection from Taiwan to China three decades ago. Lin, a Peking University professor, was asked by reporters on the sidelines of China's annual meeting of parliament about the day he swam across from a Taiwan-controlled island off China's southeast coast, and when he thought he might be allowed to return. More accustomed to talking about economics, Lin seemed to have difficulty getting his words out when the subject of his father came up. His father died almost six years ago and the Taiwan government refused to let Lin return for the funeral. "This is a question I've actually always wished to avoid, because it's something that's very hard to face up to," he told a packed news conference. "The Tomb Sweeping Festival is almost upon us, and that's what I really want to do," Lin added, referring to a traditional Confucian Chinese holiday when relatives tend to their ancestors' graves. "I hope to return as a native son of Taiwan," he said, before his words trailed off. "Let's talk about this later," Lin added awkwardly, declining to comment further. Lin is well-known in Taiwan for opting to attend a military academy instead of the prestigious National Taiwan University and then defecting to China in 1979. At the time, the island was under martial law and ruled by the Nationalists who fled there after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. While serving in the army he swam to the southeastern Chinese port city of Xiamen from the tiny Taiwan-controlled Kinmen, or Quemoy, using basketballs, according to Taiwan media, to keep him afloat. But this was firmly denied by his wife, Chen Yunying, who later joined him in China and is now a member of China's largely rubber-stamp parliament, representing Taiwan, even though nobody in Taiwan voted her into that position. "Some of the reports, especially about the basketballs, are not true," Chen said, sitting next to her husband. "He can swim very well ... He doesn't need basketballs. "Nobody could cross over with basketballs. If they could, there'd be no need to buy tickets for the boat from Kinmen," she added, in reference to the limited transport links now permitted between Taiwan and China, which still considers the island its own. "Please, give my husband some respect," Chen said to laughter. Lin did not talk directly about his defection, ignoring a question about how long he had to swim for. China has never trumpeted his defection. "They have understood me," he said simply of his former colleagues and classmates back in Taiwan. "I want to say thank you to my friends in a former life."
