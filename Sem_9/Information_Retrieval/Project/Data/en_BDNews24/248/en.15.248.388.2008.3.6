 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - F&C Asset Management reported higher-than-expected earnings on Thursday and said the firm would look at all possible options as majority shareholder Friends Provident considers selling its stake. F&C said its 2007 underlying earnings per share fell to 10.4 pence, ahead of analysts' forecasts of around 9.4 pence, from 12.8 pence a year ago as assets under management fell. However, performance fees surged 119 percent to 20.8 million pounds. Underlying pretax profit was 77.3 million pounds, compared with 88.7 million pounds a year ago. The proposed final dividend is 4.0 pence, making a total for the year of 6.0 pence, down from 11.0 pence in 2006. The 140 year-old investment firm, whose 52 percent shareholder Friends Provident confirmed in January it may sell its stake, declined to comment on whether F&C or Friends had received any offers, and said all options were still open, including a management buyout. "Is an MBO on the table? ... We will obviously look at all possible alternatives to create shareholder value," Chief Executive Alain Grisay said on a conference call to journalists. "This is not a firesale ... (But) it is in everybody's interest to keep this as short as possible." In January Grisay said F&C had excellent prospects as a standalone company. However, the firm said on Thursday that uncertainty surrounding Friends Provident, Friends Provident's possible sale of its stake in F&C and deteriorating market conditions meant the timing of growth expected in a three-year turnaround plan it announced last year was less certain. "There is an element of distraction linked to this uncertainty," said Grisay. "There's (also) no doubt that the current market environment is much more challenging than it was 12 months ago ... What is happening now vindicates the strategy of having a very diverse range of products." At 0845 GMT F&C's shares were 0.9 percent lower at 173.25 pen
