 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) - New coach Abu Yousuf wants to give room to those footballers able to go through the 90 minutes in the AFC Challenge Cup and the SAFF Championship matches. "I would like to give room those players who are fully fit and able to play throughout the 90 minutes, and I would not mind whether they are juniors or seniors," Yousuf told reporters at his signing ceremony at the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) House Wednesday. The BFF Wednesday signed up Yousuf to coach the national team until the SAFF Championship, scheduled June 3 to 14 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The former national player-turned-coach will also guide the national side in upcoming qualifying round of the AFC Challenge Cup, scheduled for May 5-10 in Kyrgyzstan. BFF president SA Sultan expressed happiness to have involved the local coach with the national team after a long time. The BFF also appointed Golam Rabanni Choton as Yousuf's deputy. The national footballers have been out of training since November after the BFF came to an end with Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin because of the six- month deferment of the SAFF Championship. The BFF high-ups then told reporters that they would recall Nayeemuddin soon after the rescheduled fixture of the SAFF Championship. When attention was drawn to the promise, the BFF president said, "Actually, we didn't make any promise. We realised that Yousuf is the man who is able to bring result in our favour and we have gave him the responsibility." Yousuf, the former national defender, takes the AFC Challenge Cup as a preparatory tournament for the SAFF Championship. He believes all should concentrate on prestige meets like SAFF Championship. The BFF president said that they had decided to hold the camp in Cox's Bazar so that the booters could easily cope with conditions during the SAFF Championship in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Yousuf guided the national U-19, 20, 23 and women's team. Besides, he coached the national team in two friendly matches against Qatar Olympic team and Qatar national team in 1998, and his side drew both the matches against the superior rivals. Bangladesh were placed in Group C along with hosts Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Laos in the qualifying round of the AFC Challenge Cup, scheduled for May 5-10. In the SAFF Championship, Bangladesh were drawn in Group B along with co-hosts Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Bhutan, scheduled for June 3 to 14 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
