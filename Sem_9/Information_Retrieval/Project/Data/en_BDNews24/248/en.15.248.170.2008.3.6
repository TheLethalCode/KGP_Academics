<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  The results of the 27th BCS examinations are not likely to be published within the coming year, the Public Service Commission chairman said Thursday. "It will not be possible for us to publish the results of the 27th BCS exams in the next one year as there are so many cases against the commission pending trial," PSC boss Saadat Hussain said. "We are not certain when the cases will be resolved," he said, adding that the cases are disrupting the regular activities of the commission. "The viva voce of the current BCS exam will be finished in May, but the PSC will have to delay publishing the results," the chairman said. bdnews24.c
