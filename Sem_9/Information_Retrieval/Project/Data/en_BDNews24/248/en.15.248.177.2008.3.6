<TITLE> Beckham likely to get 100th England cap, says Capello </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham will get his 100th England cap as long as he is fit and in form, manager Fabio Capello told national team fans on Wednesday. "I know Beckham very well from Real Madrid and I hope David will play the 100th game and get that cap," Capello told representatives of the official England supporters club. "He will get his 100th cap if he is fit and in form." Beckham was left out of Capello's first squad for the friendly against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium last month because Major League Soccer (MLS) was in its close season and the midfielder was by not match-fit. Speaking mostly in English on Wednesday, Capello said he or his assistant Franco Baldini would travel to the United States this month to see the 32-year-old former England captain in action for his MLS club Los Angeles Galaxy. "I understand from reading his last interview that at this moment his fitness isn't good. I will phone him because I want to know exactly what he thinks. "Los Angeles play in Dallas on March 14 and Franco or I will go to see him and assess his fitness. "He is in contention for France. We will check on him in Dallas and then we will decide whether he will be fit for that squad," Capello was quoted as saying in British newspapers. SYMBOLIC CAPTAIN England face France in a friendly in Paris on March 26 but if that is too soon then Capello said Beckham can feel confident about winning his 100th cap, possibly in potential friendlies against the U.S. and Trinidad & Tobago in May and June. Capello was also asked who would be appointed permanent England captain after Steven Gerrard was given the armband on a temporary basis for the Switzerland match. The Italian said he would decide in time for the 2010 World Cup qualifying matches which start away to Andorra in September. "It's very important to choose the captain for the World Cup qualification games but I have to know not only the player but the man as well," Capello was quoted as saying on the FA Web site (www.thefa.com). "He must be a symbol of the England team. "To be that symbol he must be a good player, a good man and he has to represent the England team, always, in every situation.
