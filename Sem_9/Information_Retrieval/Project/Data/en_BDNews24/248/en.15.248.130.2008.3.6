 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistanis increasingly see talks with Islamist militants as the only way to end a rising tide of violence, but it's far from certain the militants want to listen. More than 500 people have been killed in violence since the beginning of this year, raising fears about stability in nuclear-armed Pakistan and presenting a new government being formed after elections last month with a daunting problem. "The only way is to have a dialogue," said a government official involved with policy in ethnic Pashtun tribal areas on the Afghan border, where militants fighting against both the Pakistani and Afghan governments are based. Under pressure from the United States and other countries battling the Taliban in Afghanistan, Pakistan has sent about 100,000 troops to tribal lands on the border but the attacks have only intensified. Militants have struck in all major Pakistani cities over the past year and they assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto as she left an election rally on Dec. 27. "We have used force for quite some time and have not been able to achieve anything," said the government official, who declined to be identified. "Any amount of force you bring in is only going to get sucked in." The opposition parties that won last month's parliamentary elections and are now forming federal and provincial governments have also said they want to push talks, although it is the military that calls the shots in the war on terror. A Pakistani Taliban spokesman said last week they would be ready for talks with a new government but days later Pakistanis were shocked when a suicide bomber attacked a traditional tribal council, or jirga, that had gathered to discuss security in the Darra Adam Kheil region in the northwest, killing 42 elders. "It's unprecedented. It's a statement about the lack of respect for local tribal decision-makers and the decision-making framework," said a Western diplomat. "We could be seeing a group of people distanced and disconnected from the traditional norms and customs who are sufficiently powerful they think they can survive blood feuds." FREE HAND There are also questions about who authorities might talk to. The militants are a diverse bunch from disaffected Pashtuns to sectarian militants from elsewhere in Pakistan to central Asian and Arab al Qaeda supporters. But central to any attempt to negotiate would be the jirga, the most respected institution in Pashtun society, where tribal elders have the moral authority to make binding decisions on issues such as peace and expelling the foreign militants. "The jirga is the only institution that can be effective, there's no other way," said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a veteran journalist and expert on Pashtun affairs based in the northwestern city of Peshawar. But the attack on the jirga appeared aimed at undermining any effort on talks. "When you attack jirgas it means others will think twice or thrice before becoming involved," Yusufzai said. Authorities have also tried making deals with militants and the Pashtun tribes, but critics including the United States say while the deals might see a brief fall-off in violence in an area, they also give the militants breathing space to regroup. "Every peace agreement has been in favour of the militants, they get a free hand to do what they want in Waziristan and across the border," Yusufzai said. Nevertheless, authorities struck a new deal in North Waziristan last month. The government official said it would give an opportunity to get aid in and win over the people. But while the United States has promised $750 million for the tribal areas, the official said little was being done. "We are not seeing any major activities as far as livelihood improvement or investment in the social or economic sectors. Nothing is coming in, that's where we're lagging," he said. The new government is unlikely to get much of a honeymoon from either the militants or the United States. "It's getting warm in Afghanistan and I know of plans by the Taliban for a lot of attacks," Yusufzai said. "If there are more attacks and the Americans realise there is some incursion from Pakistan they'll put pressure on the army and the government." Many Pakistanis already blame President Pervez Musharraf's alliance with the United States for the violence. And in a country rife with conspiracy theories, some even see the United States behind the violence in an effort, so the theory goes, to create chaos and provide an excuse to confiscate Pakistan's nuclear weapons. "In a society like this perceptions matter more than reality," said Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal areas. "Al Qaeda create doubts in the minds of the people. They are succeeding on the propaganda fron
