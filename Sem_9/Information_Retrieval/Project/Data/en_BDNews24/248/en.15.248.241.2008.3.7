 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)Bikalpadhara Bangladesh Friday renewed its demand for immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency. The party's secretary general Abdul Mannan urged the Election Commission to hold the polls immediately. "People have doubt whether the election will be held in December as per the roadmap announced by the Election Commission," he told reporters after a meeting with the leaders of the Ganotontri Party at the Bikalpadhara office on Topkhana Road. "Declare the election schedule as early as possible. Let the political activities start within two months and lift the emergency rule," said the retired major, who defected from the BNP to form Bikalpadhara. He said people were in doubt over whether there would be a farcical poll or one free from the influence of money and muscle power by December. He said, "People responsible for imposition of the state of emergency must not be allowed to contest the polls under any circumstances." "There is no alternative to a national dialogue for a meaningful election," said Nurul Islam, president of Ganotontri Party. He also urged the government to lift the state of emergency immediately. bdnews
