 Gaza, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian militants said they blew up an Israeli army jeep on the Gaza Strip border on Thursday. A witness said the jeep appeared to have been destroyed by the explosion at the Kissufim border crossing in central Gaza, and two tanks and an ambulance rushed to the scene. "I believe the jeep was destroyed, because it was consumed by flames," the witness, a local Palestinian, told Reuters. A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate details on the incident. Israeli forces withdrew from north Gaza on Monday after a sweep against Palestinian rocket crews that killed more than 125 people -- half of them civilians, according to medical officials. Fighting has persisted sporadically since.
