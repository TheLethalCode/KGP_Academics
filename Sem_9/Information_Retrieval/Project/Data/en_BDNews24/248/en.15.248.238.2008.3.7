 JERUSALEM, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel imposed a security clampdown on Jerusalem and the West Bank on Friday to prevent violence after a Palestinian gunman killed eight students at one of the holy city's most prominent Jewish religious schools. Thousands of mourners poured into Jerusalem to take part in open-air funerals for the victims, aged 15 to 26. Police set up road blocks and the army tightened restrictions on Palestinian travel in and from the occupied West Bank for 36 hours. The gunman, whose family in Arab East Jerusalem said he had once worked as a driver for the college, was shot dead after opening fire with an automatic rifle at students in the library. The Merkaz Harav seminary has long been an ideological base for the Jewish settler movement in the Palestinian territories. Police named the attacker as Ala Abu Dhaim, a driver. It was the bloodiest attack on Israelis in two years and the first such bloodshed in four years in Jerusalem, whose Arab residents have open access to Jewish parts of the city and the rest of Israel. Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, hailed the "heroic operation" but stopped short of claiming responsibility. The attack was greeted with celebrations in Gaza, where an Israeli offensive that ended on Monday killed more than 120 Palestinians, about half of them civilians. The gunman's home was decorated on Friday with the flags of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Islamist groups. None had claimed responsibility for the attack, however. Israel called Thursday's shooting a "massacre" but said peace talks would continue with West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who condemned the attack. CITY ON ALERT Israel deployed thousands of police in Jerusalem, spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said, and limited Palestinian access to Friday prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site. Police feared violence would break out in the Old City, where Jews and Muslims gathered for prayers. The al-Aqsa mosque overlooks the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The shooting could complicate U.S. efforts to broker a statehood deal by the end of 2008. It followed a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who persuaded Abbas to return to talks after suspending them over Israel's Gaza offensive. Washington has pressed Israel to ease travel restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank. Though the attacker did not come from there, the killing makes that less likely to happen soon. Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, called on Abbas to do more to rein in militants. "They have clear obligations to act against terrorist cells, to act against the infrastructure of terrorism," he said. "While we understand they have limitations on their capabilities today, we believe that they could be doing much more, and it is incumbent upon them to do so." Israel has yet to meet its own commitments under a long-stalled peace "road map" to halt all settlement activity and to remove Jewish outposts in the occupied West Bank. U.S. President George W. Bush, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Germany, France, Russia and Britain condemned the killings. The United States accused Libya, backed by several other countries, of preventing the U.N. Security Council from condemning the assault as a "terrorist attack". A member of the Libyan delegation said the council should not speak about the Jerusalem attack while ignoring Gaza. In addition to those killed at the seminary, 11 people were wounded. It was the highest Israeli death toll since April 17, 2006, when 11 people were killed and more than 60 wounded in a suicide bombing during the Passover holiday in Tel Aviv. In Lebanon, Hezbollah's al-Manar television carried a claim of responsibility from a previously unknown militant group, citing the cause of Israeli Arabs and people in Gaza. Hezbollah had blamed Israel for the assassination last month of its senior commander Imad Moughniyah, and threatened to retaliate. Early on Friday, a Palestinian farmer was shot and killed in the northern Gaza Strip near the border with Israel. Palestinian medics blamed Israeli soldiers. The army denied responsibili
