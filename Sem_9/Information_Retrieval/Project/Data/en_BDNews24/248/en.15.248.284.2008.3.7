<TITLE> North Korea far poorer than reported: expert </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Impoverished North Korea is far poorer than earlier estimates have shown with a per capita income that places it among the world's most destitute states, a former minister for managing relations with the North said on Friday. The South's Bank of Korea said last August that the North's economy in 2006 stood at $22.8 billion but the survey from Lee Jong-seok said the figure was closer to $9 billion. This means that the average North Korean makes the equivalent of about a dollar a day, which puts the North among the world's 25 poorest countries in terms of per capita income. But the Bank of Korea's estimate put annual per capita income at closer to $1,100, about the same as Nepal. "If you had the slightest bit of interest or knowledge about the North, you would have asked the question: 'In that case, why is the majority of North Koreans starving?'" Lee, who was Minister of Unification in 2006, said in a report published on Friday. Lee said the Bank of Korea's estimates were fundamentally flawed because they used a cost base applicable for the richer South and not the destitute North.
