 OSLO, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Norwegian Foreign Ministry official will be named the UN's new envoy to Afghanistan, Norway's NRK radio said on Thursday. It said that Kai Eide, a former Norwegian ambassador to NATO who has also worked a special UN envoy in the Balkans, would be appointed to the job to coordinate humanitarian work with a NATO-led military campaign.
