 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to 200,000 airport workers will be fingerprinted and issued with identity cards from the middle of 2009, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said Thursday. They will be the first British citizens to be required to have the cards, because of the high level of security needed for their jobs, she said. From 2010, students will be encouraged to apply voluntarily for the cards, which will store the holder's fingerprint on a chip. "It will make it easier to enrol on a course, apply for a student loan, open a bank account or prove your age," Smith told a London think-tank. "It is inconceivable that in today's world people should not have a single, safe way of securing and verifying their identity," she added. A widespread roll-out of the cards to all British citizens will follow from 2011 alongside the introduction of passports containing electronically stored fingerprints. That is a year later than previously planned and well after the next general election -- due by 2010 at the latest. Smith said the cards would prevent identity theft, tackle illegal immigration, fight terrorism and make it easier for people to access public services like healthcare. But civil rights groups and both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives say ID cards are unnecessary, expensive and an intrusion into private life. Both opposition parties say they will scrap the cards if they are elected. The cards will not be compulsory for British citizens -- although the airport staff will not be able to work without them. But they will be required for foreigners from outside the European Union staying in Britain on a visa. The government will start to issue ID cards to foreigners from November, with the fingerprints now taken for all visas transferred to the cards. Foreign students will be the first given the cards and 90 percent of all overseas citizens in Britain will have them by 2015. The government is phasing the scheme in until most of the population is covered before deciding whether to pass laws to make them compulsory. The cards will be offered to anyone who wants them from the end of 2010, said Smith, with the aim of achieving a full roll-out of the scheme by 2017, earlier than previous forecasts. The scheme, currently expected to cost 5.6 billion pounds over 10 years, would now be 1 billion pounds cheaper, she sa
