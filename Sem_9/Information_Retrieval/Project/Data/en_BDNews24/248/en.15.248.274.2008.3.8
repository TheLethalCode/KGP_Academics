 Ismailia, Egypt, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police shot a Sudanese man in the back on the Israeli border on Saturday when a group of migrants ignored their orders to stop and made a run for Israel, Egyptian security and medical sources said. The man, named as 24-year-old Zakaria Moussa, had a bullet removed from his back in hospital in the Egyptian town of El Arish and is in a stable condition, they added. The other four people in his group -- a Sudanese married couple and two Eritreans -- were caught and detained, the security sources added. In a separate incident on the same border but further south, Egyptian police caught two Eritrean women, a Sudanese woman, two Ghanaian men and a man from Ivory Coast trying to enter Israel. The Egyptian-Israeli border has become a favoured conduit fro African economic migrants seeking work in Israel. Egyptian police have shot several of them dead in the last few months.
