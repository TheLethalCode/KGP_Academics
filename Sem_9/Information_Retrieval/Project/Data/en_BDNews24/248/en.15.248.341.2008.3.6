<TEXT>
 Paris, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy has scotched rumours he is planning a major cabinet reshuffle and denied opposition accusations that a shock austerity budget package will be announced after local elections this month. In a wide-ranging interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Sarkozy promised to push ahead with his reform agenda despite his recent slump in the opinion polls, saying France's real economic problems stemmed from domestic structural faults. Sarkozy's centre-right allies are expected to suffer heavy losses at the municipal ballot on March 9 and 16 -- the first nationwide test of his popularity since the 2007 presidential and parliamentary vote. Opposition Socialist politicians have said the government will have to tighten its belt after the vote, as the economy is expected to grow by less than the government's 2.0-2.5 percent target this year and the deficit is likely to climb. "I don't believe in austerity plans. They don't go anywhere," Sarkozy was quoted as saying, adding that he would nonetheless press ahead with previously announced plans such as cutting back France's army of public sector workers. "Everyone must understand that France has to reduce its public spending,"Sarkozy said, shrugging off suggestions the international economic situation would impact his plans. "I never thought the problems with the French economy came primarily from abroad. They start here," he said. Sarkozy has suffered a dreadful start to the year, his ratings going into freefall thanks to voter dissatisfaction with his hyperactive style of government and with high inflation. MINISTERS SAFE .. FOR NOW A CSA poll published in Le Parisien newspaper on Thursday showed his popularity dropping four points to 38 percent, down from highs of 65 percent in August. "Certainly good opinion polls facilitate reforms while bad ones complicate them, but that doesn't change my goal. I am working to modernise France without letting myself get distracted by sideshows," he told Le Figaro. Unitl recently, government officials had indicated that Sarkozy wanted a major revamp of his government team after the local ballot in an effort to regain the political initiative. But Sarkozy ruled out any radical reshuffle until at least the end of the France's presidency of the European Union, which starts in July and ends on Dec. 31. "I want to put an end to this French illness of changing ministers every six months," he said. He also expressed full confidence in both Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his chief of staff at the Elysee Palace, Claude Gueant, whose own future has come into question following a series of blunders by the presidential inner circle. Sarkozy admitted there had been mistakes, but said there was no point dwelling on them. Instead he promised to remain focused on implementing change, including institutional reform. He said that after the local election, parliament would discuss strengthening its own role, including getting a say on the deployment of French troops abroad and on foreign policy issues -- both currently the president's preserve.
