Several market surveys forecast the number of mobile phone users will be around 50 million at the end of 2009. Top mobile phone company Grameenphone, majority owned by Norway's Telenor, has raised its subscriber base to 16.9 million from 16.7 million at the end of 2007. Egyptian Orascom Telecom's ORTE.CA Banglalink saw its customer base grow by 370,000 to 7.5 million. Aktel, majority owned by Telekom Malaysia International, ended January with 7.3 million from 6.4 million. Warid Telecom International of the United Arab Emirates, which launched Bangladesh operations in May 2007, added 220,000 users in Jaunary, taking its user base to 2.4 million.
