 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina faced charges in court Sunday in a graft case involving the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants. Prosecutors outlined the charges against Hasina in the special judge's court set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 adjourned the hearing until March 13, when the court is is set to hear from the defendant. Sunday's hearing began at 11am after the former prime minister was produced before the court. On March 3, a special judge's court had deferred proceedings until March 9, after defence lawyers submitted that they had not had sufficient time to look into the legal files and documents related to the case. The court earlier, on Feb 26, denied Sheikh Hasina bail in the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon police against eight people including Hasina. The case claims that the accused took bribes amounting to Tk 3 crore in exchange for awarding contracts for the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdnew
