 Kate Holton LONDON, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The bruised and bloodied music industry appears finally to be winning its battle to force Internet providers to act over illegal downloading, after years of seeing its wishes fall largely on deaf ears. Britain said on Friday it would impose legislation on Internet service providers (ISPs) in 2009 if they did not work with the music and film industries to curb illegal file-sharing. France has introduced a policy of denying Internet access to those who repeatedly download illegally. And in the United States, ISP Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O: Quote, Profile, Research) has complained that customers overwhelm the network by using file-sharing applications like BitTorrent. But the plan is hotly contested by British ISPs, who argue they are mere conduits and not responsible for content, while analysts caution that those engaged in piracy will simply discover new methods to share music without paying. The developments follow years of lobbying by the music industry -- which has been turned upside down by illegal downloading -- and latterly by calls for help from the powerful movie business. Global music sales fell around 10 percent in 2007 and the industry estimates that only one in 20 of the tracks downloaded was licensed, costing the industry potentially billions of dollars. "This is a major turning point," John Kennedy, the head of the international music trade body, the IFPI, told Reuters. "Three years ago I stood up in Brussels and appealed for help from the ISPs and initially I got a very warm reception. But since then there has been almost no cooperation." RAMPANT PIRACY The music and film industries argue that ISPs benefit from the songs and movies available online, making their Internet connection more valuable, but they have done little to counter the rampant piracy that can follow. Under one plan by the IFPI, the trade body would search peer-to-peer networks like Limewire to identify those heavily sharing files. It would then take a screen grab, noting the IP address, number of files shared and the time and date, which could be passed on to the ISP for a warning letter to be sent. If the user does not desist, they could lose their Internet connection. But a spokesman for ISPA, the body that represents ISPs, said there were many problems with the suggestion, such as who would pay for the enforcement. Nick McDonald, an intellectual property expert at law firm Browne Jacobson, also questioned what would stop infringers from simply joining another ISP. "A system of data exchange would need to be implemented and this would require unparalleled cooperation between competitors," he said. The music industry, and increasingly the movie business, has been forced to seek legal means after seeing piracy eat into its business. But high profile law cases around the world have yet to deter illegal downloaders. A report due out in the next few weeks by media law firm Wiggin and Entertainment Media Research suggests 70 percent of users who download unauthorized content said they would stop downloading illegally if they received an ISP warning. And that would be welcomed. The British Video Association estimates that online piracy in the download market alone costs the audio visual industry around 53 million pounds ($104 million). At the annual industry meeting in Cannes earlier this year, Janus Friis, who once terrified the media industry with file-sharing network KaZaa, said the music industry was beginning to move from "stick" to "carrot" approach, citing legal online services Last.fm and Imeem as leading examples. And Screen Digest music analyst Dan Cryan agrees that this is the route the industry needs to take. "I'm just not sure this ISP plan will change much regarding piracy," he told Reuters. "(There are) other systems that get around this, where you can't see who is uploading." "I'm afraid the horse has bolted and the only way the record industry is going to be able to contain piracy is to offer better services at a price that is right."
