<TITLE> Uganda rebel Kony to sign peace deal: mediator </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uganda's fugitive rebel leader Joseph Kony will emerge from hiding this month to sign a final peace agreement with the government, a mediator said on Thursday. Kony and two other commanders from his Lord's Resistance Army are wanted for multiple war crimes by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Fearing arrest, they have never shown their faces at the negotiations in Juba, south Sudan, and it was unclear whether the unpredictable Kony could be detained if he turned up now. LRA representatives and government officials signed the last in a string of documents last week that paved the way for a final deal to end one of Africa's longest-running conflicts that has killed tens of thousands and uprooted 2 million more. But the rebels insist any accord be contingent on the ICC scrapping its indictments first, while the government says it will only ask for that after an agreement has been signed. Analysts say Kony, who is believed to be hiding in remote eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, is key to any lasting agreement. No outsiders have seen him for months. "I'm told Kony will join the talks for the first time before March 28 to sign a final deal," said Norbert Mao, a leading mediator and senior politician from Kony's native north Uganda. Although the 22-year civil war has had little direct impact on one of Africa's quickest growing economies since the peace talks began in mid-2006, ending it once and for all would be a big boost for President Yoweri Museveni. It would be celebrated across the coffee-exporting country of more than 30 million people, and it would also remove a destabilising element in a remote corner of the continent where conflicts frequently spill over national frontiers. REBELS ON THE MOVE Sources at the talks say the chief mediator, south Sudanese Vice-President Riek Machar, and U.N. envoy Joaquim Chissano have previously offered to guarantee Kony's safety if he appears. Mao said he had spoken to the LRA delegates in Juba and by satellite telephone with a top commander at one of the rebels' camps in Congo's thickly wooded Garamba National Park. After signing, Mao said, Kony would return to the bush to organise his forces under the terms of a demobilisation deal giving them another month to assemble on the south Sudan border. Kony has claimed in the past to take orders from spirits and "angels". His long-term intentions remain unknown. Underlining the uncertainty -- and the potential for any deal to break down before the rebels demobilise -- Uganda's military accused LRA fighters on Thursday of killing one of its soldiers during a clash late on Tuesday in southern Sudan. A Ugandan army spokesman said the battle took place east of the River Nile, some 400 km (250 miles) from the guerrillas' planned assembly area at Ri-Kwangba on the Sudan-DRC border. The LRA representatives in Juba could not immediately be reached to comment on that, or to confirm Mao's account. They have regularly denied Ugandan military reports in the past, including that hundreds of LRA fighters left Garamba last month for new bases in Central African Republic. "My information is Kony has moved the civilians with them, including his family members, away from the border," Mao said. "But since 2006 the LRA has been camping in a variety of places, including Central African Republic, so this is nothing new." He said he believed the main LRA group numbered around 800 fighters and 1,000 civilians, including women and children. But he said many of those classed as combatants had been kidnapped as youths and forced to fight by commanders infamous for mutilating victims by slicing off lips and other body par
