 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission knows nothing about the announced upazila parishad elections in May, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Thursday. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal announced on Wednesday that elections to 100 upazila parishads would be held in May. When reporters questioned Shamsul Huda in this regard on Thursday, however, the CEC said, "I know nothing. [The local government adviser] announced it. Ask him." Election commissioner Sohul Hossain, who was present at the time, said the local government adviser appeared to have decided himself on the upazila election schedule. Adviser Anwarul Iqbal while inaugurating Khulna Wasa activities Wednesday morning said: "Elections to 100 upazila parishads will be arranged in May." "The voter listing in 80 out of the 100 upazilas has already been completed. The voter listing in the remaining 20 upazilas will soon be completed," the adviser said. "Besides, elections to four city corporations and seven municipalities will be held in April," Anwarul added. Earlier in the week, after a meeting with the CEC on Monday, Anwarul Iqbal told reporters: "Upazila elections can be held before the parliamentary elections in the areas where voter listing has been completed." CEC Shamsul Huda said after the meeting Monday that the amendment to the upazila election laws is awaiting final approval of the government. Huda also told reporters on the day: "We have taken a decision in principle to hold upazila elections." "However, it has not yet been decided whether the upazila elections will be held before or after the parliamentary elections." bdnews24
