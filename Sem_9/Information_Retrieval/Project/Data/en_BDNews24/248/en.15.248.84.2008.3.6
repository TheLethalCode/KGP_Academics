<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government will put forward its candidate for the next Bank of Japan governor on Friday in a step towards ending political wrangling over the job. Toshihiko Fukui is set to retire as governor in less than two weeks, and the government and opposition parties have been sparring over who should replace him. Current deputy Toshiro Muto, whose term ends on the same day, March 19, has been widely seen as the government's choice to replace Fukui but is opposed by some lawmakers in the opposition, which can veto a nominee as it controls parliament's upper house. "Given the atmosphere within the party, it looks almost certain that Muto would be voted down," said Kohei Otsuka, a lawmaker in the main opposition Democratic Party, although it is unclear if others in his party share his view. There has been media speculation that the government and opposition may turn to a compromise candidate to head the central bank, with former BOJ deputy governor Yutaka Yamaguchi mentioned. Friday will also see Fukui supervise his final policy board meeting reviewing interest rates, with markets believing the central bank will keep the key rate unchanged at 0.5 percent. Political deadlock over who will replace Fukui has prompted talk of a policy vacuum, which could undermine Japan's market credibility, although traders remain focused on fears of a U.S. recession and a sliding dollar. "The schedule is decided for the appointment but there is still a risk of a policy vacuum if the government proposes Muto," said Naomi Hasegawa, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "We are watching to see if other candidates emerge and if those people are hawks or doves," she said, adding that Yamaguchi would be seen as less likely to cut rates. RECESSION RISK The new governor will face an economy predicted to be heading for a sharp downturn and possibly a recession in the first half of this year, in the wake of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. "We will put forward who we think are the best candidates, so I strongly hope that they will be accepted," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura, the top government spokesman, told a news conference announcing the appointment timetable. "The central bank's independence is important, so it is important that a person with awareness of this is selected." A delay in filling the post would be taken as a further sign of the political weakness of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who is struggling with a divided parliament and slumping ratings. Both sides have said they do not want the naming of the new governor and two deputies, who will also be nominated at a parliamentary committee starting at 1 p.m. (0400 GMT) on Friday, to be a political issue. CAUGHT UP IN POLITICS But the appointments have been caught up in a row over the annual budget, which the ruling coalition rammed through parliament's lower house last week, angering opposition lawmakers seeking more debate and prompting them to suspend cooperation with the government. The government's nominee will face questions from lawmakers in parliament next Tuesday. Some Democratic Party lawmakers have strongly opposed having Muto as governor. They say appointing a former senior bureaucrat such as Muto, who was once vice finance minister, would hurt the central bank's independence in setting monetary policy. Otsuka questioned Muto's ability to steer monetary policy in the face of rapidly changing global economy and markets, although he acknowledged the deputy governor was adept at building consensus. Asked about Yamaguchi, Otsuka said he was an option, but the Democrats had not yet formed a firm view on him. Some lawmakers are wary that if the appointment is held up both the government and the Democrats will be blamed by voters. "The matter should be decided by (party president Ichiro) Ozawa. Others should not say this or that about candidates," veteran party member Kozo Watanabe told Reuters. "If a policy vacuum throws financial markets into further turmoil, the electorate would think it was a mistake to have let the Democrats win in the upper house election (last year)." Yamaguchi, dubbed a compromise candidate by the Japanese media, is seen as slightly more hawkish on interest rates and lacking Muto's skills at political manoeuvring. But economists say respect earned overseas and experience in battling Japan's financial crisis of a decade ago make Yamaguchi, 67, well-equipped to take the helm at the central bank at a time of global market turbulence and fears of a US recessi
