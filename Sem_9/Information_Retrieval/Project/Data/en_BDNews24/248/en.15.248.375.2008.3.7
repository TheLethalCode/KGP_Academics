 SINGAPORE (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Oil held near $106 a barrel on Friday, within sight of a record high, helped by a tumbling U.S. dollar that bolstered fund buying and by OPEC's reluctance to pump extra crude. U.S. light crude for April delivery gained 13 cents to $105.60 a barrel by 0124 GMT (8:24 p.m. EST Thursday), just short of Thursday's intraday high of $105.97 a barrel. The gains followed a $5 jump on Wednesday that was also fuelled by an unexpected fall in U.S. crude inventories. "OPEC is keen to maintain oil prices. They do not have much spare capacity to bring crude onto the market," said Gerard Burg of National Australia Bank in Sydney. The oil cartel argued that the high oil price did not reflect oil market fundamentals, and was instead driven by speculation and a weak dollar. OPEC's argument that there is enough oil has been backed by rising U.S. crude inventories, but a U.S. government report released after the cartel's meeting on Wednesday showed crude stocks in the world's largest consumer fell by 3.1 million barrels last week, against analysts' forecasts for an increase. OPEC will next meet in September, although ministers could confer informally at a conference between consumers and producers in Rome on April 20-22. A tumbling dollar boosted oil prices as investors sought a hedge against inflation. The dollar fell to lifetime lows against the euro after the European Central Bank downplayed prospects of an interest rate cut and did not voice concerns about the single currency's sharp rally. Tensions between OPEC member Venezuela, a top oil exporter to the U.S., and neighbor Colombia, also underpinned oil prices. Venezuela deployed forces toward the Colombian border on Wednesday, after Colombia last weekend launched a raid against rebels inside OPEC member Ecuador
