 Wed Mar 5, NEW YORK (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Citigroup Inc said on Wednesday that it agreed to sell eight bank branches in northern Texas and plans to shutter 11 other branches in the United States, as it streamlines its operations. Citibank, Citigroup's retail banking unit, has agreed to sell branches in Amarillo, Pampa and Hereford, Texas, to local lender Happy State Bank for an undisclosed sum. Happy State said it is purchasing about $75 million in loans and assuming about $240 million in deposits. It hopes to retain all the employees at the branches. Citibank also said it plans to close 11 bank branches in Florida, New Jersey, California and Maryland. The company said the closures are part of a continuous evaluation of its network. Darryl Hendricks, Citibank's division manager for Texas and Illinois, said Citibank intends to expand elsewhere in Texas, without offering details. "We believe that selling these branches to a strong local player and devoting our resources to other opportunities and locations is the best course," Hendricks said in a statement.
