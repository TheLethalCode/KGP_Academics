<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com) - The ministry of Liberation War Affairs declined to sponsor the Independence Day Football Tournament organised by the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF), said an official. "The ministry last week expressed its inability to sponsor the Independence Day Football Tournament showing no reason," BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu told reporters Thursday. It was intended to hold the Independence Day football tournament this month with the BFF organising the eight-team meet with financial support from the Liberation War Affairs ministry. Malu, however, said, "We are determined to hold the Independence Day Football this month whether the ministry comes forward or not as three teams -- Abahani, Mohammedan and Arambagh -- have already given their nod." He also said Sheikh Russel KC informed them informally to take part in the meet. It was learnt that the BFF had proposed approximately Tk 40 lakh to organise this year's tournament as the ministry had earlier provided the same number of amount to the federation for the inaugural meet in 2005.
