Badruddoza said their meeting was a successful one.. "The aim of the dialogue was to find a way out of the current crises," he said He added that they wanted an election by December that would be acceptable to all. He in particular was concerned about the soaring prices of daily commodities. "The government will have to take measures to keep prices within people's reach.
