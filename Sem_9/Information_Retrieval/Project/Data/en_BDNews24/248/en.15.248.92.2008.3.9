 SYDNEY, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket Australia (CA) have lodged a formal complaint with the Indian cricket board over comments made by Harbhajan Singh about Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist. CA chief executive has asked the Indian board to take action against Harbhajan after he called Hayden a liar and said Gilchrist was "no saint". "Enough is enough," Sutherland wrote in a letter to the board, published in Sydney's Sun Herald newspaper. "Despite assurances that you have instructed him not to fuel this issue any more, Harbhajan continues to say whatever he wants. "When will it ever end? Could you please deal with your player in regard to these comments." Harbhajan was involved in several ugly disputes with the Australian players during their recent tour. Relations between the teams deteriorated to such a point that the Indians briefly suspended the tour and the International Cricket Council appointed a mediator to broker a peace deal. Harbhajan was originally banned for three matches for making racist comments about Andrew Symonds during the second test but the suspension was overturned on appeal when the charge was downgraded to a lesser offence. Both teams were warned about their behaviour but the tension remained. CA reprimanded Hayden after he called Harbhajan an "obnoxious weed" during the one-day series. India complained to CA about Hayden's comments and instructed their own players not to retaliate to ensure the row did not escalate. CA want India to discipline Harbhajan after his comments about Hayden and Gilchrist on his arrival home. "We've tried over the summer to get the balance right in the way controversial comment has been managed," a CA spokesman told the newspaper. "And we certainly, through our actions with Matthew Hayden, have been firm with our own players in terms of where the tipping point is. "We believe it is possible to make intelligent, thoughtful and even provocative public comment without descending to personal abuse.
