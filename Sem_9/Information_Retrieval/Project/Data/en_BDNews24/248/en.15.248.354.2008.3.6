<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 06 (bdnews24.com) -- Public Service Commission chairman Saadat Hossain Thursday said that some of the most corrupt individuals in the country may end up being acquitted in cases where the Anticorruption Commission failed to properly file cases. The PSC chairman said that in the final analysis there may be little difference between the ACC and its predecessor, the Bureau of Anticorruption. Saadat made his remarks at the launch of two Policy Notes by BRAC University's Institute of Governance Studies on the Anticorruption Commission and the Public Service Commission at a city hotel. "They [the absorbed officials of the defunct BAC] have not followed the correct way when filing cases. The ACC is therefore losing legal battles in the higher courts," Saadat told the function. "Very big corrupt people might get scot-free," said Saadat, who attributed the responsibility to corrupt BAC officials who joined the ACC. The PSC chairman said he feared the ACC would end up in a similar position to its predecessor due to the actions of former BAC officials now serving in the commission. Akbar Ali Khan, a former adviser to the caretaker government and Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman, said the ACC would face a tough challenge to fulfil its anticorruption drive after the withdrawal of the state of emergency. Khan said the commission should have carried out its work in line with the ordinary laws of the country instead of filing corruption cases under the emergency powers rules, which will go after the state of emergency is lifted. The former adviser also underlined the need for appointing good officers to the ACC to strengthen the institution. The ACC has been heavily criticised for its decision to install many former BAC officials who were believed to be corrupt. The BAC was abolished when the ACC was established in November 2004. bdn
