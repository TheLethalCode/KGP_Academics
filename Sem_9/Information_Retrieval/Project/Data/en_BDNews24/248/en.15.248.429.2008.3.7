 ZURICH, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss wealth manager EFG International took a hit from the credit crisis on Friday, saying a US municipal bond fund it was distributing had to be liquidated, sending its shares sharply lower. The Akos fund, which was launched in November 2004, was liquidated after a sell-off in municipal bonds last week, causing losses for investors, an EFG spokesman said. He declined to give a figure for the losses. EFG shares were down 15.6 percent at 31.30 Swiss francs by 1033 GMT, having been as low as 30.10 francs. "The product had to be unravelled with attendant losses for investors," company spokesman Keith Gapp said. The news shows mid-sized private banks like EFG are not immune to the credit crisis that has hit bigger rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse, hurting their more risky investment banking business. Client money inflows into EFG slowed in the second half of last year, although other specialised smaller wealth managers have said their image as staid guardians of capital mean they may actually benefit from the subprime crisis. EFG stressed the Akos product had largely been distributed to institutional investors, and that those clients were all made "fully aware" of the characteristics of the product and its potential risks. The fund was issued by a company called Kommuninvest i Sverige and had been structured by JP Morgan. The bonds held as part of the strategy were managed by Bigelow Asset Management, a specialist in US municipal bonds. EFG shares had dropped in early trading after Avanza Bank, Sweden's largest online broker, showed a letter on its website www.placera.nu that it said EFG had sent to its clients. EFG said it believed the letter was genuine. Gapp said the losses incurred by investors were lower than the 1.3 billion-2 billion Swedish crowns ($213.4 million-$328.3 million) range mentioned by the website. "That overestimates the losses. Even at the lower range that is an overestimate of the losses," he said. Gapp said he was not aware of any similar situations at EFG that could lead to further client losses. "This to my knowledge is exceptional and is caused by exceptional circumstances," he said. EFG shares have lost a third of their value this year and are trading below the 38 franc issue price set for its IPO in 2005, as markets worry about firm's rapid growth strategy, which is driven by acquisitio
