 MILAN, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jose Mourinho hopes to return to soccer management next year in either Italy or Spain, the former Chelsea coach has said.

"Now no, I am studying," the 45-year-old told Thursday's Gazzetta dello Sport when asked if he wanted to return to coaching. "From next year however, yes." He was sacked by Chelsea in September after a disagreement with club chiefs despite winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups in three years at Stamford Bridge. "Italy or Spain," Mourinho said when asked about his future. "Afterwards I want to go back to England and finally be national coach of Portugal." The colourful if controversial coach, who turned down the chance of managing England in December, has been linked in the media with Barcelona and AC Milan, whose respective coaches Frank Rijkaard and Carlo Ancelotti are under pressure. Holders Milan were dumped out of the Champions League by Arsenal in the last 16 on Tuesday after the Premier League leaders won their second leg 2-0 at San Siro. "I respect Milan and Ancelotti but Arsenal deserved to qualify over the two games," added Mourinho, who won the European Cup with Porto in 2004. There has been further speculation that Mourinho may be in line for the Inter Milan job despite Roberto Mancini guiding this season's leaders to the Serie A title last term.
