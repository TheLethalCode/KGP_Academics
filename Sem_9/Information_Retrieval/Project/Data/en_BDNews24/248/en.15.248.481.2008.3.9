 YANGON, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military government has rejected a United Nations offer of observers for May's constitutional referendum and elections in 2010, redoubling concerns about the freedom and fairness of both polls. "Holding the referendum for the constitution is within the State sovereignty," official newspapers on Sunday quoted referendum commissioner Thaung Nyunt as telling visiting UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari.

Gambari is not expected to travel to the new capital, Naypyidaw, to see junta supremo Than
