 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)Unidentified gunmen killed general secretary of the BNP's Ward No. 48 unit Mostafa Zaman Shibly in the city Wednesday evening. Shibly had been released from jail recently in a case in connection with the August student agitation. The case was later withdrawn. Dhanmondi police sub-inspector Atiqur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "Unidentified gunmen shot Shibly behind Meena Bazar in Dhanmondi." People in the neighbourhood took a fatally wounded Shibly to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where he bled to death. Shibly's elder brother Bayzeed Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "An unidentified group called Shibly by mobile phone around 7pm. Shibly then took a motorcycle from Mohsin Motorcycle Garage near his home and went to Dhanmondi Road No. 14." Bayzeed said that when Shibly got there, a "group of criminals" shot him and fled. On information, Bayzeed and his cousin Mokhles Zaman along with local people went there and took Shibly to the DMCH. Bayzeed said Shibly had suffered six shots to his head, ears and face. No case was filed immediately. bdnews
