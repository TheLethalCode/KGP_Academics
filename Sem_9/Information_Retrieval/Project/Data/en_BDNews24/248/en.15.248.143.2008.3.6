 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar sank to a new record low against the euro beyond $1.53 on Thursday, helping drive gold to an all-time high and rattling equity investors worried about the competitiveness of European companies. Wall Street looked set for a weak start but Japanese shares earlier gained nearly 2 percent. The European Central Bank, as expected kept interest rates steady at 4.0 percent. Higher rates in Europe over the United States, which is easing monetary policy, are a main driver of euro strength. "There are pretty clear expectations for a widening in interest rate differentials, keeping the dollar at a disadvantage," said Tomoko Fujii, head of economics and strategy for Japan at Bank of America in Tokyo. The euro rose as high as $1.53459, a new record, before dropping back slightly to $1.5317. The dollar also fell to a record low of 73.101 against a basket of six major currencies, although it later recovered a bit. It was down 0.6 percent at 103.46 yen. Besides responding to interest rate differentials, investors are dumping the dollar as a raft of U.S. data comes in pointing to economic contraction. The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index for February beat expectations on Wednesday, but still showed the service sector shrank for a second straight month. ADP Employer Services also said on Wednesday that the U.S. private sector cut 23,000 jobs in February, stirring worries that U.S. jobs data due on Friday could come in weak. The shrinking dollar, in the meantime, is helping boost gold by making it cheaper for non-U.S. investors. Spot gold hit $991.90, the highest it has even been on a non-inflation adjusted level and within reach of the key psychological level of $1,000 an ounce. It later traded slightly lower at $985 an ounce. COMPETITIVENESS With the soaring euro threatening the competitiveness of European exporters, European stocks came under pressure again, also battered by financials falling on disappointing results from Dutch firm Aegon. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent after rallying 1.7 percent a day earlier. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.9 percent on Thursday, partly because the yen was stabilising and Japanese exporters thus gaining. The benchmark Nikkei average ended at 13,215.42, one day after logging its lowest close since Jan. 23. The broader TOPIX index added 1.9 percent to 1,287.55. Euro zone government bond yields were lower. Two-year yields were off 1 basis point at 3.212 percent, while 10-year yields were off 4 basis points at 3.816 percent. Oil remained stubbornly above $100 a barrel, gaining 35 cents to $104.
