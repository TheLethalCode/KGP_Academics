 Dhaka, March 06 (bdnews24.com)--The US has branded Harkat-ul-Jihad Al Islami, Bangladesh (HUJI-B) as a foreign terrorist organisation and an "especially designated" global terrorist outfit. US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice announced the tag under an executive order Wednesday in Washington, according to a statement released by the US embassy in Dhaka Thursday. "On March 5, 2008 Secretary Rice designated Harakat ul-Jihad Al Islami, Bangladesh (HUJI-B) a foreign terrorist organisation and as an especially designated global terrorist under Executive Order 13224," the release said. The leader of HUJI-B signed the February 1998 fatwa sponsored by Osama bin Laden that declared American civilians to be "legitimate targets for attack", the US said. "Since then, HUJI-B has been implicated in a number of terrorist attacks in Bangladesh and abroad," the release added. "This designation means that it is illegal for persons in the United States or subject to US jurisdiction to provide material support to HUJI-B; requires US financial institutions to freeze assets held by HUJI-B; freezes all property and interests in property of HUJI-B that are in the United States, come within the United States, or within the control of US persons; and enables the United States to deny visas to representatives of HUJI-B," the statement clarified. The US termed Bangladesh a "strong partner of the United States in fighting terrorism" and praised its action to bring HUJI-B "terrorists" to justice and to prevent further attacks. "We applaud Bangladesh's efforts to fight terrorism and are committed to further strengthening this partnership as we redouble our efforts to counter HUJI-B and other terrorist organisations around the globe," it said. bdn
