 BERLIN, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Berlin fashion store selling clothes that are popular with German neo-Nazis has angered local residents and left-wing groups who have attacked it repeatedly since it opened last month. Tonsberg, in the trendy Mitte district near Alexanderplatz, sells Thor Steinar clothes, a brand German intelligence services say is closely associated with the far-right scene.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has voiced concern over a rise in far-right culture and a spate of racially motivated crimes in Germany in the last few years. Thor Steinar has four shops in Germany, according to its website, all in the eastern part of the country where support for far-right groups is strongest. Many Germans accuse Thor Steinar of consciously becoming a symbol of the far right. The company spokesman denied this. "This reminds me of 1933. Then there were signs up saying 'Don't buy from Jews'. Now there are signs saying 'Don't buy from Nazis'. "We're being labelled as Nazis and this is unfair. I am not a Nazi," said the spokesm
