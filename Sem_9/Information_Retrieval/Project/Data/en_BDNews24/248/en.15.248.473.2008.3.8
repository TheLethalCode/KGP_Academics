 Islamabad, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday advised an incoming coalition government, that may seek his resignation, to focus on fighting terrorism and sustaining economic growth rather than politics. The parties that defeated a pro-Musharraf alliance in an election last month have still to agree how to make up the new ruling coalition, and there is speculation they will try to drive out Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 military coup. The caretaker government will forward the official election results to Musharraf early next week to pave the way for him to convene the new assembly, Law Minister Syed Afzaal Haider, told state-run Pakistan Television on Saturday. U.S. ally Musharraf said political peace was essential to keep the fight against terrorism on track and maintain growth in an economy pressured by rising crude oil and cooking oil prices. "These are very serious challenges," Musharraf said at the launch of a new television station in the city of Multan in the Punjab province. "As soon as the governments are formed in the centre and in provinces, this is the cut off when there should be less politics and governance starts," he said. "Put politics on a back-burner." Musharraf has said he will back the incoming government so long as it chooses political peace, but there is considerable expectation that Pakistan will face more political upheavals if its new leaders seek confrontation with the president. The military issued a statement earlier this week quoting General Ashfaq Kayani, who took over as army chief from Musharraf last November, saying the army would stay out of the political process. Western allies and regional neighbours are concerned about instability in a nuclear armed state already reeling from suicide bombings carried out by al Qaeda inspired militants. The coalition will be led by Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which emerged as the largest party in the new National Assembly without winning a majority. It has yet to nominate a prime ministerial candidate. The PPP was led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto before her assassination on Dec. 27, and her husband and political successor Asif Ali Zardari is ineligible as he does not hold a seat in the assembly. Zardari's deputy chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim was widely regarded as the likely choice for the prime minister's slot, but the delay in naming Fahim has led to doubts. Talks to form a coalition are expected to take place this weekend between Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf deposed. Sharif's party was the runner up in the Feb. 18 vote. Sharif has made clear his aim to restore judges who Musharraf replaced when he declared emergency rule for six weeks last November, in order to stop them annulling his own re-election by the outgoing parliament a month earlier.
