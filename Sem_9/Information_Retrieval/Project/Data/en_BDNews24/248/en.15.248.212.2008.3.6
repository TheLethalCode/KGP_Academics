<TITLE> Anwar's wife ready to retire after Malaysian poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PERMATANG PAUH, Malaysia, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - She was an accidental opposition politician, and the wife of Malaysia's former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Thursday she is ready to "fade into the sunset", as soon as her husband officially steps back into the political arena. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, 55, a former eye surgeon and mother of six, has the only seat in parliament held by the opposition Keadilan (Justice) party that Anwar now leads and faces a tough fight to hold onto it in Saturday's general election. The Permatang Pauh constituency used to be Anwar's seat when he was the heir apparent to then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. That was before he was sacked, charged with corruption and sodomy, and jailed for six years when he turned against his boss in the midst of 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. "It is natural that Anwar takes over, having been the MP for this area for many years," Wan Azizah said in an interview at her headquarters in the Peace Foundation set up by her husband. "I get applause every time I say 'if you voters want it, of course I will step aside for Anwar. Anwar, 60, is prohibited from running for office until April due to his corruption conviction. But political analysts expect Wan Azizah to resign if she wins on Saturday so her husband could contest a by-election for that seat. Wearing a traditional Malay "baju kurung" or knee-length patterned blouse and a pink headscarf -- her signature look -- Wan Azizah said she has never had political ambitions. "But when I was entrusted with this responsibility of leading Keadilan and ensuring Anwar's future, I had to carry out my duty. "My ambition was to become a doctor, a good doctor. I am quite happy to fade into the sunset." Her opponent from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party in the multi-party coalition that has governed Malaysia since independence in 1957, is again Pirdaus Ismail, a former imam (prayer leader) at the National Mosque. Pirdaus lost to Wan Azizah by a mere 590 votes in the 2004 elections, and UMNO has deployed Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and other big guns for his election campaign. She is worried "there may be mishaps and electoral problems", and referred to reports that Malaysia has found an astounding number of people more than 100 years old on its electoral rolls. She also lamented the Election Commission's announcement on Wednesday that it was reversing an earlier decision to dye voters' fingers with indelible ink. "Now with the indelible ink not being implemented, it puts more fear in us that people can vote more than once ... But the voters see me as someone who they can trust. I have a motherly face, a caring face." ONE-SIDED? The ruling National Front coalition is certain to be re-elected, but risks a backlash by Buddhist ethnic Chinese and Hindu ethnic Indians, who complain of religious and racial inequality in the mainly Muslim nation. The opposition, mounting one of the strongest challenges to the ruling coalition in years, wants to deny the Front a two-thirds majority in parliament -- the level needed to change the constitution. It is banking on a strong protest vote over rising food and fuel costs, crime and influx of cheap labour. But it faces an uneven playing ground as government restrictions on free speech, freedom of assembly and the media will deny citizens a fair vote in Saturday's election, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said. Abdullah has rejected the criticism, saying his government was determined to hold a fair electi
