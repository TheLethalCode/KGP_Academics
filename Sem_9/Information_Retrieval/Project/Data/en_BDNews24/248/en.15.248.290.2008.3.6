<TITLE> UK to tighten drug test laws after Glaxo probe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain is to strengthen the law on disclosing drug trial results following a four-year inquiry into GlaxoSmithKline Plc's delay in reporting data linking its antidepressant Seroxat to suicide risk in teenagers. "We will take immediate steps to ensure the law is strengthened further, so that there can be no doubt as to companies' obligations to report safety issues," Kent Woods, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said in a statement on Thursday. The watchdog criticised Europe's biggest drugmaker for not handing over clinical data earlier but said criminal charges would not be brought because the legislation in place at the time was not sufficiently strong. "I remain concerned that GSK could and should have reported this information earlier than they did. All companies have a responsibility to patients and should report any adverse data signals to us as soon as they discover them," Woods said. "This investigation has revealed important weaknesses in the drug safety legislation in force at the time." The agency advised doctors in 2003 not to give Seroxat to patients under the age of 18, after Glaxo handed over data showing the medicine could increase their risk of suicidal behaviour. An investigation with a view to potential criminal prosecution was launched due to concerns that Europe's biggest drugmaker had held the information for some time before this and had failed to disclose it. In the event, government prosecutors concluded there was no realistic prospect of a conviction in the case and it should not proceed to criminal prosecution. Glaxo officials were not immediately available to comment. Seroxat, which belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that includes Eli Lilly and Co Prozac, is sold as Paxil in the United States. It was never licensed for use in teenagers in Britain, putting Glaxo's disclosure obligations into a grey area. There has traditionally been no requirement for drugmakers to publish clinical trial information for drugs in areas where they are not licensed or marketed. The move to tighten rules on disclosure adds to controversy over antidepressants, following publication of a research last week suggesting SSRIs help only very severely depressed people and work no better than placebos in many patients. Both Seroxat/Paxil and Prozac are no longer protected by patents, making them of limited commercial importance to Glaxo and Eli Lil
