<TITLE> Malaysia PM loses Kelantan state: Islamist party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kuala Lumpur, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's national ruling coalition failed on Saturday in its bid to win back control of the northeastern state of Kelantan from the country's main opposition Islamist party, a party newspaper said. Kelantan is Malaysia's only opposition-held state. The Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS), which has ruled the predominantly Muslim state for 18 years, is leading in 30 of the state assembly's 45 seats, the Harakah newspaper said in a text-message alert, quoting party vice-president Husam Musa. The official tally has yet to be announced. Losing Kelantan would be a personal setback for Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi who had waged a major charm offensive in Kelantan, promising millions of dollars in development aid to boost the chances of his multi-racial Barisan Nasional coalition.
