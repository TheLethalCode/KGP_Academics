 Kuala Lampur, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse an angry crowd of people, mainly supporters of an Islamic party, following clashes over alleged unregistered voters in Saturday's general election, police said. Police arrested 22 supporters of Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) after they were attacked with bottles, sticks and stones, and the windscreens of three police cars were smashed, witnesses said. The incident, the worst violence in the election so far, took place in Rusila, the power base of PAS President Hadi Awang. "We strongly condemned the police action," PAS Deputy President Nasharudin Mat Isa told Reuters. "I think there must be some provocation." PAS said several of their supporters were hospitalised for injuries. They included Hadi's 31-year-old son Kholil, who sustained facial injuries. Police said the fracas broke out after police detained Kholil for questioning in a dispute over confiscated identity cards seized by men, believed to be PAS supporters, from about 70 passengers of two buses entering Rusila. "They have damaged three police cars. We have managed to keep the situation under control," Terengganu police chief Ayub Yaakob told private broadcaster TV3.
