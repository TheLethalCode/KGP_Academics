 Kabul, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Afghan government on Saturday welcomed Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide as the new UN envoy to Afghanistan, a role meant to better coordinate international efforts to bring development and head off a Taliban insurgency. Eide's appointment, expected to be confirmed by the U.N. Security Council within the next week, brings to an end a tussle between the Afghan government and the United States and other powers that had wanted a heavyweight diplomat to boost coordination between UN and NATO forces fighting the Taliban. "We look forward to working with Mr. Eide," said Afghan presidential spokesman Humayun Hamidzada. "He has been the key person in the Norwegian government focusing on Afghanistan, so he has the knowledge of the country, he has the international experience and the backing of the United Nations and all the major players and the Afghan government supports his appointment," he said. More than six years after US-led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban government for refusing to give up al Qaeda leaders behind the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, NATO and Afghan forces are still battling a virulent Taliban insurgency. Frustration is growing among ordinary Afghans with the panoply of UN agencies, the more than 40 nations with troops in Afghanistan and the Afghan government over the lack of security, the slow pace of development and widespread corruption. Washington had strongly backed British politician and former UN Bosnia envoy Paddy Ashdown's appointment as 'super-envoy' heading UN, NATO and European Union missions in Afghanistan. But the combined post was split up due to sensitivities over associating too closely the UN's humanitarian role and the EU's political role with NATO's military campaign. Afghan President Hamid Karzai then vetoed Ashdown's appointment following media speculation about the extent of his powers and possible influence over the Afghan government. Eide, who at one time worked as a UN envoy in the Balkans, is known as an effective diplomat with experience in nation-building and dealing with NATO, but until now did not have a high public profile, even in Norway. Hamidzada said a number of names were floated for the job in consultations with the Afghan government. "We showed interest and great admiration for Mr. Eide when his name came up," he said. Eide was expected to be approved as envoy by the UN Security Council ahead of a meeting on Afghanistan in New York on March 12 and travel to the Afghan capital Kabul to take up the post shortly afterwards, a UN spokesman said.
