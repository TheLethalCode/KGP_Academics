 LOS ANGELES (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Britney Spears' father will retain control over the troubled pop star's personal and business affairs until July 31, a court spokesman said on Thursday. The ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Reva Goetz was made on Wednesday, said spokesman Allan Parachini. In February, the court placed the assets of the 26-year-old singer under the co-conservatorship of her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew Wallet after Spears was hospitalized twice in January for psychiatric evaluation. The conservatorship had been set to expire on March 10. Spears has seen her life spin out of control since her 2006 breakup with ex-husband Kevin Federline. She has lost custody and visitation rights to their two sons and spent time in rehabilitation. For months, the Louisiana native has been seen around Los Angeles with her self-styled manager Sam Lutfi wearing pink wigs and talking in a British accent. In February when the court granted co-conservatorship to Jamie Spears and Wallet, officials also issued a temporary restraining order against Lutfi. A hearing in that matter is scheduled for March 1
