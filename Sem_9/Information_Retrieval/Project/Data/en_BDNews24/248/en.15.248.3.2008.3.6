<TITLE> US hopes spur stocks, oil sky-high as dollar sags </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A glimmer of hope for the US economy lifted Asian stocks on Thursday, despite oil prices storming to a new high and many investors seeking shelter in rainy-day assets such as bonds and gold. Equity investors pinned their hopes on a report released on Wednesday by the Institute for Supply Management that showed the US services sector was not as weak as expected, shrinking in February at a slower pace than in January. Share traders also took solace in the dollar stabilising against the yen retracing a 5 percent plunge that began 8 days ago. But the dollar weakened to a fresh record beyond $1.53 to the euro and hit its lowest ever against a basket of major currencies. The comeback against the yen, restoring some of US buying power for Asia's exports, encouraged Japanese investors and briefly lifted the Nikkei average by as much as 3 percent, before it closed up 1.9 percent at 13,215.42 points. Stock markets across the rest of Asia, measured by MSCI's index, rose 1.7 percent by 0600 GMT. Taiwan's main share index rose 2.1 percent to end at a 3-month high, spurred by PC seller Acer and hopes that a March 22 presidential election could bring closer ties with China. OIL PRICE ANAESTHETIC The thought of the US economy doing better than feared seemed to soften the blow from a fresh record in oil prices, usually a sign of rising costs across the board. U.S. crude neared $105 a barrel on Wednesday after the export cartel OPEC decided not to raise output and data showed US oil inventories had fallen sharply. Prices edged back to $104.39 in Asian trade, still more than a dollar above the earlier record mark. Even investors in oil-dependent airlines took the price spike in their stride. Air New Zealand Ltd and Korean Air rose more than 2 percent and Australia's Qantas Airways finished 4.4 percent higher. Financial bookmakers in London expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open 8 to 11 points higher, Germany's DAX to open between 3 points higher and 8 points lower, and France's CAC-40 to open flat to down 5 points. Oil's perkiness was reflected in gold a safe-haven asset which has also hit repeated records this year. It stood at $986.10/6.90 by 0546 GMT, within striking distance of the $1,000 milestone, which some traders see in terms of "when, not if". "It's difficult to say at this juncture if we will touch the $1,000 mark. I guess it really depends on how long oil prices remain above $100," said Darren Heathcote of Investec Australia. Copper futures also rose in Shanghai after London futures surged to within 1 percent of a record high on Wednesday as the dollar-priced metal attracted buyers, many of whom may be hoping hot Chinese demand will keep prices sizzling. "Demand is strong but not that strong. Investors should be cautious," said Judy Zhu, commodity analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. "The recent rally is purely based on speculative interest rather than fundamentals." CREDIT WORRIES The commodities rally lifted resources companies such as BHP Billiton Ltd, which rose 2 percent, and PetroChina Co Ltd, which added 4.6 percent, helping stock markets in Sydney and Hong Kong bounce back from the latest slide. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2.2 percent while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index gained 1.1 percent, pulled back by fear of further fallout from the global credit crisis. "People are still very concerned about further bad news out of the banks," said Argo Investments fund manager Chris Halls. Those concerns were reinforced on Wednesday by Cleveland Federal Reserve President Sandra Pianalto who said the crisis created big risks to an already softening economy and Thornburg Mortgage Inc, a struggling mortgage lender, which said its failure to meet a margin call had triggered defaults under a variety of lending agreements. The continuing worries kept demand for safe-haven bonds buzzing, driving up Japanese government bond futures. March 10-year futures rose as high as 138.98, their highest since September 2005. "The Thornburg news raised concerns there may be more similar failures, highlighting that the credit market crisis is far from over," said a senior dealer at a US securities firm.
