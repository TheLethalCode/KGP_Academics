 LONDON, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index shed 1.15 percent on Friday, tracking steep falls in US and Asian markets on fears of a global slowdown triggered by mounting credit-related losses that weighed on commodities. By 1120 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 66.2 points at 5,700.2, ahead of US February jobs data due at 1330 GMT. The benchmark index has lost 3 percent this week and nearly 12 percent this year on concern of a looming US recession. "We had sharp losses overnight in Asia and the US, so we have a bit of catching up to do," said Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown. "In terms of the general themes, nothing has really changed. There is still big concern around continuing fallout from subprime and what other parts of the economy it might reach." Other major European indexes fell, and the iTraxx Crossover Index, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, hit a record wide. Miners were the worst hit on worries of weakening global demand. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, Vedanta Resources, Kazakhmys and Lonmin shed between 1.2 and 4.5 percent. Oil shares also suffered as crude prices edged below $105 a barrel. BP dipped 0.4 percent and Royal Dutch Shell slipped 1.3 percent. In spite of the drop, crude futures held near last session's record highs, which further weighed on sentiment battered by more instability in credit markets. Banks were other standout losers, with Barclays down 1.8 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland losing 2.3 percent, Standard Chartered easing 1.6 percent and HSBC off 0.7 percent. News that Thornburg Mortgage Inc, a "jumbo" U.S. mortgage lender, was in default after failing to meet creditor demands for more upfront cash hit on Thursday. Adding to the gloom, Carlyle Capital Corporation, an affiliate of private equity firm Carlyle Group, said it had received substantial additional margin calls and more default notices from lenders which could deplete its liquidity. HBOS SHINES Mortgage lender HBOS, however, advanced 1.2 percent as an investor roadshow and several positive analyst comments highlighted its sharp fall since last week's results appeared excessive, traders said. Lloyds TSB was up 0.5 percent. Friday's main focus for financial markets is US February non-farm payrolls data, which economists in a Reuters survey forecast would show 25,000 jobs added last month compared with a loss of 17,000 in January. Shares in pubs groups also fell after JD Wetherspoon said rising costs meant it was slightly more cautious on the outlook for its second half, as it met forecasts with a 13 percent fall in first-half profit. JD Wetherspoon was down 10 percent. Enterprise Inns, Mitchells & Butlers, Punch Taverns and Whitbread lost between 1.4 and 3.8 percent. Yell Group slipped 3.3 percent to a record low after UBS cut its price target on the British directories firm and kept its "sell" rati
