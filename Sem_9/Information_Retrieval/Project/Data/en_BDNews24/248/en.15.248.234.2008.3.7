<TITLE> Inmarsat in US mobile phone licence talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British satellite operator Inmarsat is in talks with three mobile phone operators about running a new national mobile licence in the United States, its chairman and chief executive said on Friday. Andy Sukawaty told Reuters he had held discussions with Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile about developing the new licence, which he expects to net the firm around $115 million a year in revenue. He said the talks were at an early stage, and that an agreement was not due imminently. The new licence would be able to run on both terrestrial and satellite networks. Inmarsat has already signed up satellite competitor MSV to help push through the deal. "We are talking to potential strategic partners to launch a hybrid of terrestrial and satellite mobile services," he told Reuters in an interview. "We would be the (satellite) supplier to the new licence, and would be paid leasing of $115 million a year." The move would follow a push by Inmarsat into the $350 million satellite mobile phone handset market, set to be rolled out globally in 2009. The firm is targeting a 10 percent share of the market by 2010 -- a move Sukawaty said was "extremely unrisky". Sukawaty spent much of his career at telecoms firms including Sprint in the United States and Britain's NTL, before joining Inmarsat when it was privatised in 2003. He signed a new deal last year to keep him at the firm for three more years, although his two roles will be split in 2009 with Sukawaty likely to take the chairman's position. FEARS OVERDONE Inmarsat, a contender for the FTSE 100 in the next reshuffle, currently generates revenue from shipping, land and aeroplane customers seeking information in remote parts of the globe. It currently has 10 satellites in space, with another to be launched by the end of April. It reported a 15.3 percent jump in annual revenues to $576.5 million on Thursday, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were up 17 percent. The shares fell 5 percent on results day, however, as analysts expressed fears about the impact of the global economic slowdown. The group's capital expenditure for this year also came in higher than expected. Sukawaty said he would be foolish to say Inmarsat would totally immune from a downturn, but that the nature of the business meant no impact would be felt until 2010. "I don't see any impact in 2008 ... if there is a prolonged recession then people will order fewer ships and planes, but we won't see that until 2010," he said. The shares were down a further 3 percent at 452.75 pence by 1420 GMT, valuing the company at just over 2 billion pounds ($4.03 billio
