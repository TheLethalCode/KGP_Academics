 Tokyo, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has urged North Korea to come forward and deliver on a nuclear disarmament pact before US President George W. Bush leaves office early next year, diplomatic sources said on Thursday. Wang Jiarui, the head of the Chinese Communist Party's international liaison department, conveyed the message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il when they held rare talks in Pyongyang in late January, diplomatic sources in Tokyo told Reuters. Wang told Kim that Bush's successor was more likely to be a Democrat with little faith in six-party talks on ending Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the sources said. "Apparently it's not going to be easy to push forward the six-party process if the Democrats take power," one of the sources quoted Wang as telling Kim. Wang did not mention any specific name -- Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. Kim apparently agreed with Wang, the source said. China's Xinhua news agency reported at the time that Kim received a message from Chinese President Hu Jintao. Kim told Wang that North Korea was committed to a nuclear disarmament pact and disagreements stalling its progress could be overcome, according to Chinese state media. A diplomatic source with close ties to Pyongyang said that whoever takes over power from Bush would not likely alter North Korea's stance. "When Bush took over from Bill Clinton, the US policy on North Korea suffered a setback," the source said. "But Bush moved ahead with a policy changeover later on. That is what North Korea evaluates highly." Under disarmament terms announced in October last year, North Korea was offered 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid, and the United States agreed to move to take the North from a sanctions list aimed at sponsors of terrorism. In return, North Korea agreed to "disable" its Yongbyon nuclear facility and fully declare all nuclear activities by the end of 2007. But those two steps have stalled after North Korean complaints that the energy aid and US concessions were not coming soon enough. US officials and analysts say the main sticking point is North Korea's reluctance to discuss any transfers of nuclear technology, notably to Syria, as well as its suspected pursuit of uranium enrichment.
