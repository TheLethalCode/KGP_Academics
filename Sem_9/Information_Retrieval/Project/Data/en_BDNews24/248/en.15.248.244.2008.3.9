 BERLIN, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Train drivers' union GDL said on Saturday it was optimistic a strike planned from Monday could be avoided after talks with German rail operator Deutsche Bahn. Talks with Deutsche Bahn would continue on Sunday, GDL head Manfred Schell told Reuters, adding: "If it continues like this, we will get through." GDL had threatened strikes on the railways from Monday, escalating a months-long wage dispute with Deutsche Bahn. In January, Deutsche Bahn and GDL ended months of tortuous wage negotiations and disruptive strikes with a deal that gave the union's 34,000 drivers an 8 percent pay increase from March and another 3 percent rise from September. But they are still haggling over a so-called basic wage contract, which would set out how wage deals Deutsche Bahn had agreed with other unions fitted in with the GDL accord. Deutsche Bahn personnel chief Margret Suckale said on Friday the operator wanted to make an offer focusing on how the different rail trade unions would work together in the future. "We want to use the weekend for a last attempt ... to avoid this senseless strike," Suckale told reporters. Deutsche Bahn has said it wants to keep its employees under the aegis of a sector-wide agreement. The rail operator had reached separate deals with two other unions, Transnet and GDBA. But one of GDL's core demands is that it have its own deal. "If a partner is being forced to give up its independence, that has nothing to do with balancing power," GDL official Claus Weselsky told Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. Deutsche Bahn has also filed a legal complaint to prevent the strike, which will be examined from Monday. If Monday's strikes were to go ahead, they would coincide with a separate labour dispute at Berlin local transport operator BVG, which has paralysed public transport in the capital since last Wednesday. More strikes could also be looming in the public sector in Germany, after talks between the government and Verdi ended on Friday without a wage deal for some 2 million federal and local government staff and headed for arbitration. Verdi, which has been demanding an 8 percent wage rise, said it was unsure whether arbitration would succeed and said new strikes were possible from April if no deal was reached. Workers at postal delivery firm Deutsche Post could also go on strike in April, a Verdi official told Euro am Sonntag magazine, saying employers had to make a convincing offer on pay and working conditions by the end of the month. Economists have voiced concern that a series of high wage deals in Europe's largest economy risked driving up inflation. This year has already seen a 5.2 percent pay rise for German steel workers, their biggest in 16 yea
