 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League and its front organisations marked the historic March 7 Friday. The AL hoisted national and party flags atop its headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue and other party offices. The March 7 speech by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not heard anywhere in the capital because of emergency rule. Hundreds of AL activists led by its acting president Zillur Rahman began the day by placing wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujib in front of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi. Later, the activists of Mohila Awami League, Bangladesh Chhatra League, Krishak League and Awami Swechchhashebak League marched toward the Sangsad Bhaban premises where party chief Sheikh Hasina has been detained in special jail since July 16. They waited there for a while carrying bouquets for their leader. After placing wreaths at the Bangabandhu portrait, Zillur thanked the party activists. "To me March 7 is the declaration of independence," he told reporters. At a discussion meeting marking the day at the auditorium of the Institute of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh, AL leaders demanded release of Hasina for treatment abroad. They also asked the government to create a proper context for the elections expected by the end of 2008. The leaders demanded immediate dialogue with the government in the build-up to the national polls. BACKDROP March 7 is a day to remember a historic speech that made a turning point in the history of Bangladesh. The day set the stage for a final battlefought and won in 1971. In his address, Sheikh Mujib made specific charges against the Pakistani martial law authorities, which failed to transfer power to elected representatives after a landslide victory in the 1970 election. Towards the end of his speech, he urged his countrymen: "Build forts in each homestead. You must resist enemies with whatever you have "Remember, when we have learnt to shed blood, we shall give a lot more We shall liberate this country, Insha Allah. President Yahya Khan and other leaders from Pakistan came to Dhaka on March 15 to start dialogue with Sheikh Mujib and his party. The dialogue began the following day and continued through to the morning of March 25. On the midnight of March 25, the Pakistan army launched its brutal crackdown in Dhaka. Sheikh Mujib was arrested and kept confined at Dhaka Cantonment until he was lifted to Pakistan for facing trial for "sedition and inciting insurrection".
