<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 06 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division has frozen the High Court bail to two convicts and observed that an appeals court does not have the jurisdiction of granting bail to those convicted under emergency powers rules. The apex court handed down the verdict Thursday after the government and the Anticorruption Commission filed appeals against the HC bail to Sigma Huda, wife of former minister Nazmul Huda, and Mir Helaluddin, son of former state minister Mir Nasiruddin, convicted in separate graft cases. The Appellate Division clarified that an appeals court may consider a bail prayer by a convict falling "seriously ill", provided the petitioner's health condition is certified by a "duly constituted medical board". Scope for bail applies only to the convicts serving "short sentences", according to the Appellate Division. Besides, an appeals court may consider a convict's bail prayer in case it fails to issue a final ruling within 90 days from the filing date, said a seven-member full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin. "This reasonable and just verdict cancels the High Court order granting bail to barrister Mir Helal and advocate Sigma Huda," ACC counsel Anisul Haque told bdnews24.com. According to the emergency powers rules, once an accused person is convicted by the court in a graft case and the convict files an appeal challenging the verdict, an appeals court can neither grant bail to the convicted person nor stay the efficacy of the trial court judgement. In a Dec 13 verdict, the High Court said it has the jurisdiction of granting bail to a person convicted in a graft case under the emergency powers rules. The HC granted six-week bail to Sigma and Mir Helaluddin on a condition that they have to submit their passports to the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate. The HC as a constitutional court has the jurisdiction of granting bail to a convict, it had said. In a graft case filed by the ACC on March 22 with Dhanmondi Police Station, a Dhaka court on Aug 26 sentenced Sigma to three years in prison and her husband to seven years. According to case details, contractor Mir Zahidasked by Nazmul Hudadeposited Tk 2.4 crore in bribe into a bank account in the name of 'The Khaborer Antorale', a publication run by Sigma. A Dhaka court sentenced Mir Nasiruddin to 13 years in prison and son Mir Helaluddin to three years in a graft case involving their assets. Nazmul Huda, Sigma Huda, Mir Nasiruddin and Mir Helaluddin filed appeals challenging the court verdicts and the appeals were accepted for hearing. bdnews24
