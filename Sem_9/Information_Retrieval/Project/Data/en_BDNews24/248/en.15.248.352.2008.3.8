Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mosammat Shamsunnahar gave the ruling after CID police inspector Shyamol Chowdhury sought 10 days each for suspects Sanjidul Islam Imon (38) and Md Ishaque Ali (34). India handed the two suspects to Bangladesh Friday. Both of them face various charges including murder. Clad in bullet-proof jackets the suspects were in the dock as the magistrate's order was given. During the remand hearing, the CID officer told the court they had been hiding in India for years using fake names. Chowdhury said the investigators suspected that the two had been involved in various criminal activities including subversive activities against the state in collaboration with other criminal gangs.
