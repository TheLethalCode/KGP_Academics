 Patuakhali, March 07 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Friday called on southern residents to elect "honest and sincere" representatives in the upcoming national polls. "A flawless voter list is required for a free and fair election. We are working toward making a perfect voter list," Fakhruddin told a discussion meeting with government officials, professionals and other local people in Galachipa in the southern district of Patuakhali. The CA spoke as chief guest at the meeting, chaired by Patuakhali deputy commissioner AGM Mir Mashiur Alam. Fakhruddin said it has been proven by the post-Sidr rehabilitation that joint efforts by the army and the civil administration can "make things happen". "There is no alternative to increasing farm output to keep the prices of essential commodities under control. Depending on the climate, soil and irrigation facilities we have to go for suitable crops production." Fakhruddin said: "The government will provide fertiliser, insecticides, seeds and technology for farmers." "We have to have more farmlands by reclaiming abandoned lands in the region." The CA stayed overnight in Barisal after he chaired a cabinet meeting at the Barisal Circuit House Thursday. bdnews24.co
