<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)Samyabadi Dal chief Dilip Barua said Sunday that political parties would not accept the local government polls prior to the national elections. Barua asked the Election Commission to hold national elections by year-end. "We want elections anytime from Dec 15 to Dec 31," Barua told reporters at the National Press Club. "The EC should take measures to accomplish the national elections properly in order to overcome the current political crises of the country." "If the local government polls take place earlier the parliamentary elections will be delayed," Barua said, adding that the transfer of power through a democratic system would be uncertain and a dictatorship was likely to take over the government if the national polls were delayed. "An undemocratic and self-interested group is likely to benefit instead of democratic forces as there has been a long political vacuum in the country." "Only an accountable political leadership can create a good environment for people," he said. Barua asked the caretaker government to withdraw the decision to hold local government polls and assist the EC in holding a proper parliamentary election. "After the national elections the elected government will hold local government polls," the party leader said, terming such a course "rational". Barua also asked the government to lift the state of emergency and withdraw the ban on political activities in all districts. bdnews
