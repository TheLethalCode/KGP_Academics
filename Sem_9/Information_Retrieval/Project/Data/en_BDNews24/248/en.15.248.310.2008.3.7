 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of people gathered in the lakeside ground in the capital Friday to raise their voice against acid attacks on women on the eve of International Women's Day. The day is set to be observed Saturday in Bangladesh and elsewhere across the world with the theme of "investing in women and girls". In a rare show of solidarity, thousands of men from all walks of life joined an event at Rabindra Sarobor on the bank of the Dhanmondi Lake Friday with a promise to fight acid attacks, a regular crime committed against women in Bangladesh. Anti-acid violence campaigner Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF) and the daily Prothom Alo organised the rally to sensitise the people against the crime. Many carried banners and placards that read anti-acid attacks slogans such as "Say no to acid attacks". Dozens of acid victims, mainly women, also joined the gathering. Among them was Hasina Akter, 25her face disfigured. She is struggling to rebuild her confidence to survive. "I am a victim of the heinous crime. I think they are not humans who resort to such violence," she told bdnews24.com in an emotion-choked voice. "I am suffering a lot. I want nobody to face such a fate." The presence of the acid victims with disfigured faces was depressing to Enayet Kabir, working in the garments industry, who joined the rally. "It's inhuman, we can't stand it," he told bdnews24.com. "We, the men, need to act." Motiur Rahman, editor of the Prothom Alo, thanked the participants for joining the effort. "It's a national stigma. We need to end it," Motiur told the participants. Various organisations have, meanwhile, chalked out detailed plans to mark the day Saturday. Transparency International, Bangladesh and the Anticorruption Commission have co-organised an anticorruption concert for Saturday to mark the day. The concert will be held at Gulshan Youth Club from 2:00pm to 9:00pm, TIB said in a statement. The concert to carry the slogan"Wake Up People, Wake Up to the Rights of Women"aims at establishing women's rights and inspiring people against corruption as the movements for women's rights and against corruption are interlinked. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, TIB Trustee Board chairman Muzaffer Ahmad, its secretary general Mahfuz Anam and trustees Sultana Kamal, Prof Abdullah Abu Sayeed, Prof Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Khushi Kabir and Abed Khan will join the programme. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in separate statements praised the women's roles in building society. "We need to ensure women's participation and their rights in every sphere of national activities," the president said in the statement. In a message, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said greater investment in women and girls would help further economic growth and advance development across the world. He stressed that achieving gender equality is not only a goal in itself, but a prerequisite for reaching all the other development objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the global pledges to slash poverty, hunger, maternal and infant mortality, and other social ills, all by 2015. In Bangladesh, leaders of different political parties issued statements on the eve of the day. Jatiya Mohila Parishad, Sammilito Nari Samaj, Jatiya Nari Jote, Jatiya Garments Sramik Federation, Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies, Karmajibi Nari, Shilpakala Academy, Bangladesh International Film Movement are set to mark the day with own programmes. bdnews24.com/sm/
