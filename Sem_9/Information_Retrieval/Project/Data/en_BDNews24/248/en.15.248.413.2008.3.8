 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com) - An unbeaten 85 from Mehrab Hossain Junior powered Old DOHS to a convincing six-wicket win over Victoria SC in the Premier Cricket League Saturday. DOHS raced to 165 for four in 33 overs in reply to Victoria's 162 all out in 42.4 overs at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Put in to bat first, pacer Kamrul Islam (3/22) ripped through the Victoria top order before Farhad Hossain stuck to an end with 49 off 68 balls that included six fours. Late orders Mahmudullah Riad (27), M Shahajada (23) and Wasel Uddin (13) put some runs on the board as three time champions Victoria passed the triple figure. Mahbub Alam (2/30) and Monir Ahmed (2/15) cleaned the tail. In reply, DOHS also fell in trouble losing two wickets inside 25 runs before Mehrab steered his side home along with Monir Ahmed (21) and Anisur Rahman (15 not out). Mehrab struck 11 fours and one six in 87 balls on way to his 85 runs. Biman Bangladesh tasted their second consecutive win when they handed a tense 14-run defeat to Young Pegasus at Dhamnondi Cricket Stadium. Biman bundled out Pegasus for 134 in 35.2 overs after scoring a total of 148 all out in 41.3 overs. Mahbubul Alam (3/34) and Alok Kapali (3/32) shared six wickets while Alamgir Kabir took two for 29 as Pegasus fell 14 short of their target despite 53 runs from Sabbir Rahman.
