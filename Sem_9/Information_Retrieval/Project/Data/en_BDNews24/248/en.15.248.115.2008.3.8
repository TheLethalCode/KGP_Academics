 Beijing, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese police on Saturday released human rights lawyer Teng Biao just as his secret detention two days ago began drawing intense attention from domestic and foreign rights activists. Beijing-based lawyer Teng was bundled away in an car without license plates on Thursday night, his wife Wang Ling told reporters on Friday. Teng, 34, has defended dissidents and urged stronger citizens' rights ahead of the 2008 Olympics. He has been especially outspoken about his friend Hu Jia, a dissident who faces subversion charges after spending much of 2007 under house arrest. On Saturday afternoon, Beijing police released Teng, apparently without pressing any charges. "I was taken in by Beijing Public Security at 8:40 on Thursday and then I was taken home by them at 1:40 this afternoon," Teng said, using his wife's mobile telephone. "That's all I can say now. It wouldn't be convenient to say more." He said he was in "good enough" health. Teng's case was threatening to take off as another focus of human rights campaigners as Beijing readies for its Olympic Games starting on Aug 8. Local supporters were collecting signatures for a petition demanding his release, and the Human Rights Watch, an organisation based in New York, said in a statement that his detention "brings the situation for rights defenders in China to an all-time low".
