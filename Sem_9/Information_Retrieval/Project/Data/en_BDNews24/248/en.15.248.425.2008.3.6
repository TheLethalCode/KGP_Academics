 March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spaniards vote this Sunday to elect a new Congress and Senate. Here are some facts about Spain's electoral system: PARLIAMENT: Made up of a lower house, the Congress, and an upper house, the Senate. Laws are presented and debated in the Congress before passing to the Senate. The Senate may propose amendments and even veto legislation. However, Congress can override a veto immediately through an absolute majority vote, or by a simple majority vote after two months. All 350 Congress deputies are directly elected for four years. In the Senate, 208 members are directly elected, also for four years, and another 56 -- increased from 51 in the last legislature -- are appointed by Spain's autonomous regions. 2004-2008: At the last elections in 2004, the Socialist Party (PSOE), headed by current prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, won 164 seats in the Congress. The Popular Party (PP), led by Mariano Rajoy, won 148. Ten seats went to the Catalan party CiU. Esquerra Republicana won eight seats, the Basque Nationalist Party seven and United Left five. The others went to smaller groupings. Zapatero ruled without an absolute majority in either house, securing votes by means of ad-hoc coalitions with leftists or regional parties. TIMETABLE: March 8 is "a day of reflection", when campaigning is banned. Voting takes place on Sunday, March 9. The newly elected chambers convene on April 3 after King Juan Carlos has held consultations with the leaders of the main parties and proposed a candidate for the post of prime minister. WHO VOTES: Some 35 million Spaniards are eligible to vote, 1.2 million of whom live abroad. VOTING SYSTEM: Spain's general elections work through direct universal suffrage. No one is obliged to vote. Seats are allocated by proportional representation. Voters choose not individual candidates but local or regional party lists, in which candidates are elected in the order specified by the parties themselves. ELECTION DAY: Voting at mainland polling stations begins at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) and finishes at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT). In the Canary Islands to the west, an hour behind Spain, it begins and ends an hour later in GMT. Television and radio stations will begin issuing the results of exit polls from 1900 GMT. The first official results are expected from around 10:30 p.m. (2130 GMT). BANNED CANDIDATES: The electoral authorities rejected a total of 40 candidates, including a number of candidates fielded by National Basque Action (ANV), considered a front for the banned Batasuna party, the political wing of the armed Basque separatist group ETA. REGIONAL ELECTIONS: The southerly region of Andalucia is also holding an election for its regional parliament, which is currently dominated by the Socialists, led by Manuel Chaves. WORLD FIRST: The blind can use a new system to allow them to vote without assistance, guaranteeing the secrecy of their vote. Those who register for the "accessible vote procedure" receive a series of Braille envelopes to help them mark their preferred candidate with an "X" on a normal ballot sheet. Spain says it is the first time the system has been used in a national vote anywhere in the world. Source: Interior Ministry election webs
