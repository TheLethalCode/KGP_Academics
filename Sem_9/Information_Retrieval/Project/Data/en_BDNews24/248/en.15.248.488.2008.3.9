<TITLE> England were not good enough, admits Vaughan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HAMILTON, New Zealand, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's performance in the first test against New Zealand was unacceptable, captain Michael Vaughan said on Sunday. England, chasing 300 for victory, were bowled out for 110 late in the extended afternoon session on the final day at Seddon Park as New Zealand secured a 189-run victory. Pace bowler Kyle Mills ripped the top off the England batting order to reduce them to 36 for four at lunch before Chris Martin took three wickets in the afternoon session to seal the win. "It's never nice when your team has performed at a level you don't expect, especially on a last day when you get to a ground with a small sniff of winning and you end up losing in such a dramatic fashion," Vaughan told reporters. "We felt, get to 80 or 100 for one, it was achievable and we could have had a dip at the target this afternoon, but when you lose four quick wickets... (and) with the talent we have, to get bowled out for 110, is not acceptable." "We hold our hands up and admit we haven't played a good game at all. There is a little bit of a lack of confidence in that dressing room and the performance shows." Vaughan said the fact his side had lost the first match of a three-test series against New Zealand, after losing series at home to India and away to Sri Lanka, was a concern and he sensed the confidence of his team was beginning to dip. "I didn't see it coming at all today, that's a slight worry, you see a positive vibe, sensing victory, got an opportunity to win the game, make sure take it. "We just didn't give ourselves anywhere near the chance to take that opportunity.
