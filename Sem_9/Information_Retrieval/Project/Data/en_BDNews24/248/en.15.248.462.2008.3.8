 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com) The interim cabinet has extended by another two years the validity of the current speedy trial act, a government spokesman said Saturday. The BNP-led four-party coalition government originally introduced the Law and Order Contravening Offences (Speedy Trial) Act 2002. Later the validity of the law was extended twice by two years each time, with the act having been set to expire on April 9. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters at a news briefing that the act would now be in force for a further two years according to the new timeframe, as the cabinet agreed that it was still required for conducting speedy trials. The decision came Saturday at a meeting of the cabinet chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office, Munaim said. The cabinet also approved some amendments to the National Hajj Policy 2007 and the work plan for a Hajj Policy 2008, Munaim said. It further approved in principle the Government Property and Budget Management Ordinance, 2008, he said. The press secretary said the meeting extended the deadline for efficiency tests of non-government primary school teachers by three months to June 30. Special assistants to the chief adviser, the cabinet secretary and other officials also attended Saturday's meeting. bdnews24.com
