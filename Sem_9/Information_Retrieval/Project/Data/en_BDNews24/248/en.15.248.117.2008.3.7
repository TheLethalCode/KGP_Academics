<TITLE> Credit woes, US growth fears weigh on Europe shares </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday as new reports of credit market strains weighed on financials, while economic growth worries hit shares in basic resource companies such as miners. Financial shares were the largest sectoral drag on the broader market, as HSBC, ING and Royal Bank of Scotland fell between 1.1 and 3 percent, while French insurer AXA fell 3 percent. At 0955 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.2 percent at 1,267.20 points, having fallen as much as 1.7 percent earlier, to its lowest intraday level since Jan. 23. "The market has come off the rails and is veering this way and that, like a pennant in the wind," one trader said. "The conditions point to a continuation of the recent volatile and downside-prone market phase for European stocks," LandesBank Berlin (LBB) said in a note. A break below the 2007 low of 3,528.88 points on the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index would be a "strong negative impulse," LBB said. The top-50 index was down 1.2 percent, leaving it 1.3 percent above that low, hit in intraday trading on Jan. 22. "European equities are both cheap and oversold. However, with more bad news in the pipe near term we believe the European indices still have new lows to make," Bear Stearns said in a strategy note. Oil traded near $106 a barrel and gold was not far off a record of $991.90 hit in New York on Thursday on dollar weakness, which saw the euro advance to new highs above $1.54 on Friday. "The U.S. economy is being mismanaged. That is hurting the dollar and pushing up commodities. That equals inflation and makes central banks' job very hard. That's bad for the economy and bad for equities," another trader said. European credit derivative indexes widened sharply early on Friday, hitting all-time record wide levels, after sharp overnight falls in U.S. and Asian stock markets. DEFAULTS In the United States on Thursday, shares in Thornburg Mortgage Inc sank 51 percent on worries the "jumbo" mortgage lender might go bankrupt, after its failure to meet a margin call triggered defaults under other lending agreements. Carlyle Capital Corporation, a Dutch-listed affiliate of private equity firm Carlyle Group, said on Friday it had received substantial additional margin calls and additional default notices from its lender which could deplete its liquidity. Elsewhere in the financial sector, shares in French bank Societe Generale fell 2.3 percent, British bank Barclays was down 2.2 percent. Worries of slower economic growth hit miners BHP Billiton, down 3.8 percent, and Rio Tinto, which fell 3.0 percent. Shares in Veolia Environnement fell 6.6 percent after the company posted 2007 profits below expectations and said the economic environment was challenging. Shares in Telecom Italia were down 6.2 percent after the telecoms operator said 2007 net profit fell 19 percent and almost halved its dividend. DZ Bank said Telecom Italia's figures were weak and management's guidance disappointing. Fortis shares ranked among the few gainers, reversing early losses to trade 3.2 percent higher after the Dutch-Belgian financial services group reported profit halved in the fourth quarter after a 1.5 billion euro ($2.3 billion) subprime-related writedown, and said it was in talks on a deal that would boost its solvency. "It's a big hit, but at least we know now," said one Brussels-based trader. "The market was looking only for negatives and didn't find so much." US February jobs data, seen by analysts as a key factor for the US Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision on March 18, are due at 1330 GMT, with non-farm payrolls expected by economists to show a rise of 25,000. "There are rumours that if the reading comes in negative for a second consecutive month, then this could spark another emergency Fed rate cut," ABN Amro said in a note, adding that a 75 basis point cut by the Fed on March 18 was almost fully priced
