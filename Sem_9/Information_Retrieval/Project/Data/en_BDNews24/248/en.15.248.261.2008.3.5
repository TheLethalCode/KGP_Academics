 KARACHI, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are likely to decide in the next few days whether to proceed with this month's tour of Pakistan, both parties said on Wednesday. "The Australian authorities have today been briefed by their foreign ministry on the (security) situation in Pakistan," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi told Reuters. "I think we should know in one or two days' time. The indications are they (Cricket Australia) will decide after they have a board meeting." Peter Young, Cricket Australia's public relations manager, told Geo television the decision might take a little longer than 48 hours. "We will be talking to our board in the next few days," said Young. "We would like to make a final decision soon as the tour is due to start on March 29." The world's top-ranked team have already cut the tour back to two tests and four one-dayers from the original plan for three tests, five one-dayers and one Twenty20 game because of security concerns. NEUTRAL VENUE Australia have indicated they would like to play the series at a neutral venue rather than cancel the tour but Naghmi dismissed the idea. "This option is out for us," he said. "You don't get spectators from either side at neutral venues and a series is not just played for television, the purpose is to get your own people into the ground." On Tuesday, the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) cancelled their planned inspection of Pakistan. The ACA wanted to send a delegate, Paul Marsh, to determine whether it was safe enough for the players to proceed with the tour. But the ACA deemed it too dangerous for Marsh to travel to Pakistan following a spate of violence including two suicide bombings. The PCB has promised to provide added security for the Australian players in an attempt to save the tour
