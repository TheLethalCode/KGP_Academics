 LONDON, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British rail and bus company Arriva Plc posted a 7 percent rise in annual profit on Thursday and said it would continue its expansion drive into continental Europe this year. Arriva, which provides more than 1 billion passenger journeys per year from operations in nine countries, said its European order book was up 18 percent year-on-year to 4 billion pounds ($6.6 billion). "We're very pleased with our strategy... We're always investigating opportunities in existing markets and keeping a watch on markets we're not in at the moment," Chief Executive David Martin told reporters. Growth has been boosted by continued expansion into Europe, with acquisitions and contracts in Germany, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Portugal and the Netherlands. One of London's largest bus operators, Arriva said it made an operating profit of 128 million pounds ($212 million) in 2007. Analysts' average forecast for earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) was 130 million pounds, according to a Reuters Estimates poll. Revenue was up 16 percent at 2 billion pounds. The final dividend was up 10 percent at 17.06 pence, giving a total dividend for the year of 22.65 pence. Arriva shares dipped 0.4 percent to 684.5 pence by 0930 GMT after hitting a one-week high of 710 pence at the start of the session, to value the business at around 1.36 billion pounds. MORE TRAINS FOR EUROPE Recent acquisitions in Europe include a 10 percent stake in leading Portuguese transport operator Barraqueiro, and loss-making Danish bus division Veolia, which Chief Executive David Martin was confident could be turned around. "We took on a loss-making situation across Denmark. The purpose of buying that was the ability for us to reintegrate that into our existing operations... Those loss-making contracts will take a couple of years to come back up for renewal, so it's a medium-term plan," Martin said. Martin said orders for new trains and buses were being made all the time, and Arriva had just placed orders for 10 new electric trains. Some analysts said that despite growth in Arriva's mainland European revenues, the company had yet to demonstrate any operating leverage and said its outlook was vague. "Scope exists to improve existing business ... Long-term synergies that could be achieved as European network operator are harder to quantify, however," Citigroup analysts said in a research note. In 2007 Arriva started operating the CrossCountry rail franchise in Britain, which serves 131 stations and is the largest UK rail network by geographic spread. "It's early days, but we're very pleased with the progress we've made already ... We've put in place all the contracts we need to deliver our franchise commitments," Martin said. The company said its signing of a 615 million pound five-year revolving credit facility in early August 2007, ahead of the global credit market turmoil, meant it was in a position to finance future growth. Finance chief Steve Lonsdale said he anticipated fuel costs would rise in 2009, but were fixed lower in 2008 compared with 20
