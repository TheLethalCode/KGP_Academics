 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Bikalpadhara and HM Ershad's Jatiya Party have agreed to form a government of national consensus if they are successful in the upcoming national polls. "The two parties are searching for common areas to work in. The ice is beginning to melt," Bikalpadhara president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury told reporters Wednesday after a meeting with Ershad at his Gulshan home. Ershad said the two parties wanted to work together. "The Jatiya Party wants a democratic environment to return through a fair election in the country," Ershad said. Badruddoza praised the "grand alliance" that had been formed during the last forestalled election. The Bikalpadhara chief said he had been with Ershad in the alliance with the Awami League. "We still maintain good relations with the parties that formed the grand alliance," he said. Badruddoza said the caretaker administration has done some good work since Jan 11, but the country would benefit from a "consensus government" after the election. The Bikalpadhara chief said the possibility of an alliance being formed ahead of the national polls was quite good. "Many have contacted us, including representatives from both factions of the BNP," he added. bdnew
