 Chittagong, March 9 (bdnews24.com) A routine top-order collapseexcept for a blazing knock from opener Tamim Iqbalguided Bangladesh to make a paltry 178 all out with 10 balls to go against South Africa in the three-ODI series opener Sunday. Tamim played a stroke-filled 82 after Shakib Al Hasan (6), Mohammad Ashraful (8), Shahriar Nafees (12) and Junaed Siddique (6) failed to justify their names on the slow and low wicket at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. The left-handed opener reached his fourth ODI fifty driving Johan Botha to long-off for a single and stuck to an end, but got hardly any support from others and was fifth batsmen out, leaving the side at 131 in 34.4 overs. Tamim holed out to long-on by Albie Morkel when he tried to send debutant left-arm spinner Paul Harris over the rope. Charl Lengveldt, Andre Nel and Albie Morkel made the inroads into the Tigers' batting line-up while spinners Johan Botha and debutant Paul Harris wrecked up the middle order. Bangladesh could never recover the slow start and eventually were restricted below 200-mark in the face of some tight bowling from the Proteas, whom pacer Nel led the attack with three for 24, picking two wickets in successive delivery in his 10th over. Debutant Harris, Morkel, and Lengeveldt chipped in with two wickets each for 30, 30 and 32 respectively. Bangladesh debutants Dhiman Ghosh, Raqibul Hasan (15) and Mosharraf Hossain (8) faced an uphill task after Bangladesh's recognised batsmen threw their wickets away. Wicketkeeper Dhiman remained unbeaten on 15 off 32 while Syed Rasel was the last batsman out for a duck by Morkel. Junaed pulled Charl Lanveveldt in the eighth over to debutant Paul Harris while Nafees, having returned to the one-day fold after four matches, gave a catch behind keeper AB de Villiers to become Andre Nel's 100 ODI victim. Ashraful was trapped lbw by an Albie Morkel yorker while trying to flick him and Shakib went down the wicket to drive Harris, but saw his mistimed shot going to the safe hands of Hershelle Gibbs at mid-wicket. Bangladesh have brought three uncapped playersmiddle order batsman Roqibul Hassan, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and all-rounder Mosharraf Hossain. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who remained wicketless in two Test series, was kept out of the playing eleven as left-arm pacer Syed Rasel substituted him. bdnews
