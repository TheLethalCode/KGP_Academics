 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Energy Correspondent Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)The tender process for generating power from waste has not been completed despite an initiative the Power Cell took 10 years ago. The Power Cell, an agency under the Power Division, invited bids in February 1998 from companies to produce electricity from garbage. Six companies submitted proposals after the deadline had been extended five times. The companies were American Business Corporation for Development of the US, Belgium's Seghers Better Technology for Solid + Air NV, Aarcee Holdings of Singapore, Malaysian entity Merchant Trade Asia Consortium, McConnell International of New Zealand and Bangladeshi company Jaya Vegetable Oil. A local representative of one of the bidders told bdnews24.com that there had been no progress in work after tender submission. "Nor has anybody been nominated for the job. And Power Cell did not tell us anything," he said. Power Cell director general Abdul Jalil told bdnews24.com Thursday that the issue was currently being supervised by Dhaka City Corporation and the Department of Environment. "I am not aware of any development." Ibrahim Sabir, CEO of Sabir Traders, the local agent of Singapore's Aarcee Holdings, said the Power Cell did not take any earlier decision due to political influence. He told bdnews24.com that the DCC took a new initiative for waste management in 2003. "A feasibility study has also been done. It is unknown what the DCC is doing about generating electricity from waste. We failed to get any reply from the DCC despite contacting it several times in 2004," Sabir said. He said that up to 60 MW electricity could be produced from waste generated in the DCC area. According to the DCC, garbage amounts to 3,400 tonnes a day and something between 2400 and 2500 tonnes is collected every day. Director of the DCC's waste management project Tareque Bin Yousuf told bdnews24.com that they had received proposals for electricity generation from garbage from local as well as foreign organisations. "The proposals have been evaluated. But there are no developments," he said. The DCC official said that the issue did not only involve the DCC. "Decisions from Power Cell, Petrobangla, WASA, Board of Investment and Department of Environment would be needed as well," he added. Yousuf raised the issue of price and quality of the power generated from garbage. "We really need to give the matter a thought," he said. He said that the waste from DCC could generate 2,000 kilojoules (a kilojoule is a unit of energy). At least 6,000 kilojoules of heat are needed to generate power. bdnews2
