 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has sentenced Daily Janakantha editor and managing director of Globe Constructions Atiqullah Khan Masud to seven years for fraud. Judge Tanzina Ismail of Special Judge's Court-6, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, handed down the verdict Thursday in which Rajuk officer SM Asaduzzaman was also sentenced to seven years in the same case. The two were also fined Tk 6.3 crore each or another year in prison in case of failure to pay. The Anticorruption Commission filed the fraud case with Motijheel police on Sept 30, 2007, against Atiqullah Khan Masud, SM Asaduzzaman and Rajuk employee Md Akram Hossain. The charge-sheet submitted in the case subsequently dropped Hossain's name. The ACC said that on June 26, 1990, Masud submitted designs for RAJUK approval to build a nine-storey and a six-storey building at 56 and 57 Hoseiny Dalan Road. Asaduzzaman had approved Globe Constructions' design without informing the Building Construction Committee. Joint forces arrested Masud on March 7, 2007,from Janakanthha Bhaban in Eskaton. He is currently jailed on charges of providing false information and concealing assets in his wealth statement to the ACC. Seven further cases against Masud are still under trial, of which three more involve fraud charges. The verdict in one of the cases has been set for March 9. Asaduzzaman is absconding. bdnews24.
