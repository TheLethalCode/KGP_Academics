 Patrick Markey SANTO DOMINGO, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)Ecuador and Colombia battled for support from Latin American leaders at a summit where governments sought on Friday to defuse a regional crisis over a cross-border raid by Colombia to kill leftist rebels. Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa mapped out a diplomatic route to ease the tensions, demanding the summit condemn Colombia and that President Alvaro Uribe apologise for the attack and pledge never to do it again. "This is an emergency, an emergency with the most serious consequences if we do not act in time," Correa said at the summit's opening session in the Dominican Republic. Ecuador and its leftist ally Venezuela have poured thousands of troops to their borders with Colombia and, along with Nicaragua, have cut ties with their U.S.-backed neighbor. Uribe, who is popular for his years-long offensive against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, says Ecuador and Venezuela do too little against the rebel group. "I didn't inform him of the operation because we have not had cooperation from the government of President Correa in the fight against terrorism," Uribe said during the summit. "Colombia can show its willingness to cooperate with all those who want to cooperate." Under pressure from regional governments, including heavyweights Brazil and Mexico, Uribe appears to be looking for a way to satisfy Correa in a crisis that most analysts say should not escalate into South America's first conflict in more than a decade. On the eve of the summit, Uribe pledged that his forces will not attack on neighbors' soil if they stop Marxist FARC rebels from taking shelter to plan assassinations, kidnappings and bombings against Colombians. Correa demanded that the leaders condemn Colombia to ensure countries know they cannot attack their neighbors with impunity in a region where several long-running territorial disputes blur the Latin American map. "We hope this belligerence is stopped at its core and that Ecuador's demands are satisfied after we suffered Colombia's aggression and a violation of our sovereignty," he told reporters at the Caribbean island summit. In a sign Ecuador also could move to appease Colombia's anger, the small Andean nation made a rare capture in a border area of five people it said were rebels. DIPLOMATS ON THE MARCH Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has led a leftist alliance against Uribe, blames the United States for the crisis, saying it has imposed on Colombia its policy of attacking militants anywhere in the world. The United States gives Colombia billions of dollars in military aid to combat the FARC guerrillas, helping Uribe to remain popular for pushing Latin America's oldest insurgency out of large parts of the countryside and away from cities. Despite the brinkmanship and risks of missteps on the heavily militarized borders in western South America, foreign investors largely expect the dispute to blow over as the region focuses on diplomacy. The crisis has bolstered domestic support for the three major players -- Chavez, Uribe and Correa -- for their tough stances. But each has said he wants to avoid war and there is little appetite for a conflict among their populations, where the few protests have tended to be in favor of a peaceful settlement. "The diplomatic solution is already in progress," said Jose Vicente Carrasquero, a political sciences professor at the Venezuelan Central University in Caracas.
