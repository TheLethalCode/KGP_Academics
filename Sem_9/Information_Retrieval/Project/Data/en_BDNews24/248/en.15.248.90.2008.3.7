<TEXT>
 Islamabad, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's army chief called for harmony on Thursday as a coalition opposed to President Pervez Musharraf prepared to form a government that could force him from power. Recent opinion polls showed the vast majority of people would like U.S. ally Musharraf, who came to power as a general in a coup in 1999, to step down. A crushing defeat suffered by his allies in a parliamentary election last month has raised the prospect that he could be forced out by a hostile National Assembly. General Ashfaq Kayani, who became army chief after Musharraf quit the army to become a civilian leader in November, expressed optimism that there will be a "harmonised relationship between various pillars of the state, as provided in the constitution". A military statement quoted Kayani as telling army commanders in the garrison town of Rawalpindi, that "any kind of schism, at any level, under the circumstances would not be in the larger interest of the nation." Pakistan has been reeling since mid-2007 from a suicide bomb campaign mounted by al Qaeda inspired Islamist militants. There have been four suicide attacks in the past week, and the country's state of political flux has raised international concern about the risks of instability in the nuclear-armed Muslim nation of 160 million people. The party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto won the most seats in the election while the party of Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf deposed, finished second. Both parties are set to join hands with another opposition party to form a coalition that could threaten Musharraf's rule. Musharraf has rejected calls for his resignation and has said he was ready to work with whoever forms the government. He is expected to convene the National Assembly in the coming days and invite Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) to nominate a prime ministerial candidate to form a government. Generals have led Pakistan for more than half the 60 years since the country was carved out of the partition of India following independence from Britain in 1947. Kayani reaffirmed that the army fully stood behind the democratic process and was committed to play its constitutional role in support of the elected government. He said army would stay out of the political process and expressed his hope it would not be dragged into any unnecessary controversy. Kayani, who met with Musharraf this week, said an impression was being created that the army was distancing itself from the president and he emphasised the importance of "the constitutional relationship between army and the National Command Structure". While Sharif has been outspoken in his calls for Musharraf to go, Bhutto's widower and her political successor, Asif Ali Zardari, has avoided taking such a hard line, though both have vowed to banish the military from politics.
