 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy raised questions Saturday about the neutrality of chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. "The CEC has shown his lack of neutrality by his biased statements on different occasions," Gayeshwar told reporters at former BNP lawmaker Md Shahjahan's NAM flat. He should resign from his post in the interest of protecting the neutral image of the Election Commission, Gayeshwar said. Suggesting Shamsul Huda leant towards a particular party or faction of a party, he quoted the chief election commissioner's remarks on different occasions. He quoted Huda, during electoral reforms dialogue with Awami League, as saying: "'The incumbent Election Commission is the result of your (AL's) movement.'" Some other remarks of Huda's quoted by Gayeshwar included: "'The expulsion of Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan is illegal'" and "'BNP should change its constitution'". Gayeshwar criticised the CEC's comment on Mannan Bhuiyan: "The matter is pending a court order. The CEC made his remarks on behalf of a quarter , which is not acceptable." On the constitution of the BNP, Gayeshwar said: "It is not rational to raise questions on the constitution of a party that has been running for 29 years in line with that constitution." He said the CEC did not have the authority to make any remark on the constitution of a party. The BNP joint secretary general further said that the party chairperson had nominated Khandaker Delwar Hossain as BNP secretary general in accordance with the party constitution. "There cannot be any question about it." "The invitation (to electoral reform dialogues) should be sent to the secretary general," he added. Gayeshwar also mentioned that the government's move to hold local government polls was confusing people. "People are confused as to whether or when the national elections will be held," he claimed. bdnew
