<TITLE> Economy won't recover until democracy returns: DCCI head </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  DCCI president Hossain Khaled said Saturday the economic crisis prevailing in the country would remain until a democratic government assumes power. "We had hoped that GDP growth in the current fiscal would cross 7 percent, but after the caretaker government came to power in January 2007 different factors such as the anti-corruption drive have left the economy in crisis," said Khaled. He made his comments at a function to mark the golden jubilee of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry at its auditorium in Moitjheel. Khaled went on to say that the abnormal rise in the price of essentials throughout the country had made the average person's life unbearable. "In such a situation GDP growth is bound to be lower," he said. The DCCI president, however, said the reforms of the caretaker government would hopefully bear fruit in the long term, even if the benefits are not being felt immediately. The DCCI has organised a series of programmes throughout the year to mark its golden jubilee. Two international seminars on economic issues are slated for September and October. In September, a UK team led by Sir Digby Jones is scheduled to take part in a seminar titled "Future of UK investment in Bangladesh". In October local political and trade leaders will participate in a seminar on the international economy with government officials from various countries. A rally will be held on March 22 from the DCCI's former office at Armanitola to its current address in Motijheel, and a traditional kite festival will be held on March 29 in the old-city. Nagar Bhaban Museum will host an exhibition titled "The Commercial History of Dhaka", which will also be published in book form with the assistance of the Asiatic Society. Several other programmes have also been planned including a rickshaw competition, a food festival and an essay competition. bdnews
