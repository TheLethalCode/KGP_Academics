 NAIROBI, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's unruly and divided lawmakers face a test of national reconciliation on Thursday when they sit for the first time since the signing of a power-sharing pact to end a bloody post-election crisis. President Mwai Kibaki's opening speech is expected to emphasise unity and urge the newly elected parliament to pass the laws necessary to enshrine the deal struck between him and opposition leader Raila Odinga a week ago. Kenyans are hoping the house -- which many view as a bastion of greed and laziness that rarely agrees on anything -- can move swiftly to pass the agreement creating a new prime minister's post to be taken by Odinga. "It is our hope that honourable members of this parliament ... will work in the spirit of compromise that bred the coalition and end years of agitation for a government that isn't susceptible to the whims of would-be dictators and kleptocrats," said the opposition-leaning Standard newspaper.

The power-sharing pact was designed to end turmoil after Kibaki's disputed re-election at a Dec. 27 vote, which ignited looting, riots and politically-tinged ethnic clashes in which more than 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 people displaced. The crisis, Kenya's darkest period since independence from Britain in 1963, hurt its reputation as one of Africa's most stable nations and damaged a booming economy anchored in tourism and regional trade. It also exposed simmering rifts over wealth, power and tribe dating back to the colonial era, often exacerbated by politicians angling for supremacy for their own people from among Kenya's 42 different ethnic groups. "POWER MINISTRIES" Before opening parliament, Kibaki is due to address all legislators, who are evenly split between his Party of National Unity (PNU) coalition and Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party. Analysts say the power-sharing deal is only a broad agreement, and many details must be worked out -- in particular, the premier's powers and who will get what cabinet positions. Discord has already emerged. Odinga's side wants so-called "power ministries" like finance and internal security, which Kibaki's allies are unlikely to concede. Both men are under pressure from their backers not to give away too much. Government spokesman Alfred Mutua said the president would make the final decision on cabinet appointments. However, ODM's William Ruto said the appointments would be made by both Kibaki and Odinga. "It is very clear in the accord that was signed that the cabinet is going to be shared on an equal basis, and members of cabinet will be chosen from the two sides," he told the B
