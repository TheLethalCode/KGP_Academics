<TITLE> Spain's Rajoy tries to make up for 2004 blunder </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - But for an Islamist attack on Madrid's commuters three days before the last election, Mariano Rajoy would probably have been Spain's prime minister for the past four years. Instead, the head of the conservative Popular Party (PP) finds himself leading the opposition challenge to the Socialists of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. And if opinion polls are any guide, even a faltering economy and the failure of Zapatero's policy on the poisonous issue of Basque nationalism will not propel Rajoy to power in this election either. In 2004, the outgoing government of Jose Maria Aznar, who had personally picked Rajoy months earlier to lead the PP, wrongly blamed the Basque guerrilla group ETA for the Islamist train bombings. The mistake handed a surprise victory to the Socialists, but also set the tone for Rajoy's time as opposition leader, as the PP concentrated its firepower on the Socialists' attempts to negotiate with ETA. Rajoy accused Zapatero, whom he has described as a liar and "an utter fool", of endangering Spanish national unity by talking to ETA: "If you don't do what they say, they'll bomb you, and if they don't bomb you it's because you've given in to them." Zapatero was indeed forced to abandon the talks when ETA set off a bomb despite having declared a ceasefire, but Rajoy failed to gain much political capital. ECONOMIC DOWNTURN Signs that Spain's decade-long economic boom is failing has given Rajoy a chance to change tack ahead of the election on March 9. But so far promises of better economic stewardship and tax cuts for the poor have not yielded a lead in opinion polls. Rajoy also surprised analysts by making immigration a major issue for the first time in a Spanish election, calling for a points system that would favour Latin Americans over Arabs. More than 100 academics signed a petition calling for Spaniards not to vote for the PP because of "xenophobia". The 52-year-old father of two sees himself as a moderate in a party whose image is often dominated by right-wingers closely associated with Aznar. Rajoy, a native of the rural northwesterly region of Galicia, held four ministerial posts under Aznar. His unrelenting criticism of the government has given him a stern public image, which has not been helped by a scruffy beard first grown when the scars from a serious car accident prevented him from shaving. Former Socialist prime minister Felipe Gonzalez has drawn laughs by mocking Rajoy's somewhat garbled speaking style, telling him to "get the noodles out of his mouth". Rajoy's party colleagues say his shyness can make him sound gruff. "Mariano says that if he could take each and every Spaniard out for lunch, he'd win," says a colleague, adding: "He loses a lot when he's on camera." With the polls unfavourable, there is already talk that would-be successors are manoeuvring to replace Rajoy if he loses to Zapatero for a second time. Rajoy insists that, whatever happens on March 9, he will remain head of the party, telling the newspaper El Pais: "Unless there is a disaster, which won't be the case, I'm not considering resignin
