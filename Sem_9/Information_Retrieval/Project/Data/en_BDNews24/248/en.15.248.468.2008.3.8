 kuala, Lumpur, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Malaysia's ruling Indian party lost his own seat in general elections on Saturday, victim of a big backlash from ethnic Indian voters, state news agency Bernama said. S. Samy Vellu, leader of the Malaysian Indian Congress, a component party of the ruling coalition, lost the seat he had held for three decades. He was also the longest-serving government minister with almost 30 years in cabinet. Vellu was the target of anger within the minority Indian community over complaints that they faced discrimination by the coalition, which is dominated by politicians from the majority ethnic Malay community. More than 10,000 ethnic Indians took to the streets in an anti-government protest last November.
