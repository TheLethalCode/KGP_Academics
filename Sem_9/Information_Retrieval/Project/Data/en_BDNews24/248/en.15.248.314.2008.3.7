 LONDON, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears about US recession, increased credit woes and a sinking dollar battered world stocks on Friday while oil remained stubbornly above $100 a barrel and investors sought safety in government bonds. The dollar fell to more all-time lows low against major currencies, including the euro, which hit a record beyond $1.54. Investors were focused on key US jobs data later in the day for a steer on likely interest rate moves from the US Federal Reserve but also on the depth of the US economic decline. "Markets are braced for a rather bad employment number today. These ongoing recessionary worries are hitting risk appetite across the board," said Geoffrey Yu, a currency strategist at UBS in Zurich. Overnight losses on Wall Street -- where the S&P 500 fell 2.2 percent -- spilled over to the rest of the world. MSCI's main world stock index, a benchmark for many professional investors, lost 1 percent while its emerging market counterpart sank 2.2 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down nearly 1.6 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average closed down 3.27 percent. "Turmoil, turmoil, turmoil," said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at brokers BGC Partners. "The key to unlocking the door and finding a way out can only be central banks coming together." Among the factors hitting sentiment was a renewal of fears about credit market losses. News that Thornburg Mortgage Inc, a "jumbo" US mortgage lender, was in default after failing to meet creditor demands for more upfront cash hit on Thursday. Another report showed US mortgage foreclosures hit a record high in late 2007. The February US jobs data, meanwhile, is expected by economists to show a rise of just 25,000 jobs, basically flat given the size of the population. SINKING DOLLAR The dollar tumbled to all-time lows again, with the euro powering to $1.5429 before easing back slightly to around $1.5388. The euro was boosted by the European Central Bank's signal on Thursday that it was in no hurry to start cutting rates in a month when the US Federal Reserve is seen slashing them by 75 basis points. The dollar also fell to an all-time low against the so-called dollar index, a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, at 72.698 before lifting itself slightly off the low. It has lost nearly 19 percent against this index over the past two years. The greenback also set a 3-year low around 102.11 yen. All this drove investors into safe havens. Two-year euro zone government bond yields were down 10 basis points at 3.211 percent as prices rose on demand. The benchmark 10-year bond yield was up 4 basis points at 3.751 percent. Demand for gold remained strong at around $978 an ounce, although it was off its record high of $991.90 an ounce hit during the day on Thursday. Oil prices eased a little but were still at near-record highs above $104 a barre
