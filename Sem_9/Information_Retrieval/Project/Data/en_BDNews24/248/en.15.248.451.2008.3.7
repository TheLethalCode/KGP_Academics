 BEIJING, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's top official in Tibet on Friday accused the Himalayan region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, of seeking to sabotage the Beijing Olympics. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Communist rule, told Britain's ITV network in January that during the Games Tibet supporters should protest peacefully in China against Beijing's rule. "The Beijing Olympics is the focus of world attention and the people are exalted ... but even a grand gathering like this, he is engaging in sabotage and threatening to cause trouble," Zhang Qingli, Communist Party boss of Tibet, said without elaborating. "How can this not be called engaging in splittism?" Zhang told a news conference on the sidelines of parliament when asked by Reuters why China will not believe the Dalai Lama does not advocate independence and what he needs to do to convince China. Five groups claiming to represent tens of thousands of exiled Tibetans are planning a march from India into Tibet ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics as part of a series of actions to try and embarrass China into ending its rule in the Buddhist region. But the groups said they would not seek approval from the Dalai Lama, who has a more moderate line and says he wants autonomy for Tibet, not outright independence. The groups have said it would be difficult and dangerous to cross into China. Zhang's lieutenant, Qiangba Puncog, the top government official in Tibet, said the activities of the Dalai Lama "clique were the main factors of instability in Tibet". "They will not succeed. We are fully prepared and have full confidence. We will definitely ensure the Olympics and Olympic-related events in Tibet proceed smoothly," Qiangba Puncog said, apparently referring to the Tibet leg of the Olympic torch relay that is due to scale Mount Everest. March 10 marks the 49th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile, but he remains the single most important figure in Tibetan life. The atheist Communist Party has competed against him for the loyalty of his people. On Thursday, President Hu Jintao told Tibetan members of parliament that stability in the occasionally restive Himalayan region has a bearing on the stability of China as a whole. "Tibet's stability has to do with the entire country's stability, Tibet's safety has to do with the entire country's safety," Hu said. Critics say China continues to repress Tibetans' religious aspirations, especially their veneration for the Dalai Lama, who won Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. Periodic rioting by monks has been brutally crushed. China has defended itself, saying it has poured billions of dollars to develop Tibet and improved the living standards of the impoverished region. Asked by Reuters if China would court the Dalai Lama, Zhang said China would welcome him if he matched his words with deeds. "No matter who it is ... as long as you love your country, as long as you don't engage in splittism and as long as you commit yourselves to building China, we welcome (you)," Zhang said. Hu, who is also Communist Party and military chief, praised the hard work of cadres in Tibet in a sign Tibetans would not be given more say in their own affairs. The Party should "fully trust" Han Chinese cadres sent to Tibet, he sa
