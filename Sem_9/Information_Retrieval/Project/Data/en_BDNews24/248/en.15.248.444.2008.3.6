 RIO DE JANEIRO, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juan Sebastian Veron scored one goal and set up the second to help 10-man Estudiantes to a 2-1 win away to Danubio in the Libertadores Cup on Wednesday. Adriano, on loan from Inter Milan and attempting to put his career back on the rails, scored both goals as Brazilian champions Sao Paulo beat Chile's Audax Italiano 2-1 while Fluminense thumped Arsenal 6-0 in Rio de Janeiro. Estudiantes appeared to be chasing a lost cause after they went a goal down and had a man sent off in the first half hour against their Uruguayan opponents on a wet night in Montevideo. Pedro Irala put Danubio ahead with a near-post header in the ninth minute and Estudiantes defender Agustin Ayala was sent off in the 25th for a second bookable offence. But with Veron pulling the strings in midfield, the Argentine visitors clawed their way back and equalised when Veron coolly converted a penalty awarded for pushing on the hour. The shaven-headed former Lazio, Inter Milan and Manchester United player then produced a defence-splitting pass for Enzo Perez to score the winner in the 86th minute. The result left Lanus, Deportivo Cuenca and Estudiantes level on four points in Group Two while Danubio have one. In Sao Paulo, Chilean international midfielder Carlos Villanueva fired Audax in front with a left-foot shot on the run from the edge of the penalty area in the 62nd minute. But after Audax defender Sebastian Rocco was sent off for a second bookable offence, Adriano headed Sao Paulo level in the 74th minute and tapped in the winner ten minutes later. Sao Paulo went top of Group Seven with four points from two games, one ahead of Paraguay's Sportivo Luqueno. The first Brazil-Argentina clash of the competition ended in a thumping win for Brazil as Fluminense went on a goal spree at the Maracana. Thiago Neves opened the scoring with a 14th minute free kick, then Dodo and Gabriel added further goals before halftime. Dodo made it 4-0 with a stunning 20-metre volley in the 51st minute, Washington scored after a one-two with Dodo in the 72nd and Cicero completed the rout with another free kick. Fluminense went top of Group Eight with four points from two games, ahead of Ecuador's LDU on goal difference. Arsenal have three points
