<TEXT>
 HAMILTON, New Zealand, March 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's Ryan Sidebottom took a hat-trick to spark a spectacular collapse by New Zealand and leave the first test finely balanced after the fourth day's play on Saturday. Sidebottom dismissed Stephen Fleming (66), Mathew Sinclair (two) and Jacob Oram (0) on successive deliveries to reduce New Zealand from 99-1 to 119-7 in the final session at Seddon Park. New Zealand finished the day on 147 for eight with two wickets remaining, an overall lead of 269 after England were bowled out for 348 just after lunch. Paul Collingwoood top-scored for England with 66 while debutant Tim Ambrose made 55.

Hoggard had to run at least 20 metres and took the catch high above his head with both feet off the ground to dismiss the opener for 39. The left-armer then had Fleming caught behind point by a diving Alastair Cook for 66 on the final ball of his ninth over. He then had Sinclair caught by a diving Cook for two on the first ball of his next over, before he trapped Jacob Oram in front for a duck to complete the hat-trick. Ross Taylor was then caught and bowled for six by Panesar, who then trapped Kyle Mills in front for 11, before Patel and Vettori guided their side through to the clos
