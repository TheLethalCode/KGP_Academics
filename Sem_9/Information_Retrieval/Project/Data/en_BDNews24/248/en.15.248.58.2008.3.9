 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)The US wants the elections in Bangladesh to be held no later than the end of December, said US Charge d'Affaires Geeta Pasi Sunday. Pasi made the US position on Bangladesh elections clear again after she met senior Awami League leaders, including acting party president Zillur Rahman, at his Gulshan home. "I had started meetings to exchange views on the current political situation. We had a very productive discussion (with the Awami League leaders), and we discussed a number of issues." "I think that we all share common view that we want elections to be held no later than the end of December 2008," she said. "We also discussed some of the issues that the Awami League is focused on. One of the points I would like to underscore for all of you is, this meeting underscores, I think for all of us, how important the dialogue is." Pasi referred to the demand for dialogue between the government and political parties, which she said would be an important step forward. Later, AL's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "We talked in a very cordial atmosphere. The discussion has been very successful." The US believes there will be no deviation from the elections promised by year-end, he said. Replying to a question, Ashraful said: "We want the Jatiya Sangsad election ahead of local government elections." Ashraful also said: "She (Pasi) is worried about the health condition of Sheikh Hasina. She wants proper treatment for her at home or abroad. She said human rights must not be violated in any way in the trial of Sheikh Hasina." bdnews
