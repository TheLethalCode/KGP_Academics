 MUMBAI, March 8 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Two-wheeler sales in India, the world's biggest market after China, will revive during the next fiscal year helped by price cuts and a strong economy, a senior official at the Indian unit of Honda Motor Co said. Funding options could also ease as banks control defaults, leading to growth of at least 5 percent, N.K. Rattan, divisional head of sales and marketing at Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India said on Saturday. "Whatever correction had to happen has happened," he said on the sidelines of an event to launch a new scooter model. "Some growth will definitely come next year." Two-wheeler sales fell 8 percent in April-January 2008, hit by tighter credit norms and interest rates at a five-year-high, data with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers showed. Sales rose 11.4 percent in 2006/07. "With tighter lending, defaults are falling and financiers are getting comfortable," Rattan said. Two-wheeler makers have cut prices by 500 rupee ($12.3) to 2,500 rupees a unit after the federal finance minister proposed cutting excide duty on two and three-wheelers to 12 percent from 16 percent in the annual budget for 2008/09. Honda, which is spending about $75 million to expand its Indian plant a million units, hopes to grow 2007/08 sales by a third in India to nearly 900,000 units, Rattan said. However, India's second and third-biggest motorcycle makers Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co have seen their sales fall by 10 and 16 percent respectively in April-Feruary. India's top two-wheeler firm Hero Honda Motors, 26 percent owned by Honda, has posted near flat sales and delayed the start of a new plant in north India till the start of the next financial year starting April.
