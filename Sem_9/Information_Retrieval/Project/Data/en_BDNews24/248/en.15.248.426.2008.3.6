<TITLE> Ivory Coast's Gbagbo says polls may slip past June </TITLE>

 ABIDJAN, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ivory Coast's long-delayed post-war elections, in which President Laurent Gbagbo is widely expected to seek another term, may be delayed again if the West African country is not ready by June, Gbagbo has said. The world's top cocoa grower was split in two by a brief 2002-03 civil war driven by deep north-south ethnic divisions in which rebels failed to topple Gbagbo but seized the northern half of the country. A high-stakes presidential poll initially due in October 2005, and parliamentary polls now due to be held alongside it, have been pushed back several times because the southern-based government says it can not organise polls in the rebel north. But state authority, officials and services are gradually creeping back to the north under the latest peace deal signed a year ago, under which Gbagbo appointed rebel leader Guillaume Soro as his prime minister. The deal provides for disarmament of fighters on both sides, the formation of a new national army, distribution of identity documents under a nationwide programme and organisation of the polls, which Gbagbo previously said would happen in June. "If we do not do it in June 2008 it's not the end of the world," Gbagbo told the radio station run by the U.N. peacekeeping mission late on Wednesday. "I have said June 2008, but that is the date we fixed and the one we are working towards. But if we arrive in June 2008 and we find one week beforehand that we have not finished, we will tell Ivorians that we haven't finished, and that is that." The former French colony was for many years a bastion of political and economic stability in impoverished, war-torn West Africa under independence leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who invited citizens from neighbouring states to cultivate cocoa and coffee in its fertile forests. But after his death in 1993 ethnic tensions between the mainly Christian south and more Muslim north, exacerbated by the presence of millions of mostly Muslim foreigners, fuelled a political crisis that led eventually to civil war. Gbagbo won a presidential election in 2000 -- from which other key opposition figures were barred -- despite an attempt by army ruler General Robert Guei to rig the result and hang onto power, which triggered widespread bloodshed. Gbagbo will face increased competition from former President Henri Konan Bedie, the leader of Houpouet-Boigny's Democratic Party who was ousted in the 1999 coup, and former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara, who has support among northern Muslims. Bedie and Ouattara were barred from standing in the 2000 poll but have received guarantees they will be allowed to contest the next election under a foreign-mediated de
