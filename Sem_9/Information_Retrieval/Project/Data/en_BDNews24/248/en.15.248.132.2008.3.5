 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina is facing further health problems including difficulty with her balance, her personal physician said Wednesday. Hasina's doctor Baren Chakravarty said the Awami League chief had also complained of a loss of sensation on the right side of her head. Due to the "balance problem" she leans towards the right while walking, he said. Chakravarty briefed reporters after examining Hasina at the special jail located in the Sangsad Bhaban complex where she has been detained since her arrest on July 16 last year. ABM Abdullah, the AL's chief's other physician, accompanied Chakravarty during the examination. Earlier, obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Shahla Khatun also examined Hasina at the special jail. The three doctors said they had advised that the AL president receive a check-up in hospital. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that the jail authorities would arrange Hasina's hospitalisation if she wished. Dr Abdullah told reporters that the former prime minister was suffering from a range of problems in addition to her most recent ailments. "She is suffering from different problems including eye and ear conditions as well as high-blood pressure," he said. "In fact, her tests are not being done properly here. It would be better if she could be admitted to a hospital immediately." "But she does not agree to go to hospital," Abdullah said. The doctor said Hasina's ear condition had become serious and that she should receive treatment abroad. Dr Chakravarty said a medical board should be formed to review the situation. bdnews24.
