 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League has expressed its apprehension over the holding of the 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections. Awami League acting president, Zillur Rahman, said Saturday: "While the government is saying one thing about the elections, the Election Commission is saying another, thus creating suspicion in our minds as to whether the elections will be held." Zillur Rahman was exchanging views with members of Mohila Awami League at his Gulshan home Saturday afternoon on the occasion of International Women's Day. Demanding Sheikh Hasina's unconditional release and treatment Zillur Rahman said: "She has been detained without any cause. We are deprieved of her advice." Zillur Rahman pledged that if the AL went to power in future it would arrange direct vote for one- third of parliamentary seats after reserving them for women. Demanding immediate announcement of the Jatiya Sangsad election date, he said, "The national elections must be held first." When asked to comment on Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain's comment on Friday that local elections were possible before the Jatiya Sangsad elections, Zillur Rahman said: "A browsing of law books will prove who is right. Mr Kamal's opnion is his personal view. What we are saying is in the law." Asked whether the process of sending Sheikh Hasina abroad for treatment was stalling, he said: "Attempts are on to take the leader abroad." bdnew
