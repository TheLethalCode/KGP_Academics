 BUDAPEST, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungary's opposition is set to win a referendum on Sunday to strike down health and college fees although victory will not threaten the Socialist-led coalition government, political analysts said. Hungary's eight million voters will be asked to vote "yes" to abolishing doctor and hospital visit fees of 300 forints ($1.72) as well as university fees, and polls indicate that all three questions are likely to pass with a comfortable majority. The impact on Hungary's budget will be small as the health fees generated 15.2 billion forints ($86.93 million) in 2007 and are seen at 20 to 21 billion forints in 2008, compared with an overall budget spend of 13,802 billion forints this year. The centre-right Fidesz, when it initiated the referendum had dubbed it a vote of confidence in the government, but has since backed off demands that the government must resign ahead of the next general elections in 2010 if it loses. Polls close at 1900 local (1800 GMT). Analysts added that while the yes votes will prevail, turnout is expected to be low, at around 40 percent, leaving the outcome open to interpretation and muting the impact for both sides. In order to pass, the questions need to be backed by at least 25 percent of the entire voting population. "Both sides have hedged their bets and are already looking beyond the referendum and both sides have set up escape routes ... so in a political sense, the parties are already done with the referendum," political analyst Zoltan Kiszelly said. CONFIDENCE VOTE Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, whose deeply unpopular Socialists are polling only around 15 to 17 percent after tax rises to cut Hungary's budget gap, has already called a party meeting for after the referendum to seek a confidence vote. Analysts say the party will back Gyurcsany and his economic reforms rather than risk almost certain defeat in early elections or a potentially bruising leadership fight at a time when there is no clear alternative to him. "The consequence of a relative defeat for the Socialists will be to strengthen the recent political line within Fidesz and to keep things in the Socialists camp unchanged," political think-tank Vision Consulting said in a report this week. Although Fidesz will not be able to take back power through Sunday's vote, it will solidify the position of party chief Viktor Orban. Orban, who was prime minister for one term from 1998-2002, has been weakened by election losses in 2002 and 20
