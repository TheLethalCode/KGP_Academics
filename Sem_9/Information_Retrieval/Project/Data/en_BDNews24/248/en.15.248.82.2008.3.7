<TITLE> Who was that girl? Bob Dylan asks in Brazil </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAO PAULO (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - The normally taciturn Bob Dylan was moved to words on Thursday night when a young Brazilian woman rushed on stage and hugged him during a concert in Sao Paulo. The American singer-songwriter is known for saying very little to his audience between songs and if he does it's usually an incomprehensible mumble. During the encore of his second show in Sao Paulo, a long-haired woman ran on to the stage and embraced the star. A startled-looking Dylan hung on to his black Cordoba hat before a bouncer carried her away. At the end of the song, he spoke to his fans for the first time in a two-hour show. "Thank you, friends. And I'd like to thank that young lady for coming up and joining us on stage." Then he started chuckling to himself and said: "Where did she go? I want to give her my hat. Don't let her get away." It was not known if the two did eventually get to meet formally. Dylan is currently on tour of Latin America with dates in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
