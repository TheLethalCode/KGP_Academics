 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Thursday his previous day's statement apparently misquoted by the media was that the Election Commission could hold elections to 100 Upazila Parishads if it wanted to do so. Some media reports quoted Iqbal as saying that the elections to 100 Upazila Parishads would be held in May. Contacted a day later, the adviser told bdnews24.com: "I didn't say so." The adviser made Wednesday's statement on the upazila polls when he travelled to the southwestern town of Khulna to inaugurate WASA services. The Election Commission Thursday expressed ignorance over the so-called May timeframe. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said he had no idea about the schedule. Later in the day, Iqbal clarified his statement after bdnews24.com approached him by phone: "The Election Commission can hold elections to 100 upazilas, if it wants to do so. Voter listing has been completed in 80 upazilas. The voter listing of the remaining 20 upazilas will end this month. However, the ordinance giving the Election Commission powers to hold upazila elections has to be promulgated first." bdnews
