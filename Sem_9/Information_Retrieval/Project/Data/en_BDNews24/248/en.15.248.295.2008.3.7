 Benapole, March 7 (bdnews24,com)  Kolkata police Friday handed over two suspected criminals to Bangladesh authorities at Benapole border. The suspects Sanjidul Islam Imon and Ishaq Hossain are wanted in various criminal charges, but they have long been hiding in India to avoid arrest, police said. CID's additional special police superintendent Abdullah Aref said they received the suspects from Indian police after months of waiting since the nations have no extradition treaty. In such cases, India follows normal deportation formalities. Indian police arrested Imon at a flat in Kolkata on Dec 6, 2007 while Ishaq on Jan 20 at a guesthouse in Orissa, he said. The Indian authorities have handed over five other top Bangladeshi criminal suspects to Bangladesh over the past five months. bdnews2
