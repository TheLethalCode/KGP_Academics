<TITLE> Bonds offer hedge for $4 trillion pension risk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 EDINBURGH, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pension funds should issue bonds in order to protect themselves from the 2 trillion pound ($4,029 billion) risk created by people living longer, pensions experts say. Increasing longevity, prompted by medical advances, is creating a massive financial headache for companies with defined-benefit pension schemes, which guarantee an income in retirement to employees until they die. Firms have been forced to pump billions of pounds into their pension schemes to pay this cost, but the Pensions Regulator has said many still have not fully recognised just how long their employees are likely to live after they leave work. The longevity liabilities of the UK's public and private sector pensions amount to around 2 trillion pounds, David Blake, Director of the Pensions Institute at the Cass Business School, told a pensions conference in Edinburgh. "There is massive uncertainty over how long people are going to live in the future," said Blake, adding that life expectancy has been improving at the rate of 2.5 years per decade, or 15 minutes per hour. "It doesn't strike me as sensible that pension funds should have to predict future medical advances and what the effect of those will be on the life expectancy of their retired workers," said Blake. But he added: "The capital markets are now developing hedges to help you manage these risks." EMERGING MARKET The market for longevity bonds is still in its infancy, "but it could become very large," Guy Coughlan, the head of JP Morgan's LifeMetrics unit told the conference. The development of the market has been slow, because many investors remain wary of the risks involved in investing in such bonds and because there is no standardised bond format that would prompt investors to trade these risks, said Coughlan. The Pension Protection Fund, Britain's pension fund lifeboat scheme, may issue a longevity bond in future, its chief executive Partha Dasgupta told Reuters. "But the market hasn't yet got to the level of maturity and product design for us to do that ... I still think it's five years away," said Dasgupta. Critics have argued longevity bonds are unlikely to take off because investors will not want a risk -- people living longer -- that current scientific evidence suggests will only increase. But the headline data masks wide variations in life expectancy, according to people's income, job and where they live, said Blake, which could allow investors to trade different kinds of bonds with varying longevity. Epidemics, such as the influenza pandemic following the First World War, which killed millions of people, and the potential threat posed by growing obesity, could also reverse the current trend towards people living longer. "I don't think it's fair to say it's a one way bet," said Dasgupta. Hedge funds that are currently investing in insurance-linked securities such as hurricane bonds are keen to invest in longevity bonds, said Coughlan. "They see longevity as the gap in their portfolios in terms of insurable risks that they're looking for," said Coughlan. "The broader hedge fund community is developing an interest in this as a new and uncorrelated asset class. From there you will see it widen out with familiarity and understanding to a broader group of investors," Coughlan said. Blake said the government should invest in longevity bonds to help kickstart the market. "It might be hard for the private sector to assume all this risk," but the government has said it does not want to take on these exposures, said Bla
