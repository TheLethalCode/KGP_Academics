 March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For the first time since Democrat John Kennedy of Massachusetts won the job in 1960, a member of the US Senate will be elected in November as US president. Sen. John McCain of Arizona wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, while Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois kept his lead over hard-charging Sen.

He also helped lead the charge to normalize trade relations with former foe Vietnam. As relative newcomers to the Senate, Clinton and Obama have far shorter records of accomplishments. Yet Clinton has been a leading voice on health care, while Obama helped lead a charge to tighten ethics rules in the scandal-hit Congress.
