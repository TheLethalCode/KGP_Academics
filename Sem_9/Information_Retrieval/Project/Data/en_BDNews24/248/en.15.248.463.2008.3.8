 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will search for a combination for the next World Cup squad when the Tigers take on South Africa in the first of the three-ODI series at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong Sunday. "We are looking forward to building a new combination with the experienced and the newcomers for the next World Cup to be held in the subcontinent, and we feel no pressure in taking on South Africa Sunday," Bangladesh's skipper Mohammad Ashraful told reporters at a press conference Saturday in the port city. The team management have already brought four new faces into the one-day squad with Nazimuddin, Mosharraf Hossain, Roqibul Hasan and Dhiman Ghosh coming into the national fold. Though the team management is yet to announce the playing eleven, it seems Nazimuddin, Mosharraf and Dhiman are to get the one-day cap. Ashraful saw no problem to fielding the newcomers against the Proteas on way to the preparation for the World Cup. He, however, said South Africa was a ranking two team. The Tigers will certainly seek inspiration from their Guyana triumph against South Africa along with the brilliant performance in Friday's warm-up match. Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons is also optimistic, but he wants to see performance from each individual. "Again I say each player has to perform. If they do, I think the one-day series will be competitive," said Siddons. The Australian coach believes 240 is likely to be a good total to defend considering the attack on home ground. Siddons said that he could not say whether the playing eleven were balanced as they were yet to pick the squad. He, however, hinted that there might be three spinners - Mosharraf stepping into the shoes of the recently- retired Mohammad Rafique, Abdur Razzak and Shakib Al Hasan -- in the squad on the slow and low wicket. "We have got three left-arm spinners, which is probably not good for a balance. But they are the best spinners in the country, so hopefully they will do the job for us. They did the job well in yesterday's (Friday) practice match)." On the other hand, South Africa also singing the song of youth as Herschelle Gibbs, Charl Langveldt, Paul Harris, Albie Morkel, Alviro Peterson came in for Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini, Neil McKenzie and Mark Boucher. South Africa captain Graeme Smith had earlier said that the one-day series was a platform for South Africa's newcomers and hoped they would exploit the opportunity. Smith however was a bit worried over their bowling attack after the retirement of all-rounder Shaun Pollock. He thought their bowling attack was a new one after resting Kallis and Ntini from the one-day series. The 27-year-old captain now has to rely on Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Langveldt, Albie Morkel. South African coach Mike Arthur warned his boys Bangladesh are far better side than the Test squad. bdn
