 Kuala Lampur, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's premier has no plan to step down after leading his ruling coalition to its worst-ever election disaster in which the opposition Islamists and reformists won control of five of the nation's 13 states. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's multi-racial National Front coalition won just a simple majority in parliament, and his future as leader is in doubt after he watched a record majority collapse to the weakest level ever. But Abdullah had no plan to quit, his spokesman said on Sunday, despite urging by predecessor Mahathir Mohamad that the prime minister must take responsibility for the election defeat. "There are no plans to resign," Abdullah's spokesman, Kamal Khalid said. "He still has plans to proceed to the palace tomorrow morning to take the oath of office." Mahathir urged Abdullah to quit. "He should accept responsibility," said Mahathir, who now says he made a mistake in picking Abdullah as his successor and that the current deputy premier, Najib Razak, should have taken over. The streets were unusually quiet, with many older Malaysians fearful of trouble. The last time the coalition suffered a heavy setback, in 1969, race riots erupted. Barisan has effectively ruled since independence from Britain in 1957. "I don't like Barisan Nasional," said Latipah, a 28-year manicurist in Kuala Lumpur. "I think the prime minister is indecisive, slow and confused. But I'm afraid there will be trouble now that they've lost badly." She said she was glad Malaysia now had a strong opposition to press the government. "Barisan Nasional has been there a long time, it's time to give others a chance." Abdullah, who just four years ago led the coalition to a record election victory on a wave of hope for change, faced a bleak political future on Sunday, his aides stunned but unwilling to concede that he must step down. Several party leaders would meet the prime minister to pledge him their support, a source close to the party leadership said. "A lot of senior people from within the party are seeing the PM to pledge their support." Abdullah's humbling performance nationally -- the coalition ended up with 62 percent of federal seats, down from 90 percent previously -- was compounded by the fact that his own home state, the industrial heartland of Penang, fell to the opposition. ISLAMISTS ON THE RISE The leftist Chinese-backed Democratic Action Party (DAP) won Penang, the hub of Malaysia's electronics industry, which accounts for about half of exports. The opposition Islamist party, PAS, scored shock victories in the northern heartland states of Kedah and Perak and easily retained power in its stronghold in northeastern Kelantan state. DAP and PAS also joined the People's Justice Party, or Parti Keadilan, to take control of the industrial state of Selangor and almost all the seats in capital Kuala Lumpur. Political experts and economists wondered aloud whether the Barisan government could now pursue its agenda, including plans for $325 billion in development zones across the country. Without a two-thirds parliamentary majority, Barisan can no longer change the constitution or make some key appointments. "This is probably not good news for the equity market or the ringgit," said Tim Condon, Singapore-based head of Asia research for investment bank ING. Malaysia is largely a mix of ethnic Malays, which make up about 55 percent of the population, and ethnic Chinese and Indians, who account for about a third. A protest vote from Chinese and Indians, upset over what they saw as racial inequality in terms of business, job and education opportunities, had been expected. The Indians were merciless, voting out the leader of the coalition's Indian component party and handing a seat to an Indian activist now in detention. But Malays, who are all Muslims and traditionally support Barisan in good times and bad, completed a perfect storm for the government, handing the opposition Islamists a record vote in what was perceived as a protest against rising prices. "Tomorrow we will start building a brighter future," said opposition figure Anwar Ibrahim, de facto leader of Keadilan, which emerged as the biggest opposition party in federal parliament with 31 seats. "This is a new dawn for Malaysia." Results from the election commission as of 0720 GMT showed the National Front with 138 seats in the 222-seat parliament versus 82 for the opposition, with 2 seats still being tallied.
