<TITLE> PSC's legal disputes will delay BCS exam results: chairman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  The results of the 27th BCS examinations are not likely to be published within the coming year, the Public Service Commission chairman said Thursday. "It will not be possible for us to publish the results of the 27th BCS exams in the next one year as a number of cases have been filed against the commission," Saadat Hussain said, adding that the legal disputes were disrupting the regular activities of the commission. "We are not certain when the cases will be resolved," the PSC chairman said, during the launch of a report by BRAC University's Institute of Governance Studies, at a city hotel. "The viva voce of the current BCS exam will be finished in May," he said. "But we will have to sit idle. Without disposal of the cases, we cannot publish the result." "It is up to the court when the cases will be disposed off," Hussein, a former cabinet secretary, said. He also said the PSC's examination system must be changed, mentioning that the existing system allowed incompetent candidates to qualify for exams. "I interviewed some 400 BCS candidates at the viva voce board. I saw some candidates who do not have ABC knowledge of English," Hussein said, adding that some candidates had not read a newspaper in the last two months. "There must be something wrong in the process. There were serious irregularities. Otherwise, they should not reach the viva voce." He came down heavily on the former chairmen of the commission for what he termed "carrying out the order of the governments". Hussein said the original BCS appointments were made in unethical, irregular and non-transparent ways, and so the first BCS examination "went sour". He said the PSC was a very low-priority organisation; no government had paid enough attention to strengthen the commission. bdnews24.c
