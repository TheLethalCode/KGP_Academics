 BERLIN, March 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Like a supertanker on autopilot, the German economy is steaming past an array of economic hazards that many of its peers fear will drive them into recession. A rise in the euro to a record high, the threat of a US recession and financial market turmoil have failed to drag down Europe's largest economy to the same extent as many others. Instead, robust exports and a stable if unspectacular housing sector are helping Germany steer a steady course through a period of weakening growth in the global economy. "The German business sector seems to be coping better with the current challenges than business sectors in many other countries," said Bank of America economist Holger Schmieding. Strong trade and investment helped the German economy expand by 2.5 percent in 2007, outpacing French growth of 1.9 percent. A drop in private consumption slowed growth in the final quarter but firms remain upbeat, with corporate morale rising this year. By contrast, Italian business confidence fell to its lowest level in 28 months last month. Spain, like the United States, is experiencing a housing market correction that economists fear could tip it into recession. In Germany, a solid industrial base is helping the economy weather financial market turbulence and currency pressures that are being felt more keenly elsewhere. Germany is the world's largest exporter of goods -- a title it has earned by making quality engineering products that are being sucked in by emerging economies like China, and which are proving resistant to price rises caused by the strong euro. "Germany is reaping the benefits of previous wage restraint, internal reforms and fairly solid global demand for German products," said Schmieding, adding that China and oil-producing countries like the machines and equipment Germany produces. Trade unions feel the economic upswing justifies significant pay rises this year, though if they go too far job losses could result. "Wage increases that are too high would very quickly lead to the rise in employment coming to an end," said Kai Carstensen, economist at the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. CHINA FACTOR China is a major growth driver for German firms like conglomerate Siemens, which said on Wednesday slower economic growth had not affected its order books yet and that it still expected a strong book-to-bill ratio for the time being. Siemens supplies China with goods like locomotive parts, steel producing equipment and power station control systems -- just the kind of infrastructure emerging economies need to grow. By tapping emerging markets, German firms are able to keep expanding despite the challenges of slowing growth in the broader world economy and the stronger euro, which hit a record of $1.5275 this week. German government officials have complained less about the euro's rise than those in other euro zone economies like France, where jet maker Dassault Aviation has said it could move production abroad to shield itself from the euro's rise. "German exporters clearly supply very high-quality products, which are not so price-sensitive," said Ifo's Carstensen. "We are seeing that the appreciation of the euro in business with buyers outside the euro zone has not made such a strong mark as we expected," he added. Germany's manufacturing sector expanded during the 1960s and 1970s, when the small- and medium-sized firms that form the backbone of the economy forged close ties with regional lenders, fostering a culture of loyalty that helped such businesses grow. Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Mirow said on Thursday he saw no direct impact from financial market turmoil on the credit supply to such mid-sized firms, the so-called 'Mittelstand'. CONSUMERS, HOUSES A major section of the German economy that has failed to deliver solid growth is private consumption, which fell by 0.8 percent on the quarter in the October-December period last year. Households, worried that welfare reforms mean they will have to provide more for themselves in old age, are saving around 10 percent of their income and responded to recent price rises by cutting spending. However, with unemployment having fallen steadily over the last two years, economists say the conditions are in place for household spending to pick up, generating growth that could help offset any slowdown in the corporate sector. "For German consumers there is a lot of upside, they do have the money to spend," said Bank of America's Schmieding. "Whether they will spend it is a very open question. I think they will." Another factor lending stability to the German economy is the housing market, in which prices have shown little movement over the last year -- missing out on the surge in prices seen in other countries but also escaping the downturn. Germany's home ownership rate is some 40 percent, compared to over 80 percent in Spain, where house price growth hit its lowest rate in nearly a decade in the final quarter of 2007. "If you didn't have the bubble, you don't need the correction," said Lehman Brothers economist Sandra Petcov. "There is no need (for Germany) to correct down relative to fundamental values, so that is clearly a positiv
