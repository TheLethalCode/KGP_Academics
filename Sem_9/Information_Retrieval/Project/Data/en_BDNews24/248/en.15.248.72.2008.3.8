<TITLE> Rafique refuses to reply BCB's show-cause notice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 8 (bdnews24.ocm) -- Retired spinner Mohammad Rafique has said he will not reply to a 'show-cause' notice issued by the Bangladesh Cricket Board a few days ago asking him to explain his criticism of the Board. "I only know that I am not going to reply to the Board's show-cause notice," Rafique told bdnews24.com Saturday. The controversy stems from remarks Rafique made at his farewell Test in Chittagong (Feb 20 to March 4) between Bangladesh and a visiting South Africa team. Rafique told reporters that he had decided to quit international cricket to protest against "a group people in the Bangladesh Cricket Board" who did not like to see him in the squad. "So far as I know, a cricketer's relationship with the board ends when he retires from international cricket. Considering this, I am not bound to reply their show-cause notice," said Rafique. The BCB recently served the notice on Rafique for a code of conduct breach, asking him to reply by March 8. However, BCB cricket operation chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu said Rafique is still a contracted player with the board, and has a further two-and-a-half months of a six-month contract to serve. "He is therefore still governed by the board's code of conduct," said Lipu. The 37 year-old cricketer, however, maintains that he will never play for the national side again and does not want to hear any more about a breach in the code of conduct rules. "Besides, why did they serve me a show-cause after awarding me a farewell crest," he said. Some cricket observers are now predicting that Rafique may not receive his remaining two-and-a-half months salary from the BCB. Rafique may also have difficulty playing the domestic cricket, which is controlled by the board. Rafique is the first Bangladeshi player to complete the double of 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in one-day internationals and Tests. He scored 1059 runs, and took 100 wickets in 33 Tests since his debut against India in Dhaka in November 2000. Rafique also made 1191 runs, and grabbed 125 wickets in as many ODIs since his debut against India in Sharjah in 1995. bdnew
