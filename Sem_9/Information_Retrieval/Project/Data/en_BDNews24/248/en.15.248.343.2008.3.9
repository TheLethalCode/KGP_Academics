 KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Malaysian premier's multi-racial coalition won a simple parliamentary majority in general elections on Saturday, the Election Commission said on Sunday. But the ruling coalition lost control of three states -- Kedah, Penang and Kelantan, the election body said with results still being tallied. Barisan held a 90 percent majority in the last parliament and is set for a historic setback at these elections. The opposition is claiming victory in five state assemblies, including Selangor and Perak, while also capturing at least one-third of the seats in federal parliament.
