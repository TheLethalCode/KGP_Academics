 Sumon K Chakrabarti NEW DELHI, March 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is becoming a transit hub for heroin consignments destined for Europe, said the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) Wednesday. In a report released in New Delhi, the Vienna-based organisation said the majority of such consignments passing through Zia International Airport and Chittagong seaport are going undetected. Bangladesh has also become a new destination for Indian heroin, said INCB, which implements the United Nations drug conventions. "We have given special impetus to Bangladesh. And believe meI am measuring every word I say. When investigation and law-enforcing institutions in a country are weak and there are certain governance issues, obviously drug traffickers make that country their prime target," said Gary Lewis, South Asia representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Heroin is trafficked to Bangladesh through various meansby courier, by commercial vehicles or train along the route leading from India and by sea via Bay of Bengal or overland by truck or public transport along a route leading from Myanmar to Bangladesh, the report said. The report clearly notes that while proper implementation of the drug control strategy is hampered by resources and training in Bangladesh, "priority is hardly given to drug control issues". The report said that licitly manufactured pharmaceutical preparations such as codeine-based cough syrup, benozodiazepines and buprenorphine were smuggled from India into Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. "In India, organised criminal groups traffic in amphetamine-type stimulants." In Bangladesh, Lewis said, 'Yaba', a tablet containing methamphetamine and caffeine is gaining popularity among young people from the middle class and upper-middle-class families and in areas near the border with Myanmar. "Drug abuse has spread to rural areas in Bangladesh," Lewis said, adding that codeine-based cough syrup and cannabis is gaining popularity outside the main cities. The drug report also warns of celebrity 'endorsement' through drug-related lifestyles. It says these people can make drugs seem glamorous and influence the youth, who are often most vulnerable to the cult of celebrity.
