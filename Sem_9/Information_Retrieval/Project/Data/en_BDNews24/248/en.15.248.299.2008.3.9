<TITLE> Hopes fade for 13 miners trapped in northeast China </TITLE>

 Beijing, March 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rescuers have given up hope for 13 coal miners trapped by gas and an underground fire in northeast China for four days, Xinhua News Agency said on Sunday, blaming the mine owner for trying to cover up their plight. The owner of the Taiyuan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province initially said all the miners had escaped safely when a fire, caused by either a faulty underground cable or welding, broke out on Wednesday night, Xinhua said. Condensed toxic carbon monoxide gas has hampered rescue work, and leaves little hope for the miners, it said, citing sources with the rescuers. The underground fire could continue for at least one week. China's coal industry is the world's deadliest, killing an average of 10 miners a day last year. A push for increased production after coal shortages this winter has raised concerns of more accidents, reversing the country's success in bringing down the death rate over the past few years. On Wednesday, 17 miners died in a coal mine fire in Jilin province, also in the northeast.
