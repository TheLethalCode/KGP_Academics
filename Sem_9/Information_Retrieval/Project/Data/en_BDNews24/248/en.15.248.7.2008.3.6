 Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)Four anticorruption taskforce officials quizzed former prime minister Khaleda Zia in special jail in the Niko graft case for more than four hours Thursday, her lawyers said. Updated After the anticorruption taskforce left the special jail around 7:45pm, Khaleda's lawyers Mahbub Uddin Khokon and Masud Ahmed Talukder stayed for half an hour more with the former prime minister and discussed the cases against her, they said in a news briefing. Khokon told reporters that the former prime minister had denied the charges in the Niko corruption case. The lawyer quoted Khaleda as saying: "Whatever happened at the time was in line with the rules of business." Masud Ahmed Talukder said: "Khaleda Zia also talked about the efforts to unify the BNP with us." The detained BNP chairperson was quoted as saying: "Whatever happened in the past was in line with the party constitution. And whatever happens in future will be based on the party constitution as well." Brigadier General Zakir Hasan, inspector general of prisons, told bdnews24.com that the officials led by Major Mostafa Kamal entered the special jail at 3:30 pm. The other members of the taskforce are CID inspector Nurul Islam, ACC deputy director Sahidur Rahman and NBR assistant tax commissioner Shamimur Rahman. Thursday's questioning came after former acting energy secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam and former acting secretary to the Prime Minister's Office Nurul Islam gave statements in the case Wednesday. ACC's investigating officer Sahidur Rahman recorded their statements. The charges against Khaleda involve awarding three gasfields to the Calgary-based company, Niko Resources, showing the fields as "abandoned" during her premiership. On Dec 9, the ACC filed the case against Khaleda and some other people, including two former cabinet colleagues. There is another case on similar charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The whole process of awarding the deals to Niko covered two regimes, 1996-2001 led by Hasina and 2001-2006 by Khaleda, according to the case documents. The state has reportedly cost some Tk10,000 crore because of the contracts with Niko. Former BNP law minister barrister Moudud Ahmed, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former acting energy secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam and Niko representative Quashem Sharif are the other accused in the case. After investigation, police later implicated controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun and former Dhaka Club president Selim Bhuiyan in the case. Khaleda's BNP and Hasina's Awami League denied the charges that the party chiefs had resorted to corrupt practices to award the deals to the overseas company. bdnews24.co
