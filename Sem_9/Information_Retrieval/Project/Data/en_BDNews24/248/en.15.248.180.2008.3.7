 ZAGREB, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia is acting to clean up its system of granting state contracts and licences and put an end to corrupt practices as part of efforts to meet European Union standards, local and EU officials said on Friday. The former Yugoslav republic started EU membership talks in 2005 and wants to wrap them up by mid-2009. But up to now it has done little to meet benchmarks set by the European Commission for a transparent system of public procurement, free of under-the-table deals. On Friday, the economy ministry signed an agreement with the chamber of commerce to start educating civil servants and businessmen about a new system of tenders expected to be in place later this year. Constantino Longares Barrio, a Commission official who attended Friday's signing, described it as encouraging. "This area is key in the fight against corruption. Public procurement is one of the areas where most corruption comes," he told Reuters. The aim is to show that competition for state contracts and concessions will be trasparent and open on equal terms to local and foreign companies, with little tolerance for corruption. The new system foresees more rigorous monitoring of tenders and how they are allotted and a public dialogue with potential competitors. Those who persist with attempted under-the-table deals will be prosecuted. "This negotiating chapter, perhaps more than any other, calls for a change of mindset. People will have to respect the regulations and be afraid of violating them," ministry state secretary Tamara Obradovic Mazal told Reuters. She said the annual value of public procurement deals in Croatia amounted to some 14 percent of its gross domestic product, or around 40 billion kuna ($8.47 billion), but contracts were not always awarded by the book. "So far, practice has shown that people sometimes tend to circumvent the law on both sides (the state and suppliers)," she said. The government has passed a new law on public procurement, which took effect this year, and will soon be followed by related laws on concessions and public-private partnership. Barrio said Croatia needed a good system to manage procurement and was going in the right direction now. "You now have a structural approach instead of piecemeal. That's why this will help address the benchmarks," he said. Obradovic Mazal said the government was set to have a legally-regulated system in place before Ju
