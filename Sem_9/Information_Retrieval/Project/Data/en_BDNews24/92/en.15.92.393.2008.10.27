<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - River Plate's miserable run continued on Sunday when they lost 1-0 at modest Gimnasia-Jujuy in the Argentine championship, their third such defeat in a week. At the other end of the table, leaders San Lorenzo's run of six wins came to an end in a 2-1 defeat by Racing Club. Beaten 1-0 by arch-rivals Boca Juniors on Sunday and then at home by Mexican side Guadalajara in the Copa Sudamericana on Wednesday, champions River remained 19th in the 20-team table. Diego Simeone's team have won only once in 11 league games, taken a paltry eight points and ahead of bottom-of-the-table Rosario Central on goal difference. Hector Desvaux scored the only goal in the 58th minute, heading in from the penalty spot from a corner on the left. The match was briefly interrupted in the first half when police intervened as rival factions of the Gimnasia supporters fought amongst themselves. San Lorenzo found themselves 2-0 behind in less than 20 minutes to struggling Racing Club. Adrian Lucero fired the Academy in front after two minutes, scoring with a left-foot shot from Pablo Lugercio's back-heeled pass, before Maximiliano Moralez won and converted a 19th minute penalty. Racing missed a glut of chances to increase their lead before halftime, then suffered a nerve-wracking finale after San Lorenzo pulled one back with a free kick from Paraguay international Aureliano Torres in the 69th minute. San Lorenzo, who have 25 points, had their lead cut to two points after second-placed Tigre won 3-0 at Huracan on Saturday. Boca Juniors jumped to third, a further three points behind, by beating Rosario Central 2-1 with an 87th minute winner from Nicolas Gaitan. Lucas Viatri headed in Juan Roman Riquelme's cross in the seventh minute for Boca before Central replied when Emilio Zelaya turned in Alexis Danelon's low cross early in the second half
