 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com) The War Crimes Facts Finding Committee, formed to probe atrocities during the 1971 liberation war, has decided to submit to the EC a statement with specific charges against Jamaat-e-Islami. Committee convenor Dr MA Hasan said Sunday their decision came following a public notice from the Election Commission asking if anybody had any objections against Jamaat's registration. "Specific objections will be given in writing to the Election Commission secretary Monday," Dr Hasan told bdnews24.com. "The party has taken a new name and accepted the constitution (of Bangladesh) by changing a few words. "But not a single member of Jamaat has expressed formal loyalty to the constitution. They did not admit that they committed mistake by opposing the liberation war. They did not seek apology," Dr Hasan said. "Many including al-Badr chief Motiur Rahman Nizami are still in the top leadership of the party." Dr Hasan alleged that the party was still being run with money sourced from abroad. The EC published the public notice in the newspapers on Sunday regarding Jamaat, giving just one day for the public to submit objections. The EC had earlier published public notices about 11 other parties, but no complaints were received about any, the chief of the EC scrutiny committee Nurul Islam Khan said. He said there were no obstacles to the major parties of the country getting registered. "BNP on Sunday made amendments to the party constitution. (Jatiyatabadi) Chhatra Dal and Sramik Dal will have their own constitutions and cease to be associate organisations of BNP," Khan said. "This removed the last legal complexity for the party." Earlier the Awami League had also made similar amendments. bdne
