<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)The B. League, after a four-day break due to inclement weather, resumes on Thursday with a high-voltage match between spirited Dhaka Mohammedan SC and tough Brothers Union at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Both Mohammedan SC and Brothers Union are looking to toppling each other to stretch their leads to the 11-team point table as both outfits are set to return after a long gap following players' involvement in the national team. The Gopibagh-based Brothers Union secured eight points from four outings, one point ahead of Mohammedan SC, and five points less than league leaders Sheikh Russel KC, who have played the maximum six games. Mohammedan played a match less than Brothers Union's four. Last year's runners-up Mohammedan are flying high after demolishing struggling giants Muktijoddha Sangsad 7-0 in their previous match 22 days ago, and coach Maruful Haq might have some worries whether superb spirit the players showed against Muktijoddha will return after the long club absence. "I don't think they will repeat the feat, but the 7-0 win over Muktijoddha boosted the players' confidence and they are now very positive about facing the Brothers, though they are a strong team," Haq told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Haq may find some relief in his players' scoring ability, as strikers and midfielders almostl to a man are among goal scorers, but he will be relying mostly on his strike duo Nigerian Bukola Olaleken and Mohammad Robin, who shared five goals in three outings. Mohammedan will miss injured stopper, Hasan Al Mamun, and coach Haq is thinking of including either Nasir Hossain or Kamal Hossain in Mamun's place. Brothers coach Wasim Iqbal was apparently upset with his toothless attack after his side struck a last-gasp goal to make a 2-2 draw against lowly Arambagh KS in their last match on Oct 10. "The luck does not favour us. The strikers in previous outings went close several times to scoring, but couldn't follow through with any goals lucky to find the back of the opponents' net," Iqbal told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Former national footballer, Iqbal is very keen to bring his side back on the winning track, though he regards Mohammedan as a stronger side. b
