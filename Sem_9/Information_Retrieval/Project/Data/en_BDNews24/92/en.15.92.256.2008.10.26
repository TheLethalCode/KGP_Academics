 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) Economists, financial experts and business leaders have urged the government to take signs of worldwide recession "seriously", and form a high level task force on an emergency basis to minimise any impact on Bangladesh. Speakers at a seminar on 'The global financial crisis and what it means for Bangladesh' said it was imperative to assess which sectors of the economy would be worse affected by the prevailing crisis and for how long. "The crisis in the world economy is developing and taking on new dimensions every day. None can say how long it will persist," said Debapriya Bhattacharya, permanent representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations in Geneva, in a key-note address. "Our government must take immediate action so that any impact can be averted here. For determining these actions, the formation of a task force is an urgent necessity," said the former executive director of Centre for Policy Dialogue, organisers of the seminar. "The central bank has taken some steps but they are not sufficient compared to the need. The crisis has to be seen from its entirety. Only a task force formed with experts can analyse the most up-to-date information on the world economy and advise the government on what to do," said Debapriya. Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed agreed: "Bangladesh Bank is monitoring the overall situation, but a task force is necessary." "The impact of the global crisis may not fall directly on the banking sector or share market, but there is apprehension of its negative impact on different sectors of economy including remittance inflow," the governor warned. Salehuddin added that if such a task force is formed, it has to be ensured that its recommendations are implemented quickly. Former finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhit echoed the calls for a task force, saying: "The crisis will have a negative impact on our export earnings and remittance flow. Foreign aid and investment is also likely to fall. As a result GDP growth will slow down." "Steps must be taken on an emergency basis to solve the problems in infrastructure, including gas and power. The rate of interest on bank loans must also be lowered to increase production," he said. President of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Fazlul Hoque said: "The government must take seriously the probable impact of the world crisis on our economy and take immediate steps." CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan presided, with BRAC executive director Mahbub Hossain, former president of FBCCI Mir Nasir Hossain, Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive officer Salahuddin Ahmed and CPD executive director Mostafizur Rahman among the speakers. bdnews
