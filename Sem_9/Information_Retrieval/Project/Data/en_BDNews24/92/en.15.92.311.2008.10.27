 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  A human rights organisation has filed a contempt of court petition with the High Court against three secretaries and the inspector general of police for not taking effective action in stopping the sale of melamine tainted powder milk. Eight Supreme Court lawyers on behalf of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed the petition with the HC bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Md Abdul Hai on Monday. The hearing is set to be held on Tuesday. The petition stated that the HC on Oct 23 directed the government to take quick action in banning the display and sale of eight foreign powder milk brands. The government has not taken any effective measure yet despite the HC order, the petitioners said. The government's commerce secretary, home secretary, health secretary and inspector general of police have defied the court order by their inaction, they alleged. The banned brands are Australian brands Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, Chinese brands Yashli-1, Yashli- 2 and Sweet Baby, and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. bdnew
