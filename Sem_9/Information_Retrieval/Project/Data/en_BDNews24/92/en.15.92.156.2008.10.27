 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government is taking steps to create a food and drug regulatory agency within the next two years, modelled on the US Food and Drug Administration, to prevent adulteration in food and ensure quality control, the health and food adviser said on Monday. He also mentioned that the government would move to ensure that lucrative ads for children's foods comply with existing advertising standards. The decision comes in the wake of a recent British ban on Bangladesh-bound ads for Horlicks and Maggi Noodles that, according to the UK's advertising watchdog, made false nutritional claims. "The government has decided to take measures in line with existing laws on advertising to prevent false and lucrative ads for children's foods," adviser Shawkat Ali told a press conference at the ministry. The health ministry was in contact with the information ministry in the regard, he said. The adviser said the food and drug watchdog would be modelled on the Federal Food and Drug Administration of the US. "As there is no unique authority to test and control the quality of food in the country the government has moved to form a body in this regard," Shawkat said. A survey was carried out in 2005 in this regard that will be followed in the next two years to establish the regulatory body. A high level committee will be formed in the meantime, said Shawkat, led by a top level official of the health ministry with members from the ministries of commerce and industry, among others. Asked about the eight banned brands of milk powder still available in the market, despite a High Court order, he said: "The government has not received the court order copy in hand yet." "It is not possible to take any measures in this regard until we get the copy," he said. "However the government has started to run mobile courts to stop the sale of the banned products after the news was published in the media," he said. The health ministry is also campaigning to spread the message to parents that there is no alternative to breast milk, Shawkat Ali said. "The government has limitations. We do not have an adequate system of mobile courts compared to the huge number of retail shops." "The products might be sold due to lack of manpower. But the government is taking rigorous measures on the matter," the adviser said. The HC directed the government on Oct 23 to take quick measures in banning the display and sale of eight foreign powder milk brands. The government has already halted the registration procedure of Chinese brands tainted with melamine, Yashli-1, Yashli-2 and Sweet Baby. It has also asked deputy commissioners and civil sergeants to take legal actions to seize unregistered milk powders from the market. Sufficient numbers of taskforce members were also formed under the commerce ministry as per the demand of the health ministry, the adviser said. Powdered milk samples were sent to Hong Kong for further tests that would be completed in three to four days, he said. bdnew
