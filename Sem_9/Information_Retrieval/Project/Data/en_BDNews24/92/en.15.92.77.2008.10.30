 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Titleholders River Plate dropped to the bottom of the Argentine championship after drawing 1-1 with Newell's Old Boys on Wednesday and furious coach Diego Simeone reportedly injured himself as he vented his anger. Simeone was seen to hit the substitute's bench with his fist after River's 10th domestic game without a win and local media said he injured his hand in the process. He went for medical treatment, skipping the post-match press conference. The former Argentina captain ditched his favoured all-black outfit, this time wearing a white shirt and tie, in an apparent attempt to bring a change of fortune for his team. It seemed to work as River went ahead in less than two minutes, Gustavo Bou scoring with an angled shot from Augusto Fernandez's pass. But Juan Insaurralde equalised just before the hour after a series of rebounds in the River area and the hosts were insulted and jeered by angry fans as they left the field. River have nine points from 12 games in the Apertura, the first of two championships in the season, and dropped to last place in the 20-team league after the previous occupants Rosario Central beat Gimnasia-Jujuy 3-0. However, River are in no danger of relegation which is decided over three seasons, or six championships, Gervasio Nunez, Jose Vizcarra and Andres Franzoia shared the goals for Central, who had lost their previous three games. At the other end, leaders San Lorenzo were held 1-1 at home by Gimnasia-La Plata and are top only on goal difference from Tigre, who beat Independiente 1-0 on Tuesday. The teams have 26 points from 12 games with seven to play. Andres Silvera put San Lorenzo ahead in the 18th minute from a rebound after Gimnasia goalkeeper Gaston Sessa failed to hold Aureliano Torres's 30-metre free kick. Franco Neill caught the San Lorenzo defence napping when he equalised with a 25-metre drive in the 63rd minute. Boca Juniors moved within three points of the leading pair by winning 1-0 at Banfield with a 78th minute goal from substitute Pablo Mouche. Banfield, coached by 1986 World Cup winner Jorge Burruchanga, had a first half goal from Geronimo Barrales controversially disallowed for offside against a team mate
