<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)A Chittagong court indicted mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury on charges of tax evasion on Tuesday. Divisional special judge SM Solaiman framed charges against the accused in his absence and set Nov 5 to start recording witness statements. The mayor's counsel Iftekhar Saimul Chowdhury told bdnews24.com the court had approved the mayor's absence in court on grounds of illness. Ziaul Haque, assistant tax commissioner of Chittagong Tax Zone, filed the tax evasion case on July 7 last year. The Awami League leader was accused of dodging taxes on the back of false assets accounts submitted to the Anticorruption Commission. The initial investigation report in the case said Mohiuddin had concealed around Tk 1 crore in assets in his wealth statement, which could amount to some Tk 27.6 lakh in unpaid taxes. Mohiuddin, facing a total of 13 cases against him, was released on bail on Oct 8 following 19 months in detention, after securing bail in all the cases. bdnews24.
