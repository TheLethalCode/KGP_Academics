<TITLE> Iraq denounces US raid on Syria </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Tue Oct 28, (dnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's government denounced on Tuesday a US air strike on the Syrian border, but also called for a halt to what it said was insurgent activity in Syria. "The Iraqi government rejects US aircraft bombarding posts inside Syria," spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in the first official Iraqi criticism of the raid. Syria has said US helicopters struck a border village on Sunday night, killing eight people. Washington has refused to confirm the raid, which Iraq said targeted staging grounds used by militants. Iraq "reiterates its demand to halt all activities of organizations that are using Syria as a staging ground to arm and train terrorists that are targeting Iraq," Dabbagh said. The Iraqi government's criticism of the raid could be politically significant at a time when Baghdad and Washington are trying to rescue a stalled agreement to allow US forces to stay in Iraq for three years. The cabinet met on Tuesday to look into the pact. Iraqi Shia leaders say one of their concerns is that the accord does not prevent US forces from using Iraq as a base for attacks on its neighbors
