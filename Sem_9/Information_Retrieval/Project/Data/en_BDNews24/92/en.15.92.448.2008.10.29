 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) Ministers and secretaries should be free to devote more time to policy issues rather than be swamped with day-to-day affairs of the ministry, a cabinet committee decided Tuesday. "Not all files should be sent to advisers/ministers and secretaries. Other officials who are empowered to take decisions must exercise those powers," adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said after a meeting chaired by the chief adviser. The cabinet committee on public administration reforms and governance also asked all the ministries and departments to duly follow the Secretariat Instructions, Ali said. The Instructions define roles and responsibilities of civil servants of different rank. "The meeting discussed a report of the committee formed to see whether financial and administrative powers of ministries and departments were being exercised properly," the adviser told bdnews24.com. He said the committee had also been asked to recommend steps on the basis of its findings.

The committee recommended that a ministry level monitoring committee be headed by a secretary and a central one by an adviser or the cabinet secretary. b
