<TITLE> Highway decision deferred again </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)A cabinet committee has postponed a decision on the much-delayed Dhaka-Chittagong Highway expansion project, citing on-going court proceedings on the matter. "The award of the contracts was not approved due to legal complexities," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, who chaired a meeting of the cabinet purchase committee Wednesday, told reporters. The Tk 1750 crore project was meant to expand the 198-kilometre Daudkandi-Chittagong stretch into a four-lane highway. Bangladesh's nine top contractors who won the 10 separate components for Tk 1,751 crore quoted lower than the Tk 1,795 crore estimate by the Roads and Highways Department engineers. The contractors, bidding for a second time on same terms and conditions after the first was cancelled, submitted a total of 95 bids for the 10 contract components. If the largest road construction contract in this country's history is awarded without delay as recommended by the tender evaluation committee, the expanded highway would be ready to handle the traffic load by June 2011. "The communications ministry earlier ordered twice to cancel the proposal on the same tender. Following a writ against the ministry's decision, the High Court stayed the ministry's order," the adviser said Wednesday, explaining the latest decision by the cabinet committee. The disputed ministry decision to cancel the tender was attributed to the condition that the winning bidders give the precious performance security in seven days instead of 28. The first tender was floated in Sept 2006, bringing six foreign and 10 local companies into the fray. Of these, three foreign and seven local bidders were recommended by the technical committee to the ministry. In April 2007, nearly seven months after the bidding process began, the tender was cancelled "without assigning any reason". The project received a push from chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, who in his anniversary address to the nation on Jan 12 this year promised to fast-track the process. In March, a second tender was called, under the same terms and conditions as in 2006. The pre-bid meeting, before the close of the tender, brought together most of the pre-qualified contractors. When the tender evaluation committee sent its report to the ministry, one of the 10 bidders  National-Navana Construction Joint Venture  who submitted the highest quotes in all 10 components lodged a complaint about the 7-day performance security clause. The unsuccessful bidder alleged that the clause asking the successful bidders to deposit the performance security within 7 (seven) days after issuance of letter of acceptance is a violation of the Public Procurement Rules. Navana Construction took part in both tenders and had not raised any objection during the pre-bid meeting or as the bidding drew to a close. The ministry at this stage sought clarification from the Central Procurement and Technical Unit or CPTU, the author of the much-vaunted PPR. Said CPTU: "The procuring entity under clause 4 (12) of PPR can modify or add in 'tender data sheet' or 'particular condition of contract' if it is not inconsistent with the particular clause of PPR 2006 and 2008." On July 7, however, the ministry told the RHD chief engineers that it was cancelling the bidding process, citing "inconsistency" caused by the insertion of the 7-day deadline for performance security. The winning contractors went to the court, securing a High Court order that asked the ministry to explain the cancellation and stayed the decision. The Supreme Court, following an appeal, ordered a speedy disposal of the writ petition at the High Court. The ministry, meanwhile, sent a summary to the cabinet committee seeking to sway the advisers so that the cancellation decision was cleared. The July 28 meeting of the cabinet committee instead assigned two secretaries to see if the PPR was indeed flouted and if the ministry was right in ordering the cancellation. A cabinet committee meeting on Sept 16 again ignored the communication ministry plea to cancel the tender and decided to seek "opinion" from the law ministry. The law ministry did not see any violation of PPR in giving the 7-day deadline for performance security. The opinion followed an inter-ministerial meeting that too failed to take a clear decision, sending the issue back to the cabinet sub-committee on public procurement. bdnews24
