Leverkusen always looked the likelier team to break the deadlock at the Weserstadion and they managed it when Arturo Vidal pounced on a weak punch from the keeper.

Schalke 04 climbed to third with 17 points when they enjoyed a leisurely 3-0 win away to Karlsruhe. Bayern Munich, who are seventh on 15 points, visit Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday. Werder, runners-up to Bayern, last season, have now gone four league games without a win and lie in 10th place with 13 points from 10 games. They lacked spark in attack once again on Tuesday, with Brazilian playmaker Diego and Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro both missing through injury. They were at least defending comfortably enough, however, until a mistake from reserve keeper Christian Vander, playing in place of the injured Tim Wiese, tipped the match Leverkusen's way. Vander opted to punch clear a header in the 71st minute rather than catch it and the ball landed straight at the feet of the grateful Vidal.
