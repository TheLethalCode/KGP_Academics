<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 28 (bdnews24.com)BNP and its allies stepped up their demands over the state of emergency on Tuesday, pressing for it to be lifted before the announcement of the polls schedule on Nov 2. "The December 18th parliamentary elections are a must, so our demands of lifting the emergency must be met," said ailing BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain, addressing by phone a rally at the Diploma Engineers Institute in Kakrail. "Deferring the upazila elections, cancellation of all cases against party leaders and the release of detainees must take place to create a favourable environment for the election," said Delwar, reiterating the key demands of the four-party alliance. "If any stage-managed election is arranged without our demands being met, we won't participate and the people will not accept them," said the BNP leader. Referring to the 'paddle' and 'stick' that are part of political rival Awami League's boat symbol, Delwar said it was the politics of 'paddle-and-stick' that are responsible for the country's present miserable condition. Tuesday's rally was organised to mark the 2006 "Paltan Killings". The BNP secretary general alleged the attack on the alliance's Paltan rally on October 28, 2006 was carried out "to foil the elections scheduled for January 22, 2007." Presided over by Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general ATM Ajharul Islam, the rally was also addressed by its secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed. Also attending were Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Andalib Rahman, its secretary general Shamim Al Mamun and Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nizami. bdnews24.
