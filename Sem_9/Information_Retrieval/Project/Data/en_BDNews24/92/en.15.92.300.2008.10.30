 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon will meet with the Awami League and BNP leaders to discuss the country's future during his tour of Bangladesh, says the foreign adviser. Ban, who would be the fourth United Nations chief to visit Bangladesh, is scheduled come to Dhaka on Nov 1 from Katmandu on a two-day visit. "I have come to know that Ban Ki-moon will meet the political leaders. This is good news...I hope the talks will be significant," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters on Thursday. Earlier, he met with UNCTAD secretary-general Supachi Panitchpakdi at his office. "The country's future will also be discussed (during the meeting with the political leaders)," said the foreign adviser. The UN secretary-general will also see the chief adviser, the foreign adviser and other stakeholders to discuss the polls-related issues. "The UN secretary-general's visit to any country has some political relevance," the adviser said. He said Bangladesh's socio-economic development, UN peace-keeping and others issues would also come up for the discussion with Ban. The local UN officials, led by its resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien, a couple of weeks ago met with the AL and the BNP leaders in the lead-up to their upcoming meetings with Ban. On his meeting with UNCTAD chief, the adviser said secretary-general Panitchpakdi had recognised Bangladesh success in food production. "We want to share some of the successful methodologies of Bangladesh agriculture with some of the African countries," Supachi Panitchpakdi told reporters. He said United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN body for facilitating trade and development in the developing countries, would extend support to Bangladesh in managing migration. Panitchpakdi is to attend a discussion meeting, organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, on Bangladesh's future and economic development. bd
