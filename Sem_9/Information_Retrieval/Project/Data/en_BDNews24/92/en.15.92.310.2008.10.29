 KARACHI, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirty people were killed and about 40 injured when a strong earthquake struck southwest Pakistan on Wednesday, government and hospital officials said. The US Geological Survey said a 6.2 magnitude quake hit 70 km (45 miles) northeast of the city of Quetta before dawn. The Pakistan Meteorological Department put the magnitude at 6.1 and said the quake struck at 5.10 a.m. (2310 GMT). "Two areas are badly hit," said Dilawar Khan, chief of the Ziarat district 70 km (45 miles) northeast of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province. Some houses had collapsed and 11 people were killed in one area and 14 in another, he said. Five people had been killed in neighbouring Pishin district, to the north of Quetta, a provincial government minister said. Those officials and hospital officials in the provincial capital, Quetta, said about 40 people had been injured, most when mud walls collapsed or in the panic when people rushed from their homes. The Meteorological Department said two tremors had struck before dawn, the second one bigger than the first. Quetta resident Amjad Hussain said there had been panic in the city. "There were two tremors, the second one was serious and people rushed out of their houses," Hussain said. Quetta was largely destroyed and about 30,000 people were killed in a severe earthquake in 1935. The region's worst earthquake was in October 2005 when about 75,000 people were killed, most of them in mountainous northern Pakistan, in a 7.6 magnitude quake
