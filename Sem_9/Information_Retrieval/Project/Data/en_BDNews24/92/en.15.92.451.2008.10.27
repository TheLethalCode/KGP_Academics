 CHICAGO, Mon Oct 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police on Monday found the body of a young boy following a search for Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, who has been missing since Hudson's mother and brother were slain last week. Police did not immediately release the boy's identity but local media reports said a vehicle in which the body was found belonged to Hudson's slain brother, Jason, 29. Police had issued an alert on Friday saying the boy may have been abducted in that vehicle. The boy, Julian King, has been missing since Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and Jason Hudson were found shot dead in Donerson's South Side Chicago home. Police said the slayings appeared to be part of a domestic disturbance. Various media reports said police had taken William Balfour into custody as a suspect in the double homicide investigation. Balfour, 27, had a relationship with Hudson's sister Julia but is not the father of the missing boy. Balfour's mother said earlier her son and Julia were estranged and that he had nothing to do with the slayings. The Illinois Department of Corrections Web site lists Balfour as having been convicted of attempted murder, car theft and vehicular hijacking. He was released from prison in 2006. Hudson gained fame in 2005 as a contestant on the top-rated US television show "American Idol." She was one of 12 finalists in the third season but was voted off. Her booming voice and popularity kept her touring in live shows and she earned the role of Effie White in the 2006 film version of the stage musical "Dreamgirls." The role of soulful singer White, who is kicked out of an all-girl 1960s singing group, earned Hudson the Oscar for best supporting actress and made her an instant star in Hollywood. Hudson has since appeared in the movie version of "Sex and the City" and is currently in "The Secret Life of Bees.
