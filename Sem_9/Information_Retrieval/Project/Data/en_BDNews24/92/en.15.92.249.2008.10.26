 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party has started distribution of nomination forms for candidates wishing to contest the 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections, in line with newly drawn but still disputed constituencies, with the party chairman picking up three forms on Sunday. "We will endorse candidates for all 300 constituencies and the final nominations will be given to the candidates who are likely to win from the 'grand alliance' in consultation with the other parties," JP chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad said at the party office in Banani. Ershad said that the nomination forms were being distributed in line with the EC's re-demarcation of constituencies and he would contest for three constituencies including Dhaka-17, Rangpur-3 and Habiganj-3. "The court is set to give a verdict on the disputed re-demarcation of parliamentary constituencies on Sunday. If the verdict scraps the new constituencies, the nomination papers will be redistributed in accordance with previously drawn constituencies," said Ershad. The party remains in contact with the 'grand alliance', said the JP chairman, adding: "We will fix numbers of seats through discussions with the alliance." The main aim of the alliance was to win the election and there would not be any dispute over distribution of seats, Ershad said. The former president said that there was no doubt over the Dec 18 elections and he hoped that the two former prime ministers would also be able to contest the elections. Ershad backed elections under the state of emergency, saying: "Security of the voters must be ensured for fair polls." But, he added: "We hope some conditions will be relaxed during the elections." JP presidium member Rawshan Ershad also collected forms for Mymensingh-4 and Gaibandha-5. bdnews
