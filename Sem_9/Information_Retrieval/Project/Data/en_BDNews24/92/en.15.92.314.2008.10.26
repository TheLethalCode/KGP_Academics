 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)-- The caretaker government Sunday decided to establish Bangladesh embassies in Sudan, Sierra Leone and Greece and reinstate the embassy in Afghanistan. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. "More than 4,000 Bangladeshi workers are now working in Sudan, and there is a good demand for construction workers in that country," Syed Fahim Munaim, the chief adviser's press secretary told reporters following the meeting. "There is also a huge potential for the export of human resources to Sierra Leone. A good number of our armed forces are also working in UN peace mission to the two countries," he said. The ministry of foreign affairs decided to establish embassies in the two countries to provide greater assistance to Bangladeshi army personnel working in the African nations, said Fahim. The press secretary said diplomatic relations with Afghanistan have existed for many years, although the Bangladesh embassy there was closed in 1998 due to ongoing conflict in the country. Fahim said the council of advisers also approved the inclusion of Afghanistan into the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement. The new embassies in Sudan, Sierra Leon and Afghanistan will initially operate under a first secretary. "More than 2000 Bangladeshis live in Athens, although at present they are provided necessary services through the Bangladesh embassy in Rome," said Fahim. The press secretary said a decision had also been made to make the Bangladesh Code, which contains all laws, ordinances and presidential orders, available on CD and accessible on the internet. The meeting also gave the nod to an agreement with Turkey, which would provide a $330,870 military grant, in addition to increased military cooperation and training. bdnews
