<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Tue Oct 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan executed two convicted murderers on Tuesday, including a man who strangled to death two 7-year-old girls, the Justice Ministry said in a statement. Michitoshi Kuma, 70, was convicted of kidnapping the two girls on their way to school and then murdering them. Masahiro Takashio, 55, was convicted of stabbing two women to death, along with robbery charges, the statement said. "These were crimes that took precious lives and were deeply deplorable for the victims and their families," Justice Minister Eisuke Mori told reporters. "I ordered the executions to be implemented after careful consideration." The executions are the first under Mori, who took the post when Taro Aso became prime minister last month. His predecessor ordered the execution of three death row inmates, while the justice minister before that, Kunio Hatoyama, ordered the execution of a record 13 convicted criminals while in office. Public opinion polls have shown that most Japanese approve of the death penalty, which is carried out by hanging. But human rights groups criticise the system, in which convicts and their relatives are not informed in advance that an execution is to be carried out
