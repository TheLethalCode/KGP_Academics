 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The country's top graft-buster on Sunday rubbished allegations of money laundering levelled against him but acknowledged that "financial losses" took place while he was chairman of Trust Bank. "I want to categorically say that the allegation brought against me is not true," Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury. "However," he said, "One such incident occurred. Some financial losses took place due to some reasons. But I cannot tell the amount." "(But) Action has been taken against those involved with it and two cases involving that incident are on trial," he said at a press conference at the ACC headquarters in the city. "If you want to know further about the incident you will have to contact Trust Bank." Going on the offensive, he said, "Those who have grievances against the Anticorruption Commission and me are bringing such accusations. People have right to free speech." Asked who will take the responsibility of the financial losses inflicted on Trust Bank, the former chairman of the bank said Trust Bank had to shoulder the responsibility of the loss. "Others and I took decision at the time on advice of Bangladesh Bank." Asked whether the ACC would investigate the matter, he said, "If there is a case the commission will definitely investigate as per rules." The former energy adviser of the BNP-led coalition government, Mahmudur Rahman, on Saturday tried to file a case against former army chief accusing him of money laundering. However, police did not accept the case on grounds of legal complexity. Asked whether he would sue Rahman, a corporate executive-turned-government functionary, for libel, the ACC chairman said, "Anybody can bring allegation. It is my responsibility to refute it. There will be a legal battle against it." Rahman, a staunch critic of the anticorruption drive of the caretaker government, on Saturday afternoon first went to Ramna police and then to Motijheel police to file the case. He alleged that as the chairman of Trust Bank Chowdhury laundered about Tk 20 crore in bank money abroad by citing losses in the foreign exchange transaction. Describing himself as a "conscientious citizen", Rahman, a former Board of Investment chief, arrived at Ramna Police Station to press the charges. Ramna police officer in charge (OC) Doulat Akbar sent him to Motijheel, saying the complaints fell under their geographical jurisdiction. The Motijheel OC, Fazlur Rahman, told him that money laundering cases needed clearance from the central bank and that "the place of occurrence" was actually Cantonment Police Station. "While he was chairman of Trust Bank, Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury held the board meeting in the Cantonment area," the OC said. A bdnews24.com correspondent witnessed Rahman's exchange with the Motijheel OC, before the former energy adviser left the station around 6.30pm. "Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury siphoned Tk 20 crore off to another country, showing losses in foreign exchange transactions while he was chairman of Trust Bank," Rahman told reporters as he awaited a response at Ramna Police Station. Rahman, now chairman of Amar Desh Publications which owns daily newspaper Amar Desh, alleged that Trust Bank went into the red after Chowdhury became its ex-officio chairman in 2002. He cited the audit report for 2002 to claim the bank lost nearly Tk 20.30 crore the year Chowdhury took over as chairman. Rahman, who worked for Beximco Group immediately before his BoI appointment, alleged the then army chief misappropriated the money in collusion with other bank executives. He also alleged that the police did not take case against the ACC chief on instructions from 'higher authorities'. Chowdhury, on his part, denied having a hand and said, "No, I never do this." On allegations that installations were erected at New DOHS violating approved design and those were made legal later by paying a small fine, the ACC chief said, "It is true that rules have not been followed. After returning to the Army ( on serving the UN peacekeeping mission) I took a decision on the issue through a committee." He also responded to suggestions that if these were civil installations, they would have been demolished and that there were two sets of law in the country. "There may be two sets of laws in one country. There are some rules. Work is done according to those rules. Those who are charged with looking into what happened in case of others would know it better." bdnews24.
