 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League has asked that any prospective election candidate, convicted or facing trial but with appeals pending in the higher court, be allowed to contest in the upcoming parliamentary elections. "The government must make it clear that our leader (Sheikh Hasina) has no bar to participating in the elections," acting president Zillur Rahman Rahman said at a rally organised by Jubo League, AL's youth front. "I'm sure the next elected government will be led by Sheikh Hasina, if a free and fair election is held," Zillur Rahman said. Zillur also urged the Election Commission to take measures barring war criminals and anti-liberation forces from election, and demanded lifting of the state of emergency before the Dec 18 parliamentary elections. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said a non-elected government has led the country to the brink of destruction. Urged AL supporters to take preparation for the elections, he said: "AL will form the next government with the people's mandate". The rally at AL headquarters in the city was organised in protest of the "Paltan killings" that occurred during clashes between activists of the AL-led 14-party alliance and BNP-led four-party alliance on Oct 28, 2006. The two rival alliances have traded blame for deaths on both sides, as violence erupted during counter rallies at the same location on that day. bdnews2
