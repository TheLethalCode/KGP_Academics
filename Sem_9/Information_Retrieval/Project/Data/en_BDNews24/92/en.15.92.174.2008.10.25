 Kabul, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unknown gunmen shot dead two foreigners and an Afghan in the heart of the capital Kabul on Saturday, police officials said. Officials said they did not know the nationality of the victims, nor the motive behind the attack, which comes amid rising violence in Afghanistan and less than a week after a woman British aid worker was killed in another part of Kabul. "Two foreigners and one local have been killed and another two locals wounded," said a senior police officer at the scene. Two other senior police officials confirmed the toll in the attack outside an office of the courier company DHL in the upmarket Sher Pur area of Kabul where many foreigners live. One of the police officials said the victims worked for DHL. A spokesman for DHL in Germany said he was unable to confirm any details of the attack at this stage. Police at the scene covered the silver sports utility vehicle with plastic sheeting. There was blood on the ground and two bullet holes in the window of the DHL office. The Iranian embassy lies opposite the site of the attack. The latest attack, the killing of the British aid worker and a number of high profile kidnappings in the Afghan capital in the last week, come after President Hamid Karzai appointed a new interior minister, responsible for policing, in an effort to clean up widespread corruption at the ministry
