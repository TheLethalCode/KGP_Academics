Earlier, New Zealand captain Vettori declared the innings at drinks in the third session after Jesse Ryder top-scored 91 followed by Brendon McCullum on 66. The first three days' play were washed out from incessant rain and the toss was delayed for an hour on the fourth day morning due to a still soggy outfield. However, conditions were sunny and forecast to improve further after midday. The remaining days of the Test will start early and have 30-minute extensions to the opening session to make up some of the time lost. New Zealand have made one change from the squad that beat Bangladesh by three wickets in Chittagong, with Grant Elliot replacing injured all-rounder Jacob Oram. Bangladesh also have one change from the first Test squad, with a new cap, pace bowler Mahbubul Alam, replacing all-rounder Naeem Islam. Bangladesh - Mohammad Ashraful (capt), Mashrafe Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Zunaed Siddique, Rajin Saleh, Mehrab Hossain, Mahbubul Alam, Mushfiqur Rahim, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain. New Zealand - Daniel Vettori (capt), Daniel Flynn, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Grant Elliot, Jeetan Patel, Aaron Redmond, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor. b
