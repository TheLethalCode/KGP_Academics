<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)BRAC will withdraw all of its 150 Bangladeshi staff from Afghanistan in the next five years, said an executive director of the NGO on Sunday, following the recent abduction of two of its managers. Akhter Ali and Mohammad Shahjahan Ali, area managers for BRAC Afghanistan, were kidnapped Thursday from the Afghan province of Ghazni, where they both had been working for the last three years. It was the third such incident involving BRAC staff in Afghanistan in just over a year. Abdul Alim, a BRAC official, was killed on Sept 12 last year by unidentified gunmen. Just three days later, another BRAC executive, Nurul Islam, was abducted, being released after 83 days. "There were 392 Bangladeshi BRAC staff when the [abduction of Nur Islam] took place. We then reduced the number of Bangladeshi staff to 150," Aminul Alam, BRAC's executive director (overseas programmes), told bdnews24.com after a meeting with the foreign adviser on Sunday. "We will withdraw all of the 150 Bangladeshi workers from Afghanistan within the next five years," Alam had told reporters earlier. "BRAC wants to leave Afghanistan making sure that its Afghan employees can replace Bangladeshis to run its programmes. We want to build their capacity to execute the programmes," he said. Alam said one executive would remain to head BRAC Afghanistan after the withdrawal of all other Bangladeshis. The BRAC official said staff from Bangladesh were normally given two-year postings to Afghanistan, but most wanted to remain over the official timeframe. "Because of the friendly attitude of Afghan people, our Bangladeshi staff want to overstay there." Alam and BRAC director for public affairs Anwarul Huq met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Sunday to request measures for the rescue of the two kidnapped managers. The world's largest NGO by staff, BRAC's Afghanistan mission was the first of its international initiatives, operating for the last three years in the fields of microcredit, health, education and women's empowerment. Observers say militant Islamist groups in the country are increasingly targeting NGO workers for their activities in education and women's empowerment. There have been 146 security incidents involving NGO workers in Afghanistan up to October this year, compared to 135 for the whole of 2007, according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office which monitors NGO security. bdn
