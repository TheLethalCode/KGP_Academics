 MADRID, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo has said he made the right decision to stay with Manchester United and expects to continue with them beyond this season. The Portugal winger was courted by Spanish champions Real Madrid during the close season after he let slip he would like to play for them in the future, having won a Premier League and Champions League double with United. After a meeting with United manager Alex Ferguson at the beginning of August, the 23-year-old finally ended the speculation by committing himself to staying in England for this season. "Now I understand I have made the best decision. I am with Manchester in body and soul," Ronaldo told sports daily Marca on Sunday. "I am a Manchester player. I want to respect the club, my colleagues and the fans and don't want to talk about other teams at present. Only God knows the future. I think I will continue here next season." Ronaldo is in the running for the 2008 Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year after scoring 42 goals in United's double winning season last year. He went on to reveal that he studies every game he plays in minute detail. "Every time Manchester play, the club's television channel shows the game at midnight. I like to watch it and analyse everything I have done," he said. "I believe this is a way to improve and smooth out errors. I want to be a better footballer and am completely dedicated to this.
