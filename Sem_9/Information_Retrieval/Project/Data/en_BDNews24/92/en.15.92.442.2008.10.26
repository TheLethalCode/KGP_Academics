<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)--Chairman of the newly formed Local Government Commission Faizur Razzak has stressed the commission's role in strengthening local government bodies, not "controlling them". "The commission will discharge its responsibilities as a regulatory body," Razzak told reporters Sunday following a courtesy call on local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal stressed the new commission was not an opponent of any party. "We want to strengthen the local government bodies. We hope leadership will rise from the grassroots level to develop local government on the basis of equality, without any partisan loyalty," said the adviser. "If local government bodies are to be considered important pillars of democracy, we must have the support not just of this government, but of all future governments," the LGC chairman said. "In this regard we will also need the backing of the media," he added. Razzak said a decision was yet to be made on when the new body would start functioning, although a time frame would soon be fixed in consultation with the government. "Those who formulated the Local Government Commission Act did so with the intention of strengthening local government bodies," said Razzak. "Thorough it, local government will become stronger and more dynamic," he said. The LGC head said two previous administrations had pledged to form such a commission, although it had failed to materialise. Commission members Tofail Ahmed and Hedayetul Islam Chowdhury, and rural development and cooperatives secretary ATM Fazlul Karim were also present. bdnews24
