 SEATTLE, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Sweden and Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg has signed for the Seattle Sounders, the MLS expansion team said on Tuesday. Ljungberg has been without a club since his contract with Premier League West Ham United was cancelled in August, having retired from international football in June. He joins the MLS's newest team, which kicks off in March next year, under the same 'designated player' ruling that allowed LA Galaxy to sign David Beckham from Real Madrid. "We looked far and wide for a designated player who would represent the spirit of our team," said Sounders owner Joe Roth. "In Freddie Ljungberg, we found it. A proven international star at Arsenal and captain of the Swedish national Team, Freddie is the exciting, creative force we need and we are sure the Seattle fans are in for a great treat," he added. Ljungberg, who played 75 times for his country, said he had receivers offers from European clubs but had his heart set on a move to Seattle. "Fortunately, I had many opportunities and offers from around Europe and the rest of the world during the last few months, including Seattle to play in MLS," said Ljungberg. "After thoughtful consideration, I decided this opportunity with Seattle was the right one for me. Seattle is a great city. I know this part of the world quite well. "The club itself has such great ambition and the fans over here are very passionate about their team," he added. The team did not give details of the contract beyond saying the Swede had signed a 'multi-year deal' but local media reports said Ljungberg has a two-year contract
