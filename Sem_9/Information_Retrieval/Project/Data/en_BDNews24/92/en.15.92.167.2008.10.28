<TITLE> Iraq cabinet to send proposed deal changes to US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Tue Oct 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's cabinet will send proposed amendments to a long-awaited security pact with the United States to US negotiators, the Iraqi government spokesman said on Tuesday. Ali al-Dabbagh said that the proposed changes, agreed upon by cabinet members on Tuesday, addressed both 'wording' and 'content. The security pact will govern the US troop presence after a United Nations mandate expires at the end of the year. The accord, which would provide a legal basis for the US presence in Iraq once the current UN mandate expires on December 31, appeared to have reached a final version last week after months of intense bilateral negotiations. Butthe ongoing cabinet debate underscores the deep divisions among Iraqi politicians about the foreign troops presence, five years on from the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. Washington has made major concessions in the talks, agreeing to withdraw troops by the end of 2011 and allowing Iraqi courts to try American troops for serious crimes committed off duty. It has watched the renewed debate in Baghdad with exasperation. Yet even after the cabinet has approved any of the proposed amendments, the agreement is likely to face significant opposition in parliament. Lawmakers loyal to anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr pledge to vote against the pact, while support will also be difficult for other Shia parties that have strong ties with Iran, which strongly opposes the deal
