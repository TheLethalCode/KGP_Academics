 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  Major General Md Shafiqul Islam, military secretary of the Bangladesh Army and Abdullah A Ferdous, senior consultant of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission have been nominated for the 'ID People Award-2008'' of the ID World International Congress. The congress website says both have been nominated for their contribution to the field of biometric ID information. Abdulla Ferdous is a regular speaker at conferences on the topic of registered traveller programmes, where he emphasises the viewpoint of developing countries. With almost all immigration coming from the developing world, it is important to find ways to smooth the pathway through the visa application and immigration process for travellers from these countries, says the website. Major General Shafiqul Islam has co-managed the Bangladesh Voter Registration Project with the Bangladesh Election Commission. The project was launched to prepare biometric-based voter lists and issue national ID cards. The army stepped in to assist in enrolling citizens into the database with all the relevant biometric and biographical data, completing the mammoth task of registering more than 80 million voters with their photographs and fingerprints in just 11 months. The seventh ID World International Congress will take place in Milan on Nov 18 to 20, where the winners of the awards will be announced. This year, the ID People Awards has named 25 high-flyers across five categories. The congress invites votes from the people for final selection of the award. Voting is online and open to all until Oct 29, 2008. Anyone can vote at the http://www.idworldonline.com/index.php?id=idpa08 website. bdn
