 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission's scrutiny committee has taken into cognizance a raft of objections against registering Jamaat-e-Islami as a party, and will not move ahead with the registration process until a hearing has been held. "A file has been sent to the commission recommending the hearing Jamaat and the organisations that have raised objections," EC joint secretary and chief of the scrutiny committee Nurul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com. Those who have raised objections will be heard separately. "The timeline for the hearing will be given after the EC's decision is available," he said, adding that it would likely be completed in a few days. Replying to a question, Khan said Jamaat would not be registered until the hearing was concluded. Seven separate statements of objection have been submitted to the Election Commission against registration of Jamaat, by the Sector Commanders Forum and the War Crimes Facts Finding Committee among others. In a letter submitted to the chief election commissioner Monday, SCF gave a six point statement to the chief election commissioner, including the point that the Bangladesh Constitution clearly mentions that there can be no political party with the word Islam as a part of its name. The SCF statement said Jamaat was deceiving the people by using the 'Islami' as a part of its name. WCFFC, formed to probe atrocities during the 1971 liberation war, also submitted an objection to the EC, saying Jamaat had been pursuing politics over a long period illegally and unconstitutionally as a branch of a foreign party and organisation, with party leaders involved in inhuman actions, war crimes and genocide during the liberation war through loyalty to Pakistan. Another five objections against Jamaat's registration were submitted with the EC on Monday by JSD-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League, Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, Sammilito Sanskritik Jote and Bangabandhu Sanskritik Jote and a group of private individuals. Jamaat, an ally of BNP, applied for registration on Oct 20. The EC published a notice seeking objections against BNP's registration on Tuesday. Eleven parties, including Awami League, BNP and Jatiya Party, have received the all-clear for registration by the EC, barring objections. The EC's registration work is scheduled to be completed by Oct 30. The scrutiny committee has said it is collecting information from the field level for most of the 107 parties that have applied for registration. The EC also held a meeting Tuesday with top officials of the home, foreign affairs and information ministries on visas for foreign election observers Election officials say two-month visas and 15-day visas will be issued for long term and short term observers respectively. bdnews
