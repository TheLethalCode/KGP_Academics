 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has deferred the final hearing on appeals by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to quash the Niko and barge-mounted power plant corruption cases till Nov 23. The HC bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Roisuddin made the order on Wednesday following a request Hasina's lawyer, barrister Shafik Ahmed, for more time. The High Court had earlier stayed proceedings of the cases, on July 7, for two months, on Hasina's petitions. The Appellate Division later upheld the HC stay orders on Aug 13, freezing the proceedings of the two cases in trial court. The ACC filed the Niko corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 9 last year against seven individuals including Sheikh Hasina. According to the case details, the accused caused losses of Tk 13,630 crore to the state by awarding the Chhatak, Kamta and Feni gas fields to Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd without tender. The ACC later pressed charges against nine, including the former prime minister. In September last year, the ACC filed a case against seven people, including Hasina, accusing them of illegally awarding a contract to set up three barge mounted power plants in the private sector. It is alleged the seven received Tk 3 crore in bribes in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in exchange for awarding the contract. Hasina was released on parole on June 11, to seek medical treatment abroad. bdnew
