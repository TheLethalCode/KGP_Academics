 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Much of the country including the capital experienced overcast skies, cold winds and rain throughout Saturday, forecast to continue. "Temperatures may fall further with increased rainfall," on-duty meteorologist at the weather office Arjumand Habib said. A low over the mid-west and northwest Bay of Bengal turned into a depression in the early hours. A special bulletin of the met office, issued in the evening, said the depression moved slightly north-northeastwards towards the West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts and was likely to intensify further. Under the impact of the depression much of Khulna and Barisal and some areas of Dhaka and Rajshahi are likely to see more heavy showers. Chittagong and Sylhet divisions might also experience medium rainfall. The met office said gusty weather may continue over the coastal areas of Bangladesh, with the sea remaining moderate to rough. It has asked Cox's Bazar, Mongla and Chittagong seaports to keep hoisted local cautionary signal number 3, offshore river ports signal number 2 and signal number 1 for the river ports. All fishing boats and trawlers in the Bay of Bengal should remain near the coast and move cautiously until advised otherwise. bdnew
