<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League is willing to go to national elections under the newly drawn parliamentary constituencies, said a senior party figure on Wednesday. "We will contest the polls under the re-demarcated electoral boundaries due to constitutional obligations," AL's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters at his NAM flat residence. He pressed for quick settlement of electoral boundaries and deferment of upazila polls. "Without settlement of electoral boundaries and logical deferment of upazila elections, doubts over the holding of parliamentary polls will remain," said Asahraf. When asked how many seats the party would share with its allies, Ashraful said nominations would be given to the most prospective aspirants. "The aspirants who have acceptance of the people and are financially in the clear will get priority for nomination, as AL has been working to make qualitative changes in politics," he said. According to the party's revised constitution, in line with the new Representation of the People's Ordinance, election candidates will be selected from the grassroots. "As we have already drafted the method, the process will begin with the approval of working committee," said Ashraful. He added that party chief Sheikh Hasina, now abroad, will be welcomed home drawing a "huge number of supporters". bdnews2
