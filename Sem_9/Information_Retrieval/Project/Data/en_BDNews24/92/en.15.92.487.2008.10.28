 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) - The chief election commissioner has stressed again that anyone convicted under Emergency Power Rules, up to the day of scrutiny of nomination papers, will be considered unfit for election. "We want to see the candidates for national elections as 'role models'. We don't want to see convicts, loan defaulters, bill defaulters elected," ATM Shamsul Huda said on Tuesday. "The commission has formulated electoral laws in this regard," he added, while inaugurating the second phase of a training programme on electoral law for deputy commissioners. The CEC cited the rule on EPR convicts once more, in the face of a recent challenge on the issue. According to the EPR, any person convicted for any term under the rules is ineligible to participate in any local body or national election, even if an appeal is pending with the High Court. Former communications minister Nazmul Huda filed a petition with the High Court on Sunday, arguing that the EC's move to bar those with an appeal pending in the upper court runs contrary to the Constitution. The High Court, however, returned the petition on Monday, citing time constraints, as any ruling requiring a constitutional explanation would require the court to appoint amicus curi . Said the CEC on Tuesday: "The main aim of the incumbent commission is to hold a free and fair election and establish an honest and qualified leadership for the next parliament." He asked the deputy commissioners to work neutrally during the election in their role as returning officers. Huda asked the officials to be particularly carefully in scrutinising nomination papers. The commission has sent a list of winning and defeated candidates in the past three national elections to Bangladesh Bank. The central bank will return info to the returning officers on whether there are any defaulters among them, the CEC said. He also asked the DCs to properly examine the information given by candidates themselves by affidavits. "Many unwelcome candidates ran in the August city and municipality polls as the affidavits were not properly scrutinised," he said. If ballot papers are found outside polling centre during the election, those responsible will face a maximum 10 years imprisonment, the chief election commissioner also warned. "Many ballot papers have been found outside polling centres in the past, in attempts to foil fair elections. New electoral laws provide punitive measures including fines and imprisonment for such actions," said Huda. The CEC hoped to hold a free and fair election on Dec 18. "We want to stage an election like the 1970 election; there was no question about the polls at that time." "All concerned officers must work neutrally to that end," he said. Election commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammad Sohul Hussain were also present at the training programme. The two-phase training has brought together 32 DCs in the second batch, while the first phase on Oct 25 saw another 32. bdnews
