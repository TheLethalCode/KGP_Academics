 TOKYO/LONDON,Wed Oct 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday, a measure Japan, the European Central Bank and Britain are forecast to follow by the end of next week to bolster economies facing recession. While dispensing with a repeat of the coordinated rate cuts unleashed earlier this month, authorities fear the global financial crisis will usher in a recession lasting for years and are looking to individual rate reductions to soften the blow. Hungary became the latest country to seek finance from global lenders, agreeing a rescue package worth $25.1 billion to shore up its currency and markets. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut US rates by at least half a point on Wednesday to 1 percent, the lowest level since June 2004. Norway's central bank was also seen reducing rates by 50 basis points to 4.75 percent on Wednesday. "The picture is now so depressing that Norges Bank has to do whatever it can to decrease rates ... as quickly as possible," said Inge Furre, economist at Sparebanken Moere. The Bank of Japan will consider cutting rates at a policy meeting on Friday but will watch market conditions before deciding, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Bets on a quarter-point cut to 0.25 percent snapped the recent surge in the yen, which has hurt exporters and helped hammer Japanese shares. A cut by the world's second biggest economy would "send a message to the world that Japan is cooperating with other nations in tackling the financial crisis," said Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to follow suit at their regular meetings next week. An executive board member of the European Central Bank said growth in the euro zone would be lower than expected. "Confidence will not return until we stop to think about the measures which have been taken and we can see financial institutions resuming their normal activity," Jose Manuel Gonzalez Paramo said in a newspaper interview. MARKETS RALLY Stock markets firmed on the expected interest cuts and rescue packages. Japan's Nikkei ended up 7.7 percent after the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 indexes recorded their second-biggest points gains ever on Tuesday. European shares climbed 4.6 percent. But analysts said the market recovery would be short-lived. "Given the severe recession into which the global economy is slipping, it is likely that we have not seen the bottom of the stock market yet, and this week's recovery presents a good opportunity to sell," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist with CFC Seymour in Hong Kong. Governments have pledged about $4 trillion to support banks and restart money markets to try to stem the crisis set off by the bursting of the bubble in the U.S. housing market. But as credit lines have dried up, a growing number of governments have had to look for help from global lenders. HUNGARY BAILOUT The IMF, European Union and World Bank agreed to a $25.1 billion economic rescue package for Hungary. "The Hungarian authorities have developed a comprehensive policy package that will bolster the economy's near-term stability and improve its long-term growth potential," IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in a statement. The agreement comes after Iceland, where the financial system has all but collapsed, raised interest rates by 6 percentage points to 18 percent to try to defend its currency. Iceland's central bank said the dramatic rate rise was part of a deal struck with the IMF for a $2 billion loan. For its part, South Korea said on Wednesday that it had no plans to accept financial support from the IMF because it had enough foreign exchange reserves. Even with such government efforts, the crisis could reduce the hedge fund industry to as little as a third of its current size, billionaire investor George Soros said on Tuesday. "The hedge fund industry is going to move through a shakeout," said Soros. Economic data and more plans for job cuts pointed to pain even if regulators manage to get to grips with the worst financial crisis in 80 years. In Japan, industrial output rose 1.2 percent in September but the government predicted a significant fall in core manufacturing output in October and November. Japan's Sony Corp, which last week cut its annual operating profit forecast by 57 percent, said quarterly profits at the electronics and entertainment group slumped 90 percent. Time Warner's Time Inc, the world's largest magazine company, said it plans a restructuring that could lead to as much as 6 percent of its workforce, to cope with the crisis
