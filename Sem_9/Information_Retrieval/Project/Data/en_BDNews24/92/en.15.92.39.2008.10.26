 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) An adivashi rights group has demanded that all political parties clarify their stance on voting rights of indigenous communities . "Parties must make their position clear in their election manifestos," said Mesbah Kamal, secretary general of 'Movement for Tribal Rights in Bangladesh'. "They should raise their voices clearly regarding marginalised ethnic groups in order to build an equality-based society in the light of liberation war," said Kamal in a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Saturday. "Indigenous communities have faced much injustice and wrongdoing in the bygone years." "Their forests have been destroyed in the name of 'development projects', national parks, farming and army camps, displacing adivashi people," said the tribal rights activist. He unveiled a 15-point demand for protection of indigenous people's rights for parties to include in their election manifestos. The demand charter includes acknowledgement of constitutional rights for indigenous people, primary education in their mother tongue, enforcement of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord, a separate voter roll, making the CHT land commission effective, formation of a separate land commission for indigenous people living in the plains land, recognition of their traditional land rights and restoration of land and reservation of seats at all levels of government from local to national. HKS Arefin, president of the rights organisation and Anil Marandi, president of National Adivashi Parisad, were present among others. bdnew
