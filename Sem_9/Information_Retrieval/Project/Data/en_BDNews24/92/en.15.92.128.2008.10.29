<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Wed Oct 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The former governor of Indonesia's central bank was sentenced on Wednesday to five years in jail for corruption, becoming one of the most senior officials to fall foul of the country's clampdown on graft. Burhanuddin Abdullah, 60, whose term as Bank Indonesia governor ended in May 2008, spent most of his career at the central bank and has always denied any wrongdoing. He told the court he would appeal. The sentencing came as Indonesia's top graft-buster announced four more suspects in the central bank corruption case, including a relative by marriage of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The Bank Indonesia case is one of several big corruption cases to take place under President Yudhoyono, who was elected in 2004 on promises to tackle graft which is often seen as a deterrent to investment in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Indonesia regularly ranks as one of the most corrupt countries in the world but appears to be making some progress in tackling the problem. Several high-ranking officials have been imprisoned for graft in the past couple of years. However, the Bank Indonesia case is politically sensitive and could prove embarrassing for President Yudhoyono. The Corruption Eradication Agency, known as the KPK, on Wednesday named Aulia Pohan, a former central bank official whose daughter is married to one of the president's sons, as a suspect in the investigation. "To be frank I am saddened, and I must calm down the family of my in-laws, Aulia Pohan, my daughter-in-law, my son, to face all this," said Yudhoyono. "On the other hand, as the head of state, head of government, I repeatedly said that supremacy of law must be applied. If Aulia Pohan, together with others, were considered to have committed wrong, of course the law must be enforced and I must not intervene," he told reporters at the presidential palace. Pohan was not immediately reachable for comment. MANY FLAWS The Bank Indonesia graft case centred on a foundation which was linked to the bank and which allegedly made payments of about $10 million to members of parliament and to cover the cost of legal assistance for former senior central bank officials. Anwar Nasution, an Indonesian economist, once famously referred to Bank Indonesia as a "den of thieves", although he later joined the central bank, which underwent various reforms following the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. The financial crisis exposed many of the flaws in Indonesia's legal and regulatory system -- which had gone unchecked under the late President Suharto -- and led to widespread criticism of the central bank. Indonesia's financial system collapsed, as many banks had ignored the most basic lending rules and firms borrowed heavily in foreign currencies, only to see the value of those debts soar when the rupiah currency plunged. The central bank has since undergone a series of reforms following various probes in the past decade, particularly over its controversial role in lending billions of dollars in emergency funds to banks at the height of the 1997-98 crisis. Abdullah's predecessor, Sjahril Sabirin, was sentenced to three years in jail over a banking scandal by a lower Jakarta court in 2002. A higher court overturned the conviction. The scandal erupted in 1999 over a 546 billion rupiah (then $70 million) fee PT Bank Bali paid to a firm which had links to the Golkar party to recover interbank claims extended during the economic crisis
