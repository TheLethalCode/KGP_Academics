 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Sunday appealed to the abductors to release two BRAC staff kidnapped last week in Afghanistan's Ghazni province. He had meeting with Afghan ambassador in Dhaka Ahmed Karim Nawabi and sent a letter to the Afghan foreign minister seeking his government's effort to secure freedom of the two managers of BRAC, the world's largest non-governmental development organisation by number of staff. The meeting came after BRAC's executive director (overseas programmes) Aminul Alam and director for public affairs M Anwarul Huq met Iftekhar earlier in the day to request measures for the rescue of the two kidnapped managers. Akhter Ali and Mohammad Shahjahan Ali, area managers for BRAC Afghanistan, were kidnapped on Thursday from Ghazni City, where they both had been working for the last three years. It was the third such incident involving BRAC staff in Afghanistan in just over a year. Alam and Huq of BRAC were also present at the meeting. "I appeal through the media to those who abducted them to release them for they are two innocent people who were in Afghanistan to serve their Afghan brethren, nothing more", Iftekhar told reporters after holding an urgent meeting with Nawabi at the foreign ministry. "The Bangladesh government and the foreign ministry will make every possible endeavor to obtain the release of these two brave and innocent persons, just as we did in case of Noor Islam earlier", he said. Abdul Alim, a BRAC official, was killed on Sept 12 last year by unidentified gunmen. Just three days later, another BRAC executive, Nurul Islam, was abducted, before he was released after 83 days in captivity. The adviser said BRAC brought benefit through microcredit to 200,000 Afghans, provided health service to 500,000 Afghan women and built 4,000 schools there. "I hope that the abductors will allow them to get back to their family," the adviser said. The Afghan ambassador told reporters, "We will try our best (to secure their release)". Alam, BRAC's executive director (overseas programmes), told bdnews24.com that they were yet to reach the abductors. BRAC WITHDRAWAL Earlier in the day, Alam said they will withdraw all of its 150 Bangladeshi staff from Afghanistan in the next five years. "There were 392 Bangladeshi BRAC staff when the [abduction of Nur Islam] took place. We then reduced the number of Bangladeshi staff to 150," he told bdnews24.com after a meeting with the foreign adviser on Sunday. "We will withdraw all of the 150 Bangladeshi workers from Afghanistan within the next five years," Alam had told reporters earlier. "Brac wants to leave Afghanistan making sure that its Afghan employees can replace Bangladeshis to run its programmes. We want to build their capacity to execute the programmes," he said. Alam said one executive would remain to head BRAC Afghanistan after the withdrawal of all other Bangladeshis. The BRAC official said staff from Bangladesh were normally given two-year postings to Afghanistan, but most wanted to remain over the official timeframe. "Because of the friendly attitude of Afghan people, our Bangladeshi staff want to overstay there." BRAC's Afghanistan mission was the first of its international initiatives, operating for the last three years in the fields of microcredit, health, education and women's empowerment. Ghazni is one of 34 provinces of Afghanistan, with its capital in Ghazni City. The province lies in the eastern part of the country, south-west of Kabul. BRAC Afghanistan has been working in Ghazni for the last three years. Telephone networks in Ghazni have been inoperative for the last four days, making communication extremely difficult. Observers say militant Islamist groups in the country are increasingly targeting NGO workers for their activities in education and women's empowerment. There have been 146 security incidents involving NGO workers in Afghanistan up to October this year, compared to 135 for the whole of 2007, according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office which monitors NGO security. bdnews
