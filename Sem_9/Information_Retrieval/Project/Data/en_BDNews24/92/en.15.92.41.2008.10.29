 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - The Supreme Court has upheld a stay order on the proceedings of the Barapukuria coalmine graft case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia. A five-member Appellate Division bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin made the order on Wednesday repealing the appeal by the Anticorruption Commission against the previous High Court stay order. After the verdict Khaleda's lawyer, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan, told reporters that the ruling meant a halt on the proceedings of the case in the trial court. The High Court put a freeze on the case proceedings on Oct 16 for three months. The ACC pressed charges against 16 people in the case on Oct 5. The commission filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the then government leaders of incurring losses of Tk 158.71 core to the state due to an agreement with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC). bdnew
