 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Fit-again middle-order batsman Roqibul Hassan returned to the national fold Tuesday when selectors announced the squad for three one-day internationals and one Twenty20 match against hosts South Africa in November. Roqibul was out of action for two months after injuring his right thumb during the three-ODI opener against Australia in Darwin on Aug 30. The selectors also recalled Nazmul Hossain as the fifth pacer, after vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel and uncapped Mahbubul Alam Robin. Robin made his Test debut against New Zealand on Tuesday. Opener Imrul Kayes and spinning all-rounder Nayeem Islam, who were in the ODI squad against New Zealand, retained their places, although middle order batsman Mahmudullah Riyad lost out to Roqibul. Bangladesh will open the tour playing the lone day-night Twenty20 match on November 5 at Liberty Life Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. The first day-night one-day affair will be held at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom, on Nov 7, while the second match is billed for Nov 9 at Willowmoore Park, Benoni. Bangladesh will face the Proteas in the third and final one-dayer at Buffalo Park, East London under floodlights on Nov 12. Apart from the ODIs and T20 match, Bangladesh will also play two Tests against the Proteas in their month long tour to South Africa. The Tigers will also play a three-dayer (Nov 15-17) against South Africa A before facing the hosts in the first Test (Nov 24-24) at the OUTsurance Oval, Bloemfontein. The second and final Test (Nov 28-Dec 2) will be held at SuperSport Park, Centurion.
