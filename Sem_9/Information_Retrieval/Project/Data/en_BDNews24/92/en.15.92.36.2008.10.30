<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Franck Ribery struck again to give Bayern Munich a 2-1 comeback win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday while Hoffenheim returned to the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-1 victory at VfL Bochum. Bayern started casually and fell behind early in the second half through a Martin Demichelis own goal. Miroslav Klose equalised and Ribery, who scored his first goal of an injury-hit season to lead another rallying 4-2 win over VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday, sealed Bayern's victory with 20 minutes to go when he netted from the edge of the area. Hoffenheim's comeback was even better, digging themselves out of trouble with three goals in a seven-minute burst in the second half. Bochum took the lead in the third minute and it was hard going for the Bundesliga newcomers before Demba Ba put them level just past the hour. Vedad Ibisevic converted a penalty to take his goal tally for the season to 11 and Brazilian midfielder Carlos Eduardo made certain of the win with a deft finish a minute later. Hoffenheim lead on 22 points from 10 games followed by Bayer Leverkusen on 21 after a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen on Tuesday. Hamburg SV are third on 20 points thanks to a 2-0 triumph at home to VfB Stuttgart while Bayern are fourth on 18. RIBERY RESCUE Bayern's third successive league win should have been more comfortable but they failed to make the most of their first-half dominance. Frankfurt could hardly get the ball off them in that 45 minutes yet so casual were Bayern they created just one clear-cut chance, Ribery sliding a pass for Bastian Schweinsteiger who wasted the opportunity with a weak shot. The game changed when Demichelis diverted a dangerous low cross from Markus Steinhoefer in at Michael Rensing's far post. The goal probably worked in Bayern's favour as they suddenly started attacking with more urgency. The equaliser came when Ribery burst through on the right and cut the ball back for Klose to convert and the French forward got the second when he leant back to guide in his shot at the far corner
