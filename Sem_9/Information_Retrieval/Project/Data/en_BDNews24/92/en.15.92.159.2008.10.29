 LONDON, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England captain Tony Adams is the new manager of Portsmouth, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday. Adams, who was already on the coaching staff at Fratton Park, takes over from Harry Redknapp who quit to replace Juande Ramos at Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend. "It's my time, and I think I'm ready," Adams, 42, told a news conference. "It's a great opportunity for me and I would have been mad to turn it down. "I'm very excited and can't wait to get going. I've been here for two-and-a-half years so it's business as usual." Adams spent his entire playing career at Arsenal where he was part of a miserly defence comprising Lee Dixon, Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn. He won 66 caps for England. After retiring in 2002 Adams became manager of Wycombe Wanderers the following year before resigning a year later. He broadened his knowledge of the game during a spell as a trainee coach with Dutch side Feyenoord and joined Redknapp's coaching staff at Portsmouth in 2006 as assistant manager. Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie said Adams had signed a two-and-a-half-year contract. His first match in charge will be against Premier League leaders Liverpool on Wednesday. Adams turned his career around after problems with alcohol which resulted in a prison sentence in 1990. The arrival of Arsene Wenger at Arsenal in 1996 helped Adams reach new heights in his career and he was captain of the Arsenal sides that won Premier League and FA Cup doubles in 1998 and 2002. "I spoke to Arsene last night on the phone. He said 'Welcome to Hell'," Adams said. "He asked me if I was scared and I said 'No, I'm coming for you!'" Adams' appointment was no surprise to Redknapp. "When I brought Tony in a couple of years ago I said 'Come with me for a year or two Tony and you'll have my job'," Redknapp told reporters at Tottenham's training ground
