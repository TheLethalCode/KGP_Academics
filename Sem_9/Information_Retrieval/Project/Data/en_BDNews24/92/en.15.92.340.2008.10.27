 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  The country's central bank has said they have no information about any money laundering incident at the Trust Bank, following recent allegations against the ACC boss Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury involving his tenure as chairman of the private bank. However, financial losses in transaction of foreign currency were reported by the bank at the time, a central bank official said Monday. Mahmudur Rahman, former energy adviser of the BNP-led four-party alliance government, and a staunch critic of the anticorruption drive of the caretaker government, tried to file a case on Saturday against the Anticorruption Commission chairman and former army chief, accusing him of money laundering while he was chairman of Trust Bank. However, police did not accept the case on grounds of legal complexity. Rahman alleged that as the chairman of Trust Bank, Chowdhury laundered about Tk 20 crore of bank money abroad by citing losses in foreign exchange transactions. After Rahman's failed attempt, Chowdhury categorically denied the allegation on Sunday, saying he would go for a legal battle against it. At a press conference at the ACC headquarters, he said: "I want to categorically say that the allegation brought against me is not true. If you want to know further about the incident you will have to contact Trust Bank." Chowdhury said there had been losses in foreign exchange transactions, but added that the Trust Bank at the time had acted on advice from Bangladesh Bank. Deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank Ziaul H Siddiqui, said Monday: "The Bangladesh Bank does not have any information regarding any money laundering incident at the Trust Bank." "However, the bank incurred some financial losses in foreign currency transaction,"Siddiqui said, as the central bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed brought the matter to his notice during a press conference. bdnews24.co
