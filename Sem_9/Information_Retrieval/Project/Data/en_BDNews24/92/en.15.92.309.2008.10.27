<TITLE> Ballack to apologise to Loew, Frings backs down </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 27(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew won what appeared to be a complete victory in his row with two senior players on Sunday, when Michael Ballack offered an apology and Torsten Frings pledged his future to the team. "I will sit down with Joachim Loew as soon as my injury permits and apologise for my behaviour," Ballack said in a statement. Frings, who had threatened to quit the national team after being left out of the starting line-up for the last two World Cup qualifiers, later issued a statement of his own saying he would like to carry on playing for Germany. "I will continue to fight for my place," Frings said. Ballack's position as captain came under threat when Loew reacted furiously to a newspaper interview in which the Chelsea midfielder suggested senior players such as Frings were not being treated with enough respect. Ballack cooled the row when he called Loew on Saturday to say he would travel to Germany for a requested meeting. "I told Jogi Loew that it was never my intention to criticise the work he is doing as national team coach," Ballack continued in a statement quoted by the German Football Association (DFB). "I admire Jogi Loew as a player and a professional very much." MIDFIELD PARTNERS Loew told the DFB he would wait for the meeting to take place before making any comment. "I've noted Ballack's explanation but much more important is our private discussion," Loew said. The 32-year-old Ballack has won 89 caps and scored 39 goals for Germany. In many of those games he has played alongside Frings, who has 78 caps appearances and 10 goals to his name. "I was very disappointed after the games against Russia and Wales," the 31-year-old Frings explained in his statement. "Being able to contribute almost nothing to the team's success was a new and difficult experience for me and I needed time to get the situation clear. "Playing for my country is something extraordinary and specialand I want to continue doing so in the future. I've never asked for a guaranteed place and I never will." Loew did lose one less important player over his recent selection policy, with striker Kevin Kuranyi walking out for good after being left out for the 2-1 win over Russia
