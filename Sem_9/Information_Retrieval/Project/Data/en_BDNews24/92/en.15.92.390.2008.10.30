<TITLE> No return to jail as long as Hasina parole extended: lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina will not have to go back to special jail if the government extends her parole, the former prime minister's counsel barrister Shafik Ahmed has said. "If Sheikh Hasina is not allowed bail in the case she will not have to retrun to jail. She can remain free as long as the government extends the parole," the lawyer told reporters on Thursday after the Supreme Court denied her bail in Noor Ali case. "(Otherwise) She will have to go to jail as soon as she returns home if the government does not extend the parole," he said. The Awami League chief was paroled on June 11 this year to seek medical treatment abroad and her parole comes to an end on Nov. 6. Hasina's special assistant Hasan Mahmud earlier said that she would return home at the start of November. Barrister Shafik said Thursday's ruling was "unexpected." "There is no reason of rejecting the appeal as no police report has been given yet in the case," he said. Hasina has secured bail in Azam J Chowdhury and MiG-29 corruption cases while the High Court ordered not to arrest or harass her in Niko and barge-mounted power plant graft cases. She was not allowed bail only in Noor Ali case, the lawyer said. The government has shown Hasina arrested in the case, he added. bdne
