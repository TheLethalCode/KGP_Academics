 MILAN, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of Wednesday's Serie A matches (all 1930 GMT). Ronaldinho will miss AC Milan's home game with Siena after sustaining a knock in Sunday's 1-0 win at Atalanta. "He had a bruise to his right kneecap. I think that even he will need a couple of days rest," Milan doctor Massimo Manara told the club website (www.acmilan.com). Milan, a point behind joint leaders Udinese, Inter Milan and Napoli, will also be without the injured Mathieu Flamini. Sulley Muntari, who has a right leg strain, will miss Inter's trip to Fiorentina and could be out for a month. Fellow midfielder Esteban Cambiasso is also a doubt for the champions while coach Jose Mourinho must decide whether to drop forwards Adriano, Julio Cruz, Mario Balotelli and Victor Obinna after they ignored his orders in Sunday's 0-0 draw with Genoa. Alberto Gilardino, pending an appeal, will miss the match after picking up a two-game suspension for scoring with a handball in Sunday's 3-1 win at Palermo. Giampaolo Pazzini will fill in for the Viola, who are a point behind the leaders. Struggling AS Roma are without suspended defender Philippe Mexes and attacker Mirko Vucinic for the visit of Sampdoria. Centre back Juan and midfielder David Pizarro may return from injury. Injury-plagued Juventus look poised to be without 11 players when they travel to Bologna with Zdenek Grygera, Hasan Salihamidzic and Paolo De Ceglie added to their casualty list. Pacesetters Napoli will miss suspended midfielder Manuele Blasi for the home game with Reggina while goalkeeper Gennaro Iezzo is struggling with a back problem. Fellow leaders Udinese could rest top forward Antonio Di Natale for the match at Catania as he bids to shake off a couple of knocks
