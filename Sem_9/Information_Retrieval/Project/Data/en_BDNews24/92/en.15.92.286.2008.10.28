 BEIJING, Tue Oct 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China Tuesday condemned the killing of five of its citizens in Sudan as a terrorist crime but said it would continue investing in the volatile, oil-producing African country. The five men killed Monday were among nine Chinese oil workers kidnapped in central Sudan more than a week ago. They died in a failed rescue attempt, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news conference. She expressed "pained grief and condolences" for their families and said President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao had ordered Chinese officials to do all they could to ensure the safe return of the men still missing. "We express our strong outrage and condemnation of the terrorist crime of the bandits' cruel and inhuman murders of the unarmed Chinese personnel," Jiang said. She did not give any details of the men's backgrounds. Jiang said she had no details of the rescue attempt or whether Chinese officials were directly involved. She said China would not be deterred from continued investment in Sudan, where its oil stake and arms sales have drawn condemnation from critics of Khartoum's policies in Darfur, where bloody ethnic strife has raged since 2003. "In the future we will attach importance to continuing friendly policies toward Sudan and developing friendly, mutually beneficial cooperation with Sudan," Jiang told a news conference in Beijing. She said Chinese investment benefited the people of Sudan. "We also ask that Sudan, while ensuring the safety of our missing personnel, make all-out rescue efforts ... (and take) ... steps to ensure the safety of lives and property of Chinese personnel," she said. This was the third such kidnapping in the energy-producing state of South Kordofan in the past year, marking an escalation of risk in the region, where China has a big stake. South Kordofan borders Darfur. Beijing has contributed to a peacekeeping mission seeking to end the strife, but critics say its oil deals and arms sales help prop up Khartoum and abet its policies in Darfur. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry blamed the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a Darfur rebel group, for seizing and killing the Chinese. A London-based JEM official has denied the group was involved. The nine workers were snatched near a small oilfield where they were doing contract work for the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC). The company is a consortium, led by China's CNPC, that includes India's ONGC, Malaysia's Petronas and Sudan's state-owned Sudapet. Jiang said Chinese officials and CNPC had formed a team seeking the return of the kidnapped workers
