 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission has extended its deadline for those seeking clemency by another 15 days to Nov 15. "The government has given the extension considering the success of the first extension," the commission's chairman justice Habibur Rahman Khan told a weekly press briefing on Wednesday. To date, a total of 330 applications, including 264 government employees and 24 businessmen, have been submitted to the commission. Among these, only 19 applications came spontaneously, while 167 applications were submitted through the National Coordination Committee to combat corruption and serious crime, 141 through the Anticorruption Commission and three from the lower courts. The TAC has heard 213 suspects so far and certified 52 persons for clemency, with directions to deposit over Tk 22 crore to the national exchequer. The commission chairman said about Tk 11 crore of this had already been deposited. Justice Habibur said, for the first time, a politician has appealed to the TAC for mercy through the courts. Businessman Mosharraf Hossain Thakur, who is also organising secretary of BNP's cultural front Jasas has been permitted by a court to seek clemency from the truth commission, an ACC lawyer said Tuesday. TAC member Maj Gen (retd) Monjur Rashid said most of those seeking mercy from the commission have been government employees. Four clemency seekers from Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd (BTCL) have provided important information to the commission, he added. bdnews
