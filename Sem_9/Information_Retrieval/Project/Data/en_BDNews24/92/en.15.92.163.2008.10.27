 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com) The visiting Commonwealth secretary-general Monday made it clear to the government that holding elections under emergency was "inconsistent" with its position. Secretary-general Kamalesh Sharma, however, said the decision of withdrawing the state of emergency was the government's to make. He stressed that the upcoming general elections should be held in a peaceful manner. "I have  reiterated in my discussions the Commonwealth's position that a state of emergency is inconsistent with a normal electoral process," Sharma told reporters at a press conference at the Sonargaon Hotel to brief journalists on his visit. During his two day visit, Sharma has met chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, the chief election commissioner and high commissioners of different Commonwealth countries based in Dhaka. "It is important that the caretaker government and the Election Commission will together ensure that the elections take place in a climate of peace and security," Sharma told the press briefing. "It will be desirable for us if [the state of emergency] is lifted, but as for the government policy, that is for the government to share with the people," he said. He said the government had invited the Commonwealth to send observers for the 9th Jatoya Sangsad elections. Sharma said a Commonwealth assessment team would arrive in Bangladesh on Nov 8 or 9, as a prelude to sending an observation mission to monitor the general elections on Dec 18. "This team will try and consult all stakeholders and make its recommendations for the team of observers," he said. The secretary-general would then decide whether to send observers, in line with the recommendations. The secretary-general is scheduled to leave the capital Tuesday morning. He arrived in Dhaka on Sunday on a two-day official visit. bdn
