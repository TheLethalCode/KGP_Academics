 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government is going to form a panel to advise it on measures to pre-empt any negative impacts of ongoing global financial meltdown on the economy, an adviser says. The move comes on the back of appeals from experts that the interim administration puts in place a taskforce as the world grapple with worst financial turmoil in 80 years. "We have decided to form the Monitoring Management Advisory Committee in the shape of a taskforce. We will sit within a few days to form the committee," the finance and planning adviser, Mirza Azizul Islam, said in an interview with bdnews24.com on Wednesday. The committee will be composed of experts from government and non-governmental economists, with Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed as the head, the adviser said. Salehuddin is already leading a government committee to keep an eye on the swirling economic storm. He added that the committee will review the development of incidents concerning economy and will advise the government on prompt measures. "As concerns are mounting with all sorts of opinions and recommendations regarding the global crisis's impact on the national economy, the government has decided to form the committee" Mirza Aziz said. Experts, including Awami League presidium member and former finance minister Abul Mal Abdul Muhit, permanent representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations in Geneva Debapriya Bhattacharya and others have been urging the government to form a taskforce to monitor the global economic condition. "Not exactly a taskforce, but the Monitoring Management Advisory Committee will be in the shape of a taskforce," Mirza Azizul commented when the experts' urges were brought to his notice. bdnews
