<TITLE> World's most obese man weds after slimming down </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MONTERREY, Mexico, Mon Oct 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Mexico's Manuel Uribe, once the world's most obese man, has married his girlfriend, arriving at the wedding on a truck. Uribe, 43, who once weighed as much as a small truck at more than half a tonne, married Claudia Solis on Sunday after being hoisted onto a flat bed truck and taken to the wedding. Uribe has been confined to a reinforced bed for the past six years because he is so heavy and this was only the third time he has left his house. "I'm very happy. This is a really special day for me. God has permitted this day to arrive and for a beautiful woman like Claudia to marry me. We will start a new adventure together," he told reporters in Spanish. Uribe once tipped the scales at 560 kg after spending the 1990s eating pizzas and burgers in the United States where he worked as a computer repairman then moving back to Mexico and bingeing on greasy tacos. His bulk made him the world's heaviest man and won him a place in the Guinness World Records' 2008 edition. But abandoned by his first wife, his health failing and with no income, Uribe pleaded for help on Mexican television, stirring up intense international interest. Uribe, cared for by his mother Otilia, turned down offers of a gastric bypass surgery in Italy and took free medical help from US doctor Barry Sears and lost weight following the Zone Diet, which is high in protein and low in carbohydrates. He has now trimmed down to 326 kg -- the size of three hefty men -- but is still unable to move his swollen legs. Uribe relies on his family's small wholesale clothes business and the generosity of friends to survive
