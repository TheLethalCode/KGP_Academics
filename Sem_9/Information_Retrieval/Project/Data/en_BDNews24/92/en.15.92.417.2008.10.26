<TITLE> Japan economics minister: Not time to call election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sun Oct 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's economics minister on Sunday urged Prime Minister Taro Aso not to call a snap election soon because of the global financial crisis and the need for Tokyo to take its own steps to cope. Speculation has been simmering that Aso would call a Nov. 30 general election in a bid to gain a mandate to break a political stalemate caused by the opposition's control of parliament's upper house, where they can delay laws and stymie policies. But a sharp slide in Tokyo share prices and a surge in the yen's strength that is battering profits at exporters as Japan's economy slips into recession are making the decision a tough one. "I have said that if there is anxiety in the financial and security markets and if global uncertainty begins, then we do not have the leisure to call an election," Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on a TV programme. "We have budgetary steps to take and at the world leaders' summit on Nov. 15, Japan will probably receive various 'homework' of its own," Yosano added. "If we have an election while we are doing our 'homework', we cannot do anything." The United States will host a summit of global leaders on the financial crisis in Washington on Nov. 15. Asked if it was an option for Aso to postpone an election until next year, Yosano replied: "That option is quite possible." No lower house election need be held until September 2009. Analysts say the ruling bloc could well lose if an election is held soon. But an angry opposition, keen for a chance to oust Aso's long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), may delay policy steps if the premier decides not to go to the polls. Japan's government is compiling another economic stimulus package, expected to be unveiled this week, that will include 2 trillion yen ($21.21 billion) in temporary income tax cuts, a bank bailout scheme and relief for small businesses. The government would need to enact another extra budget to implement the package, which media reports have said would be worth a total of 5 trillion yen in new spending. Aso on Saturday said the tough times for exporters meant Japan needed to stimulate demand at home, and repeated that he had not yet made up his mind about an election. "Today, I realise once again the importance of playing an international role, which should be considered as a priority over domestic politics," Aso told a news conference in Beijing after attending a meeting with Asian and European leaders. The LDP's assistant secretary-general, Nobuteru Ishihara, told a separate TV show that share prices and currency moves would be a key factor in Aso's decision. "I think the prime minister will decide while watching foreign exchange and share price moves this week," Ishihara said, adding Aso would likely want to avoid a political vacuum if shares fell further and the yen strengthened
