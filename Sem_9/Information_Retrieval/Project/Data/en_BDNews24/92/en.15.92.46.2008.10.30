<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  The commerce adviser has said the Supreme Court's denial of bail to Sheikh Hasina on Thursday would not throw the general election into uncertainty. "We have to move forward by handling these day-to-day confusions. We hope Sheikh Hasina's lawyers will face the court with more aptitude," Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters on Thursday after a meeting with a few of interim cabinet colleagues at the Secretariat. The Supreme Court denied bail to the former prime minister in Noor Ali extortion case. Others present in the meeting were communications adviser Ghulam Quader, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal. On the re-demarcation of electoral constituencies, he said: "We have already crossed a good number of milestones before the Dec 18 elections and we have more ahead of us. The redrawing of constituencies need to be resolved prior to the elections." "We have decided to intensively observe the issues of electoral delimitations and schedule to avoid any problem in declaring electoral schedule. We will do the job by holding regular discussions." "We are taking every step so that the election cannot be hampered anyway," Hossain Zillur said. Asked whether it would be possible to declare the schedule 45 days prior to elections slated for Dec. 18, as is the norm, he said: "The government will do everything required to hold the elections. We are working by evaluating all previous issues." "All problems can be solved within this short period. We will continue our effort to resolve them." bdne
