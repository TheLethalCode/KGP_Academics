<TITLE> Cannot bar 'convicted' without appeal: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  A BNP leader has claimed electoral provision of declaring "convicted" people unfit or barring them from elections is unconstitutional and they should be allowed to contest elections until any appeals are resolved in the higher court. "If anyone is convicted by the trial court he must be given the scope to appeal to the higher court against the verdict," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters Wednesday at Naya Paltan party office. "To keep one from contesting elections or declaring him unfit by not giving him the scope to appeal is not constitutional." "This is similar to repealing a person's fundamental rights. If the higher court upholds the verdict of the trial court then there is no objection," he said. Awami League has also demanded that any prospective election candidate, convicted or facing trial but with appeals pending in the higher court, should be allowed to contest in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Nazrul Islam said that his party was ready for the Dec 18 elections. "We are ready to participate in the elections if a congenial atmosphere is created." "BNP is an election oriented party and we are taking preparations to that end," he said. "But people are in doubt whether the election will be held in time because the petitions regarding the delimitation of constituencies are yet to be resolved in the higher court." "We are also in doubt as we do not know our won constituencies yet," the BNP leader added. bdnew
