 BAGHDAD, Wed Oct 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Washington has received and is reviewing Iraqi proposals for amendments to a pact that would allow US troops to stay in Iraq after a UN Security Council mandate expires this year, the US embassy in Baghdad said on Wednesday. "We got them. We are looking at them," embassy spokeswoman Susan Ziadeh said. The Iraqi cabinet drew up the proposed amendments on Tuesday after announcing last week it wanted changes to a text that had been agreed over months of negotiations. The proposed amendments have not been made public, but Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said on Tuesday that they included changes to some of the content of the text as well as its wording. Environment Minister Nermeen Othman, who attended Tuesday's cabinet meeting, said the amendments were mainly intended to remove ambiguities and would not alter one of the main sections, which grants Iraq the power to try US troops in its courts for serious crimes committed while off duty
