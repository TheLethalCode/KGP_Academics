Police isolated the envelope, and Rhoads, and then told the 140 members of staff to leave as a precautionary measure while they investigated. Staff made arrangements to ensure the company could put out a news file from other offices. Nearly three hours later, Hunt said authorities told Reuters the powder was harmless and workers returned to the desk. The New York office is the headquarters of Thomson Reuters, the parent company, and the newsroom is the firm's second largest after London. Earlier this month, letters, many containing a suspicious white powder, were sent to Chase bank offices and two other financial institutions in several states and to the New York Times headquarters in New York.

US authorities have been on alert for such letters since 2001, when envelopes laced with anthrax were sent to media outlets and US lawmakers, killing five people.
