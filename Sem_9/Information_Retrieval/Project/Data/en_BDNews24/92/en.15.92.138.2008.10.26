 Dhaka, October 26 (bdnews24.com)The government will form district level review committees to enforce the recent High Court order banning the sale and marketing of eight foreign milk powder brands that have tested positive for melamine in at least one local laboratory. The decision was taken at a meeting of the health and family welfare ministry Sunday, a ministry press release said. A campaign to raise public awareness over the issue will also be conducted by the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute (BSTI), said the statement. The police department and concerned government agencies will enforce the HC decision. Each district review committee will be chaired by the district commissioner with the police super, civil surgeon and district information officer as members. Powdered milk samples were sent to the FAO's Bangkok regional office after tests carried out by Dhaka University's chemistry department indicated the presence of melamine in eight foreign brands of powdered milk. Further tests by the Food and Agricultural Organisation will be completed in three to four days, the ministry said in its statement. The BSTI and concerned agencies will also take prompt measures to test whether the contaminant substance melamine is present in sweetmeats or any other milk products, said the ministry. On Oct 23, the HC ordered the government to suspend the sale, marketing and display of eight foreign brands of powdered milk. They are Australia's Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, China's Yashili-1, Yashili-2 and Sweet Baby-2, and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. bdnews24.
