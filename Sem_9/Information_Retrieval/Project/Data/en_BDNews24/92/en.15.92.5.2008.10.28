 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) - Home adviser MA Matin has dismissed contempt of court charges brought against the government by a human rights group for not taking effective action in stopping the sale of melamine tainted milk powder. "We did not defy the court order. We rather took effective measures to implement the order. So the allegation is baseless," Matin told reporters at the Secretariat Tuesday. Eight Supreme Court lawyers filed a petition on behalf of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh with a High Court bench on Monday. The HC on Oct 23 directed the government to take quick action in banning the display and sale of eight foreign brands of milk powder. The government has not taken any effective measure yet despite the HC order, the petitioners said. The government's commerce secretary, home secretary, health secretary and inspector general of police have defied the court order by their inaction, they alleged. Matin said Tuesday, the government was implementing the HC order rigorously. "We have already directed the concerned district and police officials to take action in preventing the sale of the banned milk powders." The banned brands are Australian brands Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, Chinese brands Yashli-1, Yashli- 2 and Sweet Baby, and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. bdnew
