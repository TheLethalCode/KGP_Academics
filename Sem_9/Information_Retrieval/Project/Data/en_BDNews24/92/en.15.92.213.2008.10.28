 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguayan championship leaders Libertad beat second-placed Guarani 2-1 in a match which was played over two days after being suspended by a tropical downpour. Two players scored hat-tricks in Peru, modest Palestino continued their impressive run in Chile and Blooming won the first leg of the Bolivian championship final. PARAGUAY Libertad went four points clear at the top of the Clausura championship after winning their rain-interrupted game. In the first half played on Saturday, Jonathan Fabbro gave Guarani the lead with a penalty and Osvaldo Martinez equalised from a free kick. The game was abandoned at halftime as a violent electrical storm waterlogged the pitch in only a few minutes. Play was resumed 24 hours later and Manuel Maciel scored an 86th minute winner to keep Libertad on course for a fourth successive title. PERU Uruguayan Miguel Ximenes scored a hat-trick in Sporting Cristal's 3-0 win over Jose Galvez while Brazilian Calheira also notched three as Sport Ancash beat Universitario by the same score. Deportivo San Martin won 2-0 at struggling Juan Aurich to stay top of the championship's second stage with first-half goals from Roberto Ovelar and Jose Diaz, who scored from a penalty. Cienicano came from behind to beat Melgar 3-1 in a game which produced three red cards in an eight-minute spell in the first half as Norbil Romero and Gerardo Garate (Melgar) and Roberto Guizasola (Cienciano) were all dismissed. Cristian Guevara scored twice in the second half and Cesar Nahui added a third for the hosts, wiping out Garate's 15th-minute opener for Melgar. CHILE Modest Palestino beat Provincial Osorno 1-0 to stay top of Group Three in the Clausura championship with a first-half strike from Francisco Ibanez. Palestino have 33 points from 17 games, the best record in the tournament. Lucas Barrios scored a hat-trick in Colo Colo's 3-0 win over Deportes La Serena, taking his tally to 11 goals, and Cobreloa beat titleholders Everton 2-0. BOLIVIA Aurora's chances of winning their first title took a knock when they lost 2-0 to Blooming in the first leg of the Clausura championship final. Alejandro Schiaparelli headed the Santa Cruz-based side ahead in the 34th minute and his fellow Argentine Hernan Boyero scored with another header in the 74th. ECUADOR Argentine striker Martin Mandra scored twice in the first half, taking his tally to 16, to give Deportivo Quito a 2-0 win over local rivals LDU and extend their lead at the top of the championship's final stage. Deportivo have 12 points from three games, including a three-point bonus carried through from previous stages of the tournament, and are four clear of LDU. Third-placed Barcelona fell six points behind the leaders after they were held 1-1 at Macara. COLOMBIA Millonarios and Santa Fe played out a 1-1 draw in their Bogota derby, the goals coming in the first 25 minutes. Venezuelan Luis Manuel Seijas headed Santa Fe in front and Milton Rodriguez levelled from the penalty spot. Leaders Tolima lost 2-0 at Once Caldas, Ricardo Ciciliano scoring twice in the last 10 minutes, and second-placed Deportivo Cali were beaten by the same score at Envigad
