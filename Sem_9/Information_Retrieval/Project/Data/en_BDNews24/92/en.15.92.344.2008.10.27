 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)The third day of the second and final Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand was delayed Monday due to wet conditions. With the match set to start at 9am at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka, water on the covers and a soggy outfield was also holding up a pitch inspection scheduled for 11am. Umpires said if there was no rain in the next few hours there might be some play, but it seemed a remote possibilty. The second successive day was washed out Sunday after continuous rains in Dhaka since Friday. Calling off play on the first day, umpires Asoka de Silva and Daryl Harper said the remaining four days' play would start at 9am, 30 minutes earlier than the scheduled time, to make up for the first day's loss. But the probability of catching up on the time lost looked unlikely Monday. The Mirpur game will be the decider of the two-Test series after New Zealand won the first match in Chittagong by three wickets, chasing down 317.
