 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) - The government will not tolerate any disruption of law and order during the elections even after a relaxation of the state of emergency, the home adviser warned on Tuesday. "If those who use terror tactics try to take advantage of the relaxation they will be handled severely, They will not be tolerated in any way," adviser MA Matin told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting on upcoming Victory Day celebrations at the Secretariat. Asked whether the state of emergency would be lifted during the polls, he said: "The decision is up to the government. So far I know, the emergency will be relaxed." On the possibility of a rupture in law and order, with the gap between Victory Day and elections being very short, he said: "The law and order situation will be the same as it is now. There is no possibility of deterioration." "We hope the election will be held fairly and properly," Matin said, when asked what impact the relaxation of emergency would have on the election. On Victory Day celebrations, he said the government had taken various preparations but the weeklong display of war weapons at the National Parade Ground would not be held this year. The government has formed a committee with five organisations to arrange all Victory Day programmes. bdnew
