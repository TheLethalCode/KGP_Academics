 NEW DELHI, Wed Oct 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top Indian policymakers including the finance minister and the central bank governor met on Wednesday and discussed several issues including New Delhi's position at the forthcoming G20 meeting, officials said. Leaders of G20 nations are expected to meet at an international financial summit on Nov. 15 to examine ways to overhaul the financial system following the global credit crisis. Indian authorities have taken a number of steps to stave off the impact of the financial crisis on the broader economy, including a surprise 100 basis point cut in the main lending rate ahead of a monetary policy review on Oct. 24. "The finance minister had called this meeting which discussed a number of issues including the position that India must take in the forthcoming G20 meeting," Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao told reporters. The meeting was attended by Subbarao, deputy governor Rakesh Mohan, stock market regulator C.B. Bhave, former central bank governors C. Rangarajan and Bimal Jalan and planning commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. India has been particularly vulnerable to rising risk aversion among foreign investors. They have pulled more than $12 billion this year from the stock market, which has lost about 56 percent so far in 2008. It rose 47 percent in 2007. Growth is also expected to slow in Asia's third-largest economy as the ripple effects of the turmoil worldwide kick in. Estimates say it could slow to as much as 7 percent in the fiscal year to March 2009 from 9.0 percent in the previous year
