<TEXT>
 MADRID, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Teenage striker Bojan Krkic will return to familiar territory for the first leg of Barcelona's King's Cup match at Benidorm on Tuesday. The 18-year-old, who struck twice in the 5-0 Champions League rout of Basel last week, scored against the Segunda B (third tier) side on his debut for Barcelona's second-string team in the 2006/07 season. Barcelona B lost the match, but with coach Pep Guardiola resting key players for Tuesday's last-32 clash, including Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta, Krkic should get his chance for revenge. "It was a very memorable match, because it was my first in the B side," Krkic said on Barcelona's website (www.fcbarcelona.com). "Being able to play for the first team against them now in the King's Cup is special for me." In Wednesday's ties, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, Portugalete of the Tercera division (fourth tier), play Cup holders and Primera Liga leaders Valencia. Last season, Valencia beat Getafe 3-1 in the final to claim their seventh King's Cup. The arrival of the top-flight clubs in the tournament also sees third-tier Real Union play league champions and 17-times winners Real Madrid on Thursday. There are four all-Primera Liga ties, including Getafe, runners-up over the last two years, playing Osasuna on Wednesday and Athletic Bilbao facing 2003 finalists Recreativo Huelva on Thursday. The return matches are scheduled for Nov. 1
