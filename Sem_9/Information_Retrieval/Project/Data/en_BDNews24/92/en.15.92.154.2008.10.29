<TITLE> Stop purging public servants: RRC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)The Regulatory Reforms Commission has recommended provisions to stop purge of civil servants on political considerations. The RRC, which has its tenure extended until Oct 2010, has also convinced the government that public servants must get their pensions as early as possible when they retire. The provision will be effective from this December. "We have recommended that the government not send any public servant into forceful retirement without showing any reason," Apurba Kumar Biswas, RRC's chief executive officer (CEO), told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "It must give a reason for such action," Biswas said. The RRC proposal took into account many instances, in recent years, of civil servants getting the sack-- mostly at the discretion of the political powers that be -- on completion of 25 years of service. But the recommendation was yet to get the Chief Adviser's clearance. The proposal on the public servants' pension, however, did receive approval from Fakhruddin Ahmed. Public servants will get their pensions even if audit objections remain pending against them, RRC officials said. The RRC, assigned to recommend simpler rules and regulations, said the ministries of finance and establishment had already began working on the pension plan. "Just for a simple audit objection, the last resort of a public servant cannot hang in the balance for years," Biswas said of the RRC move. "Thousands of retired officials and employees have been sufferers for ages. "If the audit objection is more than the pension money, the case could be an exception," he said. It's no secret that retired government employees often have to bribe audit officials to get the all-important NOCs or no objection certificates from all previous departments they had served. All RRC recommendations are first sent to the Chief Adviser's Office. Then the concerned ministries vet them. On approval from the respective ministries, the new provisions are published through gazette notifications. The RRC's term was to expire on Oct 29, but the government last week decided to give it two more years. The military-installed caretaker government formed the RRC with a view to simplifying the centuries-old government rules and regulations. b
