 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com) Mahmudur Rahman, former energy adviser of the four party alliance government, has submitted allegations of money laundering against the ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury to the Anticorruption Comission by registered post for "investigation". In a signed fax message to the media, Rahman said: "I, the undersigned have sent to the Anticorruption Commission the allegation against former chairman of Trust Bank Ltd Lt Gen Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury by registered post for investigation under sections 4 and 8 of the Money Laundering Ordinance 2008, sections 406, 408 and 409 of the Penal Code and section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947." Rahman, a vocal critic of the caretaker government's anti-corruption drive, said copies of the allegations were also sent to the ACC chairman himself and the ACC director general Hanif Iqbal. Mahmudur Rahman, on Oct 25, attempted to file a case against the former Trust Bank chairman Chowdhury on charges of laundering some Tk 22.41 crore of the bank's money by showing losses in foreign exchange transaction. Police refused to accept the case on jurisdictional grounds. ACC boss Chowdhury has denied the allegations and said that he would take legal action against them. Speaking at a press conference at the ACC office Sunday, he said: "I want to say categorically that the allegations brought against me are not true." Chowdhury said there had been losses in foreign exchange transactions, but added that the Trust Bank at the time had acted on advice from Bangladesh Bank. bdnew
