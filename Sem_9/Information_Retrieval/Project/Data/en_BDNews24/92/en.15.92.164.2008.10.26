 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The government has spelled out a cut in fuel prices effective from Sunday midnight  with transport fares set to come down as the fuel price cut comes into force  an announcement expected to give the public weighed down by high food and fuel prices some relief. A ministry announcement said the price of diesel and kerosene will come down to Tk 48 from Tk 55, the price of petrol to Tk 78 from Tk 87 and octane to Tk 80 from Tk 90, from midnight. "The government will announce the cut of transport fares immediately following the government's cut in fuel prices," adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters at the Secretariat. "The ministry has taken all preparations in this regard. There will not be any scope to be confused about it," he said. The government will reset maximum fares of diesel-run buses and minibuses, also effective from Sunday midnight, said a press information department handout. Fares will come down to 98 paisa per kilometre from Tk 1.50 for buses, except those plying through Mawa and Paturia by ferry, which will come down to Tk 1.01 from Tk 1.08 per km. Fares will also be reduced to Tk 1.04 from Tk 1.11 per km for mini-buses en route to Mawa and Paturia by ferries. The new fares will also be effective from Sunday midnight.

Crude oil prices per barrel have plummeted since June, from a life-time high of over $145 to $62.7 on Friday. Bangladesh sees an annual demand of nearly 4 million tonnes of petroleum.
