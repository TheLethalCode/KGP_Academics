 HARARE, Tue Oct 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition party said on Tuesday that President Robert Mugabe's ruling party was not sincerely committed to entering into a genuine cooperative government under a power-sharing deal. The MDC opposition's Secretary-General Tendai Biti said the allocation of ministries was still being discussed in talks on forming a cabinet. He said the opposition party was committed to reaching an agreement but would not accept a bad deal. "The core of our differences with (the ruling) ZANU-PF is the pure lack of sincerity on the part of ZANU-PF," Biti told a news conference. Biti said that talks can be concluded in two days if there is good faith on outstanding issues. A regional meeting failed to break a deadlock threatening Zimbabwe's power-sharing accord on Monday, prompting the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) to call for an urgent full-scale summit on the crisis. Officials said the meeting could be held this week or next week in an attempt to persuade Mugabe and opposition factions to implement the accord, widely seen as vital to any effort to pull Zimbabwe out of economic meltdown. INTERIOR MINISTRY The SADC said the allocation of the interior ministry, which oversees the police force, was the main sticking point in negotiations. Zimbabweans had hoped a new leadership could provide relief from an economic meltdown. Inflation is out of control and food and fuel shortages are widespread in Zimbabwe, a once prosperous country and former British colony. Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe in a presidential election on March 29 but by too few votes to avoid a run-off in June. Mugabe won the second round after Tsvangirai pulled out, saying his supporters had been subjected to violence and intimidation. Mugabe, 84 and Zimbabwe's sole ruler since independence from Britain in 1980, has dismissed Tsvangirai as a "pathetic Western puppet" and vowed that he will never get near power. The 56-year-old opposition leader has called Mugabe a "raving old man with nothing to offer"
