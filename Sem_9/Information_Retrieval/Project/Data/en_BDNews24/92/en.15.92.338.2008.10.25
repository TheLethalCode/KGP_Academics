 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission is set to announce the schedules for national and upazila polls on Nov 2, the chief election commissioner said on Saturday. ATM Shamsul Huda, speaking to bdnews24.com, confirmed the date of announcing the detailed timeline while inaugurating a training programme for deputy commissioners on electoral laws at National Economic Council auditorium. The national elections would be held on Dec 18 while the upazila polls have been planned for Dec 24 and 28. "You have to work fearlessly from the day of announcing election schedule through to the days after the elections. This is a unique opportunity for you all," the CEC told the civil servants. "The sole agenda of the commission is to present the nation a free and fair election," he said. Huda asked the DCs, returning officers during national elections, work neutrally while applying electoral rules and regulations. "There is nobody to give them any directive except the commission, not even the chief adviser, theoretically speaking," the CEC said. He stressed proper scrutiny of nomination papers of the candidates. "If properly scrutinised, the unwanted people will be automatically off the list of candidates." Huda also asked them to be careful so that no one was deprived of their right to vote due to such silly mistakes as spelling of names. The two-phase training has brought together 32 DCs in the first batch while a second phase will see another 32 getting trained on Oct 28. b
