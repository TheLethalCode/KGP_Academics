 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Qatar will respect the existing protocol with Dhaka and recruit more semi-skilled and skilled from Bangladesh, its labour minister has said. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, in the Philippines to attend a migration conference, met with the labour minister on Wednesday. "The Qatari labour minister Sultan Bin Hassan Al Dosari has told foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury his country welcomes Bangladeshi manpower and appreciates their contributions to the Qatari economy," a foreign ministry press statement said. The minister's assurance comes at a time when many Bangladeshi workers have faced a crackdown in Middle Eastern countries, on charges of violating the local laws or overstaying their visas. Al Dosari came to Bangladesh on Jan 5 this year, when Doha signed a protocol with Dhaka on recruiting more Bangladeshi workers. The agreement seeks another 15,000 semi-skilled and skilled workers to be recruited in different sectors of the booming Gulf economy, including doctors, engineers, nurses, technicians and others. According to the expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry, there are some 70,000 Bangladeshis currently employed in Qatar. bdn
