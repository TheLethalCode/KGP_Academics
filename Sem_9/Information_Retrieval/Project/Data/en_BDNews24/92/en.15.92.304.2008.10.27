 LONDON, Mon Oct 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil trimmed losses after sinking to a new 17-month low below $62 a barrel on Monday, driven down by investor pessimism about the deteriorating global economic climate and its likely impact on demand for fuel. US light crude for December delivery was down 47 cents at $63.68 a barrel by 10:09 a.m. EDT, after touching a 17-month low of $61.30 a barrel earlier in the session.

Asian oil refiners said on Monday they had yet to receive notice of any curbs on their Gulf crude oil shipments, but most were expecting a 5 percent cut. Iran's OPEC Governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi has said the group will reduce production further if the cut agreed in Vienna on Friday does not stabilize the market. Oil prices have fallen by nearly 60 percent since they hit a record high above $147 a barrel in July. Demand has fallen in the United States, the world's top energy consumer, and in other industrial countries as the credit crisis infects the wider economy and begins to spread to emerging markets. In China, for example, apparent oil demand rose by just over 2 percent in September, the slowest growth in 10 months. Investors around the world are trying to find shelter, contributing to heavy losses on Asian and European stock markets, as well as other commodities such as gold and copper. The volume of open contracts in energy, metals, grains and soft commodities on major US commodity futures markets fell to its lowest since May 2006 in the week to October 21, as the risk of recession has prompted some investors to pull out
