<TITLE> Japan PM decides to put off election: Kyodo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minster Taro Aso has decided to put off calling a general election in order to deal with the global financial crisis and Japan's economic woes, Kyodo news agency said on Tuesday. The agency gave no source for the information. The Kyodo report, the second one in two days that the Japanese premier would put off elections, comes amid financial turmoil which saw Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average sink on Monday to its lowest close in 26 years. Aso on Monday had denied a Nikkei financial newspaper report that he had told an aide there would be no election for a while.

No election need be held until next year, but when Aso came to office in September he was widely expected to call an early poll to try to gain a mandate to break a stalemate caused by a divided parliament, where the opposition controls the upper house and can delay legislation. Voters tend to support the view that an immediate election is not needed, a poll published in the Asahi newspaper showed. About 57 percent of respondents to the poll carried out on Oct. 25 and 26 said there was no need to rush to hold an election, compared with 33 percent who wanted one soon. On Monday, Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, said it would raise up to $10.6 billion to replenish a depleted capital base while the government moved to beef up a bailout package for the country's ailing banks, which are big investors in domestic equities
