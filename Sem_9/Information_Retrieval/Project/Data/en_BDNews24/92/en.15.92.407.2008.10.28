 SRINAGAR, Tue Oct 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian army killed five suspected militants intruding into Kashmir and accused the Pakistani army of a fresh violation of a five-year-old ceasefire in the disputed Himalayan region. The cross-border firing happened in Sabzian area of Poonch district, south of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, the army said. "We were fired upon suddenly with mortars and small arms, but our troops did not retaliate," the army said in a statement. India and Pakistan came to a truce along the de facto border in November, 2003, as part of peace efforts between the two nuclear-armed rivals. This year a series of violations have taken place from the Pakistani side, authorities said. Indian soldiers also shot dead five militants overnight, as they tried to sneak into Indian Kashmir from the Pakistani side, the army said. It was the third attempted incursion in the last eight days and indicates an increase in efforts by separatist guerrillas to slip into Indian territory, before the bitter winter snow blocks mountain passes, the army said. New Delhi says Muslim guerrillas slip across the frontier under the cover of shooting by Pakistani troops to fuel an insurgency in Kashmir that began in 1989. Islamabad denies the charge
