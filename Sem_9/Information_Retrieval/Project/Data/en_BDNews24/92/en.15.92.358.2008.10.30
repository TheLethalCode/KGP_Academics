<TITLE> McCain hits Obama on experience, economy </TITLE>

 TAMPA, Florida, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - John McCain questioned rival Barack Obama's readiness for the White House and Obama issued a prime-time television appeal on Wednesday calling the election "a defining moment" as a bruising presidential campaign hit the final stretch. McCain kicked off a tour of the must-win state of Florida by warning that Obama would be bad news for small businesses and workers, and by casting doubt on the Illinois senator's judgment and ability to handle a security crisis. "The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and other grave threats in the world," McCain said after meeting with national security advisers in Tampa six days before Tuesday's election. "And he has given you no reason to answer in the affirmative," he said. Earlier, McCain renewed his charge that Obama's plans to raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 would hurt small businesses and accused Obama of wanting to redistribute the nation's wealth as "Redistributor in Chief." "Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I'm running to create more wealth. Senator Obama is running to punish the successful. I'm running to make everyone successful," McCain told a Miami rally. Obama, who would raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 and cut taxes for lower- and middle-income workers, said McCain's economic policies would be bad news for the middle class and would mean more of the Republican approach followed by President George W. Bush. "He's spending these last few days calling me every name in the book. I'm sorry to see my opponent sink so low," Obama told about 28,000 supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. "By the end of the week, he'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten," he said before heading to Florida for his own campaign events. "So let's cut through the negative ads and the phony attacks -- under John McCain, the middle class will watch wealth get favored over work, jobs get shipped overseas, and the cost of health care and college go through the roof." McCain is struggling to overtake Obama's lead in national polls and to defend about a dozen battleground states won by Bush in 2004, with Florida and its 27 electoral votes leading the list. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll showed Obama with a 5-point national lead on McCain. A blizzard of recent national polls gave Obama a national lead ranging from 2 points to 15 points. The key for both candidates is winning the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House, and Florida is a big piece of the puzzle. FLORIDA IS CRUCIAL A win in Florida for Obama, who earlier this month sent two of his top campaign officials to the state to supervise the voter turnout effort, could clinch the White House for him. "We need to win in Florida," McCain, an Arizona senator, said in Miami. Polls show Obama slightly ahead or running even with McCain in the state that decided the 2000 election for Bush after a disputed recount. Obama made his first joint campaign appearance with former President Bill Clinton at a late-night rally before more than 30,000 cheering supporters at an open-air sports complex in Kissimmee, Florida, after an expensive prime-time television address on three networks. There were no signs of any bitterness from the primary campaign in which Obama defeated Clinton's wife, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. Obama and the former president strode together to the microphone with arms draped on each other's shoulders. With Obama at his side, the former president heaped praise on the Democratic nominee for what he said was a calm, reasoned response to the financial crisis, saying that showed he would be a good manager in the White House. "If we have not learned anything, we have learned that we need a president who wants to understand and who can understand," Clinton said, taking a veiled swipe at Bush. Obama, whose fundraising juggernaut has broken all records and allowed him to blanket battleground states with ads, purchased 30 minutes of time on CBS, NBC and Fox on Wednesday night for an extended pitch on his economic plans. The ad cost about $1 million for each network. "This election is a defining moment, the chance for our leaders to meet the demands of these challenging times and keep faith with our people," Obama said in an ad that was taped but ended with live footage of the candidate addressing cheering supporters in Sunrise, Florida. Obama has surged in the past month as the Wall Street financial crisis hit, with polls showing voters prefer his approach to turning around the economy. McCain countered with an advertisement expanding on his theme that Obama is too inexperienced to be trusted in the Oval Office, and he released another spot on Wednesday expanding on the theme. "Behind the fancy speeches, grand promises and TV special lies the truth -- with crises at home and abroad, Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs," the narrator said. McCain also renewed his call for the Los Angeles Times to release a videotape of a 2003 banquet where Obama spoke of his friendship with Rashid Khalidi, a leading Palestinian scholar and activist. The Times reported on the contents of the tape in an April 2008 story about Obama's ties with Palestinians and Jews, but says it cannot release the tape because it was obtained from a source on the promise it would not be released to the public. "Now why that should not be made public is beyond me. I guarantee you, if there was a tape with me and Sarah Palin and some neo-Nazi or one of those, you think that that tape wouldn't be made public?" McCain said in a radio interview
