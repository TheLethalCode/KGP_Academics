<TITLE> EC chooses 'credibility over self-reliance' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)The EC chose credibility over self-reliance in overturning "almost half a century's practice" of using steel boxes, the CEC said Tuesday, as he received over 240,000 translucent ballot boxes from the Canadian government, ahead of the December general elections. Canadian High Commissioner Robert McDougall handed over the boxes to chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in a formal ceremony at the city's Radisson Water Garden Hotel. The United Nations Development Programme, with Canadian funding, procured the translucent ballot boxes worth over $5 million at the request of the EC. The CEC mentioning the debate for and against the change of "almost half a century's practice" of using steel boxes, said it was a question of self-reliance versus credibility. "Though self-reliance and dependence are important questions and should get due consideration in such decision making, the EC favoured procurement of translucent boxes more as a measure to gain voters' confidence." Translucent ballot boxes allow light to pass through these, while ensuring that ballot papers cannot be read once placed inside a box. They assure voters that the boxes are empty prior to the election while also securing voters' privacy at the polls. Huda hoped that the continuing modifications in election technologies and instruments would enhance the overall election management. "But the one area where technology is of little help is that of vote buying. To curb this malady the EC needs assistance of the voters, political parties, civil society, NGOs and a multiplicity of other organisations", added the CEC. He also said that the EC would soon launch a campaign against vote buying. "And we hope that the EC will not be alone in this endeavor." Huda said that they were looking forward to holding a successful poll on Dec 18 and installation of an elected government in January, 2009. The Canadian envoy in his speech said that such boxes would enact greater transparency in the upcoming polls. "Use of these boxes will encourage greater citizen participation in the electoral process and help ensure that the votes cast on Election Day will reflect the will of the people", he added. Speaking on the occasion, UNDP resident representative Renata Lok Dessallien said the initiative would help build confidence among all players of the election and protect confidentiality of the votes. She hoped that Bangladesh would enter into a democratic phase that was transparent, sustainable and responsive to people through the Dec 18 polls. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman, AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Hossian, Bikalpadhara president Badruddoja Chowdhury, LDP chief Oli Ahmed, election commissioners M Sakhawat Hossain and Muhammed Sohul Hossain, along with members of the diplomatic community were among those present. However, no representatives from the BNP or Jamaat-e-Islami attended the ceremony, though both parties were invited to join the programme. The Awami League-led alliance in 2005 demanded introduction of transparent ballot boxes in the ninth parliamentary polls as, they said, non-transparent metal ballot boxes were one of the main instruments for rigging elections. The BNP-led alliance has opposed using transparent ballot boxes. The Election Commission in 2006 rejected the Canadian offer of providing transparent ballot boxes free of cost. The EC had decided that the later-annulled Jan 2007 polls would take place using non-transparent metal ballot boxes. bdews2
