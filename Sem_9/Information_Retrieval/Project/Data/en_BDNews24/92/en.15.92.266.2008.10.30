 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Police on Thursday barred hundreds of protestors, rallying under the banner of the 'Sculpture Protection Movement', as they attempted to march towards the site of the recently removed Baul statue in front of Zia International Airport. The demonstrators began their rally from Dhaka University's Aparajeyo Bangla at around 11am. As they reached the Faculty of Fine Arts, police set up barricades to prevent them from advancing further. Hundreds of teachers, students and cultural activists, who had joined the rally, later held a gathering in front of the Fine Arts building and proclaimed a five-point demand to the government. Professor Sirajul Islam Chowdhury, directing his remarks at 'fundamentalists', blamed for instigating the removal of the Baul sculpture, said that they "abuse religion and people's religious sentiments" for their own purpose. The protestors demands include reconstruction of the sculpture in front of the airport with the theme of the 'Liberation War and folk culture', ensuring the practice of secular education and culture, modification of madrasa education, trial of war criminals and banning religion-based politics. DU professor MM Akash alleged the government had a hand in obstructing the demonstration with the help of police. He said that they would continue their movement until their demands were met. MM Akash also asked "democratic parties" to include the demands in their electoral manifestos.
