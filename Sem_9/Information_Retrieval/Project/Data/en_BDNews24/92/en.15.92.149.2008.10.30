 LONDON, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's plan for a new stadium has moved a step closery when the club announced plans on Thursday to build 60,000-capacity ground next door to their current White Hart Lane home. In a statement released with the club's financial results, chairman Daniel Levy said: "With a waiting list for season tickets of over 22,000 and club membership levels of over 70,000, our need for an increased capacity stadium has been clear for all to see for some time. "We diligently spent considerable time reviewing our options and the news that our supporters had been waiting for came this month when we announced our intention to remain in Tottenham, confirming the Northumberland Development Project  a world class scheme incorporating a new stadium with a capacity of 60,000, a club museum, new shops, restaurants, homes and important public space. "I am personally delighted that we have been able to put forward a viable option which we know to be the fans' favourite  remaining at the club's spiritual home." Spurs have been at White Hart Lane since 1899 but with a capacity of just over 36,000 it is dwarfed by local rivals Arsenal's 60,000 Emirates Stadium. Spurs have spent five years buying up options on industrial land close to their ground after discussions with local governing bodies led to the conclusion that redeveloping the current site and its environs was the most viable route. "To date this includes almost 60 separate property transactions, including 40 residential and potentially 160 commercial properties at a commitment of 44 million pounds ($18.25 million)," Levy said. Spurs, bottom of the Premier League but on the rise after a win and a draw in the first two games under new manager Harry Redknapp, announced that turnover was up 11 percent in the year to June 30 2008.
