 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)The newly floated Islamic Democratic Party will not be registered with the Election Commission since its constitution conflicts with that of the country's, top election officials said Wednesday. They also told bdnews24.com that the EC would hear objections against registration of Jamaat-e-Islami on Saturday. Committee chief and EC joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan said: "IDP's constitution is in conflict with the Bangladesh Constitution, and hence it has been barred from registration." "The country's Constitution states Bangladesh is a republic, while the IDP's constitution outlines an Islamic state." "They also failed to fulfil some preconditions to obtain registration," said Khan. The Islamic Democratic Party, floated by members of the banned militant organisation Harkatul Jihad Al Islami (Huji), applied to the EC for registration on Oct 20. Following media reports, the EC said that it would not register any banned organisation in the guise of a new political entity. "We will not register a party that is based on the ideals of a banned party," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters on Oct 21. However, the scrutiny committee chief said the EC had not taken the issue under consideration, as it found complexities in IDP's constitution that barred it from being registered. Forty more parties were found unfit for registration as their constitutions clashed with the Constitution of the country. On conclusion of an EC meeting Wednesday, election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com that a hearing would take place Saturday of those organisations submitting objections against Jamaat's registration. Seven separate statements of objection were submitted to the EC by the Sector Commanders Forum and the War Crimes Facts Finding Committee among others. bdnews24.
