 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)--Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday said the state of emergency would be relaxed in phases to allow political parties to carry out their electoral activities without hindrance. Syed Fahim Munaim, the chief adviser's press secretary, briefed reporters on Fakhruddin's comments, which were made to Commonwealth secretary general Kamalesh Sharma during a courtesy call on the chief adviser. "The Election Commission is working completely independently and will strengthen the base of democracy," said Munaim, quoting the chief adviser's comments to the secretary general. The chief adviser said the elections to four city corporations and some municipalities were held under the state of emergency, and they had seen a significant increase in ballots cast by voters, said the CA's press secretary. Again referring to the earlier discussion, Munaim said the commonwealth secretary general said a proposal is in the pipeline to create an alliance between Commonwealth countries which have independent election commissions. An assessment team will be sent to Bangladesh before the election. Commonwealth members will also be able to exchange experiences among themselves, said Fahim, quoting the secretary general. Sharma also described the reform measures undertaken by the present caretaker government as a milestone for the country, adding that the next administration would reap the benefits, said the press secretary. "He mentioned the independent Election Commission, preparation of voter lists with photographs, the Anticorruption Commission, Public Service Commission, newly formed Local Government Commission, Right to Information Ordinance and Consumer Rights Ordinance," Munaim said. The commonwealth secretary general said he would hold a meeting with the chief election commissioner, and provide him some advice regarding the election, he added. Fakhruddin concluded the meeting by expressing hope that the activities of the Commonwealth would be more dynamic during Sharma's tenure as secretary general of the organisation, said the press secretary. bdnews24.
