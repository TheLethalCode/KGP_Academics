<TITLE> Manila, Muslim rebels to blame for abuses: Amnesty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Wed Oct 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Amnesty International urged the Philippines and the country's largest Muslim rebel group on Wednesday to respect the rights of non-combatants, holding them responsible for deaths and destruction in the troubled south. The rights group said it had documented hundreds of cases of human rights abuses on the southern island of Mindanao in which almost 100 civilians were killed and hundreds of homes and farms destroyed. Donna Guest, deputy director of Amnesty International in Asia Pacific, said soldiers and guerrillas were behind the killings and burnings of houses and farms in the south, according to victims the group had interviewed. "The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and local groups opposing the peace talks have used violence as a negotiating strategy and hundreds of thousands of people are paying the price," Guest said in a statement. Some of those interviewed at temporary shelters in late August and early September also blamed soldiers for some of the atrocities, said Aurora Parong, head of the local chapter of Amnesty International. "In most cases, the Philippine government failed to provide non-combatants adequate protection," Parong told Reuters. "Some of the victims said the government has also done some abuses." In a 39-page fact-finding report, Amnesty International urged both the government and MILF to abide by the protocols of the Geneva Convention in the conduct of war and to take action against rights abuses in the conflict areas. It also recommended that the government indemnify victims of violations of international laws based on global standards, including compensation and rehabilitation of homes and farms. The group also criticised the arming of civilians and warned against imposing food blockades and preventing aid agencies from delivering food, medicines and supplies to displaced people. Nearly 300 people have been killed in more than two months of fighting between security forces and rebels from the largest Muslim rebel group in the south of the mainly Roman Catholic state. The fighting has displaced more than 650,000 people. Violence erupted in mid-August after the country's high court halted the signing of an agreement between the government and the MILF that would have expanded an existing Muslim autonomous region, giving it wider political, social and economic powers. The 11,000-member MILF has been fighting for nearly 40 years to achieve self-determination in a conflict that has killed more than 120,000 people and stunted growth in a region believed to be sitting on rich deposits of metals, oil and natural gas
