 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  After more than a dozen deferrals in past months, a Dhaka court has finally framed charges against 22 people, including former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu and chief of banned militant outfit HuJi, Mufti Abdul Hannan, in two separate cases regarding the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. Judge Masdar Hossain of Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 read out the charges on Wednesday, in the presence of 14 accused, all pleading innocent. The date for charge framing in the case had earlier been deferred a total of 13 times. The judge set Nov 5 for witnesses to begin testifying. Of the 14 in court, 13 are being held behind bars, including Pintu and Hannan, while one accused has been bailed. Another eight accused in the cases are on the run. Some 23 people, including AL central leader Ivy Rahman, died of injuries sustained in the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally held in front of party offices on Bangabandhu Avenue. The police filed a case the following day. Four years later, on June 11 this year, the Criminal Investigation Department pressed two separate charge sheetsone for unlawful killings/murder and another under the Explosives Actaccusing 22 people. Later, the government shifted the cases to the Speedy Trial Tribunal, where both cases are being tried together. It has been alleged that the immediate past four-party alliance government led by BNP had attempted to derail the investigations in the past by frequently changing investigation officers and other irregularities. bdnew
