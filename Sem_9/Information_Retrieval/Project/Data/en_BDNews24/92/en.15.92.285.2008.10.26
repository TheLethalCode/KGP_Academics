<TITLE> How far have emerging markets fallen? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Once thought "decoupled" from economic crisis in the West, emerging markets are now taking the brunt of recent global financial turmoil with stock markets and currencies slumping in value. Western investors and hedge funds have dumped anything considered risky, almost regardless of local fundamentals. Falling currencies have endangered repayment of foreign currency loans, threatening local banking sectors. Emerging borrowers are finding it almost impossible to refinance debt. Below are some facts about recent emerging market falls. EMERGING STOCK MARKETS Globally, emerging stock markets have lost 60 percent of their value since May, slumping to their lowest in four years and losing 38 percent in October alone. Russia's stock market has been one of the biggest losers, down 75 percent this year as war with Georgia, worries over government interference in investments, global problems, bank worries and falling oil prices sent capital fleeing. Among other key emerging markets, Brazilian stocks have lost 47 percent, Indian stocks have lost 57 percent and Chinese stocks 65 percent this year. CURRENCIES SLUMP Emerging currencies are also broadly sold off, with countries with large current account deficits and political risk suffering particularly. South Africa's rand is down 40 percent against the dollar this year, while the Turkish lira has lost more than 30 percent. DEBT SEEN MUCH RISKIER Emerging sovereign debt spreads -- a measure of how risky emerging sovereign debt is seen relative to U.S. Treasuries -- have more than doubled this year to their widest in six years. The cost of insuring emerging market debt in the credit default swaps market has also ballooned to several times the cost earlier in the year, with several countries including Pakistan and Ukraine pricing in probable default. Ratings agencies have downgraded a string of countries particularly in central and eastern Europe on deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and the cost of bailing out troubled local banks. CRISIS HOTSPOTS Iceland's highly indebted banking sector collapsed, taking with it the currency and broader economy and leaving the country dependent on a bailout from either the International Monetary Fund or possibly Russia. Other countries seen talking to the IMF about help include Pakistan, Belarus, Serbia, Hungary, Turkey and Ukraine. Central and eastern European economies are seen heavily exposed, with banking sectors under increasing pressure and requiring government support.
