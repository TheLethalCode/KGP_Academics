<TITLE> Nazmul Huda challenges EPR polls bar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com) Former minister Nazmul Huda has filed a petition with the High Court challenging the Election Commission's decision to disqualify those convicted under emergency powers rules from participating in any election, even if their case is under appeal. Huda, a former communications minister of the four-party alliance government, filed the petition Sunday, citing article 66 of the Constitution, which outlines the eligibility of prospective candidates to the Jatiya Sangsad elections. According to existing laws of the country, anyone convicted to over two years in prison is ineligible to contest elections for a further five years from the date of their release, unless an appeal is pending with the High Court. According to the EPR, any person convicted for any term under the rules is ineligible to participate in any local body or national election, even if an appeal is pending with the High Court. The rules also state that any person convicted under its provisions will be considered ineligible for any government, semi-governmental, regulatory agency or any other organisation with ties to the government. Huda claims the EC's move to bar those with an appeal pending in the upper court runs contrary to the Constitution. Some 60 political leaders have been convicted in cases under the EPR and have lodged appeals with the High Court against their convictions. The hearing on Huda's petition is expected to be held on Monday. bdnews24
