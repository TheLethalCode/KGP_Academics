 Male, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on Wednesday lost the first multiparty elections in the Indian Ocean archipelago's history, coming in second in a runoff vote to his longtime political nemesis, activist Mohamed "Anni" Nasheed. Former political prisoner Nasheed managed to line up a unified opposition behind him to unseat Gayoom, who was Asia's longest serving ruler after three decades in power.

Oct 9-10: Maldives holds first multiparty presidential election, which stretches into second day amid problems with voter rolls and rigging allegations. Gayoom gets 40.6 percent of the vote but it is not enough to avoid runoff with Nasheed, who comes in second with 25.1 percent. Oct 28: Maldivians go back to the polls for a runoff. Things go more smoothly despite registration hitches, and election officials say 86 percent of the 209,000 registered voters take part. Oct 29: Election board says Nasheed is the winner with 54.2 percent against Gayoom's 45.8 percent based on an official provisional count.
