 Chittagong, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, out on bail, flew to Bangkok on Wednesday on government permission for treatment. Mohiuddin, facing as many as 13 cases on charges of corruption and extortion, secured bail in all cases and was released on Oct 8 after 19 months in detention. The Awami League leader is suffering from a number of diseases including spinal cord complaints. His wife Hasina Mohiuddin is also accompanying him to the medical trip. The government has allowed him 45 days for seeking treatment abroad. Prior to heading for the airport, the mayor told reporters that he had left written directives for the supporters for the upcoming general election. "If they comply with the directives the party will be able to win most of the constituencies in the city," he said. The mayor said he had not had any feud with the acting city mayor and added that it was the elected mayor who had chosen the acting mayor. "It is not right that local government ministry would fix the appointment," Mohiuddin said. He said he would take legal action against the government order after returning home as he was not allowed to resume office. Mohiuddin said the government had committed a crime act by dragging its foot on allowing him to go abroad, for which he failed to see his daughter alive. Daughter Fauzia Sultana Tumpa died of cancer in Bangkok on Oct 17 while they were on a flight to Thailand to see her. The mayor returned from Bangkok with his daughter's body on Oct 19. bdne
