 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Two advisers on Thursday tried to dispel doubts about the general election slated for Dec. 18 amid differences over electoral constituencies and participation of convicted politicians. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters at the Secretariat the parliamentary polls would go ahead as scheduled however the complicacies over the newly-drawn constituencies. "There is no doubt about the upcoming elections whatever the outcome of the re-demarcation of electoral boundaries," he said. "There is no confusion that a free and fair election will be held as per the declared date." On the accord between the government and the political parties about the elections, the adviser said the parties had already said they were going to participate in the elections. "There is no confusion about that," he said. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman also said the caretaker administration will help stage the general election as planned. "The government is creating an environment of trust for the elections," he told reporters after a meeting with UNCTAD secretary general Supachai Panitchpakdi at the Secretariat. Hossain Zillur was surprised at the suggestion by reporters whether the general election would be postponed. "The preparation for election is underway in full swing. The government has left all doubts behind much earlier." "The government is doing everything to ensure the election." "The government wants to stage the elections with the participation of all parties. It has successfully crossed all the milestones to achieve the target amid the day-to-day uncertainties," the adviser said. "But it is also important whether the political parties are making the same atmosphere for the people. The politicians will have to make sure whether they will be able to maintain a stable condition after the election," he said. On the demands pressed by the parties to lift the state of emergency prior to elections, Quader said: "We will make the move whenever we feel the necessity." Asked about the government's stance about the decision about banning the loan defaulters and convicted people from elections he said: "The government will stick to its position about the matter." "If anybody gets the scope of participating in the elections even after that the civil society will take the responsibility." The adviser asked people to be aware so that these unwanted people could not be elected anyway. bdnews2
