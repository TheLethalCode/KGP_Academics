<TITLE> Civil servants lost for words on gas queries </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)Civil servants seemed at a loss Monday when business chiefs queried if the government would be able to ensure gas supply for new investors. "In the present situation, we can neither say you stop investment nor can we suggest you go ahead," said energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin, as he faced salvos at a seminar titled 'Natural Gas in Bangladesh: Demand and Supply Spectrum'. "It is indeed difficult to comment," the secretary said. Businessmen gave vent to their frustration at the seminar, hosted by Dhaka-based City Bank, and asked the top civil servant at the ministry quite bluntly: "We would like to know if there's gas or not." FBCCI chief Annisul Huq led the onslaught. "We heard Bangladesh was floating on gas. Now we hear we are running out of gas. What do we do now? "We hear gas supplies will slow down after 2011. We must be told in clear terms whether we should make new investments or not. "We are not satisfied with the answers we get from the government. "Political crises hurt us, but do not silence us or stop us. But power and gas crises stall us completely." The energy secretary, who spoke as chief guest, said the government was in a difficult dilemma about how to use the country's scare gas resource. "We will have to decide whether we will give more gas to fertiliser factories or to the industries. "Our energy balance is heavily dependent on gas. We will have to go on large scale coal extraction soon. "Despite environmental concerns, use of coal as fuel has increased." On gas export controversy, he said: "Petrobangla never suggested export of gas. Inadequate analysis of data on reserves may have contributed to the controversy." Responding to the businessmen, Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed said, "Our only possible source of gas import is Myanmar. Apart from that, we can import liquefied natural gas (LNG)." He also spoke of revising the rates for domestic gas consumers. "Gas is being supplied at a flat rate throughout the month. It has to be reconsidered." Petrobangla director, retired major Moktadir Ali in his key-note paper said there is possibility of more gas from Jalalabad and Moulvibazar fields. A survey will be conducted in a 459 sq km area in block number 7, he said. "It is assumed that there is a reserve of 1.5 trillion cubic feet gas in this block. It may bring good news for the country." "Three dimensional surveys will start at Moghnama and Hatia next year. Three dimensional surveys will also start soon in block numbers 17 and 18." He said the country had proven gas reserves of around 7.7 trillion cubic feet, and probable and possible recoverable gas amounting to around 13 trillion cubic feet. At present the daily demand for gas is 2,046 million cubic feet (mmcf), with production at 1,840 mmcf. City Bank chairman Aziz Al Kaiser said: "We must formulate a long term  50 year long  energy policy. It is the right time for politicians and policy makers to take decision in this regard." City Bank CEO, K Mahmud Sattar gave the address of welcome. bdnews
