 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) The Supreme Court has denied bail to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. Hasina's lawyer barrister Shafik Ahmed said the ruling was "unexpected." "The court is allowing convicted people bail, but our appeal has been rejected," he said. A five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, gave the ruling on Thursday after concluding the hearing on the bail appeal. Attorney general Salauddin Ahmed said the court rejected the appeal on the basis of a majority ruling by the judges. The former prime minister's senior counsel, barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said earlier in the hearing that the court should allow bail considering his client's illness. Mentioning that Hasina was abroad for treatment on parole, Huq said: "Parole is meant for temporary release only, while bail is a matter of consideration by the court." The High Court had previously rejected Hasina's bail appeal on Sept 29, on her petition filed challenging the case. The Awami League chief appealed to the Appellate Division against the High Court order on Oct 5. The Appellate Division had deferred the bail appeal hearing several times, until Thursday. Unique Group chairman Noor Ali filed the Tk 5 crore case on June 13 last year against Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helal and his wife Rupa Chowdhury. The High Court, on Aug 7 that year, allowed Hasina bail but the Appellate Division on Aug 27 stayed the bail order. The former prime minister was arrested on July 16 last year, and allowed temporary release on June 11 this year to seek medical treatment abroad. bdnew
