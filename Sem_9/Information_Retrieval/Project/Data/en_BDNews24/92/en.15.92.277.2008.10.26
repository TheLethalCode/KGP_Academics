<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo has said he will run in the Dhaka mayoral race. He told bdnews24.com after a meeting on Sunday that he would throw himself in the fray for Dhaka City Corporation elections given that business leaders backed him. "I will contest the next race if business communities supports me," the former leader of the country's apex trade body said. "I have been working to build Dhaka as a modern city for past 10 years. And I have previsouly expressed my desire to run for the mayor's office," said Mintoo. Ameer Hossain Khan, president of Bangladesh Shop Owners Association (BSOA), suggested that Mintoo gave it a go for the top Dhaka job at an opinion-exchange meeting at BIAM auditorium in the city's Eskaton. The business leaders at the meeting sounded unwavering support for his candidature. FBCCI president Annisul Haque, voicing his support, said: "A business leader taking the charge of mayor, it will have positive outcomes." But he declined to announce his official support then and there. "As the FBCCI president, I cannot declare it now because any decision has to be approved by the board of directors of FBCCI." Nevertheless, he said: "Dhaka is an unplanned city and Mintoo has been working to make it a modern city. We've seen several mayors here, and our needs were not met by them." The FBCCI president urged political parties not to declare any candidature for the mayoral election, saying: "We want a business leader as mayor." The meeting introduced a 30-point demand for the city to better serve its people, including modern communication and traffic systems, flyovers and subways, pure drinking water supplies, proper sewerage system and measures to reduce traffic jam and the mosquito menace. The business leaders also demanded a favourable environment for business and investment and standard health services. Presided over by Alhaz Abdus Salam, president of Bangladesh Paint, Dyes and Chemical Merchants Association, the view exchange meeting was also addressed by FBCCI director Anwar Hossain, its former directors Enayet Hossain Chowdhury, Shafiullah Chowdhury and ASM Kamal Uddin. Former FBCCI chiefs Mahbubur Rahman, Mir Nasir Hossain, incumbent vice presidents Abul Kahem Ahmed, Abu Alam Chowdhury and around 500 business representatives were also present in the meeting. bdnew
