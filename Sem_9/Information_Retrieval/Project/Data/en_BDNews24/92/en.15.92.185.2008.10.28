<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Two fine knocks from Shahriar Nafees and Alok Kapali powered the Dhaka Warriors to a six-wicket win over the Mumbai Champs, their second Indian Cricket League victory, at Tau Devi Stadium in Gurgaon on Monday. Dhaka Warriors clocked 155 for four with eight balls to spare in reply to Mumbai Champs' 151 for six in the stipulated 20 overs as Nafees struck 57 and Alok remained unbeaten on 48. Left-handed opener Nafees made a cracking start, smashing Burkul for three fours in the opening over, but partner Nazimuddin fell cheaply for just two in the third over, leaving the side at 15 for one in 2.4 overs. Nafees, pairing with Aftab Ahmed, repaired the initial damage to put on 54 runs for the second wicket before Aftab went cross to be bowled by Khanolkar for a 15-ball 23. Alok, the lone centurion in the ICL, joined Nafees, who fell on 57, leaving the side at 95 for three in 12.2 overs. Nafees struck nine fours and one six in his 40-ball knock. Keeping his cool, Alok knocked a superb 48, while Dhiman Ghosh, who remained unbeaten on 13, struck Burkul for four to steer Dhaka Warriors home with eight balls to spare. Alok, who smashed three sixes and four fours in his 35-ball knock, was named the man of the match for his all-round performance. Invited to bat first, the Champs could manage only a moderate total in the face of tight bowling from the Dhaka Warriors, with Khirid (51 not out) and van der Wath (18 not out) putting on a significant 74 off 41 balls to take Mumbai to 151 from 77 for six. Left-arm spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel returned two for 20 while Mohammad Sharif, Tapash Kumar Baisya, and Kapali took one wicket apiece for the Warriors. b
