<TEXT>
 Mumbai, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rupee headed back towards record lows as the stock market fell sharply again, but dollar sales by exporters and expectations of Reserve Bank of India intervention kept a check on a steep decline. At 10:40 a.m., the partially convertible rupee was at 50.06/50.07 per dollar, 0.2 percent weaker than Friday's close of 49.950/965. It fell to a record low of 50.15 on Friday. "There may be good amount of export booking today in view of good spot as well as forward premiums on the dollar-rupee," said V. Kumar, chief dealer with State Bank of Travancore. "But there are not much of volumes, may be due to limited staff. Dealings rooms have less than 40 percent attendance," he added. The market is shut on Tuesday for the Diwali festival, and many traders had taken Monday off as well. The central bank was expected to step up dollar sales if the rupee fell too sharply, following up its aggressive intervention last week after the rupee tumbled to record lows, traders said. The BSE Sensex fell more than 7 percent in morning trade with investor confidence shattered after a brutal 11 percent fall on Friday. Foreign funds have so far sold a net $12.3 billion worth of Indian stocks, and the share index has shed more than 60 percent this year. They had bought a record 17.4 billion last year. Asian shares fell on Monday, with Japan's Nikkei hitting its lowest intraday level since 1982, as investors feared fresh moves expected from central banks this week would not be enough to stave off a deep recession. Traders said banks were also buying dollars in the domestic market to sell it offshore and take advantage of the high price differential, which was pressuring the rupee. One-month offshore non-deliverable forward contracts were quoting at 52.44/59, 4.7 percent weaker than the onshore spot rate.
