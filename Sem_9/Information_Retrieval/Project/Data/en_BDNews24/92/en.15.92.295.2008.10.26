 NEW DELHI, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's struggling opener Matthew Hayden is confident his aggressive batting will finally come good in the third test against India starting on Wednesday. Australia went 1-0 down after India defeated them by a record 320 runs in the second test in Mohali. The left-handed batsman has made just 42 runs in four innings, twice failing to score.

"A little bit of rub of the green and I think a big score for Hayden is around the corner." Hayden was a huge success on the 2001 tour, amassing 549 runs and averaging 109.8 although Australia lost the series 2-1. He also hit three test hundreds when India toured in December and January. "If conditions allow, which it does look like another batting track, I hope to play with good intent." Australia, usually braced for spin in India, have been hit by pace and left-armer Zaheer Khan has dominated Hayden. "When a bowler is successful against you, he obviously knows he has got a certain strategy which is working for him," Hayden said. "I believe in my heart that I have also had an extremely successful time against Zaheer
