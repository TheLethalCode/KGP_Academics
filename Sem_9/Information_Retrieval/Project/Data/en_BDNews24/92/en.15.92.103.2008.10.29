 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's booming textile sector, the world's fourth largest, has been hamstrung by a huge skills shortage, and things are to only get worse, says a government official. "Within a span of three years (by 2011), the manpower deficit in the textile sector will reach 80,000," Md Fazlul Haque, a joint-secretary to the textile ministry, said at news briefing at Hotel Sheraton on Tuesday. The media conference, organised by the British Council, Dhaka, was organised two days before the launch of a three-day discussion meeting on the state of vocational and technical education in Bangladesh. The discussion meeting will is to start on Friday. Haque told bdnews24.com that around 4,000 professionals such as engineers and technicians used to get admitted in all textile colleges and institutes every year in the country. "Employers in the textile sector want more efficient professionals, but we cannot meet their need," said Haque. "Employers from the UK have been demanding efficient professionals in the hospitality sector, but we cannot act as per their demands," Khurshed Alam Khan, a joint-secretary to the tourism ministry, said at the press conference. He said the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation trained 12,00 professionals for the hospitality sector every year at its lone institute. "All of them get employed easily. If we could deliver, the employment would be five times what it is now," Khan told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh Technical Education Board chairman Nitai Chandra Sutradhar told journalists that the syllabus and curricula of the technical education in Bangladesh were neither market-oriented nor up-to-date. "The syllabus and curricula of the technical and vocational education need to be up-to-date and need-based so that employers can recruit them as per their demands," said Sutradhar. "Some experts from the UK will attend the discussion meeting to give an idea of the British practices on technical and vocational education," said Raiqah Walie-Khan, the British Council's manager (education and society). She said the employers would also take part in the discussion to share their ideas to make Bangladesh's vocational and technical education timely. bd
