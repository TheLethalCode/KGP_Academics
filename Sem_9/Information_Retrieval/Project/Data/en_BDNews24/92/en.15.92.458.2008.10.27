 Dhaka, October 27 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed on Monday cautioned garment exporters to take extra care in accepting overseas orders until the ongoing global economic crisis is over. "Experts are warning of a negative impact on the country's highest foreign currency earning sector, due to the global economic crisis," the governor said, referring to the garments industry, in a press conference at the central bank headquarters. "It is still uncertain what is coming ahead. But exporters will have to remain very careful. Orders should be taken after extra scrutiny during this time," he said. "Overseas buyers may end up defaulting on large bills," Salehuddin cautioned. "Seeing a worsening global situation ahead, buyers in the US and Europe may want to stockpile goods now by giving large orders," he said. But, the governor warned, they may end up delaying or totally refusing future pay, citing the growing credit and banking crisis. Salehuddin urged all garment exporters to consider these issues during shipment and taking of export orders. To cushion against export shocks, it is also necessary to expand the local market, by increasing production, demand and people's buying capacity, the central bank's ninth governor observed. "Bangladesh's economy is still stable despite the past weeks' economic turmoil. And Bangladesh Bank is continuing to review the global economic condition," he said. "It is true that inflation has crossed double digits, but not too far. Point-to-point inflation stood at 10.01 percent in August," he said. The governor said inflation would come down to a tolerable condition, with the prices of essentials dropping in line with the falling prices of food items and fuel in the international market. He said the central bank was still pressing private banks to further reduce interest rates on bank loans to reduce their rate spread to below five points. To maintain expected GDP growth targets and keep inflation tolerable, the central bank will not change its monetary policy against the backdrop of the world crisis, he said in answer to a query. The bank has no plans at the moment to adjust the value of the taka against the US or any other currency, Salehuddin added. bdnews2
