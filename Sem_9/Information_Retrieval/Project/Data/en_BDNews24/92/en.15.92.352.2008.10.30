 GUWAHATI, India, Thu Oct 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven bomb blasts in quick succession ripped through Guwahati and three other towns on Thursday, killing at least 39 people and wounding 210, police said. No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts. Assam has been a focus of a separatist insurgency for decades, but it has also recently suffered bomb attacks blamed on Islamist militants from neighbouring Bangladesh. Firefighters doused the smouldering remains of cars and motorcycles at one of the blast sites in Guwahati. One of the blasts targeted a high-security zone with a court as well as offices and the homes of senior police officials. Many of the blasts were in crowded markets in the state. Television channels showed some people lying on the streets, their clothes soaked in blood. Some of the walking wounded were helped into ambulances by local people and police. "So far, we have received reports of 39 deaths and 200 people wounded in 11 blasts," a police officer in the main control room told Reuters. A wave of bomb attacks has hit India in recent months, killing more than 125 people. Police have blamed most of those attacks on Muslim militants, although some Hindu militants have also been suspected of carrying out several attacks. Last month, Assam state was also hit by clashes between indigenous tribes and Muslim settlers that killed at least 47 people. G. P. Singh, a senior police officer, said two of the bombs in Guwahati were hidden in motorcycles or scooters. Pakistan, often blamed by New Delhi for fomenting trouble in neighbouring India, condemned the attack and called for international cooperation to tackle strikes by militants. "Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has strongly condemned the bomb blasts," an official statement said. "He deplored the loss of lives. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms." PACKED BUS BURNT Pankaj Goswami, a witness at a blast in Guwahati, said: "The impact of the blast was so huge, a packed bus got half burnt and we pulled out a lot of injured people and sent them to hospital". Local television said a curfew was imposed in Guwahati after angry crowds attacked police and set cars on fire. Police fired in the air to disperse the angry mob. "Immediately after the blast there was complete darkness for a while and I later saw several bodies and severed limbs all around," said Bikash Goyal, a witness in Guwahati. In October, at least two people were killed and 100 injured in four bomb blasts in Assam that police blamed on Muslim militant groups based in neighbouring Bangladesh. But the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), fighting for an independent homeland for the state's more than 26 million people, is often suspected of being behind attacks. Ringed by China, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Bhutan, India's northeast is home to more than 200 tribes and has been racked by separatist revolts since India gained independence from Britain in 1947. Local citizens accuse New Delhi of taking away the region's mineral and forest resources, neglecting development and allowing in a flood of outsiders
