 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong opener Nafis Iqbal struck an unbeaten century in the rain-affected National Cricket League's drawn match against Khulna on the final day Wednesday at Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. National discard opener Javed Omar also shone for Dhaka, but their third round match against league leaders Rajshahi also ended in a draw with the hosts failing to complete their first innings after almost two days and a half were lost due to rains at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Away at Sylhet Cricket Stadium, hosts Sylhet refused to play after visitors Barisal reached 160 for five in reply to Sylhet's first innings total of 163. After the third round, all teams except Sylhet and Barisal have been awarded three points each in line with bylaws as the tournament committee is yet to decide on the Sylhet-Barisal match.
