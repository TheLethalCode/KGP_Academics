<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP and its partners are pressing for the seven-point demands of the four-party alliance to be met before the announcement of the election schedule on Nov 2. "If the government wants the four-party to go to elections, we do not understand why it does not meet our demands," BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain said Sunday, claiming the government had failed to keep its word after its dialogue with BNP. Delwar reiterated the alliance's planned boycott of the general elections unless the participation of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was assured. He said the same went for the former prime minister's rival and counterpart, Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. "Our position is clear -- we will not go for the elections without Khaleda Zia. The government will have to make it clear whether the two leaders will be eligible for participating in the elections," said Delwar, addressing a scheduled rally of the alliance at the National Press Club. The alliance's seven-point demands include unconditional release of the party chief, lifting of emergency and deferment of upazila elections. "We want to participate in the elections. Create a favorable environment by implementing our demands. Do not put any more hindrances in the way of the elections," Delwar said. The BNP leader also announced the BNP-led four-party alliance will hold rallies across the country on Tuesday protesting the 'Paltan killings' in 2006. "The rally will be held to protest the attack on four-party supporters and their deaths at Paltan." Jamaat Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed and Bangladesh Jatiya Party secretary general Shamim Al Mamun, among others, also spoke. bdnews
