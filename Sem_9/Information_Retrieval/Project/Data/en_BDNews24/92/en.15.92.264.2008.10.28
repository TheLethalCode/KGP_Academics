<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Off spinner Jason Krejza is in line to make his debut in the third test against India on Wednesday as Australia are expected to shuffle their bowling attack after a crushing second test defeat in Mohali. Skipper Ricky Ponting said on Tuesday the team would decide whether the 25-year-old Krejza would replace leg spinner Cameron White, or even to play both, only after a final inspection of the spin-friendly Ferozshah Kotla pitch before the toss. Australia are desperate for a reversal of fortunes after India thrashed them by a record 320 runs last week to take a 1-0 lead in the four-test series. Australia paceman Stuart Clark will return in place of Peter Siddle after recovering from an elbow injury, boosting the team at a venue where India, mainly thanks to skipper Anil Kumble, have won seven games in a row since 1993. "It (pitch) is a bit loose on the surface," Ponting told reporters. "Spin is definitely an option for us." White, who made his debut in the series, is under pressure to retain his place after taking just three wickets in two tests. Ponting was confident his players would tackle an in-form India this time while stressing the value of spin bowling. "Jason is more of a sort of attacking, aggressive bowler," he said. "He keeps the ball in the air, does put a lot of revs on the ball. We look at him more as a wicket-taker than a containing type of spinner." HARBHAJAN INJURY Leg spinner Kumble said he had recovered from a shoulder injury which sidelined him in Mohali but was not sure fellow spinner Harbhajan Singh would play due to a toe injury. "I'm 100 percent fit," Kumble said. "Harbhajan is still not sure, we just want to wait and see." One victim short of 300 test wickets, Harbhajan would be assessed before the toss. If he does not play, Amit Mishra is expected to team up with Kumble after taking seven wickets on debut in Mohali. "Bhajji (Harbhajan) still has a little bit of discomfort," Kumble said. "He is a key member of our success so we would like to give him the maximum amount of time to take a call on whether he is 100 percent." Harbhajan hardly trained in the nets for the second day in succession but Kumble said that would not be a selection issue as he urged his players to cash in on their good form and clinch the series in Delhi. The 38-year-old's performance would be vital, having taken 55 wickets in six tests averaging 15.41. He also became only the second bowler in tests to claim all 10 wickets in an innings, against Pakistan in 1999 at the ground. "Going by the record that we have at the Kotla and the kind of cricket we played at Mohali, it certainly gives us a lot of confidence going into this game.
