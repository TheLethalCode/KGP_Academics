 LONDON, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iceland raised interest rates by 6 percentage points to 18 percent on Tuesday, taking the opposite tack to most countries fighting a global financial crisis which the Bank of England said could cost $2.8 trillion. The United States is expected on Wednesday to cut interest rates, with Europe and Britain forecast to follow next week, to try to head off the prospect of a deep recession. Other countries continued to bolster their banking sectors, hit by holding assets linked to bad mortgage debts in the United States, and shore up tumbling stock markets. Japan restricted investor bets on falling share prices to try to end a stock market slide, and delayed a parliamentary election to concentrate on protecting the world's second biggest economy, from recession. Japan's Nikkei climbed 6.4 percent after hitting lows not seen in 26 years, helping European shares gain 2.7 percent. Analysts said Iceland had increased rates, just two weeks after cutting them by 3.5 points, to try to refloat the Icelandic crown, effectively frozen since October 22. "This has come a bit out of the blue following the latest interest rate cut and it reflects a desperate attempt to restore a degree of confidence in the local market," said Elisabeth Gruie, emerging markets strategist at BNP Paribas in London. Some said the surprise move was to meet conditions from the International Monetary Fund for a $2 billion loan, which Iceland has asked for to help resurrect a once-booming economy. Iceland, driven close to bankruptcy by bank failures, wants another $4 billion and is looking to its Nordic partners, Russia, Japan, the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve. "We are basically seeing the IMF program at work. It signals that the objective is to return to a market-based floating exchange rate regime," said Beat Siegenthaler at TD Securities. RATE CUTS ELSEWHERE Governments have agreed to inject around $4 trillion into banks and markets to contain the worst financial crisis in 80 years, which has forced banks out of business and hastened a recession in much of the world. The Bank of England said the work so far in containing the crisis should calm the banking system but was cautious about the impact on the wider economy. It projected losses globally at $2.8 trillion. "The instability of the global financial system in recent weeks has been the most severe in living memory," said Deputy Governor John Gieve. "And with a global economic downturn under way, the financial system remains under strain." The consensus among Fed watchers is for a half-point cut in rates to 1 percent, the lowest level since June 2004. It has already cut the benchmark federal funds rate to 1.5 percent from 5.25 percent over the past 13 months. It will announce its decision on Wednesday. The ECB and Bank of England are expected to cut rates on Thursday next week. The moves would follow a coordinated round of monetary easing from major central banks earlier this month. IMF HELP Iceland is one of several countries to tap the IMF for loans. Ukraine must pass legislation quickly to underpin its deal for $16.5 billion from the IMF, its prime minister and head of the lender said. The Fund is due to finalize a deal with Hungary this week, and Germany said it would help Pakistan, which has just a few weeks to raise billions of dollars in foreign loans needed to meet debt payments and pay for imports, in its negotiations. The Baltic countries are also fearful their economies could follow Iceland into a debt-laden economic meltdown. Further afield, a senior official at South Korea's central bank said he expected a "broad second shock" in financial markets, especially in emerging economies. Byuan Jai-yung, a deputy director at the Bank of Korea's reserve management department, said:" Financial turmoil is spreading into the economy and we will see a broad second shock." He said South Korea and Brazil had faced the first wave. South Korean banks turned to the US Federal Reserve for dollars for the first time to help resolve a dollar funding crisis. COMPANIES SEEK AID Faced with a funding squeeze and a sharp economic downturn across much of the industrialized world, major companies joined banks in the queue for government aid. US automakers General Motors and Chrysler sought government cash for a merger, Russia was in talks with China for export-backed loans for its companies and Kazakhstan pumped $5 billion into its banks. The Japanese banking system, which largely escaped the fallout from US mortgage defaults last year, had invested in the stock market and the three largest lenders are looking to replenish capital lost on the bourse. Tokyo banned naked short selling, bringing the move forward by one week. Naked short selling allows traders to effectively sell stocks they do not own and without borrowing them first in the hope they will profit by buying stocks back at a lower price
