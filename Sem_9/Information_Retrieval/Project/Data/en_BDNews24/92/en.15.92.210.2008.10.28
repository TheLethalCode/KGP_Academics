 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)The hearing of a petition challenging the legality of redrawing parliamentary constituencies continued into the fifth day on Tuesday. Senior advocate Mahmudul Islam, on behalf of the EC, told the bench of justices Mir Hasmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain on Tuesday: "As per law, the boundary of parliamentary constituencies has to be delimited after the census. The Election Commission has carried out the demarcation to fulfil legal bindings." Senior advocate for the petitioner, TH Khan, had argued the previous day that voter lists must be drawn up according to the parliamentary constituencies. But the EC's lawyer claimed the commission had not acted out of line with the law by preparing the voter list before the re-demarcation of the constituencies. Former BNP lawmaker Abdul Mannan filed the petition on Aug 6. On Aug 7, the High Court stayed the effectiveness for three months of a gazette on demarcation of 300 parliamentary constituencies which redrew the boundaries of 133 seats. Two other writ petitions have also been filed challenging the gazette. All three petitions will be disposed simultaneously. bdnews24
