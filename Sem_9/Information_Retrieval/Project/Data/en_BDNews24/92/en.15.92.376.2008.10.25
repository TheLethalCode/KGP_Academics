<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission is taking measures to bar from elections anyone convicted under emergency powers rules, as well as loan and utility bill defaulters, the chief election commissioner said Saturday. "Anyone convicted under emergency powers rules for any term will be ineligible to contest the elections," ATM Shamsul Huda said, adding that the prohibition was written into the EPR itself. "Those convicted under any other law of the country will be ineligible if their sentence is over two years in term," the CEC said, addressing a training session on electoral laws. According to existing laws, anyone convicted to over two years in prison is ineligible to contest elections for a further five years from the date of their release, unless an appeal is pending with the High Court. Appeals are not allowed in EPR cases, though this rule has been challenged in the upper courts. "Loan and utility bill defaulters will also be barred from contesting polls if they do not pay up in time," the CEC said, adding that this bar was included in the new Representation of the People Ordinance 2008. Loan defaulters at any bank or financial institution will be ineligible for elections if they do not repay the outstanding loan or installment at least 15 days before submission of nomination papers, according to the new RPO. Similarly, utility bill defaulters will be ineligible for elections if they do not repay the outstanding telephone, gas, electricity, water, or any other bill of any service providing organisation of the government, at least 15 days before submission of nomination paper. "To avoid hassles and save time in weeding out defaulters during the scrutiny process, lists are being collected ahead of time with the help of Bangladesh Bank and the government's utility service providers," said the EC chief. "These lists will be sent to the returning officers." Addressing the opening session of a two-day training programme on Saturday, the CEC advised the deputy commissioners to discharge their duties as returning officers honestly. "A golden opportunity for holding fair elections is ahead of you, make it count," Huda told them. Presided over by EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir, , at the National Economic Council auditorium in the city, the training session was also attended by election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain. bdnews2
