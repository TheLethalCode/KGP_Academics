<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India skipper Anil Kumble won the toss and elected to bat against Australia in the third test on Wednesday as the home side were forced to make one change from the side that won the second test in Mohali. Leg spinner Kumble returned to the lineup after missing the previous game due to shoulder injury, the captain replacing fellow spin bowler Harbhajan Singh, who failed a late fitness test on a toe injury. India won last week's test by a record 320 runs to go 1-0 up in the four-match series. Australia also made one change, replacing last week's debutant Peter Siddle with fit-again paceman Stuart Clark, who has recovered from an elbow problem. Teams : India - Anil Kumble (captain), Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman, Saurav Ganguly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra Australia - Ricky Ponting (captain), Matthew Hayden, Simon Katich, Mike Hussey, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin, Cameron White, Brett Lee, Michael Johnson, Stuart Clark
