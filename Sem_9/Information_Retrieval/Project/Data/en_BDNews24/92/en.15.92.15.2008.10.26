 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal on Sunday said ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury would have to move the High Court if he wants resume responsibilities as Chittagong mayor. "The Chittagong mayor has been given bail to take better treatment abroad as per the recommendation of the medical board. That is why he has not been given charge. He came out on bail from the High Court, for taking charge he will have to go to the High Court again." He spoke to reporters after a meeting with the newly-formed Local Government Commission chairman and two other members at the local government ministry earlier in the day. Mohiuddin was released on a High Court bail on Oct 6. Councillor Monzur Alam is now the acting mayor of Chittagong City Corporation. Mohiudddin sought for resume his office immediately after hi release on bail. "The High Court gave him bail for treatment in a special situation. After getting released on bail he appealed for taking charge. His appeal has been sent to the law ministry for its opinion. "The law ministry has said he was told to go abroad for treatment; the bail was not given for taking charge. So he cannot be given charge without the decision of the High Court. If he needs to take charge at this moment he will have to go to the High Court." On the preparation for Upazila election, Iqbal said, "This government wants to make the local government bodies stronger and bring out leadership from grassroots level. So initiatives have been taken to hold the elections to Upazila bodies. The past governments did not do this." He said the government has no difference with the political parties over election to other local government entities. They have been repeatedly objecting to holding of upazila election only, he added. "In the face of their objection the move to hold Upazila elections before the general elections has been stalled. Then they said the Upazila elections had to be held after the national elections but they did not say how the two elections would be spaced out. That is why the government has taken initiatives to hold Upazila election after the national elections." The government has announced general elections on Dec. 18, and Upazila elections on Dec. 24 and 28. Asked whether the time gap between the national elections and the Upazila elections would be widened, Iqbal said, "The Election Commission will make a decision on the issue. The government's responsibility is to assist the Election Commission. We are cooperating with them." bdnews2
