<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Gautam Gambhir and Vangipurappu Laxman lashed double hundreds as India declared their first innings at 613 for seven to seize control on the second day of the third test against Australia on Thursday. Gambhir struck 206 for his maiden double century before Laxman reached 200 not out and skipper Anil Kumble declared the innings closed about an hour after tea. Australia were 50 for no loss in 15 overs at stumps with openers Matthew Hayden (16) and Simon Katich (29) together. The 33-year-old Laxman played typically elegant shots to reach his second test double hundred, after his then Indian test record of 281 against Australia in 2001 which sparked a sensational comeback home series win. He struck 21 fours in a near eight-hour knock, having scored his 13th test century, and sixth against Australia, before lunch. He shared in a 278-run fourth-wicket partnership with the left-handed Gambhir, who completed a chanceless double after lunch before being dismissed. Gambhir struck 110 runs in boundaries, faced 380 balls and had batted for more than nine hours before playing a delivery from all rounder Shane Watson on to the stumps. India added 98 quick runs after tea with Kumble (45) and Zaheer Khan (28 not out) also weighing in before the innings was called off once Laxman got to his milestone. Left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson took three wickets and Watson two as Australian bowlers wilted on a good batting pitch. India won the second test by a record 320 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series after the first game was drawn. The final test starts in Nagpur on Nov. 6
