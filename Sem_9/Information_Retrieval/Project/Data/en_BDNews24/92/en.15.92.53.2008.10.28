 KISMAYU, Somalia, Tue Oct 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali Islamists have stoned to death a woman accused of adultery in the first such public killing by the militants for about two years. The 23-year-old woman was executed late on Monday in front of hundreds of people in the southern port of Kismayu, which the Islamist insurgents captured in August, witnesses said. Guards opened fire when a relative ran forward, killing a child, they said. "A woman in green veil and black mask was brought in a car as we waited to watch the merciless action of stoning," one local resident, Abdullahi Aden, told Reuters. "We were told she submitted herself to be punished, yet we could see her screaming as she was forcefully bound, legs and hands. A relative of hers ran towards her, but the Islamists opened fire and killed a child."
