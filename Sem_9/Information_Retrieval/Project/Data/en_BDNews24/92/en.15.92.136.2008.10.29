 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Experts and activists at a roundtable discussion have asked for full implementation of the consumer protection law to curb food contamination. The roundtable on 'Melamine contents in milk', organised by the Daily Ittefaq on Wednesday, stressed good governance to check sale of contaminated foods and beverages. Borhan Ahmed, president of Consumers' Association of Bangladesh, alleged government officials in collaboration with businessmen were on to scuttle the cabinet's move to approve the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). "Nothing happened to those evil businessmen despite media reports against them," he said, adding strong implementation of the CPA is needed to resolve these issues. Professor Moazzem Hossain of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University echoed him and said only a government responsive to people's needs can do the job. In the wake of melamine contents found in infant food items, the seminar focused on the need of breast feeding. Fatema Parveen Chowdhury, director of the Public Health and Nutrition Institute, urged for creating awareness so that powdered milk was not prescribed for infants. "Mothers' milk is more than adequate for the nutrition of a child." She also emphasised the need for certification from the Institute of all brands of food items before those were on sale. The roundtable also heard, among others, from Daily Ittefaq editor Rahat Khan, Dhaka University teacher Nilufar Nahar, FBCCI vice-president Abul Kashem Ahmed. bd
