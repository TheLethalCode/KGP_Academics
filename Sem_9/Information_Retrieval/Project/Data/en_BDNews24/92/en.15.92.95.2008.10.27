<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)The government will relax the state of emergency to allow political parties to campaign for the parliamentary polls, the foreign adviser said Monday. Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said the emergency would be relaxed "in phases", signalling that it might not be lifted wholly as per the demands of parties including Awami League and BNP. "The state of emergency will be lifted in phases. We will make provisions ahead of the election so that the emergency does not stand in the way of holding of polls," Iftekhar told reporters after meeting Commonwealth secretary-general Kamalesh Sharma at the foreign ministry. "In the first phase, the right to congregate will be guaranteed. All barriers to election campaigns will be removed," the adviser said. "Ultimately the state of emergency will be relaxed or removed as necessary depending upon circumstances," he said. The adviser said the government was taking decisions consistent with discussions held with BNP and Awami League. The military-installed interim administration of Fakhruddin Ahmed and the two major political partiesthe BNP and the Awami Leagueare in disagreement over the lifting of the state of emergency. The Awami League and the BNP demand the withdrawal of emergency as precondition to take part in the ninth parliamentary polls. In reverse, the government says it will continue emergency up to the Dec 18 election to ensure public security and hold a fair and credible poll. On meeting with Kamalesh Sharma, the adviser said the Commonwealth would send an assessment team soon with a view to sending election observers for the Dec 18 general elections. bdn
