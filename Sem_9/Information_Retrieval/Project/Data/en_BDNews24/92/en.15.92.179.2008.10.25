<TITLE> Police refuse case against ACC boss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) Police Saturday refused to register complaints by a leading four-party alliance supporter against ACC chief Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, accusing the former army chief of money laundering. Mahmudur Rahman, a corporate executive-turned-government functionary, alleges the former general had laundered over Tk 20 crore. "Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury siphoned Tk 20 crore off to another country, showing losses in foreign exchange transactions while he was chairman of Trust Bank," Rahman told reporters as he awaited a response at Ramna police station. During the 2001-6 Khaleda Zia-led government, Rahman served for some time as Board of Investment chairman before becoming non-executive adviser to the energy ministry, with the rank of state minister, towards the end of the administration. Describing himself as a "conscientious citizen", Rahman arrived at Ramna station around 4.30pm to file the charges. Ramna OC Doulat Akbar sent him to Motijheel police station, saying the complaints fell under their geographical jurisdiction. The Motijheel OC, Fazlur Rahman, told the former BoI chairman that money laundering cases needed clearance from the central bank and that "the place of occurrence" was actually Cantonment police station. "While he was chairman of Trust Bank, Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury held the board meeting in the Cantonment area," the OC said. A bdnews24.com correspondent witnessed Rahman's exchange with the Motijheel OC, before the former energy adviser left the station around 6.30pm. "The present government has reduced the anti-graft drive to a farce," Rahman told reporters afterwards. "The real face of the government has now been exposed. In two years, they have set the country back by 10 years." On police refusal to register his complaint, he said: "The culture of 'instruction from superiors' that we have seen under political administrations is still in practice. Possibly such an instruction forced the OCs not to accept it." He said he would consult his lawyer before going to the Cantonment police station. Mahmudur Rahman, now chairman of Amar Desh Publications which owns daily newspaper Amar Desh, alleged that Trust Bank went into the red after Chowdhury became its ex-officio chairman in 2002. He cited the audit report for 2002 to claim the bank lost nearly Tk 20.30 crore the year Chowdhury took over as chairman. Rahman, who worked for Beximco Group immediately before his BoI appointment, alleged the then army chief misappropriated the money in collusion with other bank executives. bdnews24
