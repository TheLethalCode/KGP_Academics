 MA Taslim Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)The worldwide credit crunch, triggered by the spectacular fall of US banking giants, has brought concerns over high lending by domestic commercial banks into the spotlight. Alarms have also been raised most recently over excessive credit being funnelled into so-called 'unproductive' sectors, including consumer credit. But the emphasis on 'productive' sectors is misplaced; the focus should be on making credit productive . Bank credit swelled by more than 22 per cent over the past year (Aug 07-Aug 08). The total figure hides the fact that public sector banks actually shrunk their credit operations significantly (-7.7 per cent), while private commercial banks raised credit disbursement by a phenomenal 38 per cent. Since private bank deposits increased by only 25 per cent during the same period, the huge increase in credit must mean that private banks have overextended themselves. The loan-deposit ratio of at least some of the banks must have increased beyond what might be regarded prudent. There is an intense competition among the private banks for funds, obviously because there is an excess demand. This has pushed up the deposit interest rate to over 13 per cent; some less reputed financial institutions are even offering rates of 14 per cent. Such a high cost for funds necessarily means that the average loan rate will have to be correspondingly high. This could force many banks to relax their vigil and ignore the adverse selection problems that usually plague the loan market. They may well end up lending too much to risky borrowers, ending up with a toxic portfolio. The major trigger for the financial crisis now sweeping through the western world, in particular the US, was excessive lending to risky or 'sub-prime' (home) borrowers. Populist policies of successive governments encouraged financial institutions to lend to people of modest means who otherwise would not qualify for home loans. A falling interest rate and a booming home market apparently protected the investment of the banks and even allowed borrowers to refinance. The wizards of Wall Street invented financial derivatives that securitised these dubious sub-prime mortgages, selling them with few qualms to financial institutions in exotic new packages. As long as the interest rates were low and home prices were rising everyone was a winner, but once interest rates rose and home prices started falling the whole financial edifice came crashing down. The balance sheets of one financial institution after another went into the red, and some of the most revered names in the world of finance went belly-up. Only a massive bail-out by western governments has averted a complete collapse of the entire global financial system. Bangladesh has been spared the domino effect that swiftly swamped the US and Europe essentially because domestic financial institutions, including the stock market, do not have much exposure to foreign financial assets. This is a consequence of the capital account of the country being non-convertible: domestic residents are not free to buy and sell foreign assets. If the capital account were fully convertible, as the IMF/World Bank have long advocated, many of our financial institutions would have been lured by the promise of quick bucks to hold toxic foreign assets. We would have been exposed to the same financial meltdown as has occurred in western countries, but without their strength for countermeasures. This would have put us at the mercy of the IMF/World Bank system as was the case with several countries during the last Asian crisis. Prudential lending and investment practices in the west would have prevented the current financial crisis from developing or getting out of hand. Failure to do so necessitated the massive bail-out of the financial sector, much of it at the taxpayers' expense. Ordinary people in the West are now paying for the excessive greed of their financial wizards. Since the capacity of our government to take countermeasureson the scale that would be warranted if a full-blown financial crisis were to unfoldis strictly limited, the damage done by such a crisis would be even harsher than in the West. Hence, the government needs to be very vigilant against any signs of similar weakness in our financial system. It should not be allow any unsustainable activity such as risky lending or dubious investment. But what makes it especially difficult to regulate financial institutions is the fact that credit is also the circulating lifeblood of the market economy. Financial institutions must have the autonomy to design credit products to suit the needs of their clients. The central bank has to ensure that sufficient credit at reasonable terms is available for smooth functioning of the economy. In other words, it is the task of the central bank to determine the optimum amount of credit at any given time and adopt measures to ensure that credit flow remains at this optimum level through various market and non-market operations. Very recently alarm has been raised over media reports that excessive credit is being funnelled into 'unproductive' sectors. Since credit growth has been the highest for credit cards, consumer products and real estate, presumably these are 'unproductive' ventures. Credit cards and consumer credit provide funds for consumption, hence it would seem that funding consumption is regarded 'unproductive'. But most consumer credit actually funds the purchase of durable goods, such as air conditioners, refrigerators and so on; these are sometimes regarded as capital investments since these goods provide service over a period of time. More importantly, without credit, many of these goods would not be purchased at all, leading to lower demand for manufacturers of these goods, and production (or imports) having to be scaled down. Reduction in 'unproductive' loans would in fact end up constricting the 'productive' sector. While most people consider manufacturing a 'productive' sector, if banks were to provide credit to, say, refrigerator makers it would get a nod of approval. But without consumer credit, refrigerator manufacturers would suffer a decline in demand, their increased product would lie unsold, and the investment would turn out to be bad or 'unproductive'. Credit should be channelled where it is most productive, ie, adds most to income generation. Since both demand and supply sides are involved in income generation, exclusive focus on the supply side will not give the best results. The emphasis on 'productive' sectors is misplaced; the focus should instead be on making credit productive. Real estate is the major sector for investment in many, including developed, countries. It is often regarded as a leading indicator of the health of the economy. It is also one of the safest forms of investment that the overwhelming majority of people in any country engage in. But excessive investment in real estate can initially cause a bubble in the market, which as it bursts can create a glut in the housing market that imposes uneven costs across the economy as has happened in the USA. Note that this is not peculiar to the housing market, it can happen in any sector. According to some of our business leaders there has been substantial over-investment in such sectors as fish processing and edible oil refining. If so, further investment in these sectors would be as 'unproductive' as that in real estate during a glut. Whether real estate investment is 'unproductive' depends on the structure of the market. If most housing investment is for self-occupation by creditworthy borrowers the investment is by definition 'productive'. However, if much of it is for rental or speculation it is possible for a bubble to develop that will ultimately lead to bust. The influx of black money in the real estate sector worsens the bubble and bust problem since the holders of black money may not be all too keen about the rate of return on their investment. The Asian financial crisis in some countries such as Thailand was spurred in the past by a housing bubble. What is sometimes forgotten is that the crisis in other countries such as Korea was helped by excessive investment not in housing, but sectors such as the high-tech semi-conductor industry, presumably a 'productive' sector! There is little reason to deny individual homebuyers credit if they are creditworthy. In fact, this would be one of the safest investments for the banks if the credit is fully collateralised. The utility of such credit could be higher than for alternatives, if properly assessed. As such there should not be unreasonable restrictions on banks in lending to homebuyers. The current global crisis is a timely reminder of the harm unsustainable populist policies can do not only to the very people whom they are supposed to benefit, but to a country's entire economy and beyond. Policy makers should not jump to populist conclusions without a thorough analysis.
