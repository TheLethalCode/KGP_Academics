<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a stay on the redrawing of parliamentary constituencies, while the High Court on Thursday concluded hearing of petitions challenging the EC's gazette on the demarcations. Appellate Division chamber judge MA Matin fixed Sunday (Nov 2) for hearing of the EC's appeal by a full bench. The High Court bench of justices Mir Hasmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain, meanwhile, fixed the same day for a ruling on the petitions after a seven-day hearing. The High Court stayed the effectiveness of the gazette on demarcation of 300 parliamentary constituencieswhich redrew the boundaries of 133 seatsfor three months on Aug 7. The court also asked the EC and the government to explain why the gazette should not be declared unconstitutional and invalid. The stay order came on a petition filed by former BNP lawmaker Abdul Mannan, one of three filed on Aug 6 challenging the EC's gazette. All three petitions were being heard by the High Court simultaneously. Lawyers for the petitioners have argued that voter lists should be prepared after redrawing parliamentary constituencies, according to law, but the opposite had been done in this case. They also said the EC has no jurisdiction to formulate any law. The upper court therefore has the authority to examine the legality of the EC's gazette. The EC's lawyers maintain the EC redrew the parliamentary constituencies in line with the law, and the gazette was published after dialogue with political parties and public hearings of objections. The Election Commission primarily redrew the boundaries of 133 out of 300 parliamentary constituencies on April 29. The gazette demarcating the boundaries of all 300 parliamentary seats was published on June 10. The EC is hoping to announce the schedule for elections on Nov 2. bdnews24
