 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government will provide VIP security to two former prime ministers - Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina - for three months after announcement of polls schedules. The Special Security Force (SSF) will be in charge of their protection, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a cabinet meeting Sunday. The parties of the two ex-PMs, Awami League and BNP, have been demanding the highest level security for their leaders in the lead up to the elections. The council of advisers, at its weekly meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, decided to declare the two former prime ministers VIPs and provide SSF security for three months from the day after announcement of the election schedule. Munaim said the decision for special security provision was taken under the Special Security Ordinance 1986. The two former prime ministers were also provided with SSF security immediately after the four-party alliance government handed over power to the caretaker government on Oct 28, 2006. But it was withdrawn for both on Feb 22 last year. bdnews24.
