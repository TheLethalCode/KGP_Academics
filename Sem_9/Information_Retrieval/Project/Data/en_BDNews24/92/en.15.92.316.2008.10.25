 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)The government is committed to ensuring the right to information for every citizen, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Saturday as the nation's laws went digital for ease of public access. "Informing people of existing laws is a fundamental responsibility of the state and the government," the CA said at the launch of the 'Laws of Bangladesh' on the law ministry website. A newly published CD of the 'Laws of Bangladesh' was also unveiled at the ceremony at the Sonargaon Hotel. "I believe this will be considered a milestone in social and economic development by disseminating the rule of law," the CA said. The 'Laws of Bangladesh' includes the 38-volume 'Bangladesh Code', of laws dating from 1836-2007, in addition to those formulated since the Code's last publication in 2007. "Unhindered and easy availability of information strengthens transparency and accountability at all levels," Fakhruddin said. "It makes democracy, good governance and access to justice easier." "It helps build a bridge between the government and non-government organisations, and above all between the government and the people." "Realising this, we have formulated and published the 'Right to Information Ordinance 2008' to ensure people's right to information," said the chief adviser of the much-debated law that was gazetted just the previous week. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff presided at Saturday's programme, while law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal also spoke. bdnew
