<TITLE> Bangladesh v NZ test loses third day </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rain has washed out play for the third consecutive day in the second and final test between Bangladesh and New Zealand at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. "Play has been called off for the day as it won't be possible to start the match due to a soggy outfield," a Bangladesh Cricket Board told reporters. Weather permitting, the final two days will start at 9am local time with 30 minute extensions added to the opening sessions to make up some of the time lost to the weather. New Zealand lead the two-match series 1-0 after securing a three-wicket victory in Chittagong last week
