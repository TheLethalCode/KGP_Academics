 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com) - The War Crimes Facts Finding Committee, formed to probe atrocities during the 1971 liberation war, has stated formal objections to the registration of Jamaat-e-Islami as a party. Copies of the statement have been submitted to the Election Commission and personally handed to the chief election commissioner, the committee's convenor Dr MA Hasan told bdnews24.com Monday. The WCFFC in its written statement said that the party had been pursuing politics over a long period illegally and unconstitutionally as a branch of a foreign party and organisation, Dr Hasan told reporters after a meeting with CEC ATM Shamsul Huda. A number of significant leaders of the party were involved in inhuman actions, war crimes and genocide during the liberation war through loyalty to Pakistan, he quoted the statement as saying. These leaders did not confess to their wrongdoings or surrender to the Bangladesh government. Under the circumstances Jamaat-e-Islami could not be registered with the Election Commission, the statement said. "The party has taken a new name and accepted the constitution (of Bangladesh) by changing a few words," Dr Hasan said. "But not a single member of Jamaat has expressed formal loyalty to the constitution. They did not admit that they committed wrongdoing by opposing the liberation war. They did not seek apology," he said. Hasan said the committee would meet again with the Election Commission on Thursday. An election official said registration rules allowed for a hearing from both sides on any objection. "Both Jamaat and anyone raising objection will have their say in separate hearings," said Jesmin Tuli, member of the EC's registration scrutiny panel. "This is the first such objection to any party's registration," she added. Another five objections against Jamaat's registration were submitted with the EC later Monday, by JSD-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League, Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, Sammilito Sanskritik Jote and Bangabandhu Sanskritik Jote and a group of private individuals. Jamaat, an ally of BNP, applied for registration on Oct 20. The EC will publish a notice seeking objections against BNP's registration on Tuesday. Eleven parties, including Awami League, BNP and Jatiya Party, have received the all-clear for registration by the EC, barring objections. bdnews
