 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) - Tax offices countrywide will remain open on Saturday (Nov 1) for individual tax payers to submit returns, while Sunday will be the last day for legalising undisclosed income. Chairman of the National Board of Revenue Mohammad Abdul Mazid told bdnews24.com on Wednesday: "We are not stretching the deadline on undisclosed income. But we are allowing individuals until Nov 2 to declare undisclosed income, as the last date (Oct 31) falls on Friday." "The tax offices will also remain open on Saturday for the convenience of tax payers, as the first day of the extension also falls on the Friday," said Mazid. The tax return deadline was extended on Tuesday by another six days from Oct 31 to Nov 6. The country's top taxman had earlier in the month warned that the deadline would not be extended under any circumstances for those failing to declare undisclosed income by Oct 31. NBR officials would start drive from Nov 1 against those who would miss this opportunity, Mazid said. The annual Sept 30 deadline is normally extended each year; this year the NBR had already stretched it another month to Oct 31. According to the NBR, the number of tax payers holding Tax Identification Numbers stands at 20 lakh. Till Oct 15, only 92,000 TIN-holders had submitted their income tax returns, earning the government Tk 420 crore. Up to Monday the number had risen to 150,000. Last year the government extended the deadline twice up to Nov 30, with 640,000 TIN-holders paying Tk 739 crore for the tax year 2007-08. In 2006-07, 530,000 TIN-holders gave Tk 252 crore. bdnews
