<TITLE> Inter's Mourinho drops Adriano for indiscipline </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan striker Adriano has been left out of the squad for Wednesday's Serie A game at Fiorentina after media reports said he had been sent home for showing up late for training. Coach Jose Mourinho refused to go into details. "I talked to the players that I had to talk to, I talked to the team," the Portuguese told a news conference on Tuesday. "Everything is clear, like always. For this reason I talk only about players in the match squad. I'm not commenting on everything else." Brazilian Adriano had already upset his coach with his tactical indiscipline in Sunday's drab 0-0 draw with Genoa while media reports said he then went to a nightclub until very late. The forward was sent on loan to Sao Paolo by former Inter boss Roberto Mancini last season because of fitness problems and constant newspaper stories about his private life. Striker Julio Cruz will also not go to Florence after he annoyed Mourinho by not doing what he was asked against Genoa. "The relationship between us (me and the squad) doesn't need to be put into question. A relationship does not mean we always have to be kissy kissy," Mourinho added. Young forwards Mario Balotelli and Victor Obinna have been included in the squad despite the former Chelsea coach indirectly criticising them for their displays at the weekend. Champions Inter are joint top with 17 points from eight games but have been inconsistent in Mourinho's first few months in charge
