 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League's Tofail Ahmed has welcomed the Election Commission's assurance that the schedule for national elections will be announced on Nov 2, saying timely polls are now certain. "The decision has removed all the doubts over holding the national elections slated for Dec 18," AL presidium member Tofail told reporters Saturday after a meeting of the 14-party alliance at the party office. The EC had said earlier in the day that it would announce the schedules for both national and upazila polls on Nov 2, but the AL leader made no mention of the latter. The party has been opposed to the upazila polls being held under the tenure of the caretaker government. "We hope the government will press forward for a fair election by implementing the issues we have discussed in the talks," Tofail said. Asked about the agenda of Saturday's alliance meeting, he said: "We discussed how we can keep the alliance united." Tofail was hopeful of creating a larger electoral alliance prior to the Jatiya Sangsad elections. "The greater alliance will be formed with progressive and democratic forces." He showed annoyance when asked whether party chief Sheikh Hasina would be able to participate in the elections. "If someone is barred from participating in the elections by force we have to take it that the government does not want the elections to go ahead," the AL leader said. He added that Hasina faced no legal obstacle in contesting the elections. "Advisers cannot say who are allowed to join the elections and who are not." "Only the constitution can decide it," he said. bdnews
