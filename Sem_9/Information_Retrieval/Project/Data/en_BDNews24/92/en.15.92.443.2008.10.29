 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  As Bangladesh grapples with an acute energy crisis, two international oil companies may soon begin exploration in the Bay of Bengal with the required cabinet clearance looking like a formality. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, who is in charge of the energy ministry, has given the go-ahead to officials to place before the cabinet the proposed PSCs for nine blocks with US-based Conoco-Phillips and Irish-owned Tullow Bangladesh, according to top officials. Conoco-Phillips is due to get eight deep-sea blocks 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21  while Tullow is set to sign a production sharing contract for Block 5. "The chief adviser has instructed us to send the proposals to the cabinet. The ministry has already sent the papers to the Chief Adviser's Office," a senior official with knowledge of the matter told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "The council of advisers is expected to clear the PSCs anytime soon," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the media. Under the terms in the proposed PSCs, the two companies would be allowed to export, subject to Petrobangla's clearance, gas in the form of LNG or liquefied natural gas. In case of an oil find, export will be allowed only "after meeting the domestic demand". Both won in the third round of bidding for oil and gas exploration in Bangladesh. But never before did the energy-starved nation invite bids solely for its offshore blocks. The government called an international bidding on Feb. 15 for 28 offshore blocks, and Petrobangla opened the bid documents on May 7 to complete evaluation of the proposals in three weeks. The "Offshore Bidding" drew responses from just seven international companies. The Houston-based Conoco-Phillips, Australia's Santos International, Longwoods Resources (a US-China joint venture), Korea International Oil Corporation, China National Offshore Oil Corp, known as CNOOC, Comtrack Services and Tullow were the companies that took part. Petrobangla received 22 applications for 15 blocks out of 28 blocks on offer. Reviewing the proposed deals, the cabinet committee on public purchase had earlier asked the ministry concerned to make a decision. In line with the Model Production and Sharing Contract, officials say, the government will sign four-year exploration deal for shallow sea blocks and five-year for deep-sea blocks. The deals might be extended by four more years. After submission of development plans, 25-year agreement will be signed for gas fields and 20-year deal for oil fields. The companies will pay compensation in case any accident takes place due to carelessness and inefficiency. If any company wants sell more 50 percent of its shares, it will have to take permission from the government.
