 KARACHI, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sacked Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson is seeking legal advice over a pay dispute, sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Sunday. PCB director general Salim Altaf said the Australian former test bowler had returned a cheque given to him as full and final payment because he was unhappy with the sum. Lawson was due three months' pay as compensation for the early termination of his contract and Altaf said this obligation had been met. "We will look into it and have it sorted out by our lawyers. Contractual obligations will be fulfilled," Altaf said. Sources in the board told Reuters that Lawson had told the PCB that he was in touch with the Australian high commission for legal advice and that he would not leave Pakistan until the matter was settled. Lawson declined to comment. Lawson's contract was terminated by the Pakistan board on Friday with nine months remaining of his two-year contract. He was appointed coach last year after the death of Bob Woolmer during the World Cup. The PCB has appointed former test player Intikhab Alam as coach for next month's one-day series against West Indies in Abu Dhabi and also offered him a two-year contract that has to first be ratified by the governing bod
