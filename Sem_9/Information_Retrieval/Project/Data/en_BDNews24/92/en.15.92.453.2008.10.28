 GOMA, Congo, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN peacekeepers prepared to evacuate around 50 foreign aid workers from a town in violence-ravaged eastern Congo on Tuesday with Tutsi rebels advancing towards it, officials said. The rebels fought their way along a strategic road towards the town of Rutshuru, around 100 km (60 miles) north of North Kivu's provincial capital Goma, early on Tuesday, drawing within 10 km (6 miles) of Rutshuru. "The convoy is being prepared now, but hasn't left yet," a spokesman for UN humanitarian coordination agency OCHA told Reuters of the evacuation plan. "It will leave today. Normally there are around 50 staff in Rutshuru and surrounding areas." UN-backed Radio Okapi reported clashes around Kibumba, 20 km (12 miles) north of Goma, which saw heavy exchanges of fire on Monday, when rebel forces said they had forced the Congolese army from their positions there. Both Rutshuru and Kibumba shelter tens of thousands of internal refugees displaced by years of fighting in east Congo. An aid worker working with medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) told Reuters that its staff in Rutshuru could hear the explosions from its headquarters at the main hospital early on Tuesday as fighting neared the town. "In Rutshuru, the population is fleeing north. We've heard about an evacuation, but for the moment we have no plans to leave," Axelle de la Motte Saint-Pierre, MSF's deputy head of mission in North Kivu, said. She said MSF's medical team there had treated around 70 people wounded in fighting since the offensive began on Sunday. "TOTAL PANIC" "There is total panic in town. The fighting is now around 5 km (3 miles) from Rutshuru," local administrator Dominique Bofondo said by telephone. Tutsi insurgents loyal to renegade General Laurent Nkunda launched a major offensive on Sunday, advancing to within 20 km (12 miles) of Goma, destroying two UN armoured vehicles and forcing thousands of civilians to flee south towards Goma town. Local people angered by the fighting and the failure of UN peacekeepers to prevent the rebel advance rioted at the UN base in Goma on Monday and one person was killed, a UN spokesman said late on Monday. Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) accuses Congo's army of collaborating with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes Hutu militias and ex-Rwandan soldiers responsible for orchestrating Rwanda's 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Resource watchdog Global Witness says both Congo's army and the FDLR are running tin and gold mines in Congo. Some 80 percent of Congolese tin ore comes from North and South Kivu. Around 100,000 civilians have fled their homes in North Kivu since a January peace deal collapsed in August, swelling the number of Congolese displaced by years of violence. Congo's 1998-2003 war and resulting humanitarian disaster have killed an estimated 5.4 million people, most through hunger and disease
