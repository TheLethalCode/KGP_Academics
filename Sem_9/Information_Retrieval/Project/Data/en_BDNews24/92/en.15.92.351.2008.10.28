<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Urgent steps, including setting up of nuclear power plants, are vital to dealing with the energy crisis, but the World Bank, IMF and ADB must have a lesser role in the business, speakers at a seminar said Tuesday. They said coal could be a source, but development of Fulbari mine would not be possible engaging Asia Energy. BIDS research director Dr M Asaduzzaman in his keynote paper at the CPD-hosted dialogue, titled "Energy for Development: Options and Strategies for Bangladesh", said the focus always fell on the cities. When it came to energy and power crisis, Dr Asaduzzaman said, the urban areas received all the attention while the rural Bangladesh remained ignored. He spoke of silent energy crisis facing the villages. Speaking as chief guest, CA's special aide for energy, Prof M Tamim stressed steps such as nuclear plants and immediate exploration of off-shore oil and gas. "We have several options. One of them is importing gas from Myanmar. Myanmar is selling 1,000 cubic feet of gas for $9 to China. One must keep this mind when talking about the crisis." "Bapex gets highest priority from us and will get Tk 3000 crore. Not a single proposal from Bapex has ever been returned," Tamim told the dialogue, moderated by CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan. Tamim said the government spent Tk 1400 crore in subsidy in the three months to September this year. Power secretary M Fauzul Kabir Khan said policies were being reformed to promote private participation in electricity generation. This year, 372 megawatts of electricity has been added to the national grid, Khan said. Renovated plants are now giving an extra 490 MW, he said, while deals have been signed for 1070 MW. "But gas supply is a problem," the power secretary said. Energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin said gas production failed to match demand. "W are exploring new gas. But we have to think of alternatives. "Coal can be one of the alternatives. The government is trying to finalise the coal policy." FBCCI president Annisul Huq said businesses suffered to the extent that even after importing equipment factories could not go into operation due to lack of gas and power. Bangladesh's ambassador in Geneva Debapriya Bhattacharya said nuclear power plants could solve the problem. He said 17 per cent power comes from nuclear energy and there were as many as 440 plants in 30 countries in operation globally. Held at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, FBCCI co-sponsored the dialogue.
