 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is entering into a "critical stage", with the legal wrangle over re-demarcation of parliamentary constituencies still unresolved, said the chief election commissioner on Wednesday. ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters the commission was not prepared to say more, until it was "ready." "Let November 2nd come," he said, but did not comment further. The CEC said at the start of the week that the commisison would announce the schedule of the parliamentary and upazila elections on Nov 2. Asked whether the date of annuncement might be deferred if the re-demarcation issue remains unsettled, election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hussain also refused to comment, as "the issue was under trial". The hearing of petitions challenging the legality of redrawing parliamentary constituencies continued into the sixth day on Wednesday. Three writ petitions were filed on Aug 6 challenging the gazette on redemarcation by the EC. On Aug 7, the High Court stayed the effectiveness of the gazette for three months. All three petitions are being disposed simultaneously. Barrister Abdur Razzaq, lawyer of petitioner Arifur Rahman Sohel, told a High Court bench Wednesday that the EC has no jurisdiction to formulate any law. The upper court therefore has the authority to examine the legality of the EC's gazette on demarcation of 300 parliamentary constituencies which redrew the boundaries of 133 seats, the lawyer argued. Echoing the previous days' arguments by a lawyer of another petitioner, Razzak said voter lists should be prepared after redrawing parliamentary constituencies, according to law, but the opposite had been done in this case. On behalf of the EC, lawyer Shahdin Malik replied: "The EC redrew the parliamentary constituencies in line with the law." "The gazette was published after the hearing of objections in this regard," he said. bdnews24.com/
