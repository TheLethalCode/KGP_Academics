 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)A devastating onslaught from Kiwi skipper Daniel Vettori claimed three Bangladeshi wickets in a single over, at the close of the fourth-day of the second and final Test in Dhaka, after New Zealand declared a quick-fire 262 for six in the first innings. Play finally got underway on Tuesday at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium after three days of rain, but there were still plenty of thrills in store it seemed as Bangladesh were struggling at 13 for three in the first innings at stumps. Tamim Iqbal (eight) along with Mehrab Hossain Junior (nought) will resume play Wednesday for the fifth and final day, with Bangladesh trailing by 249 runs in the first innings. On-form left-arm spinner Vettori replaced paceman Iain O'Brien to enter the attack after the ninth over. He immediately made his presence felt, striking in his first, third and last delivery to leave Bangladesh reeling at 13 for three in 10 overs. Left-handed opener Junaed Siddique went down the wicket to play Vettori, but misjudged the line and was stumped by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. TV replays showed that McCullum broke Siddique's stumps in his second attempt, as the Bangladesh opener looked reluctant to return to popping crease after missing the line. One ball later, one-down Mohammad Ashraful got struck in front, and umpire Asoka de Silva did not hesitate to raise his finger. New batsman Rajin Saleh followed Ashraful, being trapped leg before in the last delivery from Vettori. He saw his one-over spell 1-1-0-3, with only one probing over from the left-arm spinner as bad light forced an end to play with 2.2 overs to go. Earlier, the Bangladeshi pacers exploited the early moisture to rattle the New Zealand top-order, although Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum managed to deny them with their stroke-filled play. Pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza justified captain Ashraful's decision to make him bowl first, after a delayed first session start due to wet outfield, trapping Aaron Redmond (2) in front in the day's third over. Debutant pacer Mahbubul Alam followed his strike partner, bowling Jamie How (8) out in his second over. Afterwards, paceman Shahadat Hossain uprooted Ross Taylor's stumps for 19, and New Zealand were reduced to 49 for three inside 13 overs. Ryder and McCullum, however, recovered from their shaky start, adding 137 runs for the fourth wicket. Ryder was just nine runs short of his maiden Test hundred when he was dismissed by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak for an attacking 91 off 140 balls, studded with 12 fours. McCullum, looking slow initially, struck eight fours and one six in his 122-ball 66 knock before the wicketkeeper was caught by Mohammad Ashraful off Shakib Al Hasan, who was earlier unlucky not to claim McCullum twice. Later, Vettori struck two fours and one six to make 22, while Daniel Flynn remained unbeaten on 35 as New Zealand crossed the 250-run mark and declared the innings at drinks in the final session. Mashrafee, Mahbubul, Shahdat, Shakib, Razzak and Ashraful took one wicket apiece. The first three days play were washed out due to incessant rain and the toss was delayed for an hour on the fourth day in view of the soggy outfield. However, conditions rapidly improved, with the forecast remaining hopeful. bdne
