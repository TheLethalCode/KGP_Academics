 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League has finalised a draft of the candidate nomination process for the next Jatiya Sangsad election, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said Sunday. "The Representation of the People Ordinance (RPO) has stipulated nomination from grassroots level. We have brought changes to the party constitution accordingly," Ashraful told reporters after an emergency meeting of the presidium at the acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home in the evening. "We have more or less decided on the process of candidate nomination. After approval by the central working committee it will be sent to the party units throughout the country," he said. Members of the ward, union, upazila and district committees of the party in every parliamentary constituency will name five candidates for the seat, he said. "These committees through an extended meeting will finalise one from the list." Once the election schedule is announced, the party will distribute nomination forms, priced at Tk 5,000 each, from its central office. Asked how they would conduct the candidate nomination process if the state of emergency continues after the declaration of the schedule, Syed Ashraf said, "We would just say: we'll defy the state of emergency to establish democracy." He said he was confident that the Awami League would form the next government. "Sheikh Hasina will participate in the election in accordance with the law. There is no confusion about her participation. "We will fight the election under her leadership, win the polls and form the government. There is no doubt about it." Acting party chief Zillur Rahman chaired the meeting, attended by Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. bdnews2
