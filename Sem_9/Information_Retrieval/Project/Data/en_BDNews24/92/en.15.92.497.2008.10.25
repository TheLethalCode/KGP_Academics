<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) The Dhaka University Deans Committee has decided to review disputed admissions criteria with concerned departments to see if the new rules can be relaxed. The deans sat Saturday in the wake of demands from madrasa students and recent pressure from White Panel teachers backing the BNP-Jamaat alliance. Vice chancellor professor SMA Faiz told reporters after the meeting that two deans, of arts and social sciences faculties, would discuss the matter with admissions committees for Kha and Gha units. Several departments have introduced rules that bar students from seeking admission who failed to study English and Bangla for 100 + 100 mark exams at HSC or equivalent level. The rules affect madrasa students, who argue the new criteria were discriminatory. Pro-Awami League Blue Panel teachers Saturday disagreed. "If they want, they can modernise their education system and fulfil the new admission criteria," Prof Harun or Rashid, dean of social sciences and convenor of the Blue Panel, told a press conference before the meeting. Pro-BNP teachers' union leader Sadrul Amin had his own argument: "We are firm on our demandthe new conditions have to be revoked. Everyone should have the right to study at Dhaka University. We want to protect that right," he told reporters after the deans' meeting, which he attended as dean of arts. Asked if a decision would be imposed on the departments seeking to introduce the new rules, he said: "This is not a matter of imposing anything on anyone ... the departments will be asked to withdraw those conditions. Everything will be settled through discussions." But he evaded a direct reply when asked: Why the threat to boycott examinations and to whom it was directed. "Maybe the matter won't go that far, and the announcement was no final word." Last Saturday, a group of madrasa students vandalised the offices of the Dhaka University VC, to protest "illogical" admission rules, making the incident the sole agenda of a scheduled syndicate meeting later on the day. The students under the banners of 'Committee for protection of madrasa students' rights' and 'Bangladesh madrasa students movement council' marched thorough the DU campus and vandalised furniture, windows and property inside and outside the VC's room. This year, linguistics and women and gender studies introduced the new condition. Bangla, English, journalism and mass communication departments had already enforced the 200-mark requirement. The addition of two more departments angered students of madrasa origin. The public administration, international relations and economics departments had also decided to bar such students this year but later relented. "We have this rule to ensure admission of qualified students who have a high degree of literacy in English and Bangla," according to linguistics chairperson Dr Firoza Yasmin. bdne
