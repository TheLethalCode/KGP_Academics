 SRINAGAR, Mon Oct 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities deployed thousands of troops across Kashmir on Monday to prevent demonstrations planned to mark the 61st anniversary of New Delhi's rule over the region. In Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, troops patrolled deserted streets, erected barricades and blocked roads leading to the offices of U.N. Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). UNMOGIP, one of the oldest UN missions, monitors a 1949 ceasefire line dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference alliance, was placed under house arrest to prevent him from leading a march to the UN office. "Oct. 27 is the blackest day in the history of Kashmir," Farooq said referring to the day in 1947 when Indian troops arrived to take control of the region, just over two months after India and Pakistan won independence from Britain. On Oct. 26, 1947, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir said his Muslim-majority kingdom would accede to India and not join newly created Islamic Pakistan. Kashmir has since been claimed by both India and Pakistan, and roiled with violence, involving Indian troops and Muslim militants. So far 43,000 people have been killed, officials say, but human rights groups put the toll at 60,000. On Monday, shops, businesses and schools remained closed in much of Kashmir. The Indian army marks the event as "Martyrs' Day" and senior army officers lay wreaths at a memorial for soldiers at the heavily guarded military headquarters in Srinagar and elsewhere in army camps in the mountainous region. Violence has declined significantly after India and Pakistan, who have fought wars over Kashmir, began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. But people are still killed in almost daily shootouts. Indian soldiers shot dead five members of Kashmir's biggest militant group, Hizbul Mujahideen, in an overnight gun battle in south Kashmir, police said
