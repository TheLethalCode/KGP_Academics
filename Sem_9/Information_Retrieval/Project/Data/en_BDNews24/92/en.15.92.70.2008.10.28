 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com) - The tax return deadline for individuals has been extended by another five working days. "We have extended the deadline from Oct 31 to Nov 6 as the returns are not up to expectations," Chairman of the National Board of Revenue Mohammad Abdul Mazid told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The annual Sept 30 deadline is normally extended each year; this year the NBR had already stretched it another month to Oct 31. Asked why returns were below expectations, Mazid had told bdnews24.com: "It has become a part of our culture to rush at the eleventh hour. It's the same case with income tax returns." He said a longer extension was unlikely: "The press has reported that the deadline might be lengthened by up to a month. The NBR would like to clearly state that in no circumstances will it be extended by another month." "It is being extended by only a few days on special consideration." He also pointed out that income tax laws allow an individual some days over the official deadline, by appealing to the officials of the tax zone concerned, if they can give a specific reason for not being able to submit their return within the stipulated time. He stressed, however, that the tax payer must show "valid cause." According to the NBR, the number of tax payers holding Tax Identification Numbers stands at 20 lakh. Till Oct 15, only 92,000 TIN-holders had submitted their income tax returns, earning the government Tk 420 crore. Up to Monday the number had risen to 150,000. Last year the government extended the deadline twice up to Nov 30, with 640,000 TIN-holders paying Tk 739 crore for the tax year 2007-08. In 2006-07, 530,000 TIN-holders gave Tk 252 crore. bdnews
