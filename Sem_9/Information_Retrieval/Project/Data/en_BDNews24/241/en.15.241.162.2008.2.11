 Canbera, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timorese rebel leader Alfredo Reinado was killed in a shoot-out at the Dili residence of President Jose Ramos-Horta early on Monday morning, a presidential adviser said. Rebel soldiers attacked Ramos-Horta's isolated house at about 4.30 a.m., wounding the president in the stomach. Here are five facts on Alfredo Reinado, who went from refugee to military police chief to renegade leader during his four decades of involvement in East Timorese politics. Forced to work as a porter after Indonesian forces annexed the country in 1975, Reinado fled to Australia in a fishing boat in the 1990s. He left his wife Maria and young family in Australia to return to East Timor around 1998, ahead of democratic elections in 2001. Transferred to the army from the navy, he rose to the rank of Major in the military police force, returning to Australia several times to see family and undergo stints of military training. In May 2006, Reinado led a revolt against the government after its controversial dismissal of 600 soldiers. He was charged with murder after the ensuing factional violence killed 37 people and drove more than 100,000 from their homes. Reinado and 50 other inmates walked out of a Dili prison in Aug. 2006, embarrassing security forces. Going on the run with a group of armed followers, he made several public appearances, and met the army chief in Dec. 2006, and President Ramos-Horta in Aug. 2007. Security forces made no attempt to arrest him during these meetings. Defiant to the end, Reinado said he would turn himself in only once the former ruling party, Fretilin, left office, and hundreds of foreign troops deployed after the 2006 violence departed. In Feb. 2008, officials said that rebels led by Reinado fired on Australian troops patrolling Dili. His continuing stand-off with the government had raised fears of more violence. Source: Reuters
