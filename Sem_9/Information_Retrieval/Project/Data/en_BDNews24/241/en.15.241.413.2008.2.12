 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - Unauthorised recruitment and promotion in public universities is eroding funds allocated for academic activities, according to the University Grants Commission. The university regulatory body made the allegations in its 33rd annual report, recently submitted to the president. UGC chairman Prof Md Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com that: "The number of teachers, officials and employees is high relative to the standard of many public universities." Islam found some universities needed more teachers. "But the number of officials and employees in most of the universities is much higher than they need." According to the UGC report, the number of teachers and employees in some public universities is far greater than the number of authorised posts. The commission said direct academic functions were being drained of money in the universities due to unauthorised recruitment and promotion. Most of the money allocated for the universities go to salaries and other benefits. In 2005-06, 69 percent of the total allocation went for the purpose, the report said. The watchdog body identified creation of new posts by the universities themselves, awarding promotion, upgradation and selection as the reasons behind the rise in expenses. Prof Islam said concerned universities had been warned of the matter. "We asked them to strike a balance and to recruit qualified teachers for the vacant posts." The UGC chief said there should be one teacher to 15 students in the technical universities and a one to 20 ratio in general universities. According to the UGC report, there is one teacher for every two students and a ratio of two employees to one student at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agriculture University has one teacher for every six students and one employee for every two students. Bangladesh Agriculture University has one teacher for eight students and one employee to every two students. The commission's report recommended placing controls on such over-recruitment and an end to launching new departments without approval, adding that abuse of autonomy in the public universities must be stopped. bdnews
