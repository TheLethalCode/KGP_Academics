 Addis Ababa, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopia has agreed to temporarily host a UN peacekeeping force acting as a buffer with Eritrea after Asmara cut off fuel supplies to the force, the foreign ministry said on Monday. However, it said the UN force being relocated to Ethiopia would not be operational, but would have administrative status. The UN Security Council renewed on Jan. 30 the mandate of the struggling UN mission (UNMEE) on the border for six months, but it was unclear how long the troops could stay put because of a fuel cut-off by Asmara. Eritrea has said the peacekeepers' presence along the border was tantamount to occupation, and ignored last week's UN deadline to grant the troops access to badly needed fuel. "Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has assured UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that his country would cooperate with the UN in addressing the latest challenge to UNMEE, including temporary relocation in Ethiopia," Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement. "However, UNMEE forces being relocated in Ethiopia for a short time would not be operational, but only have an administrative status," it added. "UNMEE's area of operation remains the Temporary Security Zone, a 25 km (15.5 miles) buffer zone inside Eritrea." The 1,700-strong UN mission started work in 2000, at the end of a two-year war between the two Horn of Africa neighbours that killed an estimated 70,000 people. Despite a peace deal that ended the 1998-2000 war, Ethiopia and Eritrea remain deadlocked over their 1,000 km (620-mile) border. A UN official has said UN soldiers were reluctant to leave because they feared it could spark conflict. An independent commission charged with marking the frontier awarded the town of Badme to Eritrea in 2002, but Ethiopia has refused to implement the ruling before more talks. In November, the commission marked the boundary by map coordinates in a ruling Asmara accepted, but Addis Ababa rejected. Eritrea has long accused the international community with siding with its much larger neighbour. The two countries insist they will not start war, but both have moved tens of thousands of troops to the border
