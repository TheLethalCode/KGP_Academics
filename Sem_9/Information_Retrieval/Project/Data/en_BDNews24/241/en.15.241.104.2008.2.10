 Washington, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush said on Sunday he would sign on Wednesday a $152 billion package aimed at boosting the US economy and ward off a recession. "I will be signing this bill Wednesday," Bush said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. When asked whether he would consider further action if the economy continued to sputter, Bush said: "We just have to play it by ear." After a brief spat over the size of the package, the Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday agreed to a measure that would provide one-time rebates of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for couples plus $300 for each child. Low-income people, including retirees on Social Security and disabled veterans who pay no income taxes, would receive checks of $300. The checks could be in the mail within months
