 Baghdad, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US forces said they had detained 25 suspected Shia militiamen during raids in Baghdad on Monday in the latest operation against groups it says are defying a ceasefire by Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army. The US military has been aggressively targeting what it calls rogue elements of the cleric's militia who are ignoring the six-month freeze in attacks Sadr announced last August. The clampdown has provoked anger amongst some members of the Mehdi Army who have called for the ceasefire not to be renewed later this month, a move analysts say would seriously jeopardise recent security gains. The US military said troops had detained 25 militiamen in an area near Sadr City, the sprawling Shi'ite slum in northeast Baghdad and one of Sadr's power bases. "We knew exactly who we wanted to pick up," Lieutenant-Colonel Steve Stover, a spokesman for US forces in Baghdad, said in a statement. The raids have angered local residents, who accuse US troops of being indiscriminately heavy handed. Reuters pictures at the scene of the raids showed furniture strewn from houses, blood on the ground and women and children crying. "I appeal to the government and especially the Americans to stop the search operations. Everyday they are invading our houses and taking our innocent young people," Hussein Zaidan, who lives in the area, said. Attacks in Iraq are down by 60 percent since last June on the back of a boost of 30,000 extra US troops, a decision by Sunni Arab tribal leaders to turn against al Qaeda and the ceasefire ordered by Sadr last year. The Pentagon used to describe the Mehdi Army as the greatest threat to peace in Iraq, a term it now reserves for Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. However, last week a respected think-tank said US forces should not provoke the militia group into the sort of widespread violence that took Iraq to the brink of civil war. The International Crisis Group (ICG) said the Mehdi Army, which has tens of thousands of fighters, was "unassailable" in Baghdad strongholds and it would be "fanciful" to imagine its defeat. Last week, Sadr issued an order to his militia to maintain the ceasefire, amid rumours it was about to come to an end. However many members of the Mehdi Army have voiced discontent, saying US troops and Iraqi security forces have taken advantage of the ceasefire to target them
