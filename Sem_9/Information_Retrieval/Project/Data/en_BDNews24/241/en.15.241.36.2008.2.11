 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The process of voter registration has been completed in the Dhaka City Corporation area, an official said Monday. "The timeframe fixed by the EC to register voters in DCC is over. Most voters have now been registered," deputy election officer for Dhaka division Biswas Latifur Rahman told bdnews24.com. Rahman said that 13 information booths will be open at as many police stations in the DCC area until Feb 29 to assist people who had not yet registered. "Anyone who again fails to register can contact the central server room at Mohanagar Natyamancha, in line with the EC's plan," the official officer said.
