 Rangamati, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  A BRAC employee who was abducted at gunpoint five days ago from a remote area in Rangamati was released Sunday night, officials said. Hemanta Kanti Chakma was taken to BRAC's Rangamati office Monday morning. BRAC officials later took him to Khagra Zone Sadar where Hemanta gave army personnel an account of his abduction. Hemanta, an education manager at BRAC's Kaukhali office, was kidnapped on Feb 6 while returning home from a tour of the NGO's schools in Kutubchhari. Following the abduction, army personnel stationed at Khagra in Kaukhali mounted an operation to locate Hemanta, cordoning off Panchhari, Chelachhara and Labourpara. The gang demanded a ransom of Tk 3 lakh for his release, family members said. There have been conflicting reports as to whether a ransom was paid. Hemanta told reporters at the Khagra Zone Sadar Monday that his family and authorities had initially kept news of his abduction quiet so as not to jeopardise his safety. bdnews24.co
