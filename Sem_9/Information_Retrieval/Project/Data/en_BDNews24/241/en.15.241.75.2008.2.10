 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)Stocks ended down Sunday amid moves by investors to lock in profits, despite the SEC's withdrawal of restrictions on margin loans. The Securities and Exchange Commission's decision became effective on Sunday releasing funds that were expected to heat up the market. However, DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed said, the merchant banks were being cautious about supplying margin loans, which led to lower than expected buying in the market. Market analysts also said the increase in turnover seen Sunday on the Dhaka Stock Exchange indicated "mature profit taking behaviour by investors". "As far as we know, the merchant banks are taking a cautious stance on giving loans. I heard those who were giving loans today were offering them at lower ratios than one to one," Salahuddin said. The DSE chief lauded the merchant banks for their vigilance: "This was a very responsible posture for the merchant banks to take."
