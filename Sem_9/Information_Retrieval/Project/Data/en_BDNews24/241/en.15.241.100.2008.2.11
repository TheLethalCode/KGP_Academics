 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - The National Sports Council (NSC) plans to organise the Independence Cup Football tournament in March to mark the Independence Day. "We are planning to hold the Independence Cup Football in March with the participation of top Dhaka clubs," said NSC secretary M Akbar Hossain Monday. Asked whether the fixture clashes with the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF)'s Independence Cup tournament, Hossain said, "We will discuss the matter with the BFF as well as the Liberation War Affairs Ministry before finalising the schedule." "If the BFF organises the tournament, we will look forward to reinstating the International Friendship Cup Football that was supposed to be held in December last," added Hossain. When attention was drawn to the NSC tournament, BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu said, "To organise the Independence Cup Football is the duty of the federation, which is maintaining correspondence with the sponsor, Liberation War Affairs Ministry." "The federation has already included the Independence Cup fixture of its yearly calendar following the request of the Liberation War Affairs Ministry," Malu said, "We had organised the Independence Cup in 2006 with the assistance of the Ministry." The BFF apparently remains inactive since the completion of the first-ever professional football league in 2007, and outside the federation Mohammedan Sporting Club organised the Victory Day Football Tournament that concluded Sunday last.
