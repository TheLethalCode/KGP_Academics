 DILI, Feb 12 (news24.com/Reuters) - Australian troops began arriving in East Timor on Tuesday to begin enforcing a two-day state of emergency declared after a double assassination attempt that left its president in hospital with triple gunshot wounds. "The C-130 aircraft are arriving by the hour. The troops will bolster forces already there," said a spokesman for Australian Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon. An Australian warship also arrived off the Dili coast on Tuesday to support the first of 200 fast reaction troops sent to reinforce international security forces as doctors said President Jose Ramos-Horta would remain on life support until next week. In the capital Dili, East Timor's interim president Vicente Guterres declared a state of emergency and appealed for calm, after apparently coordinated attacks against the president and prime minister threw the young nation into a fresh crisis. Guterres said meetings and protests were banned, and all citizens must stay home between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Around 1,600 UN police, backed by around 1,000 Australian soldiers, were patrolling Dili and other cities amid fears of fresh violence by rebel soldiers, whose leader Alfredo Reinado was killed in the surprise pre-dawn assault. "The government of East Timor is in firm control," said Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, ahead of a visit to the troubled nation later this week. MORE SURGERY Schools, businesses and government institutions were open in Dili, as local police stopped and checked cars, but the calm appeared uneasy and local people admitted they were nervous. "I am going back home early because I'm afraid of gang fighting or protests," Antonio Gomes, a high school student, told Reuters as he headed home. In the Australian city of Darwin, where Ramos-Horta was airlifted after being shot in the chest, back and stomach, doctors were planning more surgery for up to three gunshot wounds, a senior doctor said. "We'll have to go back to theatre, probably in the next 24 to 36 hours for some staged surgery, but at this stage we're looking at quite stable," Len Notaras, general manager of Royal Darwin Hospital, told Australian radio. "He will be in an induced coma until at least Thursday, intensive care until Sunday or Monday of next week," he said. Notaras said doctors performed three hours of surgery, including reconstruction of Ramos-Horta's right lung, removing shell and bullet fragments. One fragment remained in his body. Ramos-Horta, 58, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for waging a nonviolent struggle for independence, was shot at his home early on Monday by renegade soldiers. His bodyguard was injured and two rebel soldiers died in the shoot-out, which the East Timorese government said was a coup attempt. One of the dead men was identified as rebel soldier leader Major Alfredo Reinado. Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao escaped a similar attack that left his car riddled with bullets. US President George W. Bush condemned the assassination attempts. "Those who are responsible must know that they cannot derail democracy in Timor-Leste," Bush said in a statement. 20 REBELS Australia's Foreign Minister Stephen Smith, who was meeting his East Timor counterpart Zacarias da Costa in Darwin on Tuesday, has said that up to 20 rebels were involved in the assassination attacks, divided into two groups of 10. Asia's youngest nation has been unable to achieve stability since hard-won independence. The army tore apart along regional lines in 2006, triggering factional violence that killed 37 people and drove 150,000 from their homes. Foreign troops were needed to restore order. Reinado had led a revolt against the government and was charged with murder during the 2006 factional violence. But Ramos-Horta had met Reinado as for talks as recently as January in an attempt to reach a deal with rebel forces in which they would give arms in return for talks on outstanding grievances and legal issues. The former Portuguese colony of almost 1 million people gained full independence in 2002 after a UN-sponsored vote in 1999, marred by violence, ended more than two decades of brutal Indonesian occupation. The predominantly Roman Catholic country, though one of Asia's poorest nations, straddles key shipping lanes, is strategically important for neighbours Australia and Indonesia, and has potentially lucrative oil and gas reserves.
