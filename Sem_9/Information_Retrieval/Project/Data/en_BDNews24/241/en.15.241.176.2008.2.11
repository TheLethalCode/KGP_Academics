<TITLE> US presence in Iraq is destabilising: Mubarak </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cairo, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Monday the presence of US and other foreign forces in Iraq was attracting terrorists and threatening security and stability in the region, state news agency MENA reported. Mubarak, who has previously said US forces should stay in Iraq to prevent a descent into anarchy, was speaking to Egyptian editors on his plane to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. "President Mubarak warned against the continuation of the American presence in Iraq," the agency said. "He said that the presence of US and foreign forces in Iraq would lead to pulling in terrorists from everywhere and threatening security and stability in the area," it added. The agency gave no direct quotes and no extra details. It did not say explicitly that Mubarak favoured a US withdrawal and Mubarak's spokesman was not available to elaborate. The Egyptian government opposed the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. But once the United States had overthrown President Saddam Hussein, it said US troops should stay to restore law and order. Egypt supported the US decision to send more troops to the Baghdad area last year, saying it hoped the plan, known as the surge, would strengthen the position of the Iraqi government
