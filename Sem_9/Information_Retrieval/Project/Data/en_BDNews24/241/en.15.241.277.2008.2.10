<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday stayed the Anticorruption Commission's wealth statement notices on Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco and Awami League presidium member Qazi Zafarullah. The court also ordered the ACC and the government to show why the notices on should not be declared illegal. The home secretary and the ACC chairman have been ordered to provide a justification for sending the notices within six weeks. A High Court bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam gave the order following two separate petitions from Zafarullah and Coco. ACC deputy director Mobara Khanam issued Zafarullah's wealth statement notice on Jan 28; the AL leader was given a week to submit his statement. Zafarullah appealed to the ACC on Jan 30 for an extension to the deadline, which was granted on Feb 6. At the hearing, the AL leader's council barrister Shafiq Ahmed said the ACC's wealth statement demand had not complied with due legal process. Mobara Khanam issued a wealth statement notice to Arafat Rahman Coco on Dec 28 last year. Joint forces arrested Coco on Sept , 2007. bdnews24.
