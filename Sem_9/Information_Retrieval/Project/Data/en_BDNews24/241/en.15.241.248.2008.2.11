<TITLE> Putin-Medvedev tandem gives stability to Russia: Ivanov </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A political tandem of President Vladimir Putin and his preferred successor Dmitry Medvedev can ensure a smooth democratic development of Russia after the March 2 presidential election, Putin's close ally said on Sunday. Law bars Putin from seeking a third term. But the Kremlin leader, who wants to maintain political influence after quitting, has agreed to consider becoming a prime minister after the likely victory of his anointed successor, Medvedev. "After all, if this scenario -- president Medvedev and prime minister Putin -- is realised, Russia will continue a stable democratic and evolutionary development," Russian news agencies quoted First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov as saying. "The country will go ahead calmly and in a civilised way, without twists and turns," he added speaking at an international security conference in the German city of Munich. Analysts believe that Ivanov -- a member of a more conservative Kremlin clan competing with the one to which Medvedev belongs -- competed to be picked by Putin as his preferred successor. But in Munich he praised Medvedev in a demonstration of loyalty to Putin's choice. "I have not a slightest doubt about (Medvedev's) professional and human qualities," Ivanov said. "I know that this man has the highest level of culture and intellect." Putin is Russia's most popular politician after presiding over years of economic boom. His outright support for Medvedev, also a first deputy prime minister, has ensured the victory for his ally. Over 60 percent of voters are ready to back Medvedev. Medvedev, viewed as a member of a more liberal part of Putin's entourage, has already pledged to carry on his mentor's course to give Russia "decades of political stability".
