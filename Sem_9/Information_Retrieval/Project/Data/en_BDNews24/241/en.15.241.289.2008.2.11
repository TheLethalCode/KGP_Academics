<TITLE> Credit concerns drag on European shares </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday, led by financials as another widening in credit spreads and a grim outlook from the Group of Seven rekindled worry over the impact of credit market turmoil on the global economy. Banks and insurers were the biggest drag on the broader European market, battered by more broker downgrades and by pessimism over the economic outlook. The Group of Seven finance leaders over the weekend sounded a pessimistic note on the fallout from last year's global liquidity crisis and regulators at the meeting warned worse may lie ahead as banks tighten lending standards and an economic slowdown spreads. By 1130 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.3 percent at 1,298.29 points. The index lost 3.7 percent last week, hit by fears of a US recession and worries that financial institutions have not yet revealed the full impact of the credit crisis on their books. Among banks, HSBC was down 2.4 percent, UBS shed 2.4 percent and insurer AXA fell 1.6 percent. Societe Generale, the French bank reeling from a massive rogue trading scandal, dropped 3.3 percent after it launched a rights issue at a steep discount as it aims to raise cash to bolster its balance sheet. The French bank's losses related to the U.S. subprime crisis totalled 2.6 billion euros, including 600 million in write-downs that were not previously detailed. "There is an argument that says investment banks are tightening credit conditions ... even if policy rates come down, you are pushing on a string ... the transmission mechanism of cheap rates into the real economy isn't functioning properly," said Dresdner Kleinwort strategist Philip Isherwood. "The electric shock to the chest doesn't work, or at least not initially. We're going through results season and understandably that is getting a lot of attention." The FTSEurofirst lost 3.7 percent last week and has fallen in seven out of the past 10 weeks as investors grow increasingly worried about corporate profitability in an environment of high borrowing costs and slower growth. BUILDERS SUFFER Other interest rate-sensitive sectors also fell. Builders took a hit after Goldman Sachs cut forecasts and price targets for several stocks within the sector. Britain's Persimmon fell 3.2 percent, while rival Taylor Wimpey shed nearly 5 percent. Spain's Grupo Ferrovial lost 3.8 percent, while Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas lost 3.4 percent. France's Bouygues fell 3.2 percent. Hampering equities further was a widening in credit spreads, as measured by the iTraxx Crossover Index, reflecting a degree of wariness over the current environment. "Spreads are widening again in credit markets and that means the market anticipates a very gloomy scenario," said Romain Boscher, head of equity management at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris. "I think there'll be an initial shock from people that it's so highly discounted, but in this environment, with this market volatility, it would be ridiculous to price it at anything other than at this kind of discount. You wouldn't want to risk this not happening," one London-based trader said. "It's probably more important that they're taking another write-down this morning because that might dent some confidence and make it more toxic for people to purchase it if there are other skeletons in the cupboard." The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost nearly 14 percent so far this year, dragged lower by sustained US recession worries and fears that it could hurt the global economy. "One of the risks for equities is the fading resilience of emerging markets. We thought they could hold on, but now we fear that they might also tumble," Groupama's Boscher said. "Most Asian markets have been closed for a couple of days, and the worry is that they could catch up on last week's sharp losses in U.S. and European stocks when they reopen, and that could spark a new wave of sell-off." China's markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holidays and will resume trade on Wednesday. Japan's markets were also shut for Constitution Day on Monday, and will resume on Tuesday. Hong Kong shares shed 3.6 percent in their first trading day after the holiday. Germany's DAX index was down 0.7 percent, the UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.5 percent. Energy shares gained as crude oil prices held near $92 a barrel after Venezuela threatened to halt oil exports to the United States, the world's top fuel consumer. Royal Dutch Shell gained 1.3 percent and BP rose 0.9 percent. GlaxoSmithKline helped the pharmaceutical sector, rallying 2.6 percent after a UBS upgrade. Novo Nordisk gained 1.4 percent and AstraZeneca rose 0.4 percent
