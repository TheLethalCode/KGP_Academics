<TITLE> S Africa`s Eskom keen to buy power from locals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cape Town, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African state-owned power utility Eskom is negotiating to buy electricity from local industrial firms in a bid to resolve an energy crisis, Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin said on Monday. Eskom is under pressure to come up with a plan to increase power generation after weeks of rolling blackouts that have darkened millions of homes and forced businesses to shut. Large mining operations ground to a halt for five days last month. "Large producers, who would not normally want to be in electricity but need electricity, are now considering that there may be merit in them going into electricity production and selling to Eskom," Erwin told a media briefing in Cape Town. Erwin told Reuters the government was talking with Sasol, BHP Billiton and Anglo as it sought to boost power capacity, with gas-fired turbine stations favoured because of shorter construction times. "Clearly we are interested in that ... given the strictures on energy and the difficulties we have ... This opens an interesting possibility. We are in intensive negotiations now," Erwin said. President Thabo Mbeki expressed confidence on Friday that the crisis would be resolved quickly but did not give details of the government's plan. There have been calls from opposition parties and the media for him to sack several ministers. Mbeki and other senior officials have blamed the country's booming economy for increasing demand for electricity, while acknowledging that warnings of an impending power shortage went unheeded for years. INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS Coal shortages and unexpected breakdowns at power plants also have been cited as factors in the power crunch, which is expected to slow economic growth this year. South Africa's cabinet in September last year approved plans for independent power producers to supply up to 30 percent of the country's energy needs, working alongside monopoly Eskom. But, the response so far has been slow. "It has been difficult to attract the private sector," said Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica. Erwin said the government would talk to investors to clarify the country's energy position, but noted that it would be unable to sustain more energy-hungry projects, such as Rio Tinto Alcan's planned $2.7 billion smelter. "South Africa would not entertain another large smelting project of the size of an Alcan. After Alcan we need a lot of time to develop the system again," he said as the country targets reducing overall electricity use by 10 percent. Erwin reiterated the government's belief that the crisis could last up to four months and persistent power supply troubles would linger for the next four years or so. The minister also said Eskom, which is expected to begin rationing electricity in March, had seen a "significant" reduction in electricity demand from industry and business last week
