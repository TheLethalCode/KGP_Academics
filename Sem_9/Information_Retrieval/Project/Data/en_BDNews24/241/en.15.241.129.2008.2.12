<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)--The caretaker administration has decided to employ mobile courts to penalise garment factory owners who do not pay their employees the minimum wage, an adviser said Tuesday. The government also plans to form participatory committees which will mediate between workers and employers in each garment factory. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman briefed reporters following a meeting on the garments sector at the commerce ministry Tuesday. The adviser said the meeting had discussed the initial findings of a report from a committee tasked with investigating recent incidents of unrest in the garments sector. The meeting also addressed labour rights and development of the sector. Zillur said 42 percent of garments factories were found to be paying the minimum wage in June last year. By September the figure reached 48 percent, while in December the figure rose to 56 percent. The adviser conceded that the number of factories found to be complying with the law fell in January to 51 percent. "The government is closely monitoring the matter," he said. The adviser said the government would come down heavily on any employers found not to be complying with government fixed minimum wages. The caretaker government has already filed cases against 47 garment factory owners for not complying with minimum wage laws, he said. Recent unrest in the garments sector has sparked widespread concern at home and abroad about the future sustainability of the industry in Bangladesh. Zillur said a crisis committee consisting of 15 teams is working in different garment factories to investigate the problems. bdnew
