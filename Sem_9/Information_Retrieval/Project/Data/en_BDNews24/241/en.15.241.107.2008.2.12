 LAHORE, Pakistan, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Students at Pakistan's Punjab University, the country's biggest and a traditional nursery for politicians, are disillusioned with politics and many say they will not be voting in next week's election. A senior academic at the university in the eastern city of Lahore said the gloom on campus reflected despondency in the rest of Pakistan ahead of the Feb. 18 parliamentary elections. "It's a very depressed generation," Umbreen Javaid, the chairwoman of the political science department, said. "Generally the public, not only the young people, are very depressed these days. You see what has been happening: the suicide attacks, the energy crisis, the flour crisis and Benazir Bhutto's death. This is a very gloomy picture." Pakistan has undergone months of political turmoil stemming from opposition to President Pervez Musharraf, rising militant violence and the assassination of opposition leader Bhutto nearly seven weeks ago. Musharraf outraged Pakistanis when he declared a six-week state of emergency in early November and purged the judiciary of judges hostile to his bid to hold on to power. Many students at the country's oldest university said they had no faith in politicians vying for power, and also feared the elections would be rigged. "Most of us just want to boycott. We're not sure if they're going to be fair, there's a lack of trust in the government," industrial engineering student Nawaf Mehmood said while kicking around a football with some friends in the leafy grounds. The vote, which Pakistan's allies hope will restore stability in a nuclear-armed country on the front line of the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism, was postponed after Bhutto's assassination in Rawalpindi on Dec. 27. Mehmood said he would have supported cricket hero turned politician Imran Khan, if he were running. Khan, who heads his own small party, has boycotted the vote in a protest against the increasingly unpopular Musharraf. "If Imran Khan was taking part we'd vote and he'd get four out of five votes, but he's not taking part and we're not voting." The dashing and articulate Khan has a strong following among younger Pakistanis, though he was his party's only representative in the last National Assembly. "DEPRESSED GENERATION" While Bhutto's murder was expected to bring her Pakistan People's Party a sympathy vote, it has also contributed to the grim atmosphere in the country. "Students feel there is going to be no change and what's the use of voting when the same people are going to come again and there are no new people," Javaid said. She is trying to persuade her students not to opt out by posting notices outside classrooms reading: "Please vote. It is your national right and duty". But the message does not appear to be getting through. "The politicians are not so serious. None of them are able, so we can't support them," said student Ahsan Fayyaz. The biggest group on campus is the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami religious party, which is also boycotting a vote it says would lend legitimacy to Musharraf's presidency. The campus president of the group, Zahid Naveed, said people were losing faith in politics. "Students and the young generation are losing faith in the system. We see no sign of society progressing. There's a big need for change," he said, adding that the only way for change was through street protests. Naveed said he would not be voting and only one out of a group of 10 of his friends said he might. "Students are a part of society. This is a reflection of what's happening in society. People are worried," Naveed sa
