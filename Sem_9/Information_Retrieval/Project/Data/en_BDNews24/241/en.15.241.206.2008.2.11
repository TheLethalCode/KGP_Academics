<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Barrister Mainul Hosein Monday protested brother Anwar Hossain Manju's statement that a case had been lodged against him because of his influence as an adviser to the caretaker government. Mainul, who resigned from the Fakhruddin administration apparently under pressure, said that everybody knew from press reports that the Anticorruption Commission filed several cases against Manju, now in the US. The former adviser said that he had refrained from protesting such statements earlier for the sake of his family, although they were untrue and severely defamatory. He said that Manju was failing to understand that it was now not easy for a minister or a political leader to file false cases against anybody. Mainul alleged that Manju had also brought charges against the Bangla-language daily Ittefaq of using musclemen in the newspaper office solely to control the paper. He said Manju's share in the company remained the same as before. "Instead of a political leader, a respectable journalist acceptable to all had been made the editor," Mainul added. The former adviser said Manju's statement that the ACC had been influenced was tantamount to attacks on the honesty, independence and authority of the anti-graft watchdog. He also questioned how, what he called, a defamatory statement from abroad, from someone now out of the reach of law, could be published in the press. Mainul said that if the cases filed against Manju by the ACC were false, he should have come to the country to face them. "I am not an adviser now." bd
