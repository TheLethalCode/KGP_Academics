<TITLE> Romania names new candidate for justice minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bucharest, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania's ruling Liberals named a new candidate for justice minister on Monday, trying to end a political deadlock that could hinder judicial reforms ahead of a key European Union report in July. A row between Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu and President Traian Basescu has left Romania without a justice minister since December, just as it is trying to convince Brussels it is serious about fighting corruption and avoid the threat of punitive EU measures. The decision to nominate Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu, a 66-year-old diplomat, for the post follows Basescu's refusal to endorse previous nominee Norica Nicolai. Former justice minister Tudor Chiuariu resigned late last year ahead of a criminal investigation into corruption allegations against him. "This situation had to be resolved as quickly as possible," Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu told reporters after meeting senior party members. "If Romania has a problem right now that is triggering worries, justice is the one." The nomination, together with that of parliamentary deputy Radu Stroe to take over the defence post, must win approval from the president. Romania, ranked by Transparency International as the EU's most graft-prone state, was urged by the EU's executive Commission earlier this month to step up action against high-level corruption. But the Commission stopped just short of punishing Romania, not imposing a safeguard clause that would have removed automatic EU recognition of its court decisions across the 27-nation bloc. A fuller report on justice issues is due this summer and Brussels may impose punitive measures at any time until the end of 2009 unless it sees marked progress
