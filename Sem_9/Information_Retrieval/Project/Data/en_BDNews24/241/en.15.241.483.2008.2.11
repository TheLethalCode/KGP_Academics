 Washington, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are key facts on Amy Winehouse, the troubled English soul singer who won five prizes at the 50th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, the most of any artist. - Her Grammy haul included record of the year, song of the year and female pop vocal performance for "Rehab," pop vocal album for "Back to Black," and best new artist. - "Back to Black," her second album, was released in 2006; it reached No. 1 in Britain and No. 6 in the United States. - Autobiographical first single "Rehab" -- with the refrain "They tried to make me go to rehab. I said 'no, no, no'" -- has been called the anthem of celebrity trash culture. - Winehouse, 24, was born on Sept. 14, 1983, in suburban London to a Jewish family steeped in jazz music. She released her debut album "Frank" in 2003. - Her distinctive look consists of a bouffant beehive hair-do, heavy eyeliner, multiple tattoos, skinny jeans, tank top, and cigarettes. - In August 2007, she was briefly hospitalized for "severe exhaustion," forcing her to cancel shows in Europe. In October, she and her husband of five months, Blake Fielder-Civil, were arrested at a Norwegian hotel for marijuana possession. In December, she was photographed wandering barefoot on a London street wearing blue jeans, a red bra and looking distressed. - Winehouse entered a London rehabilitation clinic last month, and was recently questioned by police after the publication of video stills which appeared to show her smoking crack cocaine.
