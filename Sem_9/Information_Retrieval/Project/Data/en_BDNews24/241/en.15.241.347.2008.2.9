 Munich, Germany, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has no plans to boost the number of German troops in Afghanistan or shift them to other parts of the country despite mounting US pressure, a government spokesman said on Saturday. Earlier, Der Spiegel weekly reported the German government was planning to expand the number of soldiers it can send to Afghanistan by 1,000 to 4,500 and broaden their base of operations from the north to the west. The magazine said Merkel planned to make the proposal at a NATO summit in April in order to deflect pressure from Washington to send German forces to the south. "There are no such considerations in the Chancellery," spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said by telephone in response to questions about the report. Germany is under increasing pressure from its NATO partners, particularly the United States, to move troops from the relatively calm north to help fight a fierce battle against Taliban insurgents focused in the south. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who has been leading pressure on European allies to send troops to the south, is expected to raise the issue again when he speaks at a security conference in Munich on Sunday. Merkel's government has long ruled out such a shift, and Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung told the same conference on Saturday that German troops in northern Afghanistan had made a successful contribution to NATO's 43,000-strong mission. A parliamentary mandate which expires in mid-October sets an upper limit of 3,500 German forces in Afghanistan. German officials said the government was considering extending the mandate by 15 to 18 months instead of the usual one-year period in order to keep the issue out of the next federal election, due in the autumn of 2009. CONTROVERSIAL The Afghanistan deployment is highly controversial within Germany, where many people remain averse to foreign military operations over 60 years after the end of World War Two. As a result, the German government needs to carefully balance demands from NATO partners for more troops against pressure from voters. Merkel's awkward "grand coalition" of conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) was able to renew the mandate last year, but only after a fierce debate in parliament and within some parts of the SPD. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the top SPD politician in the government, said decisions on a new mandate should not coincide with campaigning. "I think the parliamentary groups would be well advised to find a procedure early enough, so that the extension of the mandate does not fall into the heated phase of campaigning," Steinmeier told Focus weekly. Apart from the United States and Britain, who are urging other NATO members to share more of the combat burden in southern Afghanistan, Canada has threatened to pull its troops out unless other allies come forward. And Poland's foreign minister has warned against "free-riding" in the alliance. US Republican Senator and presidential contender John McCain, who cancelled plans to come to the Munich conference in order to campaign, also criticised Germany from afar for not offering more troops. "We need more German troops in Afghanistan," he told Der Spiegel
