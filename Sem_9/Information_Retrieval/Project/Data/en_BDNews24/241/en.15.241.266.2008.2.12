<TEXT>
 Cairo, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's benchmark stock index fell for a fifth consecutive session on Tuesday, weighed down by shares of Telecom Egypt and investment bank EFG-Hermes, as declines in global markets hit investor sentiment. The index, which has shed nearly 6 percent this year, dropped 0.18 percent to 9,940.44 points. Shares of Telecom Egypt, the country's state-run fixed-line operator, shed 1.5 percent to 20.40 Egyptian pounds ($3.70), their fourth session of losses. EFG-Hermes shares closed 1.3 percent down at 58.52 pounds. "People are selling as long as they find the prices they want," said Karim Hosny, account officer at Pharos Securities in Cairo. "The sentiment is very weak and the volume is very weak." Losses in global equity markets due to fears of a U.S. economic slowdown were unnerving investors, Hosny said. "People are hoping for a decoupling of emerging markets but that isn't happening," he said. Shares of Medinet Nasr Housing extended losses, dropping 3.15 percent to 57.14 pounds. Shares of the housing developer have shed more than 7 percent over the past five sessions. "It's fallen to a very attractive level," said Hashem Ghoneim, chief executive of El Nour Securities. "Its fair price is in the 80-pound range." The Hermes index shed 0.28 percent to 87,991.98 points. The broader CIBC index fell 1.27 percent to 426.03 points. ($1 = 5.51 Egyptian pounds)
