 Jerusalem, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel's vice premier said on Monday the aim of US-backed talks between Israel and the Palestinians was to reach agreement on statehood principles this year, rather than a peace accord spelling out all the details. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's top deputy, Haim Ramon, said this so-called "declaration of principles" would address final-status issues like "what will be in Jerusalem" as well as statehood borders and the future of Palestinian refugees. But Ramon said the declaration would not go into thorny details like how Jerusalem's Old City would be administered. "It has to be detailed enough in order to implement it in the years that will come after 2008, two to three years after," Ramon told reporters in Jerusalem. During a visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank last month, US President George W Bush set the goal of trying to get Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to sign a peace treaty in 2008, though Bush did not spell out what that agreement might entail. If a declaration of principles is reached in the negotiations before Bush leaves office next January, then it should be presented to the Israeli public for approval during elections sometime in 2009, Ramon said
