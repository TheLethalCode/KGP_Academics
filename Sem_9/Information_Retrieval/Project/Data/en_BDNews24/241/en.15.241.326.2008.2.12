 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus has called for patience with the caretaker government to ensure the administration can complete its work. "This may be the last opportunity to make the country corruption free," Yunus told reporters Monday at a reception arranged by York College, part of the City University of New York. Selma Botman, Executive Vice Chancellor of the university, awarded Yunus the Chancellor's Medal at Monday's reception. The founder of Grameen Bank was asked by reporters after the event if he would consider a post in any future administration. "The question is hypothetical. Only time can answer that," he replied. Yunus, famous for creating one of the world's most widely implemented micro-credit programmes, said he hoped the economic model would succeed in making the world poverty free. "Bangladesh is lagging behind due to the rule of vested interests. However, Bangladeshis are an active people, and so they should have the opportunity to live a good life," said Yunus. bdnew
