<TITLE> Stocks firmer after GM results, German survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks bounced from a recent two-week low and Wall Street was set for a firmer start on Tuesday, underpinned by stronger-than-expected results from GM and a firmer German economic survey. Stronger stocks failed to boost overall investor risk appetite, however, as European credit market sentiment deteriorated further due to concerns about forced selling of structured credit products. Platinum hit record highs again due to supply problems. GM reported fourth-quarter results which were higher than expected and also reached an agreement with the United Auto Workers Union. The ZEW survey showed German investor morale improved in February for the first time since May 2007. Other positive results from European firms added to sentiment that the six-month-old credit crisis and the ensuing tightening credit standards have yet to batter wider corporate activity. "Financial professionals (surveyed by the ZEW) are obviously expecting that the economic dip will remain limited in terms of time," said Andreas Scheuerle, economist at DekaBank. "There is hope that we will see an improvement in the late summer and the dip will not turn into a phase of stagnation." The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.1 percent on the day, having hit its weakest since late January on Monday, while MSCI main world equity index was up half a percent. U.S. stock futures were up around 0.3 percent. Financial stocks underperformed as speculation intensified of a large writedown at Dutch group ING and investors fretted about Credit Suisse's remaining exposure to the financial crisis. Credit Suisse trimmed full-year subprime writedowns to 2.0 billion Swiss francs and reported a 49 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit. Experts estimate the credit crisis will eventually cost the global banking sector around $300-400 billion. DETERIORATING CREDIT MARKETS The banking sector might suffer further if credit markets deteriorate further, which could force banks to sell their credit products. In Europe, the closely-watched iTraxx Crossover index widened to 565 basis points. "There continues to be speculation of structured credit unwinds, which is weighing on credit and especially investment grade," said Jim Reid, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank. "As spreads widen, so triggers for structured products are breached which forces them to sell assets which in turn runs the risk of destabilising other structures." A plan by Standard Chartered to provide $7 billion of backing to its structured investment vehicle (SIV) Whistlejacket lapsed, in another example of how the credit crunch is causing problems. In the currency market, the euro was steady at $1.4529, after hitting a two-week low last week as speculation grew that the European Central Bank may be softening its anti-inflation rhetoric by focusing on downside growth risks. PLATINUM SHINES Platinum hit a record high for the ninth straight trading day, rising as high as $1,965 an ounce as supply concerns lingered due to a power crisis in South Africa. Gold was steady at $919.00 an ounce, holding within sight of a record high set earlier in February. Firmer commodity prices underpinned emerging markets, where stocks rose 0.8 percent on the day and emerging sovereign spreads tightened 2 basis point. The March Bund future fell 33 ticks. U.S. light crude fell 1.3 percent to $92.37 a barrel as investors focused on a slowing U.S. economy.
