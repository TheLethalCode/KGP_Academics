<TITLE> Arab information ministers to moot broadcast charter </TITLE>

 CAIRO, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Arab League has floated a satellite broadcasting charter which would entrench state control over broadcast media and curtail political expression. Arab information ministers met in Cairo on Tuesday to debate the charter, which echoes the language found in press laws used by some Arab countries to prosecute journalists critical of their governments. Analysts say the draft is the Arab governments' response to the relative freedom enjoyed by Arab satellite broadcasters, many of which are privately financed and which encourage open political discussion of sensitive matters. "This is clearly an effort to try to stem (the) influence from satellite television on a political level," said Lawrence Pintak, director of the Center for Electronic Journalism at the American University in Cairo. "But while it may produce a lot more court cases, it's ultimately going to be doomed to failure," he told Reuters, adding that the charter shows "the sheer gap between how governments see media and how media actually plays out on the ground". Cairo-based analyst Issandr el-Amrani said that the charter idea came after the proliferation of political talk shows in recent years, which gave "a much stronger voice to opposition politicians and movements like the Muslim Brotherhood". Writing in his blog, Amrani said that Saudi Arabia, for example, appears to have recently banned live talk shows after someone mocked the size of a civil servant salary increase -- a position seen as a criticism of the royal family. Saudi stations still run phone-in programmes but it is not clear if they are still live, he added. The charter would ban broadcasting material seen as undermining "social peace, national unity, public order and general propriety" -- accusations which Arab governments often throw at their opponents. Broadcasters could not criticise religions or defame political, national and religious leaders, it says. "Freedom (of expression) is to be exercised with awareness and responsibility to protect the supreme interests of the Arab states and the Arab nation," one clause says. Television stations could not broadcast any form of incitement to violence or terrorism, the charter added. If a broadcaster violates the charter, the host government could suspend or revoke its broadcasting licence, it said. But the charter does make one concession to public opinion, saying that Arabs have a right to watch international sporting events in which their national teams are competing, regardless of who owns the broadcast rights. In 2006 Saudi-owned Arab Radio and Television (ART) upset millions of people in several North African countries by enforcing its exclusive right to broadcast World Cup matches, which went out on encrypted satellite channels. Egyptian officials later criticised what they described as ART's monopoly. More mundane measures in the charter include a prohibition on overtly sexual material or talk, or anything that promotes smoking or the consumption of alcoh
