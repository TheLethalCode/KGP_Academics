<TITLE> Taiwan gives China visitors red-carpet welcome </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Taipei, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan gave mainland Chinese tourists the red-carpet treatment on Monday, marking an historic arrival of hundreds of visitors from the island's political rival after Taipei lifted restrictions on Chinese arriving by ship. The 790 Chinese tourists arrived on a luxury oceanliner that set out from Hong Kong. They walked from the port of Keelung in north Taiwan on red carpet onto a fleet of buses for sightseeing in nearby Taipei, local media and a port official said. "It's a new arrangement for Chinese people to come by ocean liner," a spokeswoman for the Taiwan government's Mainland Affairs Council said. "We changed the rule before the Lunar New Year (Feb. 6-11), and this is the first group that applied." Granted double-entry visas for the first time, the tourists were scheduled to depart Keelung on Monday evening and reach the southern port of Kaohsiung by Tuesday for a jewellery exhibition before heading back to Hong Kong the same day. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to attack if the island formalises its de facto independence. Taipei blocks most mainland Chinese travellers for security reasons or fear of visitors overstaying their visa on the relatively wealthy island. But this month the cabinet passed a rule allowing Chinese tourists to arrive via ship from ports outside mainland China. But there is political pressure from the main opposition Nationalists party to try to improve strained relations. The two sides have negotiated the technical aspects of a broader agreement that would allow as many as 1,000 Chinese tourists a day and open direct weekend charter flights, a boon to the island's flagging service sector. But the two governments shelved the deal about 10 months ago over political differences. Analysts estimate opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists could provide a boost for the island's relatively small international travel industry, adding as much as 0.2 percentage points to economic growth.
