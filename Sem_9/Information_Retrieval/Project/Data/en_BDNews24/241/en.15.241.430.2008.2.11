 RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Alberto scored the winning goal against his old club on Sunday as Sao Paulo marched to a 3-2 win over Santos in Brazil's biggest state championship. Ponte Preta moved to top spot in the Sao Paulo championship standings on 19 points with a 1-0 win over Rio Preto. Sao Paulo climbed into the top four, occupying a qualifying slot for the semi-final stage of the championship for the first time since it got under way a month ago. Santos, the 2007 state champions, are languishing near the relegation zone with eight points from eight games. The visitors survived early Sao Paulo pressure and took the lead when a defensive slip allowed Kleber Pereira a free run on goal. Fabio Santos headed the equaliser and then Juninho took advantage of a poorly positioned wall to put Sao Paulo ahead. Rodrigo Souto headed a Santos equaliser from a looping cross by Alemao, but sustained a head injury in the process. Carlos Alberto's deflected effort gave Sao Paulo the points. Santos were incensed when a penalty appeal was waved away after Miranda appeared to handle. Santos midfielder Rodrigo Tabata was dismissed for dissent late in the game and Sao Paulo's on-loan striker Adriano was also shown a late red card after a scuffle with Santos defender Domingos. Ponte Preta battled their way to victory over Rio Preto in a game where torrential rain turned the playing surface into a mud bath. Marcelo Soares embodied Ponte Preta's fighting spirit by forcing his way through the muddy penalty area to toe-poke the winning goal. Modest club Guaratingueta slipped to second place, on 18 points, but will play their game in hand against Rio Claro on Tuesday. RIO CHAMPIONSHIP The semi-finalists for the first stage of the Rio de Janeiro state championship have already been decided. Vasco da Gama made a successful late dash into a qualifying berth by trouncing Cabofriense 5-1. The convincing performance, capped by Morais's fine play, suggested that the players have not been adversely affected by the departure of former coach Romario, who resigned last week alleging board interference in playing affairs. Fluminense and Flamengo, who had already qualified, fielded under-strength teams in their clash at the Maracana stadium. Striker Thiago Neves scored a brilliant hat-trick to help Fluminense to a flattering 4-1 win. The game was interrupted by a fierce thunderstorm that caused a power cut
