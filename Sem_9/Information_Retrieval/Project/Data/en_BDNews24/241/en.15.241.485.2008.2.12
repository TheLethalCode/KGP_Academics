<TITLE> UN mission chief wants political talks in Chad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dakar, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of a UN peacekeeping mission to Chad and Central African Republic (MINURCAT) said on Tuesday he would seek to persuade armed groups in the region to lay down their weapons and join a political process. Victor Angelo said the mission had a political component as well as offering protection to half a million refugees from Sudan, Central African Republic and Chad. A two-pronged deployment, approved by the U.N. Security Council in September, tasks a 3,700-strong European Union force (EUFOR) with protecting refugee camps, while smaller MINURCAT focuses on training police and advising authorities on human rights and security threats. The humanitarian crisis in eastern Chad, which borders Sudan's war-torn Darfur region, has sharply deteriorated since a rebel coalition attacked Chad's capital N'Djamena 10 days ago. Analysts have voiced surprise that the international community has so far failed to call for dialogue. "Recent events show that beyond the very important security concerns, there are political problems that require the attention of all the key players," Angelo told Reuters in a telephone interview from Brussels. "We have to work together and find a lasting political solution to this complex situation." "We have to do the political work to make sure that everyone ... understands that armed struggle is not the way forward." More than 160 civilians were killed in two days of street fighting in N'Djamena before the rebels withdrew toward the east. Foreign humanitarian workers have been evacuated and aid deliveries to the east have been interrupted. "There's a need to create space for the humanitarian organisations to do their work and there's also a need for a political process, including respect for international borders." The five-year-old conflict in Darfur has been blamed for dragging neighbouring countries into a vortex of ethnic and political violence. Chad's President Idriss Deby has rejected AU proposals for talks with the rebels, whom he describes as mercenaries in the pay of Sudanese leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir. FRENCH ROLE "POSITIVE" The rebels have criticised "neo-colonialist" France for propping up Deby's 18-year-old regime, which they say is corrupt and dictatorial. They have warned other European countries not to supply troops to EUFOR and warned they will attack it. French troops will make up the backbone of EUFOR, which was expected to resume its deployment on Tuesday. Paris has denied it intervened militarily to support Deby, saying it focused on evacuating more than 700 foreign nationals. Angelo said former colonial power France, which he said had "special responsibilities" because of its historical ties, had international support for its role in Chad after both the United Nations and the African Union expressed backing for Deby. "The fact that the French are on the ground prevented the humanitarian situation from becoming very much worse," Angelo said. "We now need to build on that presence ... and the fact that the French are there is very positive." Angelo said he aimed to travel to Chad by the end of the month and to have MINURCAT deploy as urgently as possible. The mission will be split between two bases in eastern and southern Chad, and another in Central African Republic. With a budget of over $180 million, MINURCAT includes a maximum of 300 police and 50 military liaison officers.
