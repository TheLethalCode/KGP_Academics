<TEXT>
 ALGIERS, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Algerian government forces shot dead 17 members of an armed group that killed eight paramilitary gendarmes in an ambush claimed by al Qaeda, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. The al Qaeda Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb has said it was behind the Feb. 7 attack on the gendarmes in the desert province of El Oued 500 km (300 miles) southeast of Algiers. The Feb. 7 ambush was the deadliest attack in the oil- and gas-exporting OPEC state since a twin Dec. 11 bombing killed at least 41 people, including 17 UN staff, in Algiers. The top-selling El Khabar daily said the army killed five of the assailants in a clash shortly after the ambush. Troops backed by air power later surrounded other attackers and killed 12 of them, the Arabic-language daily added. Other militants travelling on 10 all-terrain vehicles joined the rebel group during the clashes, it said, adding troops were continuing to hunt for armed men in the neighbouring province of Biskra. The newspaper added that al Qaeda's north Africa group was planning to name a new leader in the Sahara desert. Yahia Abou Ammar was expected to replace Mokhtar Belmokhtar, known for his links to smugglers in desert areas bordering Mali and Niger. Newspaper commentators say that Belmokhtar, an Algerian veteran of the Afghan war against Soviet occupation, has been criticised by some colleagues for mounting what they see as an inadequate number of attacks on Algerian security forces. Some commentators have said Belmokhtar is in talks with the Algerian authorities who are seeking to persuade him to disarm in return for amnesty. Violence broke out in Algeria in 1992 after the military-backed authorities scrapped a parliamentary election that an Islamist political party, the Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. Up to 200,000 people were killed in the ensuing bloodshed. Violence had fallen since the 1990s, but a spate of suicide bombings in and around Algiers has killed scores in the past 18 months since the GSPC changed its name and declared allegiance to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Lad
