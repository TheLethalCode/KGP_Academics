 Prague, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eurosceptic Czech President Vaclav Klaus again narrowly failed to win re-election on Saturday in a parliamentary vote that has deeply split the country's ruling coalition. The right-winger Klaus, 66, fell just one vote short of the necessary majority in the two houses of parliament. He remains the favourite over challenger Jan Svejnar, an independent economist, for a new vote expected next week. "We will go into the next round, with high confidence," said right-wing Civic Democrat Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek whose party nominated Klaus. Analysts said election of any other candidate would wound Topolanek and his cabinet, which has embarked on tax cuts for richer Czechs and unpopular reforms in the health and pension systems. "Some in the party would demand Topolanek takes personal responsibility, and that could split the Civic Democrats and could lead to a government collapse," said political analyst Tomas Lebeda. The Czech parliament started voting on a new president on Friday, but without result. There have been a number of procedural battles and time-outs for back room deals over the post, which is largely ceremonial but held in high regard by the population. Presidents help steer the central European EU member country by appointing prime ministers, central bank chiefs and top judges. Svejnar, 55, is an economics professor at the University of Michigan. He has mostly lived abroad since 1970 and is backed by the junior government Green party, as well as the leftist opposition Social Democrats. Svejnar supports fast euro entry, while Klaus believes it would not be beneficial at present. Senior Civic Democrats harshly criticised the Greens for not following the government line, although the Greens have long said they would not back a candidate who opposes deeper European ties and who has challenged the dangers of global warming. An opinion poll for daily Mlada Fronta Dnes showed on Thursday Klaus would beat Svejnar 53-47 percent in a direct election
