<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Leader of BNP's reformist faction Saifur Rahman said Sunday that they would not reconcile with opposing faction leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain unless conditions were withdrawn. The reformist faction met Sunday to discuss the issue of party reunification. After the meeting Saifur told reporters: "The decision of October's standing committee meeting will not be cancelled." "If Delwar does not withdraw his condition we will not reconcile with him." Delwar had Saturday ruled out the possibility of reconciliation with the reformist faction. Terming the Oct 29 meeting of the standing committee 'illegal', Delwar had said: "It will not be possible on my part to reconcile with the reformist faction in view of the decision made on October 29 by the standing committee." Saifur is still hopeful about the unity of the party. He said that he supported the message of chairperson Khaleda Zia sent from jail. "We are working accordingly." Referring to Delwar, he said: "No reconciliation is possible with the person who does not comply with the chairperson's decision." Sunday's meeting began at 11:00 am at the Gulshan residence of Saifur Rahman, acting BNP chairperson nominated by the standing committee. Several participants had earlier said that the meeting had been called specifically to give a reply to the statement of Khandaker Delwar Hossain. Among the 35 former MPs and central party leaders present were: BNP standing committee member and former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed and adviser to the party chairperson ZA Khan. Hafizuddin told reporters after the meeting that there could not be any unity in the party with conditions attached. "On the question of unity, the issue of who will stay and who will go should not be considered. I am disappointed to hear him (Delwar) speak like this." The acting secretary general said Delwar's remark that the reformists had "gone astray" was unfortunate. "We have the support of 206 former lawmakers for our reform proposals. Have they gone astray? The leader herself has lent her support to the proposals," he said. Hafizuddin said he felt there was still time to unite the party ahead of the national polls, and described detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia as an "undisputed leader of the country". The acting secretary general added that acting chairperson Saifur Rahman was unwell and would be admitted to Apollo Hospital Sunday afternoon. Saifur and Hafizuddin were appointed to their current posts at a controversial meeting of the BNP's standing committee on Oct 29 last year. On Sept 3, BNP chief Khaleda Zia expelled the party secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and nominated standing committee member Khandaker Delwar Hossain as the secretary general. bdnews24.co
