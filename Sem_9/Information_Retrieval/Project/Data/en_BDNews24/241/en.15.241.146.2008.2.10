The company, the fifth largest Arab mobile operator by market value, lost 3.2 percent to last trade at 75.90 Egyptian pounds ($13.76) after plummeting to a low of 72.51 pounds during the session. The stock had tumbled about 7.7 percent last week as foreign funds were cashing out of it. "People were still selling OT on Sunday after its global deposit receipts (GDRs) in London went down again on Friday," said Mohamed Ashmawy of CIBC Brokerage. OT GDRs closed 3.1 percent lower at $64.90 on Friday. "OT was for sure the market leader today, dragging the CASE 30 down," he added. Orascom Construction Industries, another heavyweight, was 1.5 percent lower at 560 pounds, while shares in Commercial International Bank edged 0.2 percent down to 89.90 pounds. The benchmark CASE 30 index slid 2.1 percent to 10,000.02 points, while the well watched Hermes index dropped 1.8 percent to 88,777.35 points. The broader CIBC index inched 0.1 percent up to 426.36 points as some local retailers bought shipping and container stocks, brokers said. Alexandria Containers and Goods jumped 12.9 percent to 269 pounds, while United Arab Shipping rose 0.5 percent to last trade at 13.01 pounds. ($1 = 5.52 Egyptian pounds
