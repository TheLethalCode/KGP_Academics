<TEXT>
 Bosasso, Somalia, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen kidnapped a German aid worker on Tuesday in an ambush on his car in northwestern Somalia, his colleague said. The incident took place in Era Gabo, a town in the breakaway republic of Somaliland. "They were two Germans who went out this morning to the outskirt of Era Gabo ... On their way they were ambushed by gunmen who opened fire at their pick up truck wounding the driver," said Mohamed Haji Ismail, a Somali working for German Agro Action (GAA), also known as Deutsche Welthungerhilfe. "In the confusion, the gunmen only kidnapped the German man who worked for GAA." Speaking to Reuters by telephone, he named the abducted man as Daniel Bronkal. Ismail added that the other German, a female, with Bronkal was safe. Deutsche Welthungerhilfe confirmed that one of its workers had been kidnapped in Somalia, but declined to identify him. It was not clear whether the kidnapping was politically motivated, a spokeswoman said. The German government said it was looking into it. "We're seeking clarification on this issue," a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said.
