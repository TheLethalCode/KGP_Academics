 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Chhatra League and Chhatra Shibir members were involved in clashes at Dhaka Polytechnic Institute Sunday. Principal Md Shamsul Alam told reporters that students were asked to vacate their dormitories by 5:00 pm to control the situation. The two groups were involved in attacks and counter attacks, and vandalism of campus property. Metropolitan deputy police commissioner Mahbubur Rahman said that the dispute had continued from Saturday night originating from a trivial incident. "We are trying to control the situation," he added. Students said the dispute erupted Saturday night as members of the two groups disagreed on the seating arrangement in the dining room of Latif Hall. The dispute turned violent and some 10 to 15 rooms were vandalised. The activists of both parties resumed their dispute Sunday, with Chhatra League students vandalising windows, doors and furniture of the academic building. Enamul, a Chhatra League member, told reporters that the Shibir activists also vandalised some six to seven rooms. Shibir member Tushar claimed that Chhatra League activists beat one of their workers. Members of both groups protested that the others had attacked them. At one point Chhatra League students ousted Shibir activists from the hall. The clash revived as the Shibir group tried to re-enter. The Chhatra League activists also attempted to block the road in front of the institute in the morning but failed as police dispersed them. Several students were injured as police forced them back to the hall. bdnews24
