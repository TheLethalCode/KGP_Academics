 MANCHESTER, England, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City honoured the memory of Manchester United's tragic 1958 Busby Babes on Sunday, then dented United's current title hopes with an unexpected 2-1 win at Old Trafford. After the fans of both clubs had observed a minute's silence to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air crash, City stunned United as first-half goals from Darius Vassell and debutant Benjani Mwaruwari gave them their first win at their rivals since 1974 and their first double over them since 1969. Substitute Michael Carrick's well-taken stoppage-time goal was no more than a consolation for the home side. United's first home Premier League defeat of the season has seriously hit their hopes of retaining the title. The result meant City rose from eighth to sixth in the table, at least until Liverpool play at Chelsea later. Arsenal, who play Blackburn Rovers on Monday, have 60 points from 25 matches, United have 58 from 26, while Chelsea, before playing Liverpool, had 54 from 25.
