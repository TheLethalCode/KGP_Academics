 Los Angeles, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The union representing striking Hollywood writers said on Saturday it had reached a "tentative deal" with the studios after a three-month walkout that has crippled television production, hurt the local economy and overshadowed the awards season. "While this agreement is neither perfect nor perhaps all that we deserve for the countless hours of hard work and sacrifice, our strike has been a success," the Writers Guild of America said in a memo emailed to members. Members will meet in New York and Los Angeles later on Saturday to discuss specific terms, the ratification process and ending the strike, the union added. Some 10,500 screenwriters walked off the job on Nov. 5, four days after the WGA's old contract expired, shattering 20 years of Hollywood labor peace in a dispute that hinged on how much writers should earn for work distributed over the Internet. The WGA memo said the tentative deal "creates formulas for revenue-based residuals in new media, provides access to deals and financial data to help us evaluate and enforce those formulas, and establishes the principle that, 'When they get paid, we get paid.'" Officials from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the bargaining arm of the studios, were not immediately available for comment
