 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - Warid Telecom, the country's newest mobile operator, has secured the title sponsorship of the upcoming Bangladesh-South Africa Test and three-ODI series. Warid has bought the series sponsorship from the sports marketing company Axiom Technologies Limited, who won the rights from the Bangladesh Cricket Board last week as highest bidder. "Eleven cricketers play on the pitch but the game involves the whole nation. The people of the country love the game of cricket and cricketers. So, we are happy to be associated with the series," Zeeshan Kingshuk Huq, senior marketing manager of Warid Telecom, said at a press conference Monday. Axiom beat contender AB Bank by offering Tk 60.6 lakh to win the sponsorship rights. They also won rights of two other sponsorship packages that were on offer for the series by agreeing to pay Tk 26 lakh for each. Axiom, however, did not disclose the amount it is going to get from Warid "At the moment I can only say that I am looking for buyers for the others two sponsorship packages," said Rizwan bin Farouq, managing director of Axiom. The two Tests and three-ODI series will now be styled as the Warid Telecom Series. Warid will award both Test and one-day match winners $2,500 as prize money each. The man of the match and man of the series in the Test series will get $1,500 and $2,500 while man of the match and man of the series in one-day series will receive $1,000 and $2,000 each. BCB officials Ishtiaque Ahmad and Zulfiqar Ahmed were among others present on the occasion. bd
