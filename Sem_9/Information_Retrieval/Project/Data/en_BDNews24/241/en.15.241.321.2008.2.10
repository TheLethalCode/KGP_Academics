<TITLE> Oyster cards take centre stage in London election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Conservative candidate for London mayor, Boris Johnson, has come up with an innovative way of tackling the capital's crime problems -- taking away offenders' Oyster cards. The Oyster card is an electronic device used to pay for train and bus tickets in London. "There are loads of people on buses who are kicking up and frankly intimidating other passengers," Johnson told the BBC. "We should take away the Oyster cards from the tiny minority who are abusing their privilege. I don't want to sound too draconian or bullying because I think it's a great privilege that people have and they value it." Johnson , a floppy-haired former editor of the Spectator magazine, is well known for regular appearances on television in programmes like the comedy gameshow "Have I Got News For You" and a love life that has often been tabloid fodder. "If you look at all the evidence about crime, if you can tackle smaller crimes and if you can be deterred from committing a smaller crime it's very unlikely that you will then go on to commit more serious offences," he added. Johnson will take on twice-elected Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone and Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick, a former police chief, for the mayoral post on May 1, 2008
