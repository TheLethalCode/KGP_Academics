<TITLE> Reserved quota failing to ensure competent women teachers: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb. 11 (bdnews24.com) - Competent women teachers are not emerging though a 60 percent quota has been reserved for them in educational institutions throughout the country, an adviser said Monday. Women and children affairs adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury said in a recent test for appointment of teachers in Sylhet, only 272 persons passed as competent, against 600 reserved posts. Rasheda was speaking to reporters after chairing the national anti-dowry monitoring committee at the ministry of women and children affairs. Asked whether the issue of reserving a third of party leadership posts for women would be raised during dialogues with the political parties, the adviser said: "The cabinet has not yet taken any decision in this regard." "However, we hope that the parties will take this initiative on their own." Asked at what stage dialogues with political parties would be held, Rasheda answered: "I know nothing about this. However, the Election Commission is holding discussions with political parties." "After the talks ends the issue of dialogue with the government will arise. The dialogue with the government depends on the decision of the Election Commission." The adviser said that many questions had arisen on whether the anti-dowry committee had done any work as its second ever meeting was held Monday after a a long gap of three years. The committee was formed on Jan 10, 2005 and its first meeting held February 5 the same year. Some work had been done but not carefully monitored, Rasheda said, adding that meetings were held on women's development and dowry every month at every district led by the deputy commissioners. The meetings reviewed the activities and data presented there, but the women and children affairs ministry did not monitor these centrally, the adviser said. The ministry of information does not have related information from 40 out of 64 districts of the country. The committee decided to collect information from these districts and intensify overall monitoring activities. The committee also decided to involve the elected representatives of local government bodies in the monitoring of loan activities of the organisations under different ministries for the development of women, proper use of women's employment quotas and different anti-dowry social movements. Secretary to the women and children affairs ministry, Rokeya Sultana, senior officials and representatives of other ministries, agencies and directorates were present at the meeting. bdne
