 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division is set to hand down a verdict Tuesday on the government's appeal against a previous verdict by the High Court, which quashed an extortion case against Sheikh Hasina and ruled its trial illegal. A full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin ended the hearing of the arguments on the appeal Tuesday morning. During the hearing that ended around 10:00am, attorney general Fida M Kamal said: "The HC verdict in the case has far-reaching implications. The court should, therefore, stay the verdict." The court said: "We haven't read the HC verdict in the case. How can we hand down any ruling on this without reading it through?" Hasina's chief counsel barrister Rafiq-ul Huq said: "The HC delivered the final verdict in the case. The Appellate Division cannot stay the HC verdict without reading it, as it is not an interim order." The High Court Wednesday cancelled the extortion case and ruled that trying the charges under the emergency powers rules was illegal bdnews24.com/at/f
