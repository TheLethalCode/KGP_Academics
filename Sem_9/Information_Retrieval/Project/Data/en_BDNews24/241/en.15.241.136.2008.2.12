<TEXT>
 Kabul, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber targeted a NATO troop convoy Afghanistan's Nimroz province on Tuesday, wounding one soldier, a spokesman for the alliance said. Taliban insurgents carried out more than 140 suicide attacks last year in Afghanistan, the highest number since they were ousted from power in 2001. The lastest incident took place in the southwest when the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) convoy was passing, ISAF said. Apart from the suicide bomber, no one was killed. ISAF did not mention the nationality of the wounded soldier, but local government sources said the convoy belonged to an Italian contingent operating in the western Afghanistan. Meanwhile, a roadside bomb killed two auxiliary soldiers operating alongside with U.S.-led coalition forces in the eastern province of Khost on Tuesday, a senior police official said.
