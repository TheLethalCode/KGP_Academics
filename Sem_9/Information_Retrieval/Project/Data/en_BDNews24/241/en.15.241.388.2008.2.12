 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com) Voter listing rules have received initial vetting from the law ministry, election commissioners said Tuesday. The rules were approved six months after an ordinance on voter listing was signed into law. Election commissioners Sohul Hossain and Sakhawat Hossain finalised the voter listing rules for 2008 at a midday meeting with law and justice adviser AF Hassan Ariff at his ministry. Following the meeting, Sakhawat told reporters that four crore voters had so far been registered throughout the country. The commissioner said it had not been legal to publish the draft voter lists until the rules were finalised. A circular will be out in a day or two promulgating the rules, Sakhawat said. bdnews24
