 LONDON, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe striker Benjani Mwaruwari marked his Manchester City debut with the winning goal against city rivals United in the English Premier League on Sunday. On a weekend when the top European-based African players returned to their clubs after the Nations Cup, Benjani's glancing header put City 2-0 up at Manchester United. The home side pulled a goal back late in the second half but City held on for the upset 2-1 victory. Benjani, who missed out on the Nations Cup in Ghana after Zimbabwe failed to qualify, moved from Portsmouth earlier this month. His 12th league goal of the season helped earn his new team their first league double over United since 1969. Also in England, powerful Nigerian midfielder Dickson Etuhu crashed home a superb header in Sunderland's crucial 2-0 win over Wigan Athletic on Saturday. In Spain, Getafe's Nigeria striker Ikechukwu Uche announced his return from the Nations Cup with a goal at Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday, shooting high into the net from close range to earn his team a 1-1 draw. It was a less happy return for Sevilla's Malian midfielder Seydou Keita, who was sent off in a 1-1 home draw with high-flying Barcelona. In France, Marseille's prolific Senegalese forward Mamadou Niang scored a 25th minute tap-in to put his side on course for a 2-0 win over Nice on Sunday. Senegalese midfielder Abdou Kader Mangane helped Racing Lens maintain their good recent form with an excellent headed goal in a 4-1 win at Caen. On Saturday, Zambian striker Jacob Mulenga scored in the final minute of Racing Strasbourg's 3-0 victory over St Etienne. In Turkey, Nigerian midfielder Isaac Promise scored the only goal of the game as Genclerbirligi beat Ankaragucu. Promise's team mate Lamine Traore of Burkina Faso was sent off after 76 minutes. In Belgium, Congolese forward Christian Landu-Tubi scored a consolation goal for FC Brussels in their 4-2 home defeat against Anderlecht. Zimbabwean midfielder Vusumuzi Nyoni was on target for Cercle Brugge in their 4-2 win at FC Dender and Algerian midfielder Mohamed Brahami scored the opener for Mons in their 2-1 win at Lokeren
