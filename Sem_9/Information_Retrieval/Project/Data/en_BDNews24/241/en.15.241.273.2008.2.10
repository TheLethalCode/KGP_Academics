<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Leader of BNP's reformist faction M Saifur Rahman said Sunday that they would not reconcile with opposing faction leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain unless conditions were withdrawn. The reformist faction met Sunday to discuss the issue of party reunification. After the meeting Saifur told reporters: "The decision of October's standing committee meeting will not be cancelled." "If Delwar does not withdraw his condition we will not reconcile with him." Delwar, disputed secretary general of the opposing faction, appointed by former prime minister Khaleda Zia, had earlier ruled out the possibility of reconciliation with the reformist splinter. Calling the Oct 29 meeting of the standing committee 'illegal', Delwar had said: "It will not be possible on my part to reconcile with the reformist faction in view of the decision made on October 29 by the standing committee." Saifur is still hopeful about the unity of the party. He said that he supported the message of chairperson Khaleda Zia sent from jail. "We are working accordingly." Referring to Delwar, he said: "No reconciliation is possible with the person who does not comply with the chairperson's decision." Sunday's meeting began at 11:00 am at the Gulshan residence of Saifur Rahman, acting BNP chairperson nominated by the standing committee. Several participants had earlier said that the meeting had been called specifically to give a reply to the statement of Khandaker Delwar Hossain. Among the central party leaders present were: BNP standing committee member and former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed and adviser to the party chairperson ZA Khan. bdnew
