 Baghdad, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five American soldiers were killed in roadside bombings in Iraq on Friday, the US military said on Saturday, while Iraqi police detained 22 suspects in raids against Shia militiamen. The latest arrests come as the US military aggressively pursues what it describes as rogue elements of anti-US Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and other Shi'ite militia which Washington says are supported by Iran. On Friday a respected think-tank said US forces should not provoke the Mehdi Army, once described by the Pentagon as the greatest threat to peace in Iraq, into the sort of widespread violence that took Iraq to the brink of civil war. Attacks are down by 60 percent since last June on the back of a boost of 30,000 extra US troops, a decision by Sunni Arab tribal leaders to turn against al Qaeda and a six-month ceasefire ordered by Sadr last August. US commanders say Sunni Islamist al Qaeda is now the biggest security threat in Iraq, while some rogue members of Sadr's splintered militia have ignored the ceasefire and other Shia militia have continued attacks. "There have been increases in some areas and great decreases in others," said US military spokesman Major Mark Cheadle. Imad al-Din al-Saidi, a prominent Mehdi army figure in Baghdad's Sadr City, said Iraqi security forces and US soldiers had taken advantage of his group's ceasefire. "Those parties have viciously abused the decision through the many break-ins and the random arrests of people in Sadr's army and movement," he said, adding he did not think the cleric would renew the freeze when it expires later this month. In Friday's bloodiest incident, four soldiers were killed by a roadside blast while on patrol northwest of the Iraqi capital, the US military said in a statement. It blamed a deeply buried roadside bomb, a signature al Qaeda tactic. Another soldier died in an explosion near his vehicle and three others were wounded near Tikrit in northern Iraq. So far this month 13 US soldiers have been killed in Iraq, according to icasualties.org, an independent Web site that tracks military deaths there. A total of 3,957 American soldiers have been killed since the US-led invasion in 2003. ARRESTS Iraqi police said on Saturday they had arrested 15 militants in the Shia holy city of Kerbala, 110 km (70 miles) south of Baghdad on Friday. Another seven, some said by police to include former members of the Mehdi Army, were held in Nassiriya, about 375 km (235 miles) south of the capital. Earlier this month, the US military said attacks using Iranian-made roadside bombs had risen to the highest level in a year in an area of Baghdad that includes Sadr City, a sprawling Shia slum in northeast Baghdad and a Mehdi Army stronghold. A report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank on Friday cautioned US forces against taking firm action against the Mehdi Army, saying it was "unassailable" in strongholds in Baghdad and mainly Shia southern Iraq. The ICG report said it was "fanciful" to imagine the defeat of the Mehdi Army, which has tens of thousands of fighters, and that pressuring it would likely trigger fierce resistance in Baghdad and escalate strife among Shias in the south. But US forces remain keen to go after Shia militants who US officials say Tehran has supplied with sophisticated, armour-piercing bombs known as explosively formed penetrators (EFPs). Iran denies the allegation. On Thursday, David Satterfield, the State Department's Iraq coordinator, said he believed Iran's strategy was still to force a US withdrawal from Iraq at as high a price as possible. US and Iranian officials are due to hold another, long-awaited round of talks on security in Iraq in Baghdad soon. "We hope there's a date soon," a US embassy spokeswoman said
