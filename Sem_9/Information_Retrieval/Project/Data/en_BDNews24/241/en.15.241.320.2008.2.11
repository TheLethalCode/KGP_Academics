 Baghdad, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Monday al Qaeda had been routed in Iraq but did not elaborate on the comment and warned that despite sharp drops in violence the situation in the country remained fragile. U.S. military commanders have said while al Qaeda was badly weakened, it remained a potent threat. The military still calls al Qaeda the greatest threat to Iraq's security and blames it for most major bombings. On Sunday, militants killed more than 50 people in a spate of attacks mainly in Iraq's north, where Sunni Islamist al Qaeda regrouped after being driven out of former strongholds in western Anbar province and from round Baghdad. Before meeting his top military commanders to discuss the pace of U.S. force reductions, Gates praised troops for bringing about a "pretty remarkable" change in Iraq. "What a difference you made -- al Qaeda routed, insurgents co-opted. Levels of violence of all kinds dramatically reduced," Gates said in a brief speech in Baghdad. "The situation in Iraq continues to remain fragile but the Iraqi people now have an opportunity to forge a better, more secure and more prosperous future," said Gates. No immediate comment was available from U.S. officials on Gates's comment about al Qaeda. President George W. Bush ordered 30,000 extra troops to Iraq a year ago to curb rampant sectarian violence between the Shi'ite Muslim majority and Sunni Arabs, once-dominant under Saddam Hussein and from whose ranks insurgents draw support. SWITCHING SIDES Many of those Sunni Arab insurgents have since switched sides, joining U.S.-backed neighbourhood security units to fight al Qaeda and patrol their own districts. U.S. troop numbers have begun to fall in Iraq because of an overall improvement in security in the past few months and as more Iraqi troops and police are trained and deployed. There are about 155,000 U.S. troops in the country. Gates, who arrived in Baghdad late on Sunday, told reporters travelling with him that his talks on troop levels with the U.S. military commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, would cover a "whole range of possibilities". By July, U.S. force levels will have dropped by five brigades, bringing numbers to roughly 130,000, or the same as before the additional deployments began in early 2007. Petraeus said in a CNN interview last month he would need some time to "let things settle a bit" after the initial reduction, prompting speculation he wanted to keep about 130,000 troops or more in Iraq well into the second half of the year. Only one of the five brigades has left Iraq so far, and Gates said he expected to hear about plans for removing the other four. He has said he hoped for reductions at the same pace in the second half of 2008. Hours before Gates flew into Baghdad, a suicide car bomb killed 33 people near the northern town of Balad in an attack on a checkpoint manned by local Sunni Arab security volunteers. At least 19 other people were killed in bombings and shootings on Sunday, one of Iraq's bloodiest days in months. Gates is visiting Baghdad a year after a U.S.-Iraqi security offensive was mounted with the aid of the extra 30,000 U.S. troops to halt the country's slide toward all-out sectarian war. Attacks across Iraq are down 60 percent since last June when the reinforcements became fully deployed. Gates, who in previous visits to Iraq has been critical of the Shi'ite-led government for failing to make progress toward national reconciliation, said the country's leaders "seem to have become energised in the last few weeks". Parliament passed a law last month that will allow former members of Saddam's Baath party to regain their jobs in the government and military, a major demand by Sunni Arabs.
