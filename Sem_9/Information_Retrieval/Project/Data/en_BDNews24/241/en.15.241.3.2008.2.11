<TITLE> Greek strikers plan to cripple transport, services </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Athens, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek city transport will come to a standstill, flights will be grounded and public services will shut down on Wednesday in a nationwide strike against government economic reforms, trade unions say. The ruling conservatives have pledged to push through reforms to make the economy more competitive and rescue Greece's ailing pension system, expected to collapse within 15 years, but have faced a series of strikes over the proposed changes. "The country will come to a standstill. Nothing will be moving," said Efstathios Anestis, a spokesman for the private sector workers umbrella union GSEE. "Greece's workers feel rage and resentment." Last week a senior government official said the government will propose merging scores of pension funds into 4-6 main funds, raising retirement ages for some jobs with early pension entitlements and giving incentives to stay at work longer. Unions have accused the government of making a U-turn since winning a second four-year term in September, after pledging not to raise the retirement age, cut pensions or raise contributions. They argue that the country's pension funds have been abused by the state, which has dipped into their money for decades and from time to time has halted contributions to some funds. "Workers won't take the government's continued bullying and constant raids on their social security funds," public sector umbrella union ADEDY said in a statement. "We will continue with new strikes until the government changes policies." GSEE and ADEDY, which jointly represent more than 2.5 million workers, will also hold a rally in central Athens on Wednesday. Public transport employees plan to walk off the job, leaving the country's urban centres without buses, trains and other forms of public transport. Hospital doctors will only treat emergencies, while banks and other government services will also be affected. Air traffic controllers said no airplanes would take off or land at Athens' international airport, except military, medical and government aircraft. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis will unveil concrete pension reforms in parliament on Feb. 15, after vowing recently to stick to his reforms course depite stiff union opposition and repeated labour unrest. Unions have pledged to continue with strikes until their demands are met
