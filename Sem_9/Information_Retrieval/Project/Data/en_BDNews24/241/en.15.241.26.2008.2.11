 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team Monday got off to a flying start in the warm-up match for the ICC U/19 World Cup with a 167-run win over hosts Malaysia. Bangladesh restricted Malaysia to 103 all out in 39.4 overs after posting a fighting total of 270 for seven in 50 overs at the Royal Military Academy Ground. M Mithun led from the front to blaze 81 runs while Nasir Hossain and Mahmudul Hasan chipped in with 36 and 31 to help their side go beyond the 250-mark. Malaysia, in reply, fell in trouble in face of some tight bowling from spinners Suhrawardi Shuvo and Nasir. Nasir and Shuvo grabbed three wickets each for 23 and 24. The ICC U/19 World Cup is scheduled for Feb 17 to March 2 in Malaysia.
