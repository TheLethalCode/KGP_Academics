<TITLE> Italy`s Veltroni makes low-key start to campaign </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Spello, Italy, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rome mayor Walter Veltroni began his bid to become Italy's prime minister with a low-key speech in an Umbrian village on Sunday, pledging to cut taxes and revitalise a nation tired of bickering politicians. In stark contrast to rival Silvio Berlusconi who launched his campaign a day earlier to the backdrop of a roaring crowd, giant screens and blaring music, Veltroni spoke to a small crowd in the town square next to the local cemetery. The 52-year-old, leading Italy's centre-left since Prime Minister Romano Prodi's 20-month government collapsed last month, is banking on a message of change to defy polls that suggest Berlusconi will return to power in April's election. Seizing on a widespread feeling of gloom -- Italy posted the biggest fall of consumer morale in the world in the second half of 2007 -- Veltroni said it was time to revive a nation weighed down by divisive politics and despondency. "Our country needs to get back to wanting the future," he said, standing against a rural background of houses and cypress trees in Spello, in central Italy. "Today, those who work and live here know that our country seems scared, seems to have lost the security that tomorrow will be better than today." Veltroni did not outline the main policies the Democratic Party he founded with Prodi last year would campaign on, but said economic progress under the outgoing government meant taxes could now be lowered. The party plans to run a solo campaign for the election without allies like the far-left parties that were part of Prodi's government. Berlusconi has similarly called on right-wing allies to unite under a single banner and urged Italians not to vote for small parties running alone. Veltroni, a former editor of the left-wing daily L'Unita and an arts buff, stayed true to his intellectual image throughout his speech, avoiding the flamboyance that is Berlusconi's hallmark. While the 71-year-old Berlusconi bounded up to the stage on Saturday sporting a tie-less casual look and exhorted Italians to avoid the trap of Marxism, Veltroni stood next to an Italian flag and read out his prepared speech to polite applause. Berlusconi's spokesman quickly dimissed Veltroni's speech as resembling a "Sunday sermon"
