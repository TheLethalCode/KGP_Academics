<TEXT>
 London, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Xstrata shareholder Glencore is concerned about the terms of a proposed 50 billion pound ($97.5 billion) merger between Xstrata and Brazilian miner Vale , The Sunday Telegraph reported. Glencore, headed by financier Ivan Glasenberg, has expressed concerns about key structural and tax issues, the paper said, without identifying its sources. Swiss trader Glencore, which holds just over 35 percent of Xstrata, according to Reuters data, wants shares in the merged company rather than cash, the paper said. It added that Glencore had opened negotiations over price, asking for the equivalent of 50 pounds per share from Vale. Hedge funds with positions in Xstrata say Vale has indicated that it is prepared to pay between 40 and 45 pounds a share, the paper said. Xstrata's shares closed just short of 39 pounds on Friday. Glencore and Xstrata could not immediately be reached for comment
