 MADRID, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The popularity of Spain's ruling Socialists slid four weeks before general elections, a poll showed on Sunday, after the conservative opposition jumped on immigration as its new policy battle ground. A snap poll taken by Metroscopia showed the Socialists (PSOE) lost 0.3 percentage points since the last poll about 10 days ago while the centre-right Partido Popular (PP) gained 0.2 points.

"There are various reasons behind it but it's clear the worsening economic data is key," ABC said in an editorial. Last week, data showed the services sector shrinking to an all time low, jobless figures jumping and confidence falling. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has said the economy, which has grown much faster than most other European countries in the past years, is still in good shape and will be boosted again by a glut of public works coming up. The most positive Sunday reading for Zapatero, who this weekend won the backing of artists like film director Pedro Almodovar and singer Ana Belen, was in the El Mundo daily, where a Sigma Dos survey showed both parties losing ground to smaller parti
