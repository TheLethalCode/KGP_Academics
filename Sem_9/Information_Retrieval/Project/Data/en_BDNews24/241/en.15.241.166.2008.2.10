 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited clinched the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament title Sunday with a 3-2 win over Arambagh KS in the final at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Abul Hossain, Jahid Hasan Emili, Jahid Parvez Chowdhury struck one goal apiece for the sky-blues while Dominic and Liton netted one goal each for Arambagh KS in an entertaining final. Abahani were not up to mark against lowly Arambagh compared to their performance against arch-rivals Mohammedan SC, who quit from the semifinal losing to Abahani 1-0. "We were not in rhythm today as the players might have taken the opponents lightly, but we are happy with the result," said Abahani captain Arif Khan Joy. The Dhanmondi-outfit, who started the tournament with a loss against Badda Jagarani, were all smiles taking the season's first trophy with some brilliant performances from the forwards. Abahani were boosted by reinstating striker Emili and playmaker Abul, who were on the sidelines in the semifinal. Emili and Abul gave Abahani a 2-0 lead in 23 minutes. Abul headed a Nazrul cross from the left home in the 18th minute while Emili drove a rebound home six minutes later when a Jahid shot came his way hitting Arambagh goalkeeper Piru. Capitalising on an Abul through, Jahid rattled the Arambagh woodwork in the 26th minute before Arambagh's Ugandan striker Kabuya Dominic pulled a goal back in the 35th minute with a perfect shot from the left. Dominic came close to levelling the margin in the 41st minute, but Abahani keeper Biplob B0hattacharya frustrated him for a corner. After the breather, minnows Arambagh apparently pressed hard over the giants, but they hardly overcame the Abahani defence, marshalled by Nazrul Islam, Prodeep Pordar, Wali Faisal and Ibnul Siraji. Jahid made the Abahani margin 3-1 in the 59th minute before Liton struck the second goal in the 79th minute for Arambagh KS. bdnew
