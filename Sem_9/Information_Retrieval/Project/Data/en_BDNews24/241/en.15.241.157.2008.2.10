 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)The chief adviser will hold talks with political parties after the Election Commission has completed its second round of dialogues, a government official said Sunday. "The government and the political parties make a team," the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters following a meeting of the interim cabinet at the CA's office. "The government and political parties will work in partnership for the sake of a fair election and the smooth transfer of power," Munaim said. The press secretary added that a final date to begin the dialogues had not been decided yet, or what issues would be discussed with the parties. Munaim said the interim cabinet meeting dealt with three proposals. The draft Consumer Rights Protection Act 2008 was returned to the commerce ministry for revision. The ministry will resubmit the draft act to the council of advisers after 15 days. Final approval was given to the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Amendment Ordinance 2008. The new law will allow kazis (Muslim marriage registrars) to receive their new, renewed or reinstated license from district administrations, rather than having to travel to Dhaka. The Fertiliser (Management) Amendment Ordinance 2008 was also given final approval. The amendment will ensure the retail price of fertiliser is clearly written on the sack in addition to the manufacturing date and description of contents. Food adviser AMM Shawkhat Ali told the meeting that India's imposition of a ban on rice export to Bangladesh would not affect the import underway of five lakh tonnes of rice, Munaim told reporters. Importers who opened letters of credit to buy rice from India prior to Feb 7 will not face any problems, the chief adviser's press secretary added. bdnews24.c
