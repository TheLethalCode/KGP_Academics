 London, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three youths were arrested on Tuesday in connection with two street attacks that left one man dead and another fighting for his life. In the first, two men aged 20 and 16 have been accused of murdering a teenager during a street attack in Bilton Grove, Hull, on Monday night. Police said the unnamed 17 year-old was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary before later dying. In the second, an unnamed 26 year-old was assaulted in Droylsden, Greater Manchester by a gang of youths. The victim had been walking from the pub when he was verbally abused and later attacked. "About eight teenagers surrounded the 26-year-old... and one of them punched him in the face," a police spokesman said. "The punch caused him to fall over and bang his head, knocking him unconscious." The man was in stable condition after earlier having been described as critical. A 17 year-old youth has been released on bail until March, pending further inquiries. Detective Inspector John Chadwick, of Tameside police, said in a statement: "This is an extremely serious assault that has left a man fighting for his life in hospital. "Although only one punch was actually thrown, this demonstrates how a single act of violence can have potentially fatal consequences."
