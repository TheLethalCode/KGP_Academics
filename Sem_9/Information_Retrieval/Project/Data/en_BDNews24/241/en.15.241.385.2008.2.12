<TITLE> Turkmenistan: `great revival` or more of the same? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ashgabat, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A year after Turkmenistan's new leader came to power promising change, doubts persist over how strongly the long-isolated Caspian nation wants to break with its past and push ahead with reforms. Sworn in on Feb. 14 last year after the death of absolute leader Saparmurat Niyazov, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov declared the start of "an era of great revival" and vowed to liberalise the economy and foster good ties with the West. A year on, analysts are questioning his commitment to genuine change. Niyazov's legacy -- a poor human rights record, repressive security apparatus and absence of press freedom -- still haunts Central Asia's top natural gas exporter. "It's clear that despite a lot of talk about reforms, the Central Asian nation is arguably no more open now than it was under the deceased despot Saparmurat Niyazov," New York-based Eurasia Insight wrote in a report. Locked away under first Soviet rule, then the eccentric 21-year reign of Niyazov, Turkmenistan is now at the centre of international energy diplomacy as Russia and the West compete for influence over its huge gas reserves, estimated at 3 trillion cubic metres. Its economy is still run along the lines of the Soviet command system. Western energy companies, which flocked to Turkmenistan last year to meet the new president, have yet to make any concrete investments. Analysts say Berdymukhamedov's promises of reform are overshadowed by his resolve to conduct a more independent energy policy and to diversify gas exports away from Russia, which still controls most of its natural gas flows. "Turkmenistan is trying to diversify its export markets and is prepared to defend its national interests. It's totally understandable," said Alexei Makarkin, an analyst with Russia's Centre for Political Technology. In December, it flexed its diplomatic muscle by halting gas supplies to Iran, citing technicalities. Iran criticised the move as "immoral" and called Ashgabat an unreliable partner. Despite agreeing to work with Russia on a new pipeline across Central Asia, Turkmenistan showed its claws again in November, demanding Russia pay more for its gas supplies. Berdymukhamedov has kept the West at arms length too, giving Europe no clarity on whether he might take part in the Nabucco pipeline, designed to diversify EU supplies away from Russia. REFORM? Niyazov, best known for banning gold teeth, locking up political dissenters and naming heavenly bodies after himself, ruled the nation as a personal fiefdom until his sudden death in late 2006. He showed little interest in outside contacts. He called himself Turkmenbashi the Great (Leader of the Turkmens). His spiritual guide, the Rukhnama (The Book of the Soul), is a still must-read for schoolchildren. Quietly drawing a line under his era, officials have gradually replaced portraits of Niyazov with pictures of the new leader, looking solemn, across the desert nation. That gave people hope that reform will continue, even if the pace is slow. "Liberalisation will go on, coupled with efforts to strengthen the ruling oligarchy," Makarkin said. "It's a long process. Turkmenistan is only making its first steps." Berdymukhamedov has lifted some restrictions on travel, taken steps to reform legislation, ended a seven-year ban on opera and circus, and visited Europe, Russia and the United States to promote his homeland as a new place to invest. He has vowed to redenominate the national currency, close the gap between the official and black-market exchange rates, and set up a network of cash machines to attract foreign business. "It's easier to breathe now," said Aman, a student. But Turkmenistan remains classified, along with North Korea, as the world's worst violator of press freedom by Reporters Without Borders. It is still off limits to most Western reporters and domestic media never criticise state policies. "Many of the totalitarian pillars set up Niyazov remain in place," Eurasianet said. Turkmenistan still has a large but unknown number of political prisoners to whom the Red Cross has had no access. There are no registered political parties other than the pro-presidential Democratic Party. "It's just too early to say," said Bekdyrdy-aga, a 70-year-old pensioner scraping a living on a $20 monthly pension. "Niyazov also started well."
