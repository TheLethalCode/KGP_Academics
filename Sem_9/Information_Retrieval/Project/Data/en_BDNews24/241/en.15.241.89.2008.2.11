 Manila, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has offered to provide the Philippines with up to $20 million worth of radar and surveillance equipment to guard its porous borders against Muslim militants and smugglers, Manila's defence secretary said. Gilberto Teodoro said at the weekend the country's armed forces would also need newer and faster boats to complement the surveillance system as the Philippines sets up a coastal watch network to tighten control at its maritime borders with Malaysia and Indonesia. "We've been in talks with the United States for the setting up of a coast watch system in the south," Teodoro told Reuters in an interview aboard an air force plane on the way back to Manila from Jolo island, a stronghold of al Qaeda-linked Muslim rebels. "They're willing to provide us the needed hardware. We were told the U.S. funding for our coast watch programme could be sourced from Washington's counter-terrorism programme under section 1206 of the National Defence Authorisation Act of 2006." Since 2002, the United States, Manila's closest security partner in the region, has deployed about 500 troops to help train and advise Filipino soldiers to fight Muslim rebels. During the same period, Washington has also provided about $500 million in military assistance and development projects and to win over the Muslim minority in the mostly Catholic nation. In 2006, Washington was authorised to spend $100 million for projects involving 15 countries, mostly in Asia and Africa, to build capacity for counter-terrorism operations or stability operations in which the U.S. military participates. But the Philippines was not included in the original Section 1206 plan. "We were promised funding under Section 1206 after 2006 when they learned that Australia was helping us set up a border control mechanism in the south," Teodoro added. Another defence official said Manila was promised funds from the Section 1206 programme when Washington suspended military aid to Thailand after the Thai army seized power in September 2006. FAST BOATS Teodoro said it would take several years for Manila to set up a coast watch system guarding the country's vast maritime borders. "We already have a modest system, but we sorely lack the assets that could interdict illegal entrants into our borders," said Teodoro. "We can easily spot an illegal entrant, but if we don't have the boats to catch those crossing into our borders, our coast watch system would be useless." Philippine navy officials said they were hoping to get fast, 400-tonne cyclone-class patrol boats from Washington to outrun boats used by smugglers and Islamic militants. Muslim extremists, including two key suspects in the 2002 Bali bombings, use the Philippines' southern islands as bases, and the United States and other regional powers want to stop them slipping through unpatrolled harbours and coves. Western and Philippine intelligence agencies say small arms, illicit narcotics and consumer goods are also smuggled into the Muslim south.
