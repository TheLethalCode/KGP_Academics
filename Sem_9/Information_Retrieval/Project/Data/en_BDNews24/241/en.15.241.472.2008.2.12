<TITLE> Nigeria studying monthly dollar releases to states </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abuja, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria is studying the possibility of releasing monthly funds to state governments in dollars rather than in naira but no decision has been taken, Finance Minister Shamsuddeen Usman told Reuters on Tuesday. Most of Nigeria's revenue comes from oil exports in dollars. The money is collected centrally, converted to naira and then shared between the federal, state and local governments based on a complex formula including factors like population. "The issue is still being discussed. We need to look at the full implications. A committee is working on it," Usman said in response to a question on whether monthly disbursements in dollars had started or were due to start imminently. Usman said he did not wish to speculate on when the committee would finish its work. Foreign investors have been closely following debates on this issue because the change would have implications for inflation and for the naira-dollar exchange rate. Many analysts say it would favour further naira appreciation. Foreign interest in the Nigerian forex market has been increasing, according to the central bank, which attributes a trend of swift naira appreciation seen since the middle of last year to increasing foreign investment. A plan to disburse part of the monthly allocations to state governments in dollars was first announced by the central bank last August as part of a raft of new measures that were later put on ice by the presidency because it wanted its say. Since then, the idea has been working its way through government. The central bank says dollar disbursements would help control inflation by reducing naira liquidity. COMPLEX PICTURE Analysts agree that the change would be good in terms of liquidity management and would also help deepen the interbank foreign exchange market, but they see other implications. "The bottom line fundamentals shouldn't be forgotten," said Razia Khan, regional head of research for Africa at Standard Chartered Bank in London. "Nigeria earns a lot of its fiscal revenue in dollars and will be spending it in naira, so the more the naira appreciates the less there will be fiscal revenue to spend. The whole picture does need to be thought through carefully," she said. Usman said that was what the government was doing. "We don't want to solve one problem and create another. We need to be sure we will not create a new opportunity for malpractice. We need to look at whether the states are ready to manage dollar allocations," he said. Some states have already received dollars through a December disbursement, separate from the regular monthly allocation, of $1.8 billion from a windfall oil savings account. That money was to square accounts between the federal and state governments following a 2005 sovereign debt relief deal in which Nigeria used $12 billion of the windfall savings to pay debts to the Paris Club in return for an $18 billion write-off. Some of the $12 billion used to pay the creditors belonged to states that did not owe debts to the Paris Club, hence the $1.8 billion was to compensate them. The government has approved plans to disburse an additional $4 billion from the same oil savings account in three tranches over the next five months. That will also be in dollars in order to limit the inflationary impact, Usman said.
