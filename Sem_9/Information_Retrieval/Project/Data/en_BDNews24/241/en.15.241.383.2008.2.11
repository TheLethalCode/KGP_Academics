<TEXT>
 New York, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks fell on Monday on renewed worries about credit losses after insurer American International Group Inc received a rebuke from its auditors for how it valued some credit derivatives. In addition, the first shake-up in the composition of the Dow Jones industrial average in four years added to the turbulence. The blue-chip index replaced Honeywell International Inc and Altria Group with Chevron Corp and Bank of America Corp. AIG's shares fell 10.5 percent to $45.37, its worst one-day percentage drop since the 1987 stock market crash. But tech share losses were limited as deal news lent the sector some support. Yahoo Inc rejected Microsoft Corp's takeover bid as too low, raising the possibility of a higher offer. Motorola Inc and Nortel Networks Corp may combine their wireless networking units, according to the Wall Street Journal. For details, see ID:nL11644822. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 65.51 points, or 0.54 percent, at 12,116.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 5.53 points, or 0.42 percent, at 1,325.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 4.92 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,299.93. AIG, the world's largest insurer, disclosed that its auditors said the company failed to account properly for derivatives related to risky debt, known as collateralized debt obligations. Economic jitters persisted after finance leaders from the Group of Seven major economies said during the weekend problems in the US housing market may lead to worsening conditions as debt-laden banks clamp down on credit. Honeywell shares fell 0.5 percent to $57.53, while Altria shares slipped 0.05 percent. Bank of America shares rose 0.5 percent to $42.40, and Chevron's shares rose 1.5 percent to $80.45. Yahoo shares rose 1.8 percent to $29.73, while Microsoft shares fell 2 percent to $27.98. Motorola's shares rose 1.3 percent to $11.41. Apple shares rose 2.5 percent to $128.67 after Citigroup added the iPod-maker to its top picks list. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average ended its worst week in nearly five years as investors unloaded shares of financials, home builders and other sectors at the center of the credit market crisis
