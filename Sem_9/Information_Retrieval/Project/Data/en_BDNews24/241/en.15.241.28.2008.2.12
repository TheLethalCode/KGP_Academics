 Washington, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko flew to Moscow on Tuesday to try to settle a row over debts for gas that threatens to cut Russian supplies of the fuel to Ukraine and put stable transit flows to Europe at risk. Russia, which has a record of gas rows with Kiev, is not keen to alienate its neighbour, torn between integrating with Europe and keeping traditionally close ties with Russia. Here are details of some issues which have affected Russian-Ukrainian relations: GAS: -- Russian gas monopoly Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $1.5 billion in payment arrears for earlier supplies. -- Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who clashed with Russia over gas during her earlier stint in office, has blamed Russian-imposed gas traders for racking up the debt. -- In 2006 a new pricing deal was clinched after Russia, supplier of a quarter of Europe's gas, briefly cut flows to its southern neighbour. The rest of Europe, reliant on Ukraine's pipelines for most of its Russian gas, also shivered. NATO MEMBERSHIP: -- President Yushchenko has been trying to launch the first steps in the long process of joining the NATO alliance. Yushchenko, Tymoshenko and the speaker of parliament submitted a letter last month calling to secure a "Membership Action Plan" (MAP), the first step on a fast-track plan to join NATO. -- Russia, long opposed to NATO's eastward expansion, has said Ukrainian membership of NATO would force it to take "appropriate" measures. It said Ukraine's leaders -- linked to the pro-Western "Orange Revolution" that sought closer integration with the West -- appeared bent on creating a new relationship with NATO to replace traditional ties with Moscow. -- At the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last month Yushchenko said Ukraine would never provoke conflict with its large neighbour. -- Russia had objected to NATO membership for the ex-Soviet Baltic states in the 1990s, but acquiesced when they were among 10 members inducted in 1997. It has renewed opposition to entry for Georgia and Ukraine, saying this would affect its security. BLACK SEA FLEET/CRIMEA: -- After years of dispute in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Soviet rule, Moscow and Kiev signed a 20-year deal in 1997 allowing Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimea peninsula alongside Ukraine's tiny navy. -- Moscow rents the facilities for $93 million a year. Ukraine hopes to increase the price. -- The two sides clashed in January 2006 over rights to a lighthouse linked to the Black Sea Fleet, days after solving the crisis over gas prices. Other disputes over property have since broken out periodically. -- Kiev's jurisdiction over Crimea, by virtue of a 1954 gift to Soviet Ukraine by Kremlin leader Nikita Khrushchev, remains a sensitive issue in the peninsula dominated by ethnic Russians. But major political rows of the 1990s have died away. -- Moscow accuses Kiev of undermining the Russian language and rewriting history by extending rights to Ukrainians who fought both Nazi and Soviet troops in World War Two.
