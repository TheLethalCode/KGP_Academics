 ASHGABAT, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Car drivers in Turkmenistan started paying eight times more for their petrol on Monday as part of the government's effort to push the Soviet-style economy towards a free-market model. Central Asia's top natural gas exporter raised petrol prices, unchanged since 1993 and among the lowest in the world, to 3,100 manats ($0.15) on Monday, a break from past policies when a litre of petrol cost less then a bottle of water. But to smoothen its "shock therapy" methods, the desert nation decided to give drivers a free monthly ration of 120 litres for town cars and 200 litres for trucks and other big vehicles, according to a government decree. Only those drivers who buy petrol above the limit would have to pay the market price, according to the decree. Isolated under Soviet rule and then the two-decade reign of former present Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenistan is now trying to liberalise the economy under its more reformist leader, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. But even at $0.15 per litre, domestic prices are among the lowest in the world. In neighbouring Kazakhstan, the average gasoline price is about $0.8, while in Russia it is $0.9. Turkmenistan lies on some of the world's biggest natural gas reserves, mainly under its vast Kara Kum desert. It plans to more than triple its gas production by 2030 from last year's planned 70-80 billion cubic metres of gas. Like in Niyazov times, people still get free electricity, water and gas from the state, a policy the new leader has promised to keep at least until 2030. The new petrol policy, despite the free ration, caused irritation among some drivers in the capital Ashgabat. "I make ends meet as a taxi driver," said 25-year-old Merdan. "The ration will last only a few days." Others were more receptive. "It's another step towards a market economy," said Serdar, a 45-year-old engineer. "People have to learn alternative ways to earn money." HUGE DEPOSITS The West views Turkmenistan's Caspian deposits as an alternative energy source for Europe as well, and is trying to woo Turkmenistan to engage in projects bypassing Russia. Berdymukhamedov has promised wide-ranging reforms to make the country friendlier towards foreign investors and has explored ways to lessen his nation's dependence on Russia's Gazprom for its natural gas exports. Seperately, the state natural gas producer said it plans to produce 73 billion cubic metres of gas and 10.8 million tonnes of crude this year. Turkmenistan has not published production figures for 2007. Last year it said it planned to raise gas production by 20 percent to 80 billion cubic metres in 2007. Turkmenistan has yet to publish its total natural gas reserves. According to BP's annual statistical review, its proved natural gas reserves stood at 2.9 trillion cubic metres at the end of 2006. The Caspian nation sells most of its gas through Russian gas monopoly Gazprom. At the end of last year Turkmenistan halted supplies of up to 23 million cubic metres to Iran, citing technical issues. Turkmenistan has not commented on its actions since and it remains unclear when exports might resu
