The city's plan is far more ambitious than legislation going through parliament to cut national emissions of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide by 60 percent by 2050. The 25 pound daily tax on vehicles in central London's Congestion Charge zone emitting 225 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometre would apply in the same way as the normal eight pounds daily charge does to all but the cleanest cars.
