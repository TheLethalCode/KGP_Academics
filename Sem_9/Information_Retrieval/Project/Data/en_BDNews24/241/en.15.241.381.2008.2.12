 Canberra, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aborigines playing didgeridoos and smeared with white body paint overturned hundreds of years of British tradition in Australia on Tuesday by taking part in the official opening of the nation's new parliamentary session. The indigenous ceremony came a day before Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was due to deliver an historic apology to Aborigines for past assimilation policies, in which aboriginal children were taken from their families to be raised in white households. Aboriginal elder Matilda House, standing barefoot and wearing a coat of animal skins, delivered a traditional message stick to Rudd on Monday to mark the first sitting of parliament since Rudd's Labor Party won power in last November's elections. "With this welcome comes a great symbolism, the hope of a united nation through reconciliation," House told the politicians and guests in a crowded Members Hall, directly beneath a giant Australian flag that flies over the building. The welcome was followed by traditional dances from Aborigines, some carrying boomerangs, and indigenous Torres Strait Islanders, with some of the performers wiping away tears over the symbolism of the event. Australia gained independence from Britain in 1901, but retained Britain's Westminster parliamentary traditions that date back hundreds of years. Governor-General Michael Jeffery, who represents Britain's Queen Elizabeth under Australia's constitution, was not present for the aboriginal ceremony. But Jeffery will attend a special sitting later on Tuesday to declare open the 42nd parliamentary session, with a speech that will outline Rudd's agenda for the next three years, including his strong focus on indigenous issues. APOLOGY Rudd on Wednesday will end an 11-year wait for members of the so-called "stolen generation" of Aborigines when he leads a parliamentary apology for Australia's past assimilation policies. A landmark report in 1997 found between one in three and one in 10 aboriginal children were removed from their families between 1910 and 1970, and recommended a government apology on behalf of the nation. But the previous conservative government under prime minister John Howard refused to apologise, offering only a statement of regret, saying present generations should not be held responsible for past government actions. Rudd told Tuesday's ceremony that when parliament first sat in Canberra in 1927, no Aborigines were invited and one aboriginal man who attended as a spectator was asked by police to leave because he was not dressed appropriately. "Today we begin with one small step, to set right the wrongs of the past. In this ceremonial way, it is a significant and symbolic step," Rudd said to applause. "We can be a bit slow sometimes. But we got here." Australia's 460,000 Aborigines make up 2 percent of the 20 million population and have a life expectancy 17 years less than white Australians. They have far higher rates of unemployment, imprisonment, alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence.
