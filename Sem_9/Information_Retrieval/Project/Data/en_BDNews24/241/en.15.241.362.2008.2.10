 JAKARTA, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A stampede at a rock concert in Indonesia's West Java province killed 10 people and injured several, police said on Sunday. Hundreds of fans had packed a hall to watch a performance by a little known punk rock band in the city of Bandung when the stampede began on Saturday night, said Brigadier Nano Kartono, a local police officer. Most of the dead were teenagers, he said. Bandung city police chief Bambang Suparsono said 15 concert organisers had been questioned, the state-run news agency Antara reported. "We received information that before the crush that ended with deaths, concert organizers distributed free drinks. There was a smell of alcohol," Antara quoted him as saying. Indonesia has seen a number of deadly stampede at concerts in recent years.
