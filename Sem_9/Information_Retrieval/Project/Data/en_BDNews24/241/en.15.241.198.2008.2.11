The Indian actor recently bought the IPL's Kolkata team from the Indian cricket board (BCCI) for more than $75 million. Rafique, who will retire when Bangladesh's home series against South Africa ends in March, said he was interested in the offer but would wait before making a decision. "I felt really honoured after getting a call from him (Shah Rukh). But at the moment I am only thinking about the home series against South Africa," the left-arm spinner told Reuters. South Africa are due to arrive in Bangladesh on Thursday to play two tests and three one-day internationals. The first test starts in Dhaka on Feb. 22. The series ends in March.
