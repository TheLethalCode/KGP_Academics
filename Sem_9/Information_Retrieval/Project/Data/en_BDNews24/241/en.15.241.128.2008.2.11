<TEXT>
 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three teenagers were sentenced to a total of at least 44 years on Monday for murdering a father-of-three who died in an attack outside his home. Garry Newlove, 47, was set upon after he confronted the group of youths who had vandalised a mechanical digger and another vehicle in Warrington, Cheshire last August. He died in hospital two days later from head injuries after being kicked like a football, police said. Adam Swellings, 19, Stephen Sorton, 17, and Jordan Cunliffe, 16, were found guilty of his murder at Chester Crown Court last month. Two other teenagers, aged 17 and 15, were acquitted after a trial lasting several weeks. Swellings, who had earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was sentenced to a minimum term of 17 years. The teenager had only been released from custody for an assault a few hours before the attack. Sorton was sentenced to a minumum of 15 years and Cunliffe to a minimum of 12 years. Newlove's death sparked a wave of emotion and public anger. It also led to the area's police chief calling for the legal drinking age in Britain to be raised to 21 to stem anti-social and violent behaviour. Tributes were lead by his youngest daughter, Amy, 12, who wrote a letter written at his hospital bedside. In it, she described her father as "the best dad anyone can ask for". Newlove, a sales manager, had met police three months before his murder to discuss setting up a Neighbourhood Watch scheme after a spate of youth crime in the area. His wife, Helen said the family was devastated. "The light has gone out of our lives," she said after the trial. "It's like a piece of our jigsaw has been lost forever. Detective Inspector Geoff Elvey, of Cheshire police, said after the trial the murder was a "vicious, senseless, and violent attack by a group of cowardly young men"
