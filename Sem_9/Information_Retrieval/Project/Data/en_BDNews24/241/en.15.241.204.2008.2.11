<TITLE> India likely to release rice shipments against pre-Feb 7 L/Cs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)India is likely to approve shipments of rice against the L/Cs opened before Feb 7 by Bangladesh businessmen, the Indian high commissioner said Monday. In an interview with Voice of America, Indian envoy Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty said it seemed that there would be no problem about the L/Cs opened before Feb 7 when India imposed restrictions on the exports of non-basmati rice through private channels. "I think there won't be any problem about the L/Cs opened before that date," he said. And, the restriction does not apply to the planned import of 5 lakh tonnes of rice from India through the government channel, he added. The development came a day after food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said the foreign ministry had been urged by Bangladesh importers and traders to persuade its Indian counterpart to help execute L/Cs already opened for rice imports from India. India had halted rice exports to Bangladesh through private channels, sparking fears among people of a further rise in prices. Shawkat Ali said Sunday that India's decision to stop rice exports to Bangladesh would not affect the local market. Bangladesh has already approved the purchase of 2.1 lakh tonnes of rice from India and the import of another 0.75 lakh tonnes would be approved at the next meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase, the adviser said. bdn
