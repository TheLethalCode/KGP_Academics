<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The Saraswati Puja festival sprang to life Sunday night as the images of the deity were installed at different locations around the city. Devotees began praying to Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and education, from the morning and distributed holly offerings in the hope of receiving a blessing from the deity. As in previous years, the celebration's biggest crowds flock to Dhaka University's Jagannath Hall. Altars at the university built by the departments reflect their particular academic interests. For the first time this year, Saraswati's altars are being displayed outside in the Jagannath Hall field. A festive spirit prevailed as colourfully-attired visitors of all ages came to see the students' artistic efforts. The political science department depicted the deity within a cage, guarded by two guards carrying spears. Postgraduate student Gautam Ray explains: "Our teachers were put behind bars and tortured for speaking freely." "The altar also represents how the educational system is in the grip of commercialisation." "Pay money: take degree, that's the mantra. Our Saraswati Devi is still imprisoned," he said. To the right of the hall gate the economics department's altar shows Saraswati in front of an outsized Tk 500 note and beside a large US dollar sign. Students from the department of geography and environment depicted the deity in a cyclone shelter to symbolise the power of nature and the importance of cyclone shelters. Many other departments contributed colourfull and interesting altars, although the most impressive was built by students from the Institute of Fine Art on Jagannath Hall Lake. Here a large white boat has been sculpted into the shape of two swans, which pull the goddess gracefully over the lake. bdn
