 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investigators hope to gain access to the burnt-out area of the Camden Market site on Monday to find the cause of the blaze that gutted a row of shops, a pub and warehouses. Fire crews were continuing to damp down the area in north London which erupted in a huge blaze on Saturday evening. Inspectors will not be allowed in until the canalside market, part of one of the capital's most popular tourist districts, is declared safe, a London Fire Brigade spokesman said. No one was injured but 20 fire engines and 100 firefighters were needed to tackle the blaze. The fire struck a row of shops and a stalls market by the canal side but the historic Camden Lock and Stables markets were undamaged. Road closures meant the Camden Lock market and bars, opposite the site of the fire, were closed on Monday, although the Stables was open, as it had been on Sunday. But traders said business was slow. "We expect today and tomorrow to earn absolutely nothing," said Dolly Momblli, who runs a gothic clothing stall. Another trader, who asked not to be identified, said he normally earned 1,000 pounds on Sundays, but the day after the fire he took home only 100 pounds. Roy Walker, who owns Walkers Quay Canal Boats and a cafe on the canal, said he was unable to get to his premises, even though they were undamaged. "I hate to think how much this is costing me, like everyone here, for every day of lost business," Walker said. He described the area hit by the fire as "complete devastation". Simon Pitkeathley, chief executive of local business organisation Camden Town Unlimited, said the blaze had damaged only a comparatively small part of the total market. "Camden is still very much open for business," he said. "By next weekend everything but the bit that was hit by the fire will be fully functional." The road closures also led to a diverted double decker bus smashing into a nearby railway bridge, flattening the roof. One passenger was taken to hospital with head injuries, the ambulance service said. The fire devoured the Hawley Arms pub, a popular haunt of celebrities including singer Amy Winehouse and model Kate Moss. Winehouse, who won five Grammy Awards on Sunday, highlighted the blaze in her acceptance speech. "This is for London, because Camden Town is burning down," she told the awards ceremony in Las Vegas by satellite from a studio in the British capital. Police said there was nothing to suggest the fire's origins were criminal. According to the Camden market Web site, it is the largest street market in Britain and the fourth most visited tourist attraction in London, with about 500,000 visitors a week
