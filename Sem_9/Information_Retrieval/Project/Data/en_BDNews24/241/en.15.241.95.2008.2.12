<TITLE> Venezuela wants to avoid US oil cutoff: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Caracas, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela wants to avoid cutting off oil supplies to the United States because it would be costly to the OPEC nation, a senior Venezuelan oil official said Tuesday. He spoke a day after world oil prices rose following a threat from President Hugo Chavez to stop sending oil to the United States over a legal dispute with U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil. The United States is Venezuela's top energy customer. Venezuela is the No. 4 oil exporter to America. Halting supplies is always "feasible" but would hurt the two nations' economies, said Bernard Mommer, a Venezuelan official who was a top negotiator in a nationalization drive last year that forced Exxon to leave the country. Asked on state television if it was "desirable" for Venezuela to cut off supplies to the United States, Mommer replied, "No. It would cost us money and would cost the other side money too." Industry analysts believe Chavez is unlikely to carry out his threat because it would slash his revenue. It would hamper state oil company PDVSA's business as the company faces a growing cash crunch due to heavy spending on the social programs that keep Chavez popular among the nation's poor. PDVSA refines much of its crude through U.S. refining subsidiary Citgo, which provides a crucial outlet for its heavy crude oil that can be difficult to sell on the open market. Chavez made his threat in response to an Exxon legal offensive that won international court orders freezing $12 billion in its assets. The self-styled socialist revolutionary says the largest U.S. company is a proxy in Washington's "economic war" against Venezuela.
