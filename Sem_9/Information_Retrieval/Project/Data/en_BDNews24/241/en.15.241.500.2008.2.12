 BERLIN, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Director Johnnie To aims to preserve something of the old Hong Kong in new film "Sparrow" before his native city changes forever. In competition at the Berlin Film Festival, `Sparrow' is a light-hearted story of a group of pick-pockets led by Kei who become entranced by a beautiful, mysterious young woman who is constantly running away from someone. When they discover that she is trying to escape the clutches of a big gangster boss, they cannot resist trying to save her, no matter what the risk. The action takes place in Hong Kong's old streets and alleyways, and the nostalgic feel and upbeat soundtrack led several critics to compare it to the 1964 French musical hit "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg".

To, 52, a favourite at European festivals and best known in the West for crime movies like "The Mission" and "Election", teams up once again with actor Simon Yam, who also appeared in the director's "PTU", "Election", "Exiled" and "Triangle". To said he believed Hong Kong and mainland Chinese cinema would gradually merge over time, although there were still important differences, particularly in the area of censorship. "Making films in Hong Kong, you still enjoy complete freedom, so that is an advantage Hong Kong directors have today." And Yam, who plays Kei opposite Taiwanese actress Kelly Lin in the female lead, hoped Hong Kong cinema would preserve some of its distinctive qualities. "As Hong Kong film becomes part of Chinese cinema, I hope it directors can still make something that is uniquely Hong Kong. In this film, the streets we shot in may be gone in 10 years so it was important we captured the
