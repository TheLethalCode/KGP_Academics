<TITLE> Yahoo set to rebuff Microsoft bid as too low </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yahoo Inc is set to reject Microsoft Corp's unsolicited bid, now worth $42 billion, as too low, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Saturday -- the first clear signal the board might be prepared to negotiate and sell the Internet media giant. The Wall Street Journal had quoted an unnamed source as saying Microsoft's offer of $31 per share was an attempt to "steal" the company and that Yahoo was unlikely to consider anything under $40 per share -- double its price in January. At $40 per share, the value of the cash and stock deal would be worth $51.1 billion. If completed, a merger of Microsoft and Yahoo would be the world's largest of two computer technology companies and create a formidable rival to Internet search and advertising leader Google Inc. Yahoo has been considering options, including negotiating a higher price and striking a deal with Google to take over its search operations to keep Yahoo independent, the Journal said. The newspaper reported Yahoo's board met on Friday. No alternate bidder has emerged and Wall Street has been betting that the likeliest outcome was for Yahoo board's to negotiate for a higher price from Microsoft. "Are they really seriously about nothing less than $40 or is it a negotiating tactic to try to get a richer price?" Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen said. "To me it sounds like a counter-negotiation tactic. Maybe they end up settling for $35, $36 or $37 a share." MOST LIKELY OPTION Last Monday, Citigroup analysts spelled out various scenarios, including having Yahoo seek a higher bid, find another bidder, see the deal derailed by regulators or strike a partnership with Google. The Wall Street firm predicted a higher bid was the most likely option but that a price of $40 per share "would seem very aggressive" because Microsoft would have a hard time justifying it against Yahoo's anticipated cash flows. For that reason, Citigroup said paying $30 to $31 per share for Yahoo was "reasonable." Microsoft's initial offer fails to take account of the risks that a merger between the world's largest software maker and Yahoo would be rejected by regulators, the Journal reported, citing "a person familiar with the situation." In a series of meetings over the past week, Yahoo's board has been weighing what alternatives the company may have. Yahoo spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler declined to comment on any specific actions of the board. "Yahoo's board is carefully and thoroughly evaluating the Microsoft proposal in the context of all of the company's strategic alternatives," she said. A Microsoft spokesman also declined comment. Microsoft's half-stock, half-cash offer was originally worth $44.6 billion or $31 per share -- a 62 percent premium to Yahoo's stock price. Since then, Microsoft shares have fallen and the deal is now worth $41.8 billion. A $40 price would represent a 109 percent premium to Yahoo's close at $19.18 per share on Jan. 31, before Microsoft went public with its bid. Yahoo stock last traded above $40 two years ago, before competitive pressures from Google, product missteps, management defections and repeated restructuring moves chopped the price below $20.
