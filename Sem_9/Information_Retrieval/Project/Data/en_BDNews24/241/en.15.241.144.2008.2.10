 ACCRA, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon captain Rigobert Song will play his 33rd African Nations Cup game in Sunday's final against Egypt (1700 GMT) and has no plans to retire. The 31-year-old centre back, taking part in his seventh Nations Cup tournament, believes he still has a lot to bring to the Indomitable Lions. "When I started in this team at the age of 17, I learnt a lot from the older players and I feel I still have much to bring," Song told a news conference on Saturday. The Galatasaray player, who won the Nations Cup final in 2000 and 2002, added: "This record (of 33 games) shows I still enjoy playing and as long as I'll enjoy it, I'll go on." Song, who also played the 1994, 1998 and 2002 World Cups, earned his first cap with Cameroon in September 1993 against Mexico and has notably played for Liverpool, West Ham United and RC Lens. "I am very pleased with my career, there is nothing I regret when I look back," he said. Song was also looking forward to what he hoped would be one of the highlights of his career with Sunday's Nation's Cup final against Egypt. "They are a great team but if we lost the first game against them, it was because of individual mistakes that we have corrected," he said. "Now we don't care about who we are facing. We are here on a mission and it will be finished when we will have brought the Cup back to the streets of Yaounde." Cameroon lost 4-2 to Egypt in this year's Nations Cup group phase and were also defeated by the team in their only final loss in 1986. "These are only statistics and as statistics say, every series has an end. And we will end it tomorrow," said Cameroon coach Otto Pfister
