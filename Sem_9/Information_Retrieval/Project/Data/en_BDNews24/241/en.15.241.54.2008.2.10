 TOKYO, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, which briefly jumped in January, has fallen back to levels low enough to make him cautious about calling a general election anytime soon, an opinion poll released on Sunday found. The poll was conducted less than two weeks after Japan's ruling and opposition parties narrowly averted a showdown in parliament over a controversial gasoline tax that could have delayed passage of the government budget and triggered a snap election. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which heads an opposition bloc that controls the upper house, argues that the tax, which expires on March 31, should be scrapped. According to an opinion poll conducted on Feb. 9-10 by Kyodo news agency, support for Fukuda's cabinet has fallen to 35.6 percent, a loss of 5.8 percentage points from a January poll and just a fraction above December's all-time low of 35.3 percent.

A majority of voters, 57.1 percent, were against extending the tax once it expires, a drop of 15.1 percentage points from the previous survey. Those in favour of extension made up 31.6 percent. Some recent opinion polls have shown that nearly half of voters do want to see power pass to the Democrats from Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of the past five decades. But the Democrats, a fractious amalgam of former LDP members and socialists, face a high hurdle convincing voters they are ready to assume power. In the weekend poll, 30.5 percent said they supported the LDP and 26.2 percent favoured the Democra
