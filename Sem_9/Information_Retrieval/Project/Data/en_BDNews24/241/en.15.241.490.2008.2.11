 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League's main target now is dialogue with the caretaker government, one that it wants to make successful at any cost, the party's presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Monday. With this aim, the party has started talks with members of the 14-party alliance, and held talks with the Workers Party Sunday. It is scheduled to sit with Samyabadi Dal Tuesday. Asked what was the main aim of the Awami League's political activities at the moment, Amu told bdnews24.com: "Our main aim is dialogue. We will go to dialogue and discuss. Let us see what happens then." At a discussion meeting in his home Friday, acting AL president Zillur Rahman said the party would try to build up a 'grand alliance' with pro-liberation forces, besides like-minded parties, ahead of the elections. However, AL did not discuss the issue with Workers Party members at a meeting Sunday. After the meeting, AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed and WP president Rashed Khan Menon said they did not discuss the issue of forming a grand alliance. Amu also told bdnews24.com Monday: "There was no discussion on a grand alliance with the Workers Party." "If anybody wants to discuss the issue, we will discuss it. Whatever takes place will happen on the basis of discussion." A member of the Workers Party present at Friday's meeting, on condition of anonymity, said: "Zillur Bhai spoke of grand alliance without consulting anybody of the party." "Awami League has not yet taken any formal decision on this issue." An AL leader also present at the meeting at Zillur's residence Friday told bdnews24.com: "In the past we made mistakes." "If we form a grand alliance this time, we will have a broader framework to include those who may otherwise join our political opponents," he said. "Zillur Rahman spoke of a grand alliance to prevent this." bdnews
