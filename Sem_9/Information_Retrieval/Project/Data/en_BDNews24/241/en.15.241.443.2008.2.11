<TITLE> Rigging unlikely to save Musharraf`s allies: Sharif </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Lahore, Pakistan, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's allies are engaged in massive rigging in the run-up to an election but it might not be enough to win, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif said on Monday. Musharraf is not taking part in the Feb. 18 elections for a new parliament and provincial assemblies but his authority, and even his position as president of nuclear-armed Pakistan, are likely to be challenged if the opposition wins and forms a government. Sharif and his allies in the party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto have complained of widespread efforts to rig the vote in favour of the party that backs Musharraf and has ruled under him. Sharif released a report on Monday giving details of the dirty tricks he says have been going on, but said they might not be enough to rob the opposition of victory. "We think we have so much of a margin, a cushion, that this rigging, perhaps, will not be sufficient to turn our winning candidates into losing candidates," Sharif told a small group of reporters at his house in Lahore. "They do not enjoy the support of the masses. The gap is very big. The gap is huge," he said. The election is seen as a three-way race between the parties of Sharif and Bhutto and the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League (PML). SYMPATHY VOTE Analysts say Bhutto's party can expect a sympathy vote after her assassination on Dec. 27 while Sharif has won support despite his mixed record as prime minister for being seen to stand up to the increasingly unpopular Musharraf. Musharraf's popularity has plummeted over the past year, especially since March when he tried to dismiss the country's top judge. In November, he outraged many Pakistanis by imposing a six-week stint of emergency rule, during which he purged the judiciary and gagged the media. Sharif has said he would be willing to form a coalition with anyone who agreed to his demand that sacked judges be reinstated, a decision Bhutto's widower and de facto political successor Asif Ali Zardari says the next parliament should decide. The stance on the fate of the judges is a main difference between Sharif and Bhutto's party. Compounding the troubles of the pro-Musharraf party is widespread anger over rising prices and shortages of staple flour, as well as ever more frequent power cuts. Musharraf rejects opposition complaints of pre-poll rigging and turned down opposition demands to reconstitute a caretaker government, set up in November to oversee the polls, and to disband district governments that the opposition say are dominated by Musharraf's allies. The opposition also say the Election Commission is subservient to the government and is failing to act on their complaints. Musharraf says election procedures have been refined to prevent cheating and the vote will be free and fair. He also says he will work with whoever becomes the next prime minister, but analysts say confrontation between the president and an opposition-dominated parliament is possible, prolonging political instability in the important US ally facing a rising tide of militant violence. Sharif was barred from standing in the election because of past criminal convictions he says were politically motivated. He told a news conference earlier on Monday the disqualification of him and his politician brother, Shahbaz Sharif, was unconstitutional and part of the government's efforts to rig the election result. He said other incidents of rigging included fake entries on the electoral roll, the existence of thousands of fake identity cards which would allow multiple voting, illegal donations of government funds and illegal involvement of district governments in the campaign. "The entire state machinery, resources, exchequer and influence of the outgoing and caretaker ... governments have been and continue to be deployed in the implementation of the exposed master pre-poll rigging plan," he said
