 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)The 42 artefacts sent to Paris for an exhibition at the Guimet Museum will be brought back to Dhaka on Feb 23, an adviser said Monday. "A team of Bangladesh government is already in Paris to take the artefacts back. The artefacts will be brought to Dhaka on Feb 23," cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Choudhury told bdnews24.com by phone. "An Air France cargo flight carrying the artefacts will leave Paris on Feb 22 and reach Dhaka without stopover," she said. The government and the Guimet Museum last year signed a deal on exhibiting some Ganges-delta artefacts at the museum in Paris. According to the agreement, Bangladesh sent 42 artefacts to the French capital, with a plan to send the second consignment of 145 artefacts amid, protests from cultural activists. But two statues of Hindu god Vishnu went missing from the cargo village of Zia International Airport on Dec 22 after those were handed over to Air France officials, en route to Paris. Later, the broken pieces of the two statues were recovered from a dumping ground from Aminbazar, RAB officials said. Some members of the gang were arrested with links to the theft. The police officials initially blamed the theft on the Air France authorities. But the French embassy in Dhaka alleged that a group opposing the dispatch hatched a "conspiracy" to embarrass France. Amid widespread criticism, the council of advisers decided not to send the second consignment to Paris. The then cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri resigned, taking responsibility for the theft. bdn
