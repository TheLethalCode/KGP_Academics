 Paris, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A report that French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde tendered her resignation to President Nicolas Sarkozy last week is without foundation, a top aide of Sarkozy said in an interview released on Tuesday. France's BFM radio reported on Friday that Lagarde had offered to resign on February 6 over Sarkozy's efforts to save a steelworks in eastern France, but was asked to stay on. "This rumour has absolutely no foundation," Sarkozy's Chief of Staff, Claude Gueant, said in an interview with weekly magazine L'Express released ahead of publication in Thursday's edition. Steel giant ArcelorMittal unveiled plans last month to close its Gandrange plant by the start of 2009, which would result in 600 job cuts. The news drew strong criticism from trade unions and politicians in France and Luxembourg, where the group is headquartered.
