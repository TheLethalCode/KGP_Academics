<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has deferred until Tuesday the government appeal hearing on the High Court's cancellation of an extortion case against Sheikh Hasina. Sunday saw a six-member full bench of the Appellate Division headed by acting chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim set Feb 12 for the hearing. The Supreme Court had earlier fixed Sunday to begin hearing the government appeal against the verdict that dismissed the case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against the former prime minister. But Hasina's lawyers told the Appellate Division bench Sunday that the appeal filed by the government was irregular as it did not fulfil all the required formalities. The High Court ruling was given on a writ petition filed by Hasina challenging the legality of transferring the case proceedings under emergency powers rules. Meanwhile, the case was being tried in a special courtroom set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises. The High Court cancelled the extortion case on Wednesday after ruling illegal the transfer of the case for trial under EPR. The government immediately appealed to the Chamber Judge Court of the Appellate Division for a halt of the verdict. Attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal, acting for the government, said Sunday that the Supreme Court had already granted extra time Thursday upon a request made by Hasina's lawyers. The government side was ready Sunday morning for the hearing, he added. Hasina's lawyer barrister Rafiq Ul Haque submitted to the bench that until the appellant corrected the flaws in the submission of the appeal, the court should not continue with the hearing. Rafiq added that he would not take part in the hearing otherwise. Fida M Kamal said that the issue was of public importance and so he requested the bench to continue with the hearing, saying it should not be further deferred. The bench, addressing both parties at this point, said all must abide by the rules and the court should also conduct its business as per the law. The rule of law must prevail for the judiciary to maintain its efficacy and significance, it added. The Appellate Division bench ordered the government to rectify the flaws in the submission of their appeal. Back in his office, the attorney general told reporters that the government appeal had duly been included in the appeal court's cause-list for Sunday after allowing Hasina's lawyers extra time for preparation. Barrister Fida M Kamal also said such a case of public importance is likely to have crucial impact on other similar cases, but it has now been deferred again as Hasina's lawyers have objected to the hearing. Barrister Shafique Ahmed, another of Hasina's lawyers, told reporters that the government while filing the appeal appended only a copy of Hasina's writ petition but did not furnish all the other related documents, which made the appeal faulty. He added that the trial court cannot resume proceedings Monday of the Azam J Chowdhury case filed against Hasina, as had been earlier scheduled, because the HC had meanwhile dismissed the case. The case filed on June 13 charges the former prime minister and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim with extorting Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam J Chowdhury, during Hasina's 1996-2001 term, in exchange for a contract to build a power plant. Hasina was arrested on July 16. The case was brought under emergency powers rules the following day when she was shown arrested in the case. On July 24, a charge sheet was submitted to the court that included Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana as co-accused. bdnews24.com
