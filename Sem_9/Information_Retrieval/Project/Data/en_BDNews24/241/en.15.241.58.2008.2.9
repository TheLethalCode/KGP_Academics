<TITLE> UK Archbishop faces calls to go over sharia remark </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rowan Williams, spiritual leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans, faced calls to resign on Saturday for suggesting that the introduction in Britain of some aspects of Islamic law was unavoidable. The Archbishop of Canterbury tried to quell the storm by denying he had called for Islamic law, known as sharia, to be introduced alongside British law. In a BBC interview on Thursday, he referred to the use of sharia in some personal or domestic issues, much like orthodox Jews already have their own courts for some matters. Asked if sharia needed to be applied in some cases for community cohesion, Williams said: "It seems unavoidable." Williams faced a torrent of critical headlines for a second day on Saturday and the mass circulation Sun newspaper launched a campaign to remove him from office. The Sun printed a form so readers could make a "complaint of misconduct" against Williams who it said had destroyed his credibility and "given heart to Muslim terrorists". Some bishops criticised Williams' remarks and several members of the Church of England's governing body, the general synod, called for his resignation. "I don't think he is the right man for the job any longer ... At best it was politically inept and at worst it was sheer foolishness," general synod member Alison Ruoff told Sky News. "Christians, particularly in Islamic countries who are being severely persecuted, are really incredibly upset," she said. However, she said there was no chance of a general synod meeting next week forcing him out. Newspapers quoted friends of the archbishop -- who is already battling divisions within his church over gay priests -- as saying he was in shock at the hostile reaction to his words. A statement on the Archbishop of Canterbury's Web site defended Williams. "The Archbishop made no proposals for sharia ... and certainly did not call for its introduction as some kind of parallel jurisdiction to the civil law," it said. DEBATE Sharia is the body of Islamic religious law based on the Koran, the words and actions of the Prophet Mohammad and his companions, and rulings of Islamic scholars. It covers issues including worship, commercial dealings, marriage and penal laws. In his BBC interview, Williams said some provisions of sharia were already recognised under British law and he noted that orthodox Jews are already allowed to use their own courts to settle some issues based on religious law. At least 10 Islamic courts, dealing mainly with divorce or financial disputes, operate in Britain, news reports said. In the United States, too, sharia has been applied locally in some court cases involving domestic issues such as child custody and inheritance. Williams said he was not endorsing the harsh punishments meted out in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, where murderers and drug traffickers are publicly beheaded or hanged. Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying Islamic law would be "in tension" with fundamental aspects of Britain's legal system. Other church leaders sprang to Williams' defence. Dean of Salisbury June Osborne described some of the reaction to his words as "frenzied", telling BBC News 24 it raised the question: "Is this an untouchable subject for us?" Williams' comments have been welcomed by some Muslim groups, but the government said it was out of the question that the principles of sharia could be used in British civil courts. The issue of integrating Britain's 1.8 million Muslims has been widely debated since July 2005, when four British Islamists carried out suicide bombings on London's transport system, killing 52 people
