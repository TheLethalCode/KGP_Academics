<TITLE> Power sector to miss out on Tk 630 crore: official </TITLE>

 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Energy Affairs Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  About Tk 630 crore of the Power Division's total allocation under the annual development programme will remain unused due to less project implementation this year, an official said Monday. A 150-megawatt power plant in Chandpur did not receive Tk 180 crore in funding due the cancellation of a related agreement. In addition, Tk 450 crore targeted for projects under the Sustainable Power Sector Development Programme, which were to be financed by the Asian Development Bank, may not be implemented this year. A ministerial meeting Monday at the energy and mineral resources ministry discussed progress in ADP project implementation in the power sector. Power Division secretary Faozul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com: "We are trying to complete the agreements made under the Sustainable Power Sector Development Programme." He said the withdrawal of restrictions on new electricity connections to households and businesses in rural areas would speed up the pace of ADP implementation. An official from the Power Division, preferring anonymity, said Tk 3,778 crore had been allocated to the power sector under the ADP this fiscal year. The revised ADP budget for the current fiscal year in the power sector has reduced the initial estimate by over Tk 600 crore. In the first half of the current fiscal year, the Power Division has so far spent Tk 674 crore of ADP funds. The official said that ADP spending commonly remains low in the first half of a fiscal year, while tenders are floated and agreements signed, although progress picks up in the latter half of the year. He hoped that up to 90 percent of the development programmes would be implemented by the end of the year. bdnews
