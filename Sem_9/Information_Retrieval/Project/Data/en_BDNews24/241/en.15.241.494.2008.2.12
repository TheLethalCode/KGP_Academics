 LONDON, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British consumer price inflation rose last month to its highest since June 2007 but the rise was smaller than most economists had forecast, official data showed on Tuesday. The figures are likely to provide some relief to Bank of England policymakers after data on Monday showed factory gate inflation rising at its highest rate in more than 16 years. Sterling fell as investors bet the Bank of England would continue cutting interest rates to shore up the economy. The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices fell by a larger than expected 0.7 percent in January. Compared with the same month last year, consumer prices were 2.2 percent higher, below forecasts for a reading of 2.3 percent. The "core" rate, which excludes oil, food, energy and tobacco, eased to 1.3 percent, the lowest rate since August 2006.

In the past, utility bill changes were phased in over four months. As from next month's release, changes will take effect straight away, meaning stiff price hikes announced by utility providers over the last month could cause a sharp spike higher. The ONS also said on Tuesday it would change seasonal weighting for fruit and vegetables to annual weighting, reflecting the fact that most items are now available all year round. The main upward impact came from transport costs, which were up an annual 6.4 percent in January -- the fastest rate in more than 11 years. The cost of fuels and lubricants rose nearly 20 percent on the year, the highest rate since records began in 1997. Retail price inflation, the basis for most wage deals, rose by 4.1 percent on the year, in line with expectatio
