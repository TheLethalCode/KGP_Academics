<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com) - Some 1,000 students of Jagannath University in the old part of the city demonstrated Tuesday to demand better educational and residential facilities. They marched through the campus and seized the office of the vice chancellor for one hour to extract a promise from the university authorities. But there was no report of violence. Students have been demanding improved facilities for one week, pressing a 10-point charter that included appointment of new teachers, better transportation facilities, freeing student dormitories from encroachers, and installing a medical centre and a gymnasium. They also said they needed a central library and a centre for teachers and students with a cafeteria. Various organisations, including some official ones, have encroached some of the dormitories meant for the students of the university. The protesters Tuesday announced that they would boycott classes for two hours everyday. They also threatened to stay away from examinations until their demands are met. Political science student Imran Hossain announced the protest plan. Vice chancellor Dr SI Khan said the university would be able to evict the encroachers from the student dormitories by March. The other problems would be dealt with in phases, he said, asking the protesters to remain peaceful. He said all examinations scheduled for Wednesday would take place. bdnews
