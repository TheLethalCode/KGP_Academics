 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  A magistrate's court in Dhaka Saturday sent a bank director to jail, pending trial, hours after the police arrested him on charges of "attempted adultery" with the wife of another man. Metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui ordered Ahmed Rajib Samdani, one of the directors of The City Bank Limited, to prison. Defence lawyers appealed for bail to Samdani but the court rejected their appeal. Gulshan police chief Obaidul Huq said the police had arrested Samdani at his Baridhara home. The charges involve an "attempted sexual relationship" and an alleged bid to marry the wife of one Rudis Karim, who could not be immediately identified with further details. Under Sections 497 and 498 of the Penal Code, adultery or sexual relationship with the wife of another man is a criminal offence. A convict has to serve a maximum of two years in jail with a fine or without, according to the Penal Code. bdnews24
