<TITLE> UK factory inflation soars, trade gap worst ever </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's factories are facing the strongest inflation pressures on record and ramping up prices to compensate, further eroding the room the Bank of England has to cut interest rates this year. The central bank, which cut borrowing costs to 5.25 percent last week, is worried inflation could spiral well above the 2 percent target this year but is also under pressure to lower the cost of money to shore up the economy as the outlook darkens. BoE Governor Mervyn King has already said this year looks like being the toughest for UK monetary policymakers since the central bank won independence from government in 1997. It could also prove a year to forget for the government as it may not be able to rely on a volley of rate cuts to help boost growth as Prime Minister Gordon Brown tries to build bridges with disillusioned voters. "The Monetary Policy Committee will have to let activity slow fairly sharply in order to prevent pipeline price pressures from finding their way into the high street," said Paul Dales, UK economist at researchers Capital Economics. "The producer prices figures are likely to prompt the market to reconsider its assumption that rates will fall fairly rapidly from here," he said. RECORD FACTORY INFLATION The prices of goods leaving factories rose at its fastest annual pace in more than 16 years in January, accelerating to 5.7 percent from 5.0 percent in December, according to official statistics released on Monday. Core output price inflation, which strips out food, drink, tobacco and petrol, shot to its fastest monthly rate since records began in 1986. And there is little sign price pressures are set to ease with the cost of raw materials surging 18.9 percent from a year earlier, the strongest rate since the series began 22 years ago. That was helped along by record oil prices up to $100 a barrel and soaring wheat costs. Crude oil costs rose more than 70 percent on the year, the highest rate in nearly 8 years, while domestic food prices soared 36 percent -- a record high. "These figures are unequivocally awful," said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec. With inflation expectations among Britons already running at record levels, the BoE may need to take more stringent action to keep prices in check other than talking tough. That's a far cry from the United States where fears of a recession are outweighing any concern about inflation and central bankers are willing to slash borrowing costs. British consumer price inflation figures are due on Tuesday, ahead of the central bank's quarterly inflation forecasts on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a rise to 2.3 percent last month from 2.1 percent in December. King has said there is a risk inflation could spike well above the 2 percent target this year and even above 3 percent, which would force him to write a letter to the government to explain what the BoE will do to bring inflation down. Faced with such worrying inflationary pressures, the BoE will want any economic slowdown to be steady enough to help keep a lid on prices but also calm enough to avoid a recession. The jury remains out on where the economy is headed but economists were worried by December's trade figures, also released on Monday, that came in worse than expected, and further signs of a quickly cooling housing market. TRADE GAP BLUES Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world ballooned to a new record last year at 87.4 billion pounds ($170.4 billion), against 77.4 billion in 2006. "The BoE is looking for the economy to rebalance with exports making a greater contribution to growth. However, going forward, exports seem set to be increasingly hit by slowing demand," said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight. And government figures showed annual house price inflation in Britain falling to its lowest rate for more than a year in December, further evidence that the once red-hot housing market is swiftly coming off the boil. "There is clearly a very real danger that a sharp housing market correction could occur," Archer said. "A sharp housing market correction would increase the risk of recession
