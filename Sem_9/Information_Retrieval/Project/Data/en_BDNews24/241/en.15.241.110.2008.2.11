<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The ongoing anticorruption drive will widen to the army, Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury was quoted to have told a Danish delegation Monday. A delegation of Danish Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) met the chief of the anticorruption watchdog. In a press briefing after the meeting, Helge Adam Moller, a PAC member, said the caretaker government had brought former ministers, businessmen and police officials to justice. Moller quoted the ACC chief as saying that the drive would also target the army. But he did not explain when. Moller said he believed the state of emergency would be lifted as soon as possible. On the death of a ward commissioner of Dhaka City in custody, the Danish official said democracy did not function under a state of emergency. Moller stressed the need for commitment from political parties to continue the anticorruption drive and protect independence of the commission if voted to power. Referring to Danish aid to different sectors in Bangladesh, Moller said they were bound to answer to their people how the money had been spent and the purpose of their visit was to see it for themselves. Other members of the delegation Svend Erik Hovmand, Mogens Lykketoft and Henrik Otbo were also present at the meeting with Hasan Mashhud. bdnew
