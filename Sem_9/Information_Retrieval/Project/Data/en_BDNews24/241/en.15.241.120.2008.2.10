<TITLE> Sarkozy son challenges father`s aide in mayoral poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The 21-year-old son of Nicolas Sarkozy said on Sunday he would join the mayoral race in the French president's former fiefdom of Neuilly, standing against a close aide to his father whose candidacy was backed by Sarkozy. Jean Sarkozy said he and two other candidates, Arnaud Teulle and Marie-Cecile Menard, had deserted David Martinon's ticket and would set up their own list for next month's poll in the posh suburb, west of Paris, of which his father was once mayor. Newspaper Le Figaro had reported on Saturday that Martinon, the president's spokesman, might step down as the official candidate of Sarkozy's UMP after an informal poll suggested he might lose to Jean-Christophe Fromentin, a local businessman standing as an independent conservative. "This is a city with a very strong personality and a very strong identity, which requires people that are profoundly attached to it -- people it (the city) knows and whom it can trust," Sarkozy's son told France Info radio. "The people of Neuilly have asked Arnaud, Marie-Cecile and me ... to work together, and work with everyone," he said. Teulle and Menard were previously on Martinon's ticket, while Jean Sarkozy had campaigned for him. Officials at Martinon's campaign headquarters, who had earlier denied he would drop out of the mayoral race, were not immediately available to comment. Martinon, 36, made an appearance in the streets of Neuilly on Sunday morning but declined to comment, media said. He was due to accompany Sarkozy to French Guiana later today. Sarkozy's Elysee palace said it would make no comment on the situation, while UMP officials sought to avoid taking sides. "They (Sarkozy, Teulle and Menard) are people of quality, who have lived in Neuilly for ever and know their city well ... What they are expressing must be heard and taken into consideration," Patrick Devedjian, the UMP Secretary General, a long-time Sarkozy ally, told France 2 television. "On the other side, David Martinon is a boy that entered this campaign with a lot of conviction. This is a difficult campaign and he is facing big difficulties," Devedjian added. Martinon announced his candidacy on Sept. 30 in the presence of President Sarkozy but his perceived carpetbagger status has hampered his campaign and he has so far failed to win over residents of the wealthy suburb. Devedjian said the UMP would hold a meeting on Monday night to decide who will run under its banner in Neuilly. The first round of voting is due to take place across the country on March 9, with a second scheduled a week later. The squabble may be another headache for Sarkozy, whose ratings have plunged in recent months due to widespread public discontent over his handling of the economy and what many see as over-exposure of his private life
