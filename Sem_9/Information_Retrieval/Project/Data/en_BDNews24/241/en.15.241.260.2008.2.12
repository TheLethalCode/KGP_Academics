<TEXT>
 Harare, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party expelled former Finance Minister Simba Makoni on Tuesday for challenging President Robert Mugabe in next month's election. Mugabe, who will be 84 next week, said he was "raring to go" in the election despite facing the first challenge to emerge from within his own party ranks for two decades. "I am very raring to go and raring to fly," Mugabe said in remarks broadcast on state television, waving his trademark clenched fists in a sign of defiance. Former guerrilla leader Mugabe has been the southern African nation's sole ruler since independence from Britain in 1980. He is seeking another five-year term in the March 29 presidential, parliamentary and council polls. Analysts say the challenge from Makoni, a member of the party's decision-making politburo, shows divisions in ZANU-PF which could leave Mugabe weaker even if he wins. Shortages of food, foreign currency and fuel, and the world's highest inflation rate -- officially pegged at 26,000 percent -- are seen as the biggest challenge to Mugabe's rule. The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has failed to capitalise on Mugabe's failure to rescue the economy, once one of Africa's most promising. It remains to be seen if daily hardships will push Zimbabweans to support Makoni. Mugabe's ZANU-PF confirmed it had been expelled Makoni. "The rules are very clear that anyone who tries to challenge an elected candidate of the party stands expelled. In the case of Simba Makoni ... he stands expelled," party spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira said at a press conference. BRITISH WARNING In London, Britain's Africa minister Mark Malloch-Brown said the polls were unlikely to be free and fair despite South African efforts to mediate. "We want to keep an open mind on this ... but the omens and early signs are not good," Malloch-Brown told Reuters, adding "the odds are against" a free and fair vote. South African President Thabo Mbeki has been mediating between Mugabe's government and the MDC at the urging of a regional grouping. Malloch-Brown said Mugabe had "bulldozed" aside the opposition's request for a delay, there wasn't time to campaign adequately, three million Zimbabwe citizens outside the country had been "essentially disenfranchised" and there was an "apparatus of intimidation and fear" surrounding Mugabe. Malloch-Brown said Makoni's decision to run against Mugabe was "a very interesting development". Makoni's status in ZANU-PF had been unclear since last week after he maintained he was still a party member. He says he is backed by senior party officials but they have yet to publicly show their support. Shamuyarira warned ZANU-PF officials against coming out in support of Makoni, saying they too would be expelled. "Its either you support a party or you don't". It is expected that Makoni will campaign as an independent against Mugabe, who has said his party would secure a landslide election victory to silence the MDC and shame Western critics he accuses of funding his opponents.
