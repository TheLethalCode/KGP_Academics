 MADRID, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second-placed Barcelona failed to keep the pressure on leaders Real Madrid after just scrambling a 1-1 draw at Sevilla in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Barca had a chance to move within three points of Real, who host Valladolid on Sunday, but faced an uphill battle after Diego Capel put impressive Sevilla ahead in the first half. They improved after the break and 14 minutes from time Xavi equalised to leave Frank Rijkaard's side on 48 points, five short of Real. Earlier, Guillermo Franco snatched a goal in added time for Villarreal to give them a 1-0 victory at lowly Real Murcia. They climbed to third with 42 points.

In Saturday's other game, Nigeria striker Ikechukwu Uche rescued a point for Getafe in a 1-1 draw at Deportivo Coruna
