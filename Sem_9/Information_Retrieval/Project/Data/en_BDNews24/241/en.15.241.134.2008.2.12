<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengupta called upon the government Tuesday to arrange ailing party president Sheikh Hasina safe passage abroad for medical treatment. He termed the matter a 'humanitarian issue'. Speaking to reporters at his Zigatala residence, Sengupta said if required Awami League will bear the expenses necessary for her treatment abroad. "Hasina should be treated by trustworthy physicians of her choice and the government should either take full responsibility for her treatment or allow her to arrange the same on her own," said Sengupta. Party leaders and workers are worried to hear that Hasina's health has been failing of late, he added. Terming Hasina's safe passage abroad for medical treatment as a 'humanitarian issue', Suranjit said: "There are previous instances of the government sending people abroad for treatment and it will be a compassionate act on the part of the caretaker government." However, when reporters pressed him, the veteran politician could not name the people that he claimed had been sent abroad for treatment by governments in the past. "The law does not forbid anyone to behave humanely," he replied. Earlier in the day, deputy inspector of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that the detained former prime minister was well. "Sheikh Hasina is well. No doctor went to see her today." Hasina's special assistant Hasan Mahmud also told bdnews24.com that the AL chief was doing better than the previous day. Sheikh Hasina's personal physician, however, once again declined to talk about the former prime minister's health status. bdnews2
