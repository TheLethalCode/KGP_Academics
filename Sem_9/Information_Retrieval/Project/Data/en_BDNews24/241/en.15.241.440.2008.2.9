 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com) Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Saturday said elections should be arranged soon, even with the old voter-list updated, if necessary. He said that the matter of a national government was just a smokescreen. "It's bogus. There is no scope for a national government in the constitution. There is no alternative to election, and the election is the solution to all problems," Zillur said at a discussion meeting with former Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders at his Gulshan home. The former BCL leaders said that they were scrapped from the committee of the Chhatra League because of an age-limit barrier that, they said, was designed to weaken the student wing of the Awami League. They branded some of the personal assistants and employees 'agents of Hawa Bhaban' and said that these elements had misguided Hasina as part of their conspiracy. The former BCL leaders asked Zillur Rahman to take steps to identify those people and take action against them. Zillur assured them that the matter would be discussed at the next meeting of the party's central working committee. He asked the student leaders to submit a written statement on their say. "We don't do politics to get anything. We do politics with a goal. What we have to think now is how to free our leader, leaving the past aside," Zillur said. He said that nobody would be able to beat the Awami League if it was united. "Our leader must come out. She must make arrangements for you." He said that election campaign would need at least four months and enough time would not be available if the election date was declared in September. Brushing off the much talked about national government, the AL chief said: "There are talks of a national government. With whom will the national government be formed? We have the biggest party, but we are not going to join any national government." Former BCL leader Rafiqul Islam Kotwal said that about 20,000 BCL workers across the country worked without any post. They could have been involved in the party's different programmes. ABM Mazhar Anam said that the matter of age-limit had destroyed the BCL. Some taking bribe from the Hawa Bhaban misguided the leader. He demanded action against the 'conspirators'. He said that the present BCL leaders would make any sacrifice for Hasina. BCL leaders present had earlier requested Anam not to speak, but he refused. Another ex-leader SM Atiqul Alam Jewel also spoke on the occasion under protest. Jewel said: "I was not kept in the Liakat-Babu committee although I was qualified. I thought I would be kept on the next committee, but the present president seized my SSC certificate. I could not get admitted for a course in law. Jewel alleged that half of the people in the existing BCL committee were members of Islami Chhatra Shibir. "There are 114 vice presidents in the present committee of Chhatra League. The letters for appointment of vice presidents were sold out." Hemayet Uddin tried to speak, but he was forced to stop, so was Ishtiaq Ahmed Shimulboth former BCL members, the bdnews24.com correspondent reported from the scene. Former BCL member Mahfuzur Rahman protested and said: "We worked up to 15 years for Chhatra League, but now we are not allowed to speak." With the situation getting chaotic, AL organising secretary Abdul Mannan tried to calm the situation. "I worked eight hours without any post since I left the post of president. You vent your problems to the leader (Hasina) and she will make arrangements," he said. bdnews
