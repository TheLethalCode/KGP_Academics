 Baghdad, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates met his top military commanders in Iraq on Monday to discuss the pace of US troop reductions, a day after militants killed more than 50 people in a spate of attacks. President George W. Bush ordered 30,000 extra troops to Iraq a year ago to curb rampant sectarian violence between the Shi'ite Muslim majority and Sunni Arabs, once-dominant under Saddam Hussein and from whose ranks insurgents draw support. U.S. troop numbers have begun to fall because of an overall improvement in security in the past few months and as more Iraqi troops and police are trained and deployed. There are about 155,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. Gates, who arrived in Baghdad late on Sunday, told reporters travelling with him that his talks on troop levels with the U.S. military commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, would cover a "whole range of possibilities". By July, U.S. force levels will have dropped by five brigades, bringing numbers to roughly 130,000, or the same as before the additional deployments began in early 2007. Petraeus said in a CNN interview last month he would need some time to "let things settle a bit" after the initial reduction, prompting speculation he wanted to keep about 130,000 troops or more in Iraq well into the second half of the year. Only one of the five brigades has left Iraq so far, and Gates said he expected to hear about plans for removing the other four. He has said he hoped for reductions at the same pace in the second half of 2008. Hours before Gates flew into Baghdad, a suicide car bomb killed 33 people near the northern town of Balad in an attack on a checkpoint manned by Sunni Arab volunteers who have joined U.S. forces to fight Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. At least 19 other people were killed in bombings and shootings on Sunday, one of Iraq's bloodiest days in months. QAEDA STRONGHOLDS Most of the attacks occurred in northern Iraq, where al Qaeda has regrouped after being driven out of former strongholds in western Anbar province and from round Baghdad. U.S. and Iraqi forces have launched a series of offensives in northern provinces this year against al Qaeda, widely blamed for most large-scale attacks in Iraq. Gates is visiting Baghdad a year after a U.S.-Iraqi security offensive was mounted with the aid of the extra 30,000 U.S. troops to halt the country's slide toward all-out sectarian war. Attacks across Iraq are down 60 percent since last June when the reinforcements became fully deployed. Gates, who in previous visits to Iraq has been critical of the Shi'ite-led government for failing to make progress toward national reconciliation, said the country's leaders "seem to have become energised in the last few weeks". He had dinner on Sunday night with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, President Jalal Talabani and other leaders. Parliament passed a law last month that will allow former members of Saddam's Baath party to regain their jobs in the government and military, a major demand by Sunni Arabs. But Maliki's government has struggled to make headway on other laws seen as vital to reconciliation, especially legislation that would equitably share Iraq's vast oil reserves and lay the framework for foreign investment in the sector.
