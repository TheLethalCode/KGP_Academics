 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The verdict on an extortion case against Awami League leader Sheikh Helaluddin and four others will be delivered Tuesday. Dhaka joint metropolitan session judge Mohammad Shafiul Azam would pronounce the verdict, additional public prosecutor Abul Kashem told bdnews24.com Monday. Mamtaz Uddin, project coordinator of road construction firm RCL, filed the Tk 1.02 crore extortion case on May 21 last year with Kafrul Police Station. Among the five accused in the case, Sheikh Helal, Shahin Chakladar, Khorshed Alam and AHM Kamal Hossain are fugitive. Accused Munshi Syeeduzzaman received bail from the High Court. Mamtaz claims that after he won a contract of the roads and highways department through bidding on May 8, 2000, accused Syeeduzzaman threatened not to allow the project coordinator to start work unless he paid Sheikh Helal. Mamtaz allegedly paid the accused Tk 87.9 lakh in cash and the rest through cheques. bdnew
