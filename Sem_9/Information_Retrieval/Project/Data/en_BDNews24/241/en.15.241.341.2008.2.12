 WELLINGTON, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brendon McCullum led New Zealand to a crushing 10 wicket win over England in a rain-interrupted limited-overs international at Hamilton on Tuesday, giving the Kiwis a 2-0 lead in their five-match series. Set a target of 165 from 36 overs to win, New Zealand cruised to victory at the start of the 19th over. McCullum finished unbeaten on 80 from only 47 balls and fellow opener Jesse Ryder made 79 not out in his second one-day international. England, who lost Saturday's series opener in Wellington by six wickets after winning both Twenty20 internationals, squandered a promising start and were bowled out for 158. The tourists were cruising at 85-2 after 15 overs when heavy showers forced play to be stopped for more than two hours. Umpires reduced the match to 36 overs for each side when play resumed but England failed to bat out their full compliment, losing their last wicket with five balls remaining. Opener Alastair Cook top-scored for England with 53 off 69 balls while Kevin Pietersen (29), Ravi Bopara (23) and Stuart Broad (23) all made starts but failed to go on as the wickets fell at regular intervals. Chris Martin, Michael Mason and Daniel Vettori captured two wickets each for New Zealand, who were set an adjusted victory target of 165 under the Duckworth-Lewis method. The Kiwis were untroubled in their run-chase with McCullum belting eight fours and five sixes in a display of power hitting while Ryder struck 11 boundaries and two sixes in a 62-ball knock. The third match of the series takes place in Auckland on Frida
