 LONDON, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index rebounded on Tuesday, led by oil majors, while financial stocks lagged as potential trouble at Standard Chartered's and a major US insurer fed ongoing credit worries. At 1007 GMT, Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent at 5,738.9, helped by overnight gains on Wall Street and UK consumer inflation data that was tamer than expected. BP rose 1.1 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gained 1.7, as crude prices remained above $93 a barrel benefiting from Venezuela's threat to stop sales to the world's top consumer, the United States. Life insurers were the largest drag on the index, after AIG , the world's largest insurer, unveiled potential losses in its derivatives portfolio. London-listed peers Old Mutual fell 3.5 percent, while Standard Life shed 1.6 percent. "There's a lot going on beneath the surface.

Banks were mixed with Barclays and HSBC and Alliance and Leicester traded lower. Market talk of large writedowns at Dutch banking group ING also limited gains among the banks. No immediate comment from ING was available.

It comes on the back of data on Monday which showed British factory gate inflation rose more than expected in January and to its highest rate in more than 16 years. The Bank of England cut rates last week by 25 basis points but also flagged inflation pressures and recent data could well limit the bank's scope to further loosen monetary policy. Miners, which in the previous session traded broadly negative, also regained ground. Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Antofagasta, Anglo American and Lonmin between 0.7 and 4 percent higher even as metal prices eased. But Xstrata was among the FTSE's top losers, down 2.4 percent, after the Financial Times said the Anglo-Swiss miner rejected a cash-and-shares takeover approach from Brazil's Vale pitched at just under 40 pounds a share, or 39 billion pounds ($76 billion).
