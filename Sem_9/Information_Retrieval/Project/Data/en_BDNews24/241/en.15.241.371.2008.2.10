 Chittagong, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Sunday asked private banks to improve the quality of services and level of efficiency, which he said fell far short of expectations. The central banker expressed his dissatisfaction while exchanging views with the regional chiefs of the retail banks in a meeting at Bangladesh Bank's Chittagong branch. "Although the banks take high charges for services, the quality of services is not improving, rather it is deteriorating," he said. After the discussion meeting, Salehuddin told reporters that Bangladesh Bank would soon start a process to meet the shortage of staffers at three nationalised banks which have been turned into public limited companies. Also, efforts are underway to introduce an automated operating system to the branches of the three banks in phases to face fierce competition with the private banks kitted with modern equipment. The BB governor warned the banks on alleged "autocracy" in the name of free economy, adding: "We won't sit idle if we get complaints about the services and efficiency of the banks." Salehuddin advised the banks to lower interest rates on loans and to play more important roles in the economy. He urged the banks to help establish labour-intensive industries, instead of handing loans to importers alone. The BB boss also advised the banks to give more loans to entrepreneurs and farmers to fuel investment in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Salehuddin pointed to the commercial banks' growing unwillingness to provide loans for small and medium entrepreneurs and said the central bank had allocated Tk 500 crore to the banks for distribution at a 5 percent interest rate. "But they are not disbursing the loans even with a higher interest rate," he said. The governor asked the banks to take interests no more than 12 percent against L/C on nine consumer goods, which is a government decision. Bangladesh Bank Chittagong branch general manager SK Sur Chowdhury presided over the meeting, also attended by Sonali Bank regional general manager MA Baten and The City Bank senior vice president Imam Ahmed Chowdhury. The Sonali Bank general manager sought intervention of the central bank to take steps against big loan defaulters and to stop the culture of loan defaults. bdnews
