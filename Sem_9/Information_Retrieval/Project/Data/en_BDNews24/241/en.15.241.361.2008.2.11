 Washington, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States expects the Venezuelan government to respect international law in dealing with the court battle between Exxon Mobil Corp and the Venezuelan state-controlled oil company, a State Department spokesman said on Monday. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack spoke after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to cut off oil sales to the United States over the court fight. "There's a commercial aspect to this, in that there is an ongoing legal process, between Exxon and the government of Venezuela. That should proceed and be resolved on the basis of existing and accepted international laws and standards. We would expect the government of Venezuela would respect those laws and standards in dealing with Exxon," McCormack told reporters. "In terms of his remarks today as reported, this is something that he has said before ... we've heard it before," McCormack said of Chavez. Chavez has frequently issued threats to stop oil shipments to the United States but has maintained supplies despite repeated clashes with Washington
