<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 11 (bdnews24.com)  The recently formed Bangladesh Kalyan Party Monday called upon the government to announce a specific time-frame for the next polls expected to be held by year-end. Party chairman Syed Muhammad Ibrahim said a clear-cut schedule is important to dispel any confusion about the upcoming elections. "Please announce the election date and the month to remove any doubts from the people's mind," Ibrahim, a retired major general, told a news conference in the party's makeshift headquarters at Purana Paltan. He also demanded withdrawal of all restrictions so that the political parties could conduct their activities. He said neutralising the bureaucracy before the polls is another vital need of the time. Revisiting the context of Jan 11 when the state of emergency was declared, Ibrahim said: "Jan 11 was inevitable. This government has scored many successes along with failures. It won't be wise to question the events of Jan 11 on the plea that the government has failed doing so many things. This government will have to take responsibilities for its failures. Putting the patriotic military into a confrontational situation cannot be supported." Ibrahim also demanded the government take measures to pay dues to the workers of the closed jute mills and introduce rationing for the poor. bdnews24.
