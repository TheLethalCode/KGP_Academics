<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares inched higher on Tuesday as gains in oils majors offset weaker financials after Credit Suisse's earnings and market talk of a large writedown at Dutch group ING. Heavyweight oil shares BP, Shell and Total rose by 1.1 to 1.6 percent each as oil stayed above $93 a barrel. The Dow Jones Stoxx oil and gas index was up 1.2 percent. Rising commodity prices boosted mining shares with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton and Anglo American rising 1.1 percent. ING was the top percentage loser in Europe, sliding 5.3 percent on market talk of large writedowns linked to US real estate. ING declined to comment on the talk, but a spokeswoman said the firm "was perfectly aware of its obligation to report any material deviations." Credit Suisse fell 3.4 percent after the Swiss bank said it trimmed its full-year writedowns linked to the subprime crisis to 2.0 billion Swiss francs ($1.82 billion), but also reported a 49 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit, slightly below analysts' expectations. By 0915 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.3 percent at 1,294.86 points, after the index fell almost 1 percent on Monday. "I can't see any changes in the overall sentiment," said Susanne Lahmann, equities strategist at Bremer Landesbank. "I also think it's possible that the ZEW index will bring us back down again," she added. The German ZEW investor confidence index, due at 1000 GMT, is expected to fall to -45.0 in February from -41.6 in January. The current conditions index is forecast at 50.8, sharply down from 56.6 the previous month. Xstrata fell 2.3 percent after the Financial Times said that the Anglo-Swiss miner has rejected a cash-and-shares takeover approach from Brazil's Vale pitched at just under 40 pounds a share, or 39 billion pounds ($76 billion). Vale's shares rose 3.6 percent. FINANCIALS WEIGH Insurers and banking stocks were among the strongest decliners in Europe and the DJ Stoxx insurance sector index dipped 2.5 percent while the banking index slipped 0.6 percent. European credit derivative indexes hit fresh record wides, giving up earlier tentative gains, on continued worries about forced selling of structured credit products. By 0819 GMT, the Markit iTraxx Europe index was at 106.25 basis points, according to Markit, 3.75 basis points wider versus late on Monday. "Credit spreads are widening, especially in banks. We had a lot of feedback from AIG, people are fearful of more to come, leverage loan writedown risk in general is in focus, and analysts are cutting forecasts for U.S. banks," one trader said. "And now there's fear that analysts will look at the market and start cutting forecasts at Credit Suisse's shining light, the private bank," he added. Credit Suisse's net new money in wealth management was far better than expected compared with an average forecast in a Reuters poll. Sentiment in the sector was dragged down by looming losses at American International Group. AIG shares plummeted to their worst loss since the 1987 stock market crash on Monday after the world's largest insurer's auditors said the company failed to account properly for derivatives related to risky debt known as collateralized debt obligations. Insurers in Europe such as Allianz and Europe's second biggest insurer AXA fell 4 percent and Swiss Re dropped 3 percent. Investors are also looking at Credit Suisse's results in view of other European banks to report this week, such as Germany's Commerzbank and Switzerland's UBS. Among major movers, Norway's Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) rose 5.7 percent after the solar industry group reported a bigger-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter core profi
