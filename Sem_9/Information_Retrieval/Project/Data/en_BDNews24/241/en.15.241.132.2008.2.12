 PARIS, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Exiled Georgian opposition leader Irakly Okruashvili will try to run in Georgia's parliamentary election this spring though he fears that Tbilisi will block him. But even if President Mikhail Saakashvili does stop him registering on electoral rolls, the former defence minister who has requested asylum in France, says he will try to stay active in politics. "I will submit my candidacy in April, but he (Saakashvili) will not allow it," he told Reuters on Monday in Paris. "From 3000 miles (4,800 km) away it is politically difficult, but I'll do my best to stay involved ... if French law allows," he said. Okruashvili's allegations of corruption against the pro-Western Saakashvili helped spur huge anti-government protests last year in the former Soviet republic, which Okruashvili said he was forced to flee under political pressure. Georgia issued an international arrest warrant for Okruashvili in November after he surfaced in Germany saying that the government had forced him to retract his accusations. German authorities arrested him but later transferred him to France where he was released pending an extradition hearing on Feb. 27. Okruashvili, 34, is optimistic the court will dismiss the charges and that Tbilisi will be unable to prove allegations that he was involved in a patronage scheme while he was defence minister. The Tbilisi government specifically accuses him of ordering the purchase of airplane fuel at excessive prices from a company controlled by a friend. OPPOSITION DEADLINE The Georgian opposition wants a recount of a snap presidential election votes in January which Saakashvili called and won. The opposition has told the government to give guarantees the parliamentary election will be fair and say they will take to the streets if they do not have assurances by Feb. 15. Okruashvili said he hoped Saakashvili would make some concessions to the opposition including allowing it access to mass media. "And he should punish people ... police officers, secret service officers who were involved in violence," he said, referring to the heavy-handed handling of anti-government demonstrations. If no such efforts were made to meet the opposition's demands, protests would continue, he said. "We will do our best to reduce tensions but in this case there will be demonstrations, we will continue to fight against his regime ... which is continuing repression." He also attacked the government over human rights, saying the prison population had doubled to 22,000 in just a few years. Opposition to the government was a just cause, he said, because Saakashvili was misusing state funds and not doing enough to address the rampant poverty affecting many in Georgia. "The president is bringing singers -- Shakira, Placido Domingo, Gipsy Kings ... and paying millions of dollars for such advertisements, while people are living in poverty," he said. "They've even hired one of the most expensive lawyers in Paris against me with money from the state budget," he said. Tbilisi has said private companies paid for the free concert held by Colombian pop diva Shakira last Decemb
