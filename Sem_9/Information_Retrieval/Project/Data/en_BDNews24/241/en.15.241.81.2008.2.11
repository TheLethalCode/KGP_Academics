<TITLE> Setback for Sarkozy as protege quits mayor race </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy suffered fresh embarrassment on Monday when his spokesman withdrew a bid to become mayor of Sarkozy's former stronghold despite being parachuted there by the president himself. Sarkozy anointed spokesman David Martinon as his centre-right party's official candidate for mayor in the chic Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, which Sarkozy himself ran for years before becoming president last year. But Martinon, who is seen as close to Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, has never won elected office before and he does not live in Neuilly, which has angered many Neuilly residents. In an apparent reaction to Martinon's relatively poor poll performance ahead of what should have been a shoo-in at next month's municipal election, supporters including Sarkozy's own son withdrew their support for Martinon and set up a rival bid. "The conditions are no longer in place for me to lead the municipal campaign in Neuilly," Martinon told reporters in the Paris suburb, adding: "I am pulling out." Martinon said he had offered to resign from his post as presidential spokesman but Sarkozy had refused. The debacle highlights squabbling on the right and is another setback for Sarkozy, whose approval rating has tumbled over his public romance with former supermodel Carla Bruni, whom he married on Feb. 2, and anger over the rising cost of living. SOAP OPERA MEETS ROYAL COURT Opposition politicians and political commentators have likened Sarkozy's decision to hand-pick Martinon before apparently turning on him to a soap opera and to the personal politics of the royal court in pre-revolutionary times. "We could laugh about it, and there's plenty to laugh about. A presidential spokesman designated by Nicolas Sarkozy, a plot, a family intrigue," Socialist leader Francois Hollande said. Centrist Francois Bayrou, who came third in last year's presidential vote, also jumped on the incident. "One is a little stunned by these daily unexpected developments of a sort of soap opera in which the real subject is the court -- what is happening in the court?" Bayrou told France Inter radio. The bad press for Sarkozy could also have an impact on the municipal elections on March 9 and 16, in which some 36,000 mayors in towns and villages across France will be elected. Polls put the Socialists comfortably ahead of Sarkozy's UMP party, and Sarkozy has responded with a busy round of local visits and a spate of government pledges. Most voters say they will make their choice on local issues but the poll will inevitably also be seen as an initial verdict on Sarkozy's first nine months in office. Newspaper Le Monde attributed Sarkozy's slide in opinion polls to his hyperactive style in his first months in office. "It's the boomerang rule -- the further and harder you throw, the faster and more violently it comes back," it said. "Upsetting institutions, heading to the front line on all occasions, initiating reforms on all fronts, imposing his agenda at breakneck speed, he paid little attention to the damage he did on the way," Le Monde said in its editorial. The paper also ran a cartoon on its front page showing his son Jean stabbing Martinon in the back on the instructions of the president, who says proudly: "I taught him everything!
