Investigators examined Nestle operations in Frankfurt on Thursday, a spokesman for Nestle in Germany said, confirming a report by the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper. He said the Swiss group was cooperating with the investigation but declined further comment. The paper said Kraft and Ritter were also among the targets while the antitrust agency had notified some others about ongoing investigations. The cartel office was not immediately available for comment
