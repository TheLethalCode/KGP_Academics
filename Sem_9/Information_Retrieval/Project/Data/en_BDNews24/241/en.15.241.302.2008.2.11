 Paris, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France has reclaimed its place at the heart of Europe by ratifying an EU reform treaty, three years after its referendum "No" vote helped wreck the bloc's planned constitution, President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Sunday. But he said the 27-member European Union now had to define clearly what its goals were. "By this success, as this is a success, France is back in Europe," Sarkozy said of parliament's ratification on Friday of the treaty to overhaul the EU's institutions. "It has found again its influence, its capacity to make its view known, its values, and the key role that it has always had in the past," he said in a television address. The so-called Treaty of Lisbon, which must be approved by all member states, will give the bloc a long-term president, a more powerful foreign policy chief, more democratic decision-making and more say for European and national parliaments. France is the fifth EU country after Hungary, Malta, Romania and Slovenia to ratify the treaty, a replacement for the constitution torpedoed in 2005 when French and Dutch voters rejected it in referendums. The treaty drops contentious symbols hinting at possible EU statehood such as the flag and anthem, which were among elements voters disliked in 2005. Sarkozy said the new treaty was needed to steer Europe out of an institutional crisis but warned it was not a solution. "Now that Europe can decide, the issue is to know what it wants," he said. Sarkozy said "politics" should be put back on the EU's agenda, and that everything was up for discussion including the euro currency and trade and industrial policies. "We need to speak about everything like in any democracy," he added. France will focus the EU agenda on immigration, defence, agriculture and sustainable development when it takes over the bloc's rotating presidency on July 1, Sarkozy said.
