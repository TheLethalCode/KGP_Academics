 ROME, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Christian Panucci and Mancini scored as second-placed AS Roma beat strugglers Reggina 2-0 on Saturday to trim Inter Milan's lead at the top of Serie A to five points. Italy defender Panucci headed in a Francesco Totti cross from a tight angle in the 21st minute to put the Romans on their way to burying the memory of last week's 3-0 defeat at Siena. They doubled the lead in the 76th minute when Brazilian midfielder Mancini fired home the rebound from a Ludovic Giuly shot after some fine dribbling. Reggina's Edgar Barreto had a goal disallowed for offside before Mancini's effort and Nigeria striker Stephen Makinwa hit the crossbar just after it. Inter, who have 53 points from 21 games, can restore their eight-point advantage with a victory at Catania on Sunday Fiorentina's bid for a Champions League berth suffered a setback when they were held 2-2 at Atalanta. Fiorentina took the lead in the 29th minute when forward Giampaolo Pazzini controlled a Riccardo Montolivo pass and spun around to find the far corner. Atalanta's Bosnian striker Zlatan Muslimovic equalised with the first of his two goals a minute later. Fiorentina went ahead again when winger Franco Semioli, who missed Italy's midweek friendly against Portugal with a foot problem, headed in Zdravko Kuzmanovic's cross from the right on the hour. But Muslimovic gave Atalanta a share of the spoils when he finished off a neat counter attack to complete his double in added time. The Florence club stay fourth with 38 points from 22 games. Fifth-placed AC Milan, rivals for a top-four finish and Champions League qualification, can come within two points of them with a game in hand by beating Siena at the San Siro on Sunday
