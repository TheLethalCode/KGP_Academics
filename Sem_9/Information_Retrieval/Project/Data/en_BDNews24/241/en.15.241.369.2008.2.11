<TITLE> Russia`s Khodorkovsky ends hunger strike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jailed Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky said on Monday he had ended a hunger strike he began last month in protest at the treatment of a jailed colleague who is gravely ill with HIV/AIDS. Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, declared the hunger strike in an effort to force the authorities to give 36-year-old Vasily Alexanian, a former vice president at the now defunct Yukos oil firm, access to proper treatment. Russia's prison service on Friday moved Alexanian to a specialist clinic from the medical ward of the prison where he was being kept while he awaits trial on charges of embezzlement, money laundering and tax evasion. "I am ending my hunger strike in connection with the move of Alexanian to a civilian clinic," Khodorkovsky said in a statement posted through his lawyers on his www.khodorkovsky.ru Web site. The initial refusal of Russian judges to move Alexanian -- who is going blind and says he is near death -- to a clinic drew condemnation from rights groups including Amnesty International. Prosecutors have denied mistreating Alexanian. "I hope (Alexanian's transfer shows) there are fewer bureaucratic thugs ready to let a man die while trying to guess the wishes of their bosses than there are honest and conscientious people," Khodorkovsky said. Khodorkovsky, who is serving a prison term near the Chinese border, says he earned the ire of the Kremlin by challenging President Vladimir Putin and refusing to allow corrupt officials to carve up his company. Alexanian has said he is being used as a pawn to put further pressure on Khodorkovsky, who could face another trial this year on new charges of money laundering and embezzlement. Alexanian has a brother who works as a translator in the Reuters Moscow office
