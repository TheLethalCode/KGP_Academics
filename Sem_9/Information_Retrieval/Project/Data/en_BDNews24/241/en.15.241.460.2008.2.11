 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new exhibition opens in London on Wednesday aiming to shine new light on an influential but short-lived British art group that outraged the stuffy Edwardian art establishment at the start of the 20th century. From the bold use of colour and form to scenes of everyday street life in London and the less than reverential treatment of the female nude the Camden Town Group set out to challenge the accepted norm. "They were Britain's post-Impressionists. They broke the mould of the British art establishment, showing their own works on their own terms," said curator Robert Upstone. "We are hoping to reposition this group. They brought colour and rigorous design to British art and had a very important role in the creation of modern art in Britain," he added during a preview tour on Monday of the exhibition at Tate Britain. The Camden Town Group coalesced in 1911 around Walter Sickert who lived in the rather run down north London suburb which gave the group its name. The exhibition, which runs to May 5, focuses on the five core members of the group, Sickert, Spencer Gore, Charles Ginner, Harold Gilman and Robert Bevan. It is the first major exhibition of the group's key works in half a century. Entitled Modern Painters, it studies the distinctive styles, subjects and treatment of urban life during the social upheaval in the years immediately before World War One. Not afraid to pay homage on occasion to the styles of eminent painters like Van Gogh, Degas, Seurat and Gauguin, the group members also developed their own distinctive styles. But far from the accepted choice and treatment of subjects in the era, the Camden Town Group chose to concentrate on the grittier subjects and lower social caste that were previously ignored. Nowhere was that more strongly illustrated than in the depiction of the female nude, with paintings showing ordinary women in rather seedy domestic surroundings rather than the goddess treatment that was the accepted norm at the time. "This was really quite shocking in Edwardian England. The frank depiction of the nudes, sometimes in the presence of fully clothed men, hinted at prostitution," Upstone said. "Some critics hated it but others got the message." One section of the exhibition concentrates on the notorious murder of a woman in Camden Town in 1911 that gripped the public imagination and inspired Sickert to paint a series of pictures entitled Camden Town Murder -- in part as a publicity stunt. Always a challenge to the art establishment, the group really only lasted for about three years before its members went their separate ways. The exhibition hopes to show the catalytic role the group had on the development of modern British art
