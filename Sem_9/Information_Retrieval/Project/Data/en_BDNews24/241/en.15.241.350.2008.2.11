<TITLE> Anglican leader to speak out after Islamic law storm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rowan Williams, spiritual leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans, gets a chance to respond on Monday to a barrage of criticism after saying the introduction in Britain of some aspects of Islamic law is unavoidable. The Archbishop of Canterbury has remained silent on the subject since his comments on Thursday on the use of sharia in Britain led to calls for him to resign. The storm is part of a broader debate on integrating Britain's 1.8 million Muslims that has climbed the political agenda since suicide bombings by British Muslims killed 52 people in London's transport system in July 2005. Williams may respond to his critics when he makes a speech at 3 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Monday to open a meeting in London of the Church of England's parliament, the General Synod. A handful of the synod's 467 members have publicly called for Williams to step down, calling him politically inept. Leading politicians and churchmen have said Britain can have only one legal system, although some have defended him as a thoughtful man who was trying to open a debate. Several popular newspapers have attacked Williams, with the best-selling Sun launching a campaign for him to go. A spokeswoman for Williams said on Sunday that the archbishop was not considering stepping down. Sharia, the body of Islamic religious law based primarily on the Koran, as well as the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Mohammad, has been attacked by many in the west over its treatment of women and punishments for adultery and apostasy. It covers a broad range of issues including worship, commercial dealings, marriage, inheritance and penal laws. In a BBC interview on Thursday, the Archbishop of Canterbury talked about the use of sharia to resolve some personal or domestic issues among Britain's Muslims, much as Orthodox Jews have their own courts for some matters. Asked if sharia needed to be applied in some cases for community cohesion, Williams said: "It seems unavoidable." Geoff Hoon, a government leader in parliament, told Sky News there were opportunities to resolve civil disputes through arbitration, "but there cannot be any kind of debate about the single authority of our single legal system." Opposition Conservative politician Kenneth Clarke said Williams "should have been advised that even getting on to this topic was going to cause the most monumental row."
