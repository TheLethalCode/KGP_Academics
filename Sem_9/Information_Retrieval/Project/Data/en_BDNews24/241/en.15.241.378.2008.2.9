 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)British foreign secretary David Miliband Saturday said army chief General Moeen U Ahmed had assured him that the army would "stand above and separate from politics". Full Story He said he was impressed by the strong commitment of the caretaker government to hold the general elections by year-end. But answering a question, British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury said he was not sure about any specific timeframe of lifting the state of emergency. "He (Moeen) was very committed to the idea that the army should stand above and separate from politics," Miliband told reporters at a press conference on his two-day visit at the residence of British high commissioner. Miliband, who came to Bangladesh Friday, scheduled to leave Dhaka late Saturday. He separately spoke to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and Gen Moeen Saturday where he learned about the progress of holding next polls. The UK minister got an idea about the role of army in running the interim government and what would be its position in holding the next election and its aftermath. "I was struck by the sincerity which both he (army chief) and the chief adviser and others stated their commitment to a transitional democracy," said the UK's secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs. He said the caretaker government and the political parties had joint responsibility for the functioning of democracy in the country. "We would look to all sides to respond and participate positively, in order to achieve inclusive elections and reach consensus over reforms which can sustain democracy in Bangladesh." "Inclusive election means inclusive of all political parties," he said. "The issue of lifting of state of emergency came up throughout his meeting with the chief adviser and others. Although no specific date has been given, we got the impression that the emergency would be lifted as soon as (it is) practical," British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury told the news conference. On transparency in the trial of former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the UK minister said: "Charge of any crime must be dealt with without any difference and also without discrimination". "And the law must be applied without fear or favour, in a fair way whatever their position in society. And I think that message was received". On formation of a "national government" replacing the present caretaker government, Miliband said, "It is important democratic politics needs to take root. And then it is for parties, if they are sharing common goals and programmes, they can decide whether they cooperate or not (in forming national government)". bdnews
