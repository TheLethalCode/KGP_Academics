 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Bikalpadhara parties have said they consider it too early to start the process of forming a 'grand alliance'. The two parties held a joint press conference at the KC Memorial in Baridhara Sunday, following a meeting that addressed their upcoming dialogues with the caretaker government. JSD president Hasanul Haq Inu and Bikalpadhara secretary general Abdul Mannan spoke at the briefing. Inu said the two parties had agreed to make a common proposal to the caretaker government during their talks. "A consensus government of two terms can be formed after the election, but not before," he added. Mannan said: "We were a partner in a grand alliance." "That was an elected alliance, but we do not want to start that process again before the election schedule has been announced." "However, a consensus government can be formed through discussions after the election has taken place," Mannan said. Inu stressed the election should be held after all necessary preparations have been taken. "We want the election to be held as soon as possible, but not in a haphazard way," he said. "The election has to be held after the voter list has been prepared, with photographs, and in line with the reform proposals of the 14-party alliance to ensure there is no rigging." bdnew
