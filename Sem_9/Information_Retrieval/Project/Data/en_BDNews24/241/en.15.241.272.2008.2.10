 LONDON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in marked contrast to his reputation for being cool towards Brussels, called on Friday for a Europe that could play a major role in fighting poverty and disease around the world. His late arrival at a ceremony to sign a new European Union treaty last year reinforced the belief among many of Britain's EU partners that he was lukewarm towards Europe. But he has sought cooperation with France, Germany and Italy to tackle a global credit crunch and on Friday he went further than before in advocating a global role for Europe. "I would say we should think not of a trade bloc Europe but of a global Europe, and I think the role Europe can play in the development of what I would call a global society ... is momentous," Brown told a seminar in London.

The bloc could also play a role in getting countries back on their feet after conflicts and in building a new relationship between rich and poor countries, he said. "Only if Europe takes the lead on this will malaria for example be dealt with properly and only if Europe proposes a new deal between rich and poor countries can this actually happen," he said. He suggested a "lasting bargain" where developing countries would commit to stable economic policies and wealthy nations would support their education, development and health care. Brown insisted on protecting Britain's national interests during negotiation of the new EU reform treaty and his awkward handling of the signing ceremony -- when he turned up late and signed alone after the other leaders -- did nothing to endear him to other European countries. He has rejected opposition calls for a British referendum on the new Lisbon treaty, saying it is much less far-reaching than the now defunct European Constitution. Unlike French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who visited the European Commission in Brussels soon after taking office, Brown has not yet visited the EU's executive body seven months after succeeding Tony Bla
