<TITLE> Optimism at Kenya talks, negotiators urge patience </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiators for President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga re-started talks on Monday in a mood of national optimism that a political solution to Kenya's worst crisis since independence may be near. Mediator and former UN chief Kofi Annan has predicted the two sides will agree on a formula this week to overcome their dispute over the Dec. 27 election that triggered violence killing more than 1,000 people and uprooting 300,000. Both sides are said by party sources to have agreed in principle on power-sharing and are now focusing on the details. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) is no longer calling on Kibaki to step down, the sources say. Annan warned media against "speculation and rumours" at this delicate stage in his mission. Taking their cue from the senior diplomat, both sides also tried to calm premature jubilation in a nation exhausted by scenes of burning, looting and killing -- much of it along ethnic lines among Kenya's more than 40 different groups. As talks resumed in a plush hotel in the capital, Kibaki urged Kenyans who fled their homes to return. "We are going to assist in rebuilding houses that were torched," he said at a Nairobi high school where he launched a free secondary school programme. "We will, indeed, make sure that no human being will get any pleasure whatsoever in burning another human being's house because to do so is crazy," he said to applause. Though triggered by the controversial presidential vote tally, the bloodshed in Kenya has exposed deep resentment over inequalities in the distribution of land, wealth and power that date back to British colonial rule. Critics say politicians have done more to manipulate those tensions than resolve them in the decades since. PATIENCE Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula said the focus had shifted away from the blame game: "We are now looking for solutions." Government negotiator Mutula Kilonzo, who said last week he was "1,000 percent confident" a deal was coming, urged patience. "The media is selling a deal. It could be up to a week," he told reporters. The view was echoed by an ODM party spokesman. "They're not just going to be cooked up any second. Negotiations are going to take a bit of time," he said. "(But) we are very hopeful, like the Kenyan people are." The opposition says its larger numbers in parliament entitles it to a bigger share of cabinet posts. But the Kibaki side has the official ruling of the electoral board that he won the presidential vote, albeit narrowly. Analysts say a long-term solution to Kenya's political troubles must involve reforming the constitution which currently gives the president vast powers from setting the parliamentary timetable to appointing electoral commissioners. The protests and rioting that began immediately after Kibaki's Dec. 30 swearing-in spread to many parts of the nation, especially the Rift Valley and Nairobi slums. The violence has subsided in recent days but Kenya's image as a stable democracy and a regional hub for business, tourism and transport has been badly damaged. Kenyan markets have taken a battering. The stock index has dropped about 12 percent and the shilling has fallen more than 10 percent against the U.S. dollar since the crisis began. Both sides have already agreed principles to end violence and help refugees. Annan gave them until mid-February to resolve agenda item No. 3: what to do about the disputed election. Deeper underlying issues, such as land grievances and wealth inequality, are to be tackled within a year
