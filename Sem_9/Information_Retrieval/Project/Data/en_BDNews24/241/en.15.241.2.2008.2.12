<TITLE> Settlements, Gaza cloud Israel-Palestinian talks </TITLE>

 Jerusalem, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli plans to build more homes in and around Arab East Jerusalem came under fire on Tuesday from Palestinians who see the city as capital of their future state, casting another shadow over troubled peace talks. Israeli officials hailed "progress" after negotiators met for the first time on two consecutive days. But comments from ministers threatening new attacks on the Gaza Strip and vowing to expand Jewish settlements angered Palestinian leaders. On both issues Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is under pressure from domestic opponents and from within his fragile coalition to take a tougher stance against Palestinian demands. With little public sign of movement since U.S. President George W. Bush helped relaunch long-stalled peace talks in November, the chief negotiators, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and former prime minister Ahmed Qurie met on both Monday and Tuesday, Livni's spokesman Arye Mekel said. It was the first time they had met in such quick succession. Israeli officials close to Livni said progress was being made in the talks, which Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have started with the goal of reaching a statehood deal this year, before Bush steps down. But Palestinians pointed to new signs of trouble on Tuesday when Israel's Housing Ministry said preparations were under way to build up to 1,100 new homes in and around Arab East Jerusalem, which Abbas wants to be the Palestinian capital. Palestinians have also expressed concern at Israeli threats to step up an offensive and kill senior Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip in what Israel says is a legitimate response to rocket fire on Israeli towns from the enclave. "At the end of the day, violence will breed violence. It will add to the complexities," Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said. Although Abbas's secular Fatah faction is deeply hostile to Hamas following the Islamists' seizure of Gaza in June, the president has been at pains to speak up for the 1.5 million people of Gaza suffering under an Israeli embargo on Hamas. Israel is trying to make the case that it can maintain parallel tracks with the Palestinians, one aimed at reaching a deal with Abbas, the other at breaking Hamas. HAMAS The Islamists, shunned by the West for refusing to renounce violence, say they would cease fire if Israel stops its military operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and ends the blockade that has cut supplies to the coastal territory. Israeli officials have said they may target senior Hamas leaders with air strikes. But Defence Minister Ehud Barak suggested on Tuesday that Israel would not immediately launch an all-out military campaign in the Gaza Strip. "It won't happen right away. There are reasons why we are not acting with full force right now. It will happen when the time is right," he said without elaborating. Israeli action in Gaza has killed some 700 Palestinians in the past year but has failed to prevent daily rocket fire that killed two Israelis last year and wounded an eight-year-old boy on Saturday. Olmert's many critics have stepped up calls for the government to take tougher action on Hamas, but Western powers have urged Israel to ease conditions for civilians in Gaza. Israel's vice premier Haim Ramon and the prime minister of Abbas's Western-backed government, Salam Fayyad, have complained in recent days that the peace talks lacked sufficient intensity. An Israeli source, who declined to be named, said: "It is more intensive and they are making progress on the core issues." Olmert's government has already lost one of its right-wing coalition partners over his embrace of the peace talks, and the religious Shas party has threatened to follow suit if the negotiations focus on the future of Jerusalem. Its departure would cost Olmert his parliamentary majority and might trigger an election that would almost certainly end Bush's hope of a peace agreement before he leaves office. The Housing Ministry said the municipality of Jerusalem was preparing tenders for 750 housing units in a northern area and possibly for a further 370 units to the south in what is known to Israelis as Har Homa and to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim. The talks previously bogged down in early December after Israel announced an previous plan for 307 units at Har Homa. Under U.S. pressure, Olmert has imposed a de facto halt to new construction in Jewish settlements in what Israel regards as the West Bank. But he has not called off plans to build new homes in Har Homa and other West Bank areas which Israel annexed to Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally.
