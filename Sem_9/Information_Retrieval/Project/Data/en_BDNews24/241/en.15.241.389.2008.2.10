<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Floods and storms have killed 12 people on Indonesia's main island of Java, a health official said on Sunday. Floods triggered by heavy rain killed eight people in two districts in East Java over the past two days, said Rustam Pakaya, head of the health ministry's crisis centre. Four people died on Saturday when an electricity pole was toppled by storms, hitting a car in which they were travelling in Bekasi, east of the capital Jakarta, he said. Several areas in Jakarta, where flooding killed five people this month, were under water on Sunday but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Indonesia suffers heavy flooding and landslides every rainy season. Rain and floods forced about 100,000 Jakarta residents from their homes early this month and brought the city to a standstill.
