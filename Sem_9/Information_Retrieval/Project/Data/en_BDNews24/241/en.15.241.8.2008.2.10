 CARACAS, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Hugo Chavez vowed on Saturday to keep to his self-styled socialist revolution despite Exxon Mobil winning court orders freezing up to $12 billion of Venezuela's assets in a nationalization dispute. The giant American company has retaliated for Chavez's seizure last year of an Exxon project, winning the first big court battle over compensation for a takeover that the anti-U.S. president says will help create a socialist state. Exxon's move sparked a sell-off in the OPEC nation's debt bonds this week and prompted government officials to tell Venezuelans to remain calm. The court rulings in several countries mean state oil company PDVSA -- Chavez's main income source -- cannot sell certain assets or move some funds while the compensation case is reviewed. "You have a multinational, imperialist company trying to damage our flagship company," Chavez said at a meeting with farmers. "But this ship will keep sailing and sailing full of oil." "PDVSA will not sink. Venezuela will not sink. This revolution will not sink," he said, in his first comments on the legal move by the world's largest oil company. The Venezuelan company, which has more than $90 billion in assets, finances Chavez's free spending on food subsidies, schools and clinics for the majority poor. Investors worry the court orders could limit its activities, make it more difficult for PDVSA to raise capital and affect its cash flow. PDVSA has suffered repeated refinery outages, struggled to improve production and shown signs of cash flow problems in the last year. Venezuela says the court rulings are temporary and will have no impact on PDVSA's supplies, operations or finances. It plans to file a response this week to have the rulings reversed. BATTLE FOR RESOURCES Exxon's move is the boldest challenge yet by an oil major against any of the governments from Russia to Ecuador that have moved to increase their control over natural resources as energy and commodity prices have soared. The escalation of the dispute between the biggest US company and Chavez, a leading proponent of resource nationalism, helped lift oil prices due to investors' concerns over sales from the No. 4 exporter to the United States. Chavez accuses big oil companies and large consumer nations of seeking to coerce major producers such as Venezuela into hiking supply to help lower world prices. On Saturday, he said a fair oil price was $80 a barrel, roughly in line with the current value of Venezuela's crude. Exxon, which last week reported the largest ever profit of a U.S. company, sought the assets freeze to guarantee repayment should it win arbitration over compensation. Industry analysts said the legal attack was also a tactic to set a negotiating position over how much Exxon wants for the seizure. Venezuela says fair compensation would be less than $6 billion. Wall St. economists and industry analysts have mainly focused on the effect the court orders have on Venezuela's fixed assets such as refineries. It was also known the court rulings froze $300 million in a US account. But on Saturday, the extent of Exxon's attack appeared wider -- targeting more of PDVSA's cash held abroad. A central bank director in Curacao said Exxon lawyers had told banks that one of the court rulings meant they had to at least maintain the current level of money PDVSA holds in any account on the Caribbean island. PDVSA operates a refinery on Curacao and exports oil from the small former Dutch colony off the Venezuelan coast.
