"We are of the view that the Iranians are continuing to pursue their plans to create a capacity for non-conventional weapons," he said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting. "Nothing that we've seen so far has changed our view on that," he said, speaking through an interpreter. Olmert also said he was sharing information with other countries about Iran's nuclear programme and that no options should be forgotten in trying to prevent Iran from developing atomic weapons.
