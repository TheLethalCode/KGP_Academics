<TITLE> S.Africa`s Mbeki says no change in economic course </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's economic growth is likely to slow as the world economy cools, but the country remains committed to its pro-business policies, President Thabo Mbeki said on Sunday. "There may very well be a slowdown as it (growth) slows down in the United States and in many other countries of the world ... but it doesn't change the character, the nature, the direction in which the country would develop," he said in an interview with public broadcaster SABC. Growth in Africa's biggest economy is widely expected to slow from the average 5 percent a year of the past four years due to higher interest rates, a slowdown in the U.S. and a power crisis that has knocked production at manufacturers and mines. The Treasury has said there will likely be a downward revision to the forecasted 4.5 percent expansion for 2008. Answering questions related to his state-of-the-nation speech from Friday, Mbeki said economic policy would not change, despite new leadership of the ruling African National Congress. The ANC, at its congress in December, had recommitted itself to current policy. "If you look at the policy decisions taken by the conference, they don't change policy in any way. They basically reaffirmed the correctness of the policies we have been pursuing (and) essentially the country stays on the same course." GRAFT CHARGES The election of Jacob Zuma as ANC president, over Mbeki, has raised concerns among investors that the administration's pro-business stance, lauded by ratings agencies, may be altered. It has also resulted in tensions between the Mbeki-led government and the new leadership of the ANC. Mbeki will stay national president until elections set for 2009. Zuma is backed by the ANC's left and its trade union and communist allies, who have criticised the country's inflation targeting framework and tight monetary policy, and prudent fiscal stance. The populist Zuma is also facing graft charges - which his supporters claim are directed by Mbeki -- raising the risk of more political upheaval. Mbeki reiterated that the electricity crisis the country faced could be solved, adding it was a consequence of stronger-than-expected economic growth. "The problem of electricity (shortages) comes from the growth of the country. (It is) not the country going down, but the country going up," he said. Power utility Eskom is battling to meet demand for electricity and has cut supplies to homes and businesses. Output at the world's biggest platinum and key gold mines halted in January after the state-owned company said it could not guarantee supply.
