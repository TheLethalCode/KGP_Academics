<TITLE> No deal in Russia-Ukraine gas row, supply cuts loom </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia was hours away from cutting gas supplies to Ukraine by a quarter but granted a brief extension to its deadline after last ditch talks on Monday failed to resolve a debt dispute. Russia supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, most of it via Ukraine, and European customers are hoping the row will not escalate into a repeat of winter 2006, when a pricing dispute between Moscow and Kiev disrupted shipments to Europe. Both Ukraine and Russia have assured Europe that gas flows westward will not be interrupted. Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom has said it will on Tuesday cut a quarter of the gas it ships to Ukraine if Kiev does not settle in full a $1.5 billion debt for earlier supplies. Ukraine's pro-Western Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who clashed with Russia over gas during her previous stint in office, blamed Russian-imposed gas traders for racking up the debt and said Kiev could not pay it in full right away. Talks in Moscow between Gazprom negotiators and officials from Ukraine's state-owned energy company Naftogaz ended on Monday without a deal. "The talks are to continue on Tuesday," a Naftogaz spokesman said. A rare visit to Moscow on Tuesday by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko could be Kiev's last chance to avert a cut in supplies. He is to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin for a visit scheduled before the gas row broke out. Gazprom had set the deadline for reducing gas flows at 0700 GMT on Tuesday but later announced it was pushing this back to 1500 GMT to give officials more time to seek a deal. "The pace of talks we are seeing at the moment shows that it is difficult to expect that all the problems would be settled today and that all differences would be removed," Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told Ekho Moskvy radio station before Monday's talks ended. Most of Gazprom's top executives were at a reception in the Kremlin on Monday evening to mark the firm's 15th anniversary. U.S. singer Tina Turner and British rock group Deep Purple were booked to perform. "CHANCE OF A DEAL" Yushchenko's chief of staff Viktor Baloga spoke by telephone to Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, the Ukrainian official said in a statement posted on the president's Internet site. "We discussed at length the arguments advanced by the Russian side. These cannot be ignored. There is, however, a real chance to resolve all issues in dispute," Baloga said. Gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial, but it is likely to revive accusations that Russia is using its energy resources to apply political pressure on its neighbours. The debt dispute emerged less than two months after Tymoshenko returned to the prime minister's job after an election, replacing Viktor Yanukovich who has warmer relations with Moscow. On Monday, Tymoshenko told reporters in Kiev it was Yanukovich, and former Energy Minister Yuri Boiko, who were responsible for running up the arrears. She put the debt a $1.072 billion -- less than the figure cited by Gazprom -- and said she wanted the debt restructured. Tymoshenko has long called for a shake-up of gas supplies to squeeze out Rosukrenergo, an intermediary which channels gas supplies from Russia to Ukraine. She says the arrangement lacks transparency. "As the Yanukovich government and Boiko left this debt, I believe Boiko, who now represents RosUkrEnergo, must do all he can so this debt can be restructured over a long period of time," she said. "Ukraine will not pay this debt at one go." But Gazprom's Kupriyanov said RosUkrRnergo's role was not on the negotiating table for now. "Before we start talking about new schemes, we should fill in all the holes in the old ones, to get all the old debts paid," he said. The gas Russia supplies to Ukraine is a mixture of fuel from Russian fields and cheaper Central Asian gas, which flows through Gazprom's pipeline network. Officials with Gazprom said the cut-off, if it goes ahead, would affect only the Russian gas, which accounts for 25 percent of the fuel it ships to Ukraine
