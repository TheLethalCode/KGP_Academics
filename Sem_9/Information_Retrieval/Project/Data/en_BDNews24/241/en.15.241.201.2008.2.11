 Baghdad, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US sniper was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being convicted by a court martial on Sunday of murdering an unarmed Iraqi citizen and then planting a gun on his body, the U.S. military said. At the courthouse in Camp Victory, the main U.S. base near Baghdad's international airport, Sergeant Evan Vela, from the U.S. state of Idaho, was found guilty of the killing and another charge of making false official statements. "Sgt. Evan Vela was found guilty on one specification of unpremeditated murder during a general courts martial," a statement from the U.S. military said. He was also convicted of planting an AK-47 machine gun on the dead Iraqi, a violation under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, of conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. He was stripped of all pay and allowances, and given a dishonourable discharge from the army. The incident took place in May last year during an operation near the town of Iskandariyah, 40 km (25 miles) south of Baghdad. Vela's lawyer had argued that his client was suffering from extreme sleep deprivation and physical fatigue. Vela had admitted shooting the man after he stumbled upon the sleeping place of Vela and his colleagues, but said he had no exact recollection of the incident. Last November two other snipers, Staff Sergeant Michael Hensley and Specialist Jorge Sandoval, were cleared of murder but convicted of planting evidence.
