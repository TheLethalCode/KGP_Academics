<TITLE> Maskwaith Ahsan sends <i>Monga Caravan</i> on its way </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)Journalist and author Maskwaith Ahsan launched his intriguingly titled Monga Caravan Sunday. A published author in Bengali, Maskwaith's first venture into English is a collection of eight short stories. bdnews24.com editor-in-chief Toufique Imrose Khalidi unveiled the title at the Ekushey Book Fair. At the book's launching ceremony Toufique said: "Maskawaith Ahsan's depth of thought and feeling have so far been revealed to us in the Bangla language." "Now those same thoughts and feelings have been expressed by the author in English." "His literary endeavour in English will help project Bangla culture and thought into a wider context," Toufique Imrose said. Maskwaith, a journalist by profession, said he considers writing in English a challenging but interesting endeavour. One of the reasons the author gives for deciding to write in English is the absence of Bangladeshi writers in the global arena. "I have seen that Bangladeshi literature has no presence in many international book fairs, while I have seen Indian and Pakistani writers contribute many works in English," Maskwaith said. "Overseas readers also want something from Bangladeshi writers. This has prompted me to push out our boundaries. At least we can make an effort, and start our journey." he said. The author said he was inspired by his surroundings: "I live with politics: in politics." "I am not detached from different societies across the globe." "I can't ignore the dynamics that always move around me. But I have carefully tried to put them into a context, without forgetting literary technique." The captivatingly named stories in the collection include: Monga Caravan, Olive Valley, I wanted to be like him, Timeless skies, Madam Bovary and the secret kite, The myth of nine eleven and The Daily BlackBerry and Tale of a little Casanova. Shahjahan Faruq, a former senior director of Bangladesh Betar said: "With Maskawaith Ahsan's writing in English, the potential for Bangla literature being published outside the country has been created." Monga Caravan is published by Jonantik Prokashoni. bdnews24.co
