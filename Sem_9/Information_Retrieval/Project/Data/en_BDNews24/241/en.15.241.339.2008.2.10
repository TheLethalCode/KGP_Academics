 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) has launched lottery in a bid to raise fund for increasing country's sports facilities. "The BOA conducts different national and international games including the long training programme to develop country's sports. The BOA needs more fund to continue their activities," said BOA acting secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed at a press conference Sunday. "To step up the development programme, we have taken to an alternative course to raise fund through lottery as the government is not able to provide such a high huge amount of money," Ahmed hoped that they would make a net profit of Tk 1.5 to 2 crore. Some Tk 42 lakh will be awarded as 1001 prizes with the first winner getting an apartment in the capital or Tk 25 lakh in cash, he added. The draw of the lottery will be held on March 2 and the tickets are now available in different banks  Sonali, Agrani, Rupali, Agriculture, Janata, Pubali, Uttara, Mitual Trust, Dutch-Bangla and Trust. The marketing agents  Sardar Agencies, Diamond International, Adsoft communications  will also market the tickets across the country. Ahmed said they were determined to do everything in a transparent way so that no allegation can be raised in future. BOA chief operating officer Col (retd) Waliullah said they have a plan to launch the second lottery in November next.
