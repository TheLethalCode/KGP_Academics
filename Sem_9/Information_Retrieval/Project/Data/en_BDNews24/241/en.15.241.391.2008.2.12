<TITLE> Guantanamo executions will take years, lawyers say </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Miami, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There is little chance any of the alleged Sept. 11 conspirators at Guantanamo will be convicted, let alone executed, before the clock runs out on the Bush administration, military lawyers and analysts say. The Pentagon announced on Monday that it was charging the alleged mastermind of the 2001 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and five other prisoners with murder and would seek to execute them if convicted. President George W. Bush has made the war on terrorism the cornerstone of his administration. But trial rules, a shortage of military defense lawyers and pending legal challenges almost guarantee the next U.S. president will inherit the Guantanamo trials when he or she takes office in January. The leading Republican and Democratic contenders for the November presidential election say they want to shut down the Guantanamo detention operation. Air Force Col. Moe Davis, who resigned as the Guantanamo chief prosecutor earlier this year because of what he considered political interference, suggested the Bush administration was racing the clock to ensure the trials went forward after he leaves office. "Several layers below the White House, there was kind of a common theme that these things had to get going before the election," Davis said. "If you get that train rolling, it's going to make it difficult for whoever wins the election to stop that. Who's going to tell the 9-11 families they want to stop this process?" But the rules require that the six detainees charged with conspiring to murder nearly 3,000 people by flying hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon be "zealously and vigorously" defended at trial by U.S. military lawyers. The chief defense lawyer for the trials, Army Col. Steve David, said he does not have enough attorneys to defend the men. The seven lawyers in his office are already laden with cases and must share a lone intelligence analyst, said David, who added he has requested more manpower "for months and months." SHORTAGE OF ATTORNEYS, ANALYSTS Since the six are to be tried together on overlapping charges and face the death penalty if convicted, each will need a separate defense team of two military lawyers, an intelligence analyst and a paralegal, he said. The charges must still be approved by a Pentagon official before the prisoners can be arraigned. David estimates the arraignments could take place in about 60 days, but as for the timing of the trial, he said, "I have not a clue." The rules also say the trials must start within 120 days of arraignment, unless the defense asks for more time. Defense attorneys are likely to do that because they need time to build relationships with their clients, who are held under extremely tight security, and to track down any exculpatory evidence held within the labyrinth of U.S. government agencies. "The government's had years and years in some cases to prepare their cases. They've had unlimited access to the accused. They have unlimited resources," David said. The defense will also pursue numerous challenges to the Guantanamo court system, which Congress authorized in 2006 to try non-US captives who are considered "enemy combatants" not entitled to trial in the regular civilian or military courts. "There are issues of torture, mental and emotional health of the detainees, and to what extent they can assist in their defense after being held so long," David said. Military and civilian defense lawyers in the Guantanamo cases say they are not stalling in order to run out the clock on the Bush administration. Rather, the defense lawyers consider the court system fundamentally flawed and will continue to challenge it, as they did with the Supreme Court case that stuck down the first Guantanamo tribunals established by Bush. A conviction in the Guantanamo court "would be the worst thing that could happen," said Dennis Edney, a Canadian civilian lawyer assisting the defense of Canadian prisoner Omar Khadr, who is charged with murdering a US soldier in a firefight in Afghanistan when he was 15 years old. Even if one of the prisoners agreed to plead guilty, the case would automatically be appealed through a military appeals court and then to a federal appeals court and all the way to the US Supreme Court. "Any possible execution would still be years in the future," said David Glazier, a former Navy officer and military law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
