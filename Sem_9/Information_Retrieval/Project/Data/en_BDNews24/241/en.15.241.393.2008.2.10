<TITLE> An authentic train wreck </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Fazal M. Kamal Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com) -- It did indeed look like an awfully horrendous week for GrameenPhone (hereinafter referred to as GP, though the urge to spell it out as GrameenPunk is ginormous): first there was what maybe described as a close-the-ranks "overhaul" of its management team; then came the indictment of "senior figures" for reported outside-the-law activities; after this arrived a notice from the regulator, BTRC, asking GP why its license shouldn't be cancelled for violating terms of the license; this was followed by the attack on its makeshift showroom near the Bangla Academy; and finally---and certainly, most tragically---one GP employee was knifed to death by robbers. It was a bona fide train wreck. Can it get any worse? Who on earth can answer that question with any modicum of conviction? Who would dare given the circumstances? They were worrying about losing custom; they ended up losing their pants. The only definite thing that can be said at this point in time is that it was one enormous smackdown between good and evil in the classic sense---and everyone certainly hopes and prays that good will ultimately triumph. But first let's go back to the beginning. The people of Bangladesh owe a huge and resounding "thank you" to the BTRC, the lawmen and various others engaged in ferreting out the slime that had accumulated in GP's innards. Some say it was bound to happen sooner or later. The reality is, the determination and gumption of those involved in bringing these alleged shenanigans to light definitely deserve profound approbation, especially because, to most observers, this entity was strutting about with a swagger that only something believing it is a state within the state can. The events throw up a plethora of queries: Were the promotions of some employees and the consolidation of a few divisions/departments meant to close ranks before the head hit the nail? Or were they expected to ward off the competition that was snapping at its feet after years of cozy business which a brand name brought its way? Or was there a whiff that some maybe caught with their hands in the cookie jar? Secondly, what made some of the employees of this company assume a posture akin to the overbearing arrogance of madams of a certain type of houses? And why were some others behaving with the kind of petulant arrogance usually associated with ladies of easy virtue? What was there to be so disgustingly arrogant about when you're merely just another commercial outfit but with the tremendous good fortune to have the opportunity to exploit the good name and goodwill that the brand Grameen carries with it? Then there's the question about the opacity in its functioning. Of course, one major cause for that is now evident, namely the reported illegal business at least some of its employees were indulging in. But if it's the "largest" cell phone service provider why is it so tardy in paying its creditors in time? Why do their finance/accounts employees stubbornly refuse to deal with or answer queries from those whom GP owes money? (It has been suggested, obviously only half in jest, if some of these employees are so bashful, why don't they go behind the veil before talking to their creditors on the phone?) Who, indeed, is keeping track of all that money of the "largest" operator? Last December then-recently-arrived GP chief executive officer had promised action against those in the firm who had engaged in alleged crooked activities. Here the question is, why was no such action taken till the crime busters moved in? Why, only a day or two before the formal accusation became public knowledge, did its newly-promoted PR director claim---in what might now be described as famous last words---that "we will speak [about rogue elements in GP and what action was taken relating to them by the CEO as promised by him earlier] at the right time"? Alas and alack, lo and behold, he never got the chance to "speakat the right time." How tragic! Another question that's hanging for appropriate response is the one regarding the reported oral instruction of one of the many Scandinavian expats (does the company need all of them, really; and does the number tally with government caps?) to GP staff not to cooperate with the investigators. (One hears this with deep despair given that there is so much rich irony in it since Scandinavian governments and NGOs are most vociferous about corruption in other countries. Good grief. What shall we hear of next!) What made him, i.e. the "head of revenue assurance"---whatever that may mean or does it mean assuring revenue at any cost by any method possible?---to go to this length unless there was more than sufficient fear that something much bigger than just a cat might exit the proverbial bag? And does this not amount to causing obstruction to lawful inquiry and the course of justice? By comparison, in most other cases around the world, whenever any wrongdoing was suspected, among the very first declarations made by the related organization was one of full and active cooperation with the investigating authorities. One recent example is that of Siemens, which has been going through some torrid times: as soon as the stink began to rise senior Siemens officers proclaimed their total and voluntary cooperation with the investigators. Now compare this with GP's Mr. Warendroph's by-now legendary verbal instruction. Cheap and silly, to say the very least; and reprehensible to boot. We will refrain from going much further now since we believe justice certainly will not only take its own course but will also be done, and the proper punishment will be meted out if the charges are proven. However, it's irresistible not to note with some bemusement the names of two of the former top honchos with alleged connivance: it surely hasn't gone unnoticed one went by the name of a body part of which the less is said the better; the other was called by what maybe described as the initial bars of a musical composition. It was bound to happen in a sordid affair like this, just like in the movies. Nevertheless---and in spite of the jokers in the pack of avaricious rodents---it possibly could be of substantial utility, now that formal charges have been made known, to ask a number of pertinent questions of those who despite the indictment appear to be most self-assured and self-satisfied. For instance, what did they know and who else knew? How much were they parties to the carpet bagging under the leadership of aliens who thought nothing of robbing the nation? Did others, if any, partake of the loot? Utilizing the appropriate interrogative methods answers to these and similar other queries need to be wrung out of the named persons for the sake of the truth and fairness. One reason the accused parties might be feeling comfortable still could be their belief that at least some segment of the media will, at the very minimum, preserve silence on this matter even if they don't come out with attempted apologies or defense in their behalf. Well definitely! With the kind of largess the company handed out under the seal of buying space/time often for vastly gratuitous and redundant ads, surely, this much should be expected by those who made the payouts. Is this what is known as a pacifier? Or is there another word for it? Oh well, let's move on then. Footnote: Dr. Muhammad Yunus had diligently and patiently transformed the name "Grameen" into an internationally praised and honored brand. It's not something to be trifled with; and neither will this nation quietly permit such a thing. If what is now known be true, that name is being dragged through not just mud but the putrid droppings of assorted animals. It is absolutely imperative that he retrieves that brand name, before it begins to stink worse than at present, by rescuing it from the grimy clutches of squalid tentacles. Telenor, obviously, has not been able to protect and uphold the respect and great goodwill that name brings with it.
