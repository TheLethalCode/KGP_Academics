 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Pakistani company who have been providing technical assistance in a project to convert drivers' licences to plastic are to hand over the technicalities of the scheme to local personnel. Pakistan's High Commissioner Alamgir Babar informed communications adviser Ghulam Quader of the decision Monday, an official said. The Pakistani National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) have been assisting the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority in an initiative to convert all driving licenses to plastic. Communications ministry information officer AFM Aminul Islam said Quader had been assured that necessary training would be given to local personnel prior to the withdrawal of the Pakistani technical team. A Pakistan delegation led by NADRA's chairman is expected to arrive in the country soon to assist in the transfer of skills. NADRA's contract will expire by the middle the year. bdnew
