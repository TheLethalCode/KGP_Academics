 Seoul, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 600-year-old gate in central Seoul listed as South Korea's number one national treasure and the country's landmark symbol has been destroyed, possibly by an arsonist, police said on Monday. The gate, whose history is drummed into South Korean school children from an early age, is a huge loss to ordinary citizens, many of whom gathered to look in horror at a national icon reduced to ashes. Officials said the fire that engulfed Namdaemun, or "Great South Gate", was believed to be brought under control late on Sunday but it reignited after midnight, destroying the wooden structure despite the efforts of more than 100 firefighters. "It feels like the pride of the nation and hope is lost and crumbled," said onlooker Lee Mimi, a Seoul homemaker. Police said they were searching for a man whom a witness said broke into the stone and wooden structure and started the fire. However, they did not rule out an electrical fault as the cause. "We're investigating a number of possible causes of the fire, including arson and faulty electric wiring," said Namdaemun Police Station chief Kim Young-soo. Police were also going through the tapes recorded by closed-circuit TV cameras near the gate but had not been able to identify a man entering the structure, Kim said. Firefighters, who said they wanted to proceed cautiously to preserve Namdaemun, doused the structure with water but did not break through the roof or enter the wooden pavilion to extinguish the fire inside, police officials said. The gate was constructed in 1398 and served as the main southern entrance for Seoul when it became Korea's capital more than 600 years ago and was a walled city, the Cultural Heritage Administration said. Namdaemun has also been the centrepiece of the country's international tourism campaign, with scores of tour buses making a stop each day before visitors are ushered to the open-air market across the street that shares the gate's name. The structure, also called Sungnyemun or "Gate of Exalted Ceremonies", has been rebuilt several times, with the most recent major renovation taking place from 1961-1963, the agency said. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said at the scene the government will try its best to restore the gate.
