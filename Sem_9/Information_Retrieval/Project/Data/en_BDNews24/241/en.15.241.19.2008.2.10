<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Sunday granted three months' interim bail to Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah who was detained under emergency powers rules. Defence lawyers said there was no other obstacle to Hannan Shah's immediate release. The High Court asked the government to show cause why the BNP leader should not be cleared of a general diary filed against him for violating emergency rules. Fatullah police re-arrested Hannan Shah on Feb 7 at the gate of Narayanganj jail as he was released in connection with a separate case. Sub inspector Bhuiyan Mahbub Hasan filed the general diary against him with Fatullah Police Station on allegations that Hannan Shah led a rally at nearby Link Road in which about two thousand party workers participated. The bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Md Abdul Hye issued the bail order Sunday after Hannan Shah appealed for cancellation of the case. The BNP leader denied participating in any rally and said the allegation was false. Narayanganj's deputy commissioner must comply with the court's show cause order within four weeks. Hannan Shah had earlier been arrested on Nov 7 in connection with an incidence of violence near the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar as BNP leaders marked National Revolution and Solidarity Day. On Jan 30, the High Court declared his detention in this connection illegal and granted him bail. Barrister Rafiq Ul Haq defended Hannan in court, assisted by barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokon and advocate ASM Kabir Khan. Kabir Khan later told reporters: "There is no other case against Hannan Shah. There is no obstacle to his release." bdnew
