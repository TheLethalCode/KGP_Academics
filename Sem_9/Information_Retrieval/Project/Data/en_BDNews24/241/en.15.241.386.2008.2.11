 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court sent former BNP lawmaker Moazzem Hossain Alal to Dhaka Central Jail Monday at the end of his two day police remand. Police requested the court to give him one months' detention order. Metropolitan magistrate Ismat Ara Jahan ordered prison authorities to give former MP Alal division in jail and arrange proper treatment as per the Jail Code. Mohammadpur police arrested the Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal general secretary from his Lalmatia residence Friday. Separate cases have been filed with Mohammadpur and Tejgaon police under emergency powers rules accusing him of involvement with provocative activities against the government. Alal was taken into police remand Friday following a court order. In court Monday he claimed himself innocent, saying: "What is my crime? What have I done?" Advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder and Sanaullah Miah appeared on behalf of Alal, appealing for bail, but the court rejected it. The accused was taken to jail in a police van. bdnews24
