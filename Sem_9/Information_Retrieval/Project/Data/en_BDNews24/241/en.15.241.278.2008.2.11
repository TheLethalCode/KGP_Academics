 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) outgoing president SA Sultan's hopes to return to the federation were dashed Monday when the authority asked him not to pursue the matter. Sultan had a meeting with the BFF highups Monday morning and submitted a letter expressing his wish to return as the federation chief. "Yes, he had a meeting with us, and wished to take over his responsibility again," acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu told bdnews24.com Monday. However, a source, on anonymity, said that Sultan had been assigned by the concerned authority to play his role in changing the FIFA directions outside the federation and he had a meeting with the other BFF officials. "He (Sultan) was asked to play his role in changing the statutes of FAs outside the federation, instead of getting involved in the federation," said the source. "When they learnt that Sultan wished to return to the federation, they asked him to refrain from doing so," added the source. On Dec 30, Sultan expressed his inability to continue as the president following a row over the inclusion of government officials in the Football Associations (FA) at divisional and district levels. In April last year, the FIFA asked the BFF to form FAs , without government officials, before going for the BFF election. It also extended the tenure of the expired BFF committee by one year. The BFF and the government are seemingly opposed to each other on the inclusion of government officials in FAs. On Jan 30, the BFF sought an appointment with AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam to discuss the statutes of FAs, but the Asian Football Confederation chief is still to reply. bdn
