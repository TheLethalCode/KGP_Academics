<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) The government has altered its strategy to clinch duty-free access for goods to the US market, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday. Bangladesh started "strong lobbying" to get a bill passed in the US congress to ensure duty-free access for other commodities alongside readymade garments, he said. Speaking as chief guest at a discussion on "Strategy on realising duty-free access of Bangladeshi goods to the US market," organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue at CIRDAP auditorium, he said: "Strong lobbying is underway to get the bill passed." "In that case, cooperation of all is necessary. Winning duty-free access will be difficult if all (LDCs) could not take a united stand," he said. Hossain Zillur said: "Our export market is limited to one or two goods. In this situation, diversification of exports is important. On the world market, goods in demand now may not be so in future." "That's why we have to add new commodities to our export list. And for this, we have to make a united effort to get duty-free access for other commodities (apart from RMG) to the US market." Developed countries had divided the least developed countries into two groups tactically, he said adding that they see the African countries from one angle and the countries of Asia including Bangladesh from another. "In getting trade incentive, the African countries are being benefited more," he said, adding that a united stand of the LDCs was necessary. CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan presided over the discussion, where its executive director Mustafizur Rahman presented the keynote paper. Former foreign secretary Farooq Sobhan, BGMEA president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez, International Chamber of CommerceBangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman, and Bangladesh Textile Mills Owners Association president Abdul Hye Shikder also spoke. Bangladesh has been trying for long to get duty-free access to the US market. Attempts have so far revolved around readymade garments, the main sector of export earnings. Apart from the government, the BGMEA is also trying to get the facility. The government formed an experts committee led by CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman, which is yet to submit a complete report to the government. However, in a partial report, the committee has recommended attempts to get duty-free access for other commodities as well. Hossain Zillur said the present government had considered the matter with "due importance". He that all-out attempts were being made to get the bill passed before the US Presidential elections. Rehman Sobhan said: "Earlier, the developed countries used to provide big amounts of aid to LDCs including Bangladesh. Now it has dropped to almost zero. So now we have to depend on commerce." "For Bangladesh, the US is a big market. If we get duty-free access for our commodities, we will have huge economic benefit." Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury said that in most of the factories the workers were given wages as per the government announced structure. "Barring a few stray incidents, a normal situation was prevailing in the garments industry," he claimed. He hoped that these would play a positive role in the passage of the bill. Readymade garments worth 3.3 billion dollars are exported to the US, Mustafizur Rahman said in the keynote paper. bdnews24.
