<TITLE> Education sector graft will not be spared: Mashhud </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Sunday the anti-graft drive would not spare the education sector, which is often thought to be infested with irregularities and mismanagement. He said his people were gathering information on irregularities in the sector to make a start on unmasking those involved with corruption. "The ACC will soon sit with the concerned senior officials in identifying the persons responsible for corrupting the education sector," he said at the opening of the annual Youth Engagement and Support conference. "We will make sure the offenders are punished," said the ACC chairman. He said their final effort would commence after the officials completed their investigations. Transparency International Bangladesh and Sachetan Nagorik Committee (citizens' committee) organised the conference in the city's Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, as part of a campaign against pervasive corruption. The watchdog boss said the majority of the people bear the brunt because of a few corrupt people. "The corrupt are the enemies of the people. We expect the country's youth to lead national efforts in the fight against the monsters," Mashhud said. He said people may disagree over corruption suspects but there was no doubt that they all wanted corruption be uprooted. "You must speak against the vices of corruption and the corrupt, trying all the time to dissuade them from evil doings. You must succeed, eventually," he said. Mashhud was hopeful that the ACC would continue to work under political governments to fight corruption. Sultana Kamal, TIB trustee and former adviser to the caretaker government, asked the young people in attendance to look back to 1952, 1969 and 1971, saying: "You'll realise that we have never lost in the past." "If we chastise the offenders morally and socially, we'll succeed once again," she said. Mohammad Jafar Iqbal asked young people to come forward and join hands in the cause of fighting corruption. "My generation has taken part in the War of Liberation and wrestled freedom for you." "Now it's your turn to root out corruption and rebuild Bangladesh," he said. Iftekharuzzaman, TIB's executive director, said their effort to uproot corruption has been strengthened because of the young people joining the fight for the cause. bdnew
