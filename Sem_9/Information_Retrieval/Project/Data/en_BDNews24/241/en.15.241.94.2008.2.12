<TEXT>
 Beijing, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bus plunged into an icy river in a Chinese province hit by recent snow storms, killing at least 14 people on one of China's busiest travel days of the year. As the last day of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, Tuesday marks the day when millions of workers and students return to their places of work or universities after spending the festival with their families. The bus plunged into the Chishui River in the impoverished southwestern province of Guizhou, the official Xinhua news agency said. Fourteen people were injured in the crash, Xinhua said. It cited a local official as saying that the bus was completely submerged in water, making it difficult to ascertain if there were more victims. Xinhua did not say if the crash was weather-related, but Guizhou has been one of the provinces most severely hit by snow and ice storms that have swept much of the south from mid-January. Many roads have been cut off and power lines destroyed. Millions of travellers were unable to return to their loved ones at the start of the holiday, as rail links and roads were cut off by the worst snowstorms the south has seen in decades. The bad weather caused billions of dollars in damage and killed at least 80 people, but over the past few days the government has restored nearly all rail and road links. ICY ROADS However, the National Meteorological Centre cautioned that expected bad weather over the next few days, including sleet, snow and gusty winds, could cause road conditions to deteriorate. Guizhou and Yunnan provinces would probably have sleet over the next couple of days, while parts of Tibet and Qinghai, in the far west, could expect heavy snowfall, it said. Meanwhile, much of the south and southwest would face rain or snow flurries. A cold snap was expected to hit the north and northeast, bringing strong winds to much of the eastern seaboard. Trains and highways, packed on the last day of the holiday, have so far seen none of the widespread chaos that marked the weeks before the festival, state media said. More than 5 million passengers rode trains on Tuesday, making it the busiest day for the rail system since the start of the holiday, state television said. More than 53 million people were expected to travel by road, it added. President Hu Jintao called on the military to continue to work to restore infrastructure damaged by the storms, state television reported. More than 2.5 million soldiers, police and reservists had been mobilised for relief efforts so far, it said. Workers had restored power to 93 percent of households that had suffered power cuts as a result of the storms, Xinhua said, adding that in Guizhou, the grid would not be fully restored until the end of March. Coal stocks at major thermal power plants in southern China had largely recovered after dipping to dangerously low levels in late January, state television said.
