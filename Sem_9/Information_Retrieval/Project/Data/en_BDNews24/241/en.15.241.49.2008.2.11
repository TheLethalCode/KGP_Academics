 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors took a flight to safety last year -- switching to cash from specialist sectors. Money market funds accounted for 39 percent of assets invested in 2007, largely due to volatility that sent world stock markets into freefall in the latter part of the year, according to Barclays Stockbrokers. Investors bought a mixture of cautious and growth investments up until the third quarter, after which the focus shifted to cash holdings. Despite this, the specialist sector -- the most popular in 2006 -- remained attractive and the Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) sector showed unparalleled growth, moving from sixth most bought sector to second. Amy Nauiokas, managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers, said: "The dominance of the money market and equity income sectors reflects the cautious nature of our clients in 2007. "But there are some investors who continue to find opportunities in more diverse markets, with the Asia-Pacific, specialist and emerging markets sectors remaining popular." The top five funds bought through Barclays Stockbrokers in 2007 were: Fidelity Cash, M&G High Interest, Gartmore China Opportunities, JP Morgan Natural Resources and Blackrock Merrill Lynch Gold & General. In 2006, the top five funds were: Blackrock Merrill Lynch Gold & General, Jupiter Emerging European Opportunities, JP Morgan Natural Resources, Fidelity Moneybuilder Income and Schroders UK Mid 250
