 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah was freed on bail Tuesday night, his assistant said. "My boss (Hannan Shah) was released at 8.00pm (from Narayanganj jail)," the BNP leader's assistant Babul Ahmed told bdnews24.com by phone. The High Court Sunday granted three-month bail to the BNP leader who had been detained under emergency powers rules. The bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Md Abdul Hye issued the bail order after Hannan Shah appealed for cancellation of a general diary. The court also asked the government to explain why the BNP leader should not be cleared of charges in the general diary filed for violating emergency powers rules. Fatullah police rearrested Hannan Shah on Feb 7 at the gate of Narayanganj jail shortly after he was released in connection with a separate case. A police sub-inspector filed the general diary against him with Fatullah Police Station on allegations that Hannan Shah had led a rally of about 200 party workers on the nearby Link Road. Hannan Shah was earlier arrested on Nov 7 over an incident of violence near the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar as BNP leaders marked National Revolution and Solidarity Day. bdnew
