<TITLE> Mexico living quality lags economic growth: WTO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico's per capita income has lagged economic growth and it needs to increase efficiency to boost living standards, a World Trade Organisation (WTO) report said on Monday. Mexico's per capita income rose at an average rate of 1.7 percent from 2001 onwards, reaching $8,000 in 2006, while its gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.3 percent, the WTO said in a review of Mexico's trade policies. "To raise the growth rate on a sustainable basis, additional reforms are needed to overcome problems such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of competitiveness in the domestic market and the low educational level of the workforce," the report said. But prudent fiscal management has helped Mexico consolidate its budget -- which was in balance in 2005 and 2006 -- and cut the public debt to GDP ratio. Mexico has also successfully kept inflationary expectations around its target of about 3 percent and the government is also trying to reduce the dependence of public finances on oil revenu
