 BAGHDAD, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed, including 10 suspected al Qaeda insurgents, in clashes with local security units in northern Iraq on Sunday, the US military said.

Attacks across Iraq have fallen by 60 percent since last June, when a "surge" of 30,000 extra US troops became fully deploy
