<TITLE> Niger court refuses to release RFI journalist </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Niamey, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court in Niger has refused a request for the provisional release of a journalist working for French radio station RFI detained last September for suspected links to Tuareg rebels, legal sources said on Tuesday. Moussa Kaka, director of a private radio station and RFI's Niger correspondent, was arrested on Sept. 20 and accused of receiving gifts or direct payment for reports on the Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ), a rebel group in the desert north. RFI says the only contact Kaka, who is from Niger, had with the rebellion was through his work as a journalist. An appeals court in the capital Niamey on Tuesday rejected a request for Kaka's provisional release and overruled a previous court decision that phone-tap evidence presented by the government against Kaka was illegal. Uranium-rich northern Niger has been off limits for foreign journalists since August as part of efforts to combat rebels who have killed around 50 government security personnel since launching their uprising a year ago. The Tuareg-led MNJ is demanding greater regional autonomy and control over revenues from foreign uranium mining. Niger has a poor record for press freedom and Kaka's arrest and continued detention is one of a list of actions by President Mamadou Tandja's government to have alarmed press watchdogs. Two reporters for European TV station ARTE were arrested in mid-December for violating the terms of their media accreditation by filming rebel fighters in the Sahara instead of reporting on bird flu as they had said they would. After initial fears they could face the death penalty if convicted, the two were released on bail last month. In September, the government deported independent French TV producer Francois Begeron after holding him for a month for visiting northern Niger without its authorisation.
