<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Tuesday upheld a High Court order which had granted bail to former energy secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury in the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust graft case. A full-bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, rejected the Anticorruption Commission's application to have the bail order stayed. The High Court granted the bail order on Feb 3. The ACC filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 last year against eight individuals, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Summit Group managing director Md Aziz Khan. The ACC accuses the eight of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium in return for contracts to build three barge-mounted power plants, ignoring the lowest bidder. The accused allegedly purchased land in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust with the money, according to the ACC. The case was transferred under emergency powers rules on Sept 20 last year. On Nov 16, Toufique surrendered to court and was sent to jail. Toufique's counsel, barrister Rafiq-ul Huq, told reporters that the High Court had granted his client bail in consideration of his contribution to the country during the liberation war. bd
