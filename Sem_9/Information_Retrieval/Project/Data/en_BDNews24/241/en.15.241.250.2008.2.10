 Jerusalem, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert threatened on Sunday to target all Palestinians responsible for cross-border rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip but warned against a knee-jerk Israeli military response. Olmert has been wary of launching a large-scale ground operation in the densely populated coastal territory that could result in heavy Israeli as well as Palestinian casualties. But he is under mounting domestic pressure to do more to counter the rocket fire, which seriously wounded two Israelis, including an eight-year-old boy, in the southern Israeli town of Sderot on Saturday. Part of the boy's leg was amputated. "We need to act in an orderly and methodical fashion over time. This is what we are doing. This is what we will continue to do," Olmert told his cabinet. The prime minister vowed to target "all terror elements" in the Gaza Strip -- both those directly responsible for the rocket attacks as well as those who help organise them. "We will not give special consideration to anyone," Olmert said, the strongest hint yet that Israel could start assassinating political leaders of the Hamas movement, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June after routing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's secular Fatah forces. Key members of Olmert's cabinet explicitly called for targeting Hamas political leaders. Two months after Olmert and Abbas launched the most serious statehood talks in seven years, the chief Israeli negotiator, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, said there would be "no hope" for peace or a Palestinian state that includes the Gaza Strip as long as militants kept up the rocket fire. The chief Palestinian negotiator, former prime minister Ahmed Qurie, cautioned that any Israeli military escalation would "affect the negotiation process", which, he acknowledged, has yet to pick up momentum or delve deeply into core issues. Hamas, shunned by the West for refusing to renounce violence and recognise Israel's right to exist, claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing last week that killed one Israeli. The group opposes Abbas's peace talks. ROCKET ATTACKS Gaza militants frequently fire short-range rockets and mortars at towns in southern Israel in what they say is a response to Israeli attacks on the territory. Few of the rockets have caused deaths, but they have sown widespread panic. Livni appeared to be preparing the ground internationally for a stepped up Israeli military campaign to stop the rockets. "There is a need for the international community to understand that there are certain steps that Israel needs to take in order to stop it," Livni said of the cross-border attacks. "Israel, according to international law, has the right and the duty to defend its citizens." Olmert's top deputy, Vice Premier Haim Ramon, said Israel should respond to the attacks by "raining fire" down on specific areas in the Gaza Strip where the rockets were launched. Cabinet Minister Meir Sheetrit said Israel should let residents in those areas leave and then "demolish everything". Ramon, Sheetrit and Cabinet Minister Zeev Boim said anyone involved in the rocket attacks, either directly or indirectly, should be targeted for assassination. Sheetrit singled out Ismail Haniyeh, prime minister of Hamas's government in the Gaza Strip, as a "legitimate target". Israel assassinated top Hamas leaders Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi in the Gaza Strip in 2004. Israel has since largely refrained from targeting Hamas's political wing but has struck against the Islamist movement's field commanders. After Saturday's rocket fire wounded the eight-year-old boy, an Israeli air strike killed a Hamas militant in southern Gaza. As part of its campaign to stop the rockets and isolate Hamas, Israel has tightened its blockade of the coastal territory. Human rights groups criticise what they call "collective punishment" against Gaza's 1.5 million residents
