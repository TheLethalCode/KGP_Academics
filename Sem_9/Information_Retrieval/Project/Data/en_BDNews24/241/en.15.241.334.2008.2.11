<TITLE> Chad rebels to EU states: don`t send troops to Chad </TITLE>

 N`djamena, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chad's rebels on Monday urged European Union member states not to send peacekeeping troops to the country's east, saying the force would not be neutral because it was dominated by France. The rebels said that the former colonial power, which is contributing more than half of the 3,700-strong EU force (EUFOR), had directly helped President Idriss Deby to beat off a rebel attack on the capital N'Djamena earlier this month. The EU said on Friday it hoped that the deployment of its peacekeeping mission to protect refugees displaced by the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region would resume this week after the rebel attack caused it to be temporarily suspended. The alliance of anti-Deby rebel groups, which has withdrawn to eastern Chad after pulling back from N'Djamena, said in a statement that French tanks and helicopters, part of a French military contingent stationed in the country, had opened fire in the recent fighting. Civilians were killed, it added. France, which has rallied international support behind Deby, has denied its forces took any direct part in combat, although it said they fired back in self-defence while evacuating more than 1,000 French and other foreign nationals from N'Djamena. "France has shown to the world she is no longer neutral in this conflict that opposes Deby's dictatorial regime against the armed national resistance," the rebel statement said. EU commanders suspended the deployment of the force during intense fighting around and in N'Djamena on Feb. 1-3. EUFOR has a United Nations mandate to protect more than half a million refugees who have fled fighting in Darfur. Thousands more refugees fled into Chad over the weekend to escape Sudanese army and militia attacks in West Darfur. "We are already operating in an environment where security is spiralling downwards, where the supply line from N'Djamena is cut after recent fighting, and where our field offices are running short of fuel," said Catherine Huck, head of operations for UN refugee agency UNHCR in Abeche, eastern Chad. "Getting newly arrived refugees away from the border into camps is a real challenge." OIL OUTPUT UNAFFECTED Chad's Oil Minister Emmanuel Nadingar said the country's 140,000-160,000 barrels per day (bpd) oil output had not been affected by the fighting. But he said the violence had disrupted prospecting and plans for a new refinery. EUFOR has insisted its forces will remain strictly neutral in the internal Chadian conflict. But the rebel alliance said France's "unconditional support" for Deby, whose opponents denounce him as a corrupt and dictatorial ruler, meant EUFOR could not be neutral and had changed the circumstances of the deployment. "The alliance of the armed opposition ... immediately demands that other European countries refrain from sending their nationals in EUFOR, whose final objective is to protect the Deby regime," the rebel statement said. After withdrawing from the capital a week ago following battles that killed at least 165 people and injured more than 800, the rebels have moved back towards the border with Sudan. Chad accuses Sudan of backing the anti-Deby rebels to block the EU deployment, a charge denied by Khartoum. The rebels said on Sunday they had seized the eastern town of Am Timan and that they were still in control of the centre of the landlocked central African country. Since the fighting, French warplanes have been flying daily reconnaissance missions over Chad. A French military spokesman, Pascal le Testu, confirmed the rebels were at Am Timan. But he said government forces controlled the central towns of Mongo and Bitkine, which the rebels claimed to have taken at the weekend
