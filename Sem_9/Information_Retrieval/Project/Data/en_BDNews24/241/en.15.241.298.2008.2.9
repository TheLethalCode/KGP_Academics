 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Broken undersea cables providing data services to parts of the Middle East and Asia were repaired Saturday resuming internet and voice call services, telecoms officials said. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board general manager Lt Col Zia Rashid Sofdar told bdnews24.com: "The reconstruction of six STM-1s used for internet services and three STM-1s used for voice calls has been completed early Saturday." Cable cuts in Alexandria, Egypt on the morning of Jan 30 slowed or suspended internet services across Bangladesh. Two international submarine cables in the Mediterranean Sea were damaged, causing significant disruptions to internet and phone traffic in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India and all of the Gulf states. The first cut in the undersea Internet cable occurred on Jan 23, in the Flag Falcon submarine cable, TeleGeography said earlier. Almost 90 percent of internet traffic is routed through undersea cables, and only 10 percent is done through the satellite, TeleGeography said. The breaches reportedly affected an estimated 1.7 million internet users, including those in Bangladesh. TeleGeography said new cable construction could help prevent such outages in future. Many new cable systems are slated to enter service between Europe and Egypt in the next few years, including Telecom Egypt's TE North cable, Orascom's MENA system, the IMEWE consortium cable and a new cable by Flag Telecom, it said. The introduction of these new systems will provide additional routing options and improve resiliency, but multiple cables are no guarantee against outages, TeleGeography said. In December 2006, seven of the eight cables connected to Taiwan were damaged by an earthquake, disrupting communications in much of Asia. Cable operators needed several months to restore service to normal. Amid much speculation, it was widely reported that experts believe the cause of damage in Egypt could have been a ship's anchor that was dragging after inclement weather conditions during that period. About 60 to 80 percent of damages to undersea cable are due to external factors, and only 10 percent on average can be classified as component failure, experts said. bdnews
