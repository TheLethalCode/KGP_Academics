 N`Djamena, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition leaders in Chad said on Sunday they were worried about a number of their colleagues arrested a week ago in the dying hours of a failed rebel assault on the capital. Several opponents of President Idriss Deby, including former head of state Lol Mahamat Choua, were taken from their homes in N'Djamena by armed men in uniform on Sunday, Feb. 3. "We have no news. We can't find out where they are, or even if they are still alive," Mahamat Allahou Taher, spokesman for Lol's Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) party told Reuters at Lol's N'Djamena residence. Chad's opposition has traditionally been vocal but politically weak compared to strong military leaders who have repeatedly seized power by force in the central African oil producer. The opposition is nonetheless central to hopes for a more active multi-party democracy. Lol, a member of parliament who led a transition government in the late 1970s, suffers from high blood pressure, which could be made worse by the stress of detention, Taher said. He had also been having trouble with his eyes after a cataract operation in France. "This is a man who can't even smack his grand children when they are naughty; he is not a man of war," Taher said. No charges have been brought publicly against the opposition leaders, who include fellow parliamentarians Ngarlegy Yorongar, Deby's closest challenger in a 2001 election, and Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue. A fourth detainee, Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh, leads a coalition of opposition parties who opposed a 2006 constitutional referendum that allowed Deby to contest a third term in office, and boycotted a subsequent election. Asked about their whereabouts last week, Deby -- who seized power in 1990 in a lightning three-week offensive launched from the east -- told reporters: "I am on the ground to save the country, I do not deal with these details". PARLIAMENT DEMANDS EXPLANATION Chad's national assembly, whose usual venue was badly damaged in last weekend's fighting and a subsequent wave of looting, discussed their colleagues' fate on Friday. "We requested a meeting with the government to get an explanation," said Gamar Sileck, the first deputy speaker of parliament and a member of Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), which dominates the assembly. "We have no idea of their conditions of detention, we have no idea where they are. As far as we know, they have not been seen by the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross)," said Reed Brody, of New York-based Human Rights Watch. "It's very worrying," said Brody, who works closely with victims in Chad trying to bring former President Hissene Habre to trial for killings, torture and other abuses by his political police during his 1982-1990 rule. Brody said many Chadians, including prominent human rights campaigners, had gone into hiding since last week's arrests for fear they themselves would be detained. Yorongar's home is quiet since most of the politician's family fled to the safety of his native south. Emmanuel Saleh, Yorongar's driver, described how eight men in military fatigues and green turbans came in the front gate and dragged the member of parliament out by his collar -- a similar account to one given by staff at Lol's residence. "We're all afraid, because this is the twelfth time he has been arrested, and each time he has been tortured," Yorongar's nephew Mathurin Madjitoloum Mouga N'Dotar said
