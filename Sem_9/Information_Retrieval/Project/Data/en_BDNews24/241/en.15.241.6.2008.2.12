 Islamabad, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Election Commission's inaction in dealing with complaints from opponents of President Pervez Musharraf has raised "serious questions about its impartiality" in next week's vote, an international rights group said on Tuesday. Brad Adams, Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said "the commission appears to be sitting on its hands", although on Tuesday the commission's official web site (www.ecp.gov.pk) said 1,773 pre-poll complaints had been received and gave details of action taken. The parties of assassinated opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif have long complained that authorities were using government resources to rig the Feb. 18 vote in favour of Musharraf's allies. The HRW has not lodged any complaint directly, but asked the commission for a response to opposition parties' grievances, and was told no investigation could be undertaken unless district level judges submitted evidence. Kanwar Dilshad, Secretary Election Commission, the official cited in the HRW report, was not available for comment. The HRW report said the commission has ignored widespread allegations of arrests and harassment of opposition members, and that pro-government candidates were being helped by misuse of state machinery. Local poll observers say the commission has failed to deal with complaints that district nazims, or mayors, were misusing their powers to stop any chance of a level playing field. "A majority of district nazims were supporting their family members and using state machinery for their election campaign," said Sarwar Bari of Fair and Free Election Network, an umbrella organisation of 40 non-governmental organisations. The government denies the charges. It isn't a presidential election, but if voters return a hostile parliament there is risk of impeachment for U.S. ally Musharraf. Al Qaeda inspired militants are running a suicide bomb campaign aimed at destabilising his government, and there is increasing concern in the West and among regional neighbours over the future of nuclear-armed Muslim nation. A low turnout is widely expected because of the violence. The Interior Ministry said on Tuesday that soldiers were being deployed to support police and paramilitary forces where needed. Musharraf has said troops have orders to shoot anyone trying to disrupt the polls. The election is seen as a three-way contest between Musharraf's allies and the parties of Sharif and Bhutto, who was assassinated in gun and bomb attack on Dec. 27. Sharif released a report on Monday giving details of the dirty tricks he says have been going on, but said they might not be enough to rob the opposition of victory. Siddiqul Farooq, Sharif's spokesman, said their party made several complaints to the commission, but to no avail. Bhutto's widower and the de facto leader of Pakistan People's Party, Asif Ali Zardari, told Reuters on Monday the party would have to decide whether to accept the polls results or call for agitation if it feels cheated. The PPP is widely expected to emerge as the largest party in the National assembly, thanks partly to a sympathy vote following the assassination, while Sharif has earned credit for his refusal to make any compromises with the unpopular Musharraf.
