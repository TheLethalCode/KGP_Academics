<TITLE> Australian Aborigines camp out for apology </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Canbera, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tent city has sprung up near Australia's national parliament as Aborigines arrive in the nation's capital to hear the government apologise for past injustices against indigenous children and families. Organisers expect about 2,000 Aborigines from around the nation to camp on the lawns and gardens of parliament to hear Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologise on Wednesday for past policies of taking Aboriginal children from their families. The apology ends an 11-year wait for Aborigines and members of the so-called "Stolen Generation" of indigenous children, and follows the key recommendation of a 1997 report into the old assimilation policies. "Saying sorry, it will make them feel better. That's all they want to hear, sorry from the Australian government, before they die," Aboriginal elder Yami Lester, who has joined the campsite, told Reuters on Monday. The apology will be the first item of parliamentary business for Rudd's centre-left Labor government, which swept to power last November after almost 12 years of conservative rule. Former conservative prime minister John Howard refused to apologise but issued a statement of regret for the old policies, saying current generations should not be responsible for actions of past governments. Howard will not attend the apology. The 1997 Bringing Them Home report did not detail the number of children taken from their families, to be brought up in white households, but said between one-in-three and one-in-10 indigenous children were taken away between 1910 and 1970. Local authorities have put extra health staff and facilities on the lawns in front of the Old Parliament House, a short walk from the new parliament, to cater for Aborigines who are camping out ahead of Wednesday's apology. SAD CRY FOR BABIES About 50 tents and a temporary cafe had sprung up by Monday and hundreds of Aborigines were at the campsite. Large screens will be set up to televise the apology and about 100 members of the Stolen Generation will be in parliament for the event. Aboriginal flags were flying and a carnival atmosphere hung over the campsite as children played in fountains and their parents gathered under awnings to talk over indigenous issues. Lester, 66, and who is blind, spent two days travelling to Canberra for the apology from his remote home in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands, about 1,000 km (620 miles) northwest of the South Australian state capital of Adelaide. He said he had seen children taken from their families under the old policies which left mothers heartbroken, separated Aborigines from their culture and language, and which had a wider impact on Aboriginal communities. "The apology is so important because they were taken away from their mother's breasts, to try to educate them in the white man's world," Lester said. "For mothers ... they get very sad, and they'd be crying every night, a sad cry for their babies." He said the apology would be an important first step towards fixing disadvantage for Australia's Aborigines, and should be followed by government action on jobs, education, health and housing. "It will be a big day. It will make history for the Australian government saying sorry to the Stolen Generation. It should have been done back in 1997," he said. Australia has about 500,000 indigenous Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, who are the country's most disadvantaged group, with higher levels of poverty, unemployment alcohol abuse and a life expectancy 17 years shorter than other Australians.
