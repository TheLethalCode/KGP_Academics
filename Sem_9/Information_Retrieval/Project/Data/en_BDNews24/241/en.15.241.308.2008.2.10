 HOUSTON, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NASA said on Saturday a spacewalk to install a European laboratory on the International Space Station would be postponed for a day and one of the spacewalkers replaced. The $1.9 billion Columbus laboratory, which arrived at the station aboard shuttle Atlantis on Saturday, would be attached to the station on Monday instead of Sunday. German astronaut Hans Schlegel was scheduled to participate in the spacewalk but would be replaced by Stan Love, the US space agency said. It did not explain the substitution but said one of its astronauts had had a health problem.
