<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court Tuesday halted the proceedings of the government's interim appeal against a High Court verdict in an extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Instead of delivering a verdict expected after a morning hearing, the apex court asked the government to file a regular appeal by Feb 19. Barrister Shafique Ahmed, a counsel for the detained Awami League chief, told reporters: "The Supreme Court did not stay the High Court order. It asked the government to file a regular appeal against the HC verdict by Feb 19." A full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin ended the hearing of arguments on the appeal against the HC verdict Tuesday morning. The High Court Wednesday cancelled the extortion case, filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, and ruled that trying the charges under the emergency powers rules was illegal During the hearing that ended around 10:00am Tuesday, attorney general Fida M Kamal said: "The HC verdict in the case has far-reaching implications. The court should, therefore, stay the verdict." The court said: "We haven't read the HC verdict in the case. How can we hand down any ruling on this without reading it through?" Hasina's chief counsel barrister Rafiq-ul Huq said: "The HC delivered the final verdict in the case. The Appellate Division cannot stay the HC verdict without reading it, as it is not an interim order." bdnews24.com/at/f
