 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) - Religious affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff said Thursday the government would provide all facilities for proper care of hajj pilgrims. Inaugurating the first ever Hajj and Omrah Fair in the city, he told owners of Hajj agencies: ""In future all cooperation will be provided by the government for managing hajj properly." Ariff advised them not to give any place to middlemen so that hajj pilgrims are not cheated. "All proper facilities must be ensured so that no pilgrim to Makkah and Madina has to suffer being cheated." Numerous organisations are participating in the three-day fair at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. A private firm launched the first such event in cooperation with the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh (HAAB). The religious affairs adviser called the event a positive initiative, saying: "Such kinds of initiatives for hajj pilgrims will be given all out cooperation." HAAB president Muhammad Faruq expressed hope that the fair would create a bridge between the pilgrims and hajj agencies. He assured those present: "Initiatives will be taken so that middlemen cannot disrupt hajj programmes." The fair will remain open to all from 10am to 8pm, ending June 7. bdnews
