 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Thursday vowed continued support for steps being taken by the United Nations in promoting global peace and stability. "Our participation in peace support operations and other categories of multinational forces has created a highly positive image for Bangladesh," Fakhruddin said in his speech to mark International Day of the United Nations Peacekeepers. A reception to the relatives of dead or wounded peacekeepers was held at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre as the country observed the day along with the rest of the world. The government honoured the families of 76 dead peacekeepers last year. This year, the government has honoured the families of the remaining dead peacekeepers and those who suffered injuries between 1988 and 1995. Bangladesh became a member of the UN in September 1974 and remained a "staunch supporter of multifarious initiatives" undertaken by the UN in promoting global peace and stability. "Bangladesh's commitment to the UN Peace Support Missions is backed by her readiness to make substantial contributions and tackle challenging and complex circumstances," Fakhruddin said. "Bangladesh is also capable of mobilising well-trained and well-equipped forces having vast experience at a very short notice," he said. "Bangladesh has consistently remained one of the largest contributors of troops to United Nations Peace Support Missions." "Recently, our participation in the UN mission in Darfur has become another milestone in our unwavering commitment to global peace," the CA said. Fakhruddin paid homage to the dead peacekeepers for their valiant roles in serving the cause of peace. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury praised Bangladesh peacekeepers for their contributions to the UN missions. "Bangladesh peacekeepers are currently representing the country across the world," he said. The peacekeepers are playing effective roles in recovery, reconstruction and capacity-building projects in the conflict-ravaged areas, he said. The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, said Bangladesh had worked as a sentinel of peacekeeping since it joined the UN peacekeeping operations. Over the years, Bangladeshi peacekeepers have been recognised for their professional performance and good conduct, Moeen said. The 20 years of achievement is the result of relentless hard work and patience, Moeen said. Some 73,000 Bangladeshis have been engaging in peacekeeping missions in 31 countries. Bangladesh peacekeepers worked in different countries, including Sudan, Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Republic of Congo, Cambodia, Namibia, Mozambique, and East Timor. bdnew
