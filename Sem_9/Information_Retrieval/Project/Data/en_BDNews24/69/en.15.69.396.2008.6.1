 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  Joint forces continued a hunt for local leaders of different political parties for a second day with at least 108 people arrested in seven districts until Sunday afternoon. The crackdown rounded up 16 in Bogra, 14 in Faridpur, one in Rangpur, 44 in Kishoreganj, three in Brahmanbaria, eight in Chandpur, and 22 in Magura. The government however described the countrywide crackdown that began Friday night as a "drive to prevent spiralling crimes". Local leaders of Awami League, BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Jatiya Party, and some union parishad chairmen with political links were among the people arrested since Saturday night. Dhaka Metropolitan Police and intelligent agents also arrested 140 people in the city in an anticrime crackdown. bdnews24.com's Brahmanbaria correspondent said joint forces had arrested the Pattan Union Parishad chairman, a UP member and a passport office agent Saturday night. Sadar police chief Kamaluddin said the arrestees had been sued under emergency rule. In Chandpur, joint forces detained eight people in an overnight drive. They were arrested on various charges, including land grab, extortion and carjacking. Joint forces arrested 22 people including two Jubo Dal leaders in Magura Saturday, Magura Sadar police chief Sagir Hossain told bdnews24.com. The home ministry said law enforcers arrested 548 in 24 hours. In a statement, the home ministry said Sunday the drive had been launched on reports that criminal acts peaked in the country. According to the statement: "Attacks on law-enforcement agencies, seizure of firearms from police personnel, violence in the garment industry, killings and extremist and other criminal activities spread in the country." "Police launched a countrywide special drive on May 28 with directions to arrest criminals, seize illegal firearms in an effort to improve law and order and defuse panic among people," the statement said. Noor Mohammad, inspector general of police, told bdnews24.com Saturday that the drive was part of efforts to prevent crime. The country's police chief ruled out the allegation that the people were arrested on political grounds. "The drive is targeted at listed criminals and extortionists," he said. bdnews24
