<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina has endorsed a decision by her party of boycotting talks with the government, her lawyers said Saturday. "Sheikh Hasina has said the party decision on dialogue is final," barrister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after meeting the former prime minister at the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Shafiq said Hasina wanted the polls earlier than the government's year-end plan and quoted her as demanding the return of democracy through immediate elections. Shafiq's colleague Yousuf Hossain accompanied him to the special jail during the two-hour visit that lasted until 1.00pm. The lawyers had discussed ways of dealing with a series of cases against Hasina. "We have discussed the Niko case. Implicating her in the case is illogical. The files came to her after going through different stages of vetting. She had just approved the draft, but did not sign an agreement," Shafiq said. The lawyer alleged that the case had been designed to taint Hasina's political image. "Sheikh Hasina has enough evidence to prove her innocence in the Niko case." On the MiG-29 scam case, Shafiq said the process of MiG-29 purchase began in 1994. Hasina had rejected the manufacturer's proposed price of $2.89 million and the price was later reset at $1.5 million through negotiation. "There was no corruption. There is no evidence of corruption either," Shafiq said. bdnews24
