<TITLE> Lee swings Australia towards victory with old ball </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NORTH SOUND, Antigua, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most quick bowlers love a shiny, hard new ball in their hands but Brett Lee showed on Monday with a superb spell of five wickets in 18 balls that a battered old one can also be a deadly weapon. The Australian ripped through the West Indies batting order with a virtually unplayable spell featuring conventional and reverse swing, giving the touring side a good chance of winning the second test. "I do think it is definitely the best spell I have bowled with the old ball. It's probably the most I have ever moved a ball. And it's gone late too," Lee told reporters. "There are days when it just clicks. And those moments, those six overs are the reason why I play test cricket. "They always talk about getting into a groove and getting into the right mindset and getting in to a part in your spell when it all happens for you. "It happened easily, I felt like I was running in I wasn't trying to bowl the ball too fast, the ball came out perfect," he said. The key breakthrough came when Lee removed Dwayne Bravo, who together with Shivnarine Chanderpaul had put on 132 for West Indies. Television replays showed that Bravo had not actually hit the ball, which struck his hip, but his departure opened up the lower-middle order and Lee took full advantage with three lbws and a clean bowled as the hosts tumbled to 352 all out. FLAT WICKET Lee usually swings the new ball away from right-handers and has an effective bouncer but on a flat wicket that has offered nothing to seamers the old ball was far more dangerous, shiny on one side and rough on the other. "The conditions were perfect, when I looked at the ball it was spot on, scuffed-up on one side -- the boys looked after the ball on one side just perfectly," Lee said. "There were a couple of times it got over the fence and got onto the gravel and that kind of thing which definitely helps and you are playing on a surface too which is very abrasive, the conditions were definitely in our favour for the ball to swing the other way. "To pick up five wickets is always a bonus but for me it is always about trying to get that breakthrough and hopefully try and get your test match team into a position where we can win the test match and hopefully we have done a pretty good job there," Lee added
