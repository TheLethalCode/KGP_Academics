 Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brad Pitt's manager has denied a recent television report that Oscar winner Angelina Jolie, who has publicly acknowledged she was expecting twins with the actor, had given birth to them in France this week. "It's not true. It's a rumor," Pitt's Los Angeles-based talent manager, Cynthia Pett-Dante, told Reuters in a statement issued by her office. She declined further comment. However, "Entertainment Tonight" said it stood by its report on Friday that Jolie had given birth to twin daughters in France, attributing the story to an unidentified person close to the actress. "The source says she was inside the delivery room, tells 'ET' yes, the babies were born, and yes, mother and daughters are fine," the syndicated program said in its broadcast. The story was disputed almost from the start by various other celebrity news outlets, with People magazine quoting an unnamed representative for Jolie on its Web site as saying: "Angelina has not given birth. She is fine, enjoying her home and her family in France." Meanwhile, another celebrity publication, Britain's NOW magazine, reported the latest additions to the Jolie-Pitt clan had already been named Isla Marcheline and Amelie Jane. There was no immediate comment from Jolie's Los Angeles-based manager. The only maternity clinic in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence, the region where Jolie and Pitt were believed to be staying, said it had no information. Town hall officials there said they were aware of the media reports but did not know if they were true. Just two weeks ago Jolie, 32, publicly acknowledged she was pregnant with twins during an interview at the Cannes film festival, where she was promoting the animated film "Kung Fu Panda" and the latest Clint Eastwood drama, "The Exchange." In an interview with Vanity Fair magazine due to hit newsstands next week and excerpted on its Web site on Friday, Jolie said Pitt found her to be very appealing when pregnant. "I'm fortunate," she told the magazine. "I think some women have a different experience depending on their partner. ... I happen to be with somebody who finds pregnancy very sexy. So that makes me feel very sexy." In Touch magazine reported this week that Jolie had been ordered to bed for the remainder of her pregnancy and was due to give birth via a Caesarean section around mid-July. Jolie and Pitt, 44, whose romance became public after they co-starred in the 2005 film "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," already have one biological daughter together, Shiloh, who was delivered by Caesarean section a year ago in the southern African nation of Namibia. The Hollywood couple also are the parents of three adopted children -- daughter Zahara, 3, from Ethiopia, son Pax, 4, from Vietnam and son Maddox, 6, from Cambodia. Jolie, who turns 33 next week, won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her role in the 1999 film "Girl, Interrupted."
