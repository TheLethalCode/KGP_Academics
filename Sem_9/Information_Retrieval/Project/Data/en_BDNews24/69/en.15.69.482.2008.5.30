 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)The power, energy and mineral resources ministry has almost completed a review of the draft coal policy, a special aide said Friday. The draft policy is soon be to placed before a cabinet meeting for approval, said Prof M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources. Speaking as the chief guest at a seminar on "Energy Security and Development: Perspective Bangladesh" organised by Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs and Bangladesh Heritage Foundation, Prof Tamim said the review of the draft policy submitted by a working committee to the ministry was almost complete. "No big change has been made in it. Structural adjustment has been made, it will be sent to the law ministry within 10 days for vetting. It will then be presented before the advisory council for approval." "To meet the energy demand we will have to improve coal resources. I ask all to leave it to the experts, have trust in them. Everything will be done on the basis of accountability and transparency. Mistrust has crept among us in the last three decades," Tamim said. "In the power sector, a policy for setting up power plants at government and private initiative is also being prepared. The government will have 51 per cent ownership while the private entrepreneurs will have 49 per cent," he added. BUET professor Ijaj Hossain, who presented the keynote paper at the seminar, said: "If we extract a fourth of our total coal reserves and use our gas reserves, 20,000 megawatts of power can be added to the national grid by 2030." "We should bring investment for setting up coal based power plants. We can also import power directly. A 750 megawatt power plant is being set up in Tripura, from which power could be directly imported." Prof Ijaj said coal at the controversial Phulbari mine should be extracted through the open pit mining method. "India is extracting coal through open pit mining in 80 mines." The speakers in the seminar stressed the establishment of a REGIONAL power grid with neighbouring countries to face the power crisis. The president's military secretary Major General M Aminul Karim, Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed and instructor of the Military Institute of Science and Technology Colonel Moinuddin also spoke. Director of the Rural Electrification Board BD Rahmatullah presented another paper at the seminar. Bangladesh Heritage Foundation chairman Waliur Rahman gave the address of welcome. bdnews2
