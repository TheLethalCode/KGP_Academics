 MILAN, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zlatan Ibrahimovic wants to stay at Inter Milan and believes Jose Mourinho is a great coach, the Sweden striker said on Thursday. Italian champions Inter have made no comment over media reports Roberto Mancini has been sacked following a meeting with club president Massimo Moratti on Tuesday. However, the players are preparing for former Chelsea coach Mourinho to take over. "It is Moratti's decision. He is the boss and he decides and what he does is right. Mourinho is a great coach. Who doesn't know that?," Ibrahimovic told Gazzetta dello Sport. The striker, who scored twice in this month's last-day win over Parma which sealed Inter's third straight scudetto, has been troubled by a knee problem for several months but is expected to be fit for Euro 2008. He played down speculation linking him with a move to Spain. "I am settled at Inter, the family is happy, I have won two scudettos and now we will try to do it in the Champions League as well. I stay willingly," he said. Media reports say Inter have yet to confirm the change of coach because they are working on a compensation package with Mancini, who had a troubled season despite winning the title. An announcement is expected shortly
