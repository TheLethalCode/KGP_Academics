 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League presidium Thursday demanded immediate withdrawal of a graft case against Tofail Ahmed and rejected the charges as false. AL leaders at an emergency meeting at acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home also demanded that a case against Sherpur district AL chief and former MP Atiqur Rahman Atiq be withdrawn. "We are saddened by the case against veteran politician Tofail Amed," acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the meeting. Ashraful said the case had been filed in the wake of a decision of skipping government dialogue, with party chief Sheikh Hasina in prison. "A conspiracy is on to make Bangladesh a politician-free country." "The graft case against Tofail Ahmed was filed as part of the conspiracy to undermine and alienate him from society. It has no legal basis and is absolutely politically-motivated," Ashraful alleged. The AL leader said: "Things that had not taken place under the regime of Pakistani military junta are now happening. Politicians and their family members including wife, son and daughter are being sued. The cases are being filed to destroy the families of politicians." "We have abided by the law for 16 months. We have limited our political activities during the state of emergency. We hope the government will not create a situation that will compel us to break the law," he said. The AL leader alleged that the case against Atiqur Rahman had been filed to destroy his political career. Presidium members Syed Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury and Suranjit Sengupta were present. bdnews
