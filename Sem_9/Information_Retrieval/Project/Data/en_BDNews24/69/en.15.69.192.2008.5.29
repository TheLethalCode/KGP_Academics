<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Thu May 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Eleanor Coppola is an accomplished documentary filmmaker, artist, writer and the wife of an icon of American cinema, Francis Ford Coppola. They met on the film "Dementia 13" in 1962 when she was the assistant art director and he was directing his first feature film. Coppola has accompanied her husband on movie shoots around the world, giving her an insider's view of the ups and downs of filmmaking. In the Philippines for "Apocalypse Now," she shot documentary footage for the Emmy Award-winning "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse" and kept a journal, released in 1979 as "Notes on the Making of 'Apocalypse Now.'" Her new book "Notes on a Life," is an intimate portrait of her family that includes writer/director daughter Sofia Coppola ("Lost in Translation"). The 72-year-old Coppola talked to Reuters about the book, being married to a famous director and the competing demands of career and family. Q: What was the impetus for doing this book? A: "My mother wrote her thoughts on index cards for years. She filled shoeboxes with thousands of cards. I encouraged her to edit them. She always said she wasn't ready. Then the time came when she was no longer able -- she's 99. I realized my nearly 30 years of notebooks were piling up." Q: Was it easy or hard going through old journals and deciding what to include, what to exclude? A: "I started by selecting the most complete pieces I'd written. I laughed, wept and was bored. Memories triggered searching for particular entries and then I'd find old pieces I'd forgotten, such as the trip in Japan to visit Akira Kurosawa. It was revelatory to see repeated patterns weaving through my life.
