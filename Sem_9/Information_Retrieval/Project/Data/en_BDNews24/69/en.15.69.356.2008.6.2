 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)The prison authorities await consent from detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia to take her to hospital for medical check-ups, prisons officials said Monday. Brigadier General Zakir Hasan, inspector general of prisons, told bdnews24.com: "Khaleda Zia needs to be taken to hospital for a blood test and an X-ray. We will take necessary steps after she gives her consent." Khaleda has been suffering from arthritis. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of prisons, had earlier said Khaleda would be taken to hospital soon, but did not name the hospital. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco on Sept 3 last year at their cantonment home. Khaleda made her first court appearance Sunday after she had been sent to jail after arrest. bdnew
