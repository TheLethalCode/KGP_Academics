<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 04 (bdnews24.com)The government will explore all avenues to build a national consensus to constitute a commission to review the constitution, said commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Wednesday. Cabinet members held a meeting with Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal (Khalequzzaman) at the Chief Adviser's Office as part of the ongoing political dialogue. "Taking part in today's dialogue, Samajtantrik Dal mentioned a number of inconsistencies in our constitution and talked about the need for constituting a review commission to address the anomalies. I fully agree with the party leaders," said the adviser, who attended the meeting. "A consensus among related parties will be built to form a commission or a committee. Once the body makes recommendations, the next elected government may implement them," he said. Talks with BSD continued for two hours from 10:00am. Led by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, the government delegation included law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. BSD representatives led by its convenor Khalequzzaman Bhuiyan included Mobinul Haider Chowdhury, Abdullah Sarkar, Shuvrangshu Chakavarti, Bazlur Rashid Firoz, Rajekuzzaman Ratan and Saifur Rahman Tapan. Khalequzzaman said: "We have asked the government to lift the state of emergency." Clarifying the government stance on the issue, Hossain Zillur said: "The matter is under active consideration." On the inconsistencies between the constitution and the reality, Khalequzzaman said, "The unemployed do not get any allowances in the country. The constitution speaks of a uniform educational system, whereas we are practising at least three separate systems." A number of sections of the constitution also need to be amended or annulled as soon as possible, Khalequzzaman said. Asked to comment on the government's promised efforts to bring the Awami League and the BNP to dialogue, the adviser said: "The process will continue until it produces positive results within a reasonable span of time." "The talks scheduled to be over by the end of June may be extended through July, if necessary," he said. The government sat to discuss the burning issues with businessmen Tuesday and made a plan to hold talks with local government representatives, workers, women, different professional groups and the media, the adviser said. "Regional talks will be held outside Dhaka," Hossain Zillur said. Khalequzzaman said, "We demanded that the government ensure that all citizens get bail legally under any circumstances. The black money holders, loan defaulters and exploiters of religious sentiments should also be barred from national polls." To help dispel doubts about the elections, the BSD asked the government to announce a specific election date. "BSD has asked the government not to ban general strikes and hartals by enacting laws," said Hosssain Zillur. He, however, stressed the need for a nationwide consensus by which vandalism, arson and such other destructive activities are not resorted to during the political or other strikes or protests. The government will sit with the Islami Oikya Jote on the morning of June 10. bdnews24.com/e
