 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand won the toss and decided to bowl first in bright conditions in the third and final test of the series against England at Trent Bridge on Thursday. New Zealand drafted in wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins for his test debut after Brendon McCullum's back injury was deemed too severe for him to keep wicket but strong enough to bat. Hopkins, 31, was the only change to the New Zealand team from the second test with James Marshall making way. The Black Caps elected to retain swing bowler Iain O'Brien even though teenager Tim Southee had been expected to come in. England were unchanged for the fifth consecutive test for the first time in 123 years. Bowlers Ryan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad are playing at their home ground in Nottingham. England, who have lost their last two tests at Trent Bridge, lead the series 1-0 after a draw at Lord's and a six-wicket victory at Old Trafford. Teams: England: Michael Vaughan (capt), Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Tim Ambrose, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, Monty Panesar, James Anderson. New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (capt), Jamie How, Aaron Redmond, Brendon McCullum, Ross Taylor, Daniel Flynn, Jacob Oram, Gareth Hopkins, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Chris Marti
