 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)- A group of government primary school teachers Tuesday demanded that the government scrap a decision to train teachers in 30 upazilas under a BRAC programme. They warned that the teachers would go for broader protests if the decision was not cancelled by June 10. Leaders of Bangladesh Primary Teachers Association said they would not join the training course under BRAC. If necessary, they threatened, they would prevent BRAC trainers from entering the schools. "If there had not been a state of emergency thousands of teachers would have taken to the streets in Dhaka to demand cancellation of the decision," Abdus Salam, the secretary general of the association, told a press conference in the city. If the decision is not cancelled by June 10, the association will raise black flags in primary schools across the country, he said. The teachers will take up a fierce programme if the government fails to meet their demand by June 30, Salam said. "We will launch tougher protest plans such as a march on the Chief Adviser's Office," he said. Salam announced a plan to pursue a one-hour work stoppage from 10am on June 5 to press their demand. Salam alleged: "BRAC is only eyeing crores of taka from a government project in the name of working for developing primary education." "It's just another business by BRAC." The association's president Md Abdul Awal Talukder condemned a government statement that the teachers do not understand the issue fully. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education in March in separate orders said that BRAC would train teachers, supervise and monitor the primary schools in 30 upazilas. bdnews24.
