 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday came down hard on the government for a sudden overnight crackdown that rounded up about 50 people, mostly politicians from districts and upazilas. While wishing the government-initiated dialogue a success, Delwar said a meaningful, free and neutral election would have to be held with the participation of former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. "A level-playing field for all must be ensured and power handed over to the people through a quick election," he said. The BNP secretary general, who heads a faction of the divided BNP, said the country turned into a massive jail. Delwar attended a discussion as chief guest on the 27th death anniversary of BNP founder Ziaur Rahman, organised at IDEB auditorium Saturday by Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal. The BNP secretary general said that everybody now knew what conspiracy was hatched on Jan 11 last year. "The aim of this is to disqualify top leaders from election and hold a stage-managed election." Delwar said, "The country is now going through famine. In such a situation the ruling class is trying to cling to power on the back gear. The hands of the Supreme Court have been clipped." In the latest arrest drive, claimed the BNP secretary general, joint forces had arrested more than 100 leaders and workers of the BNP. "We hear more lists are being prepared." Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal president Nazrul Islam Khan presided over the discussion meeting. BNP standing committee member Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui, attending the discussion, said: "If Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina had committed any crime, the people would try them." bdnews
