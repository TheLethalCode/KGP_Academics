 MUMBAI, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian selectors named uncapped Yusuf Pathan and Pragyan Ojha on Friday in a 15-player squad for next month's one-day tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in Pakistan.The 25-year-old Pathan, who joins younger brother and all-rounder Irfan in the squad, is a hard-hitting batsman and off spinner while Ojha, 21, is a left-arm spinner. Master batsman Sachin Tendulkar will miss the trips due to a persistent groin injury while leading off spinner Harbhajan Singh has been banned for five one-dayers after being found guilty of slapping compatriot Shanthakumaran Sreesanth in a domestic Twenty20 game. The selectors ignored former captains and experienced batsmen Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly, who also missed the victorious tri-series campaign in Australia in January. The Bangladesh tri-series, also involving Pakistan, will be played from June 8-14, with the six-team Asia Cup scheduled from June 24-July 6. India squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Praveen Kumar, Piyush Chawla, Yusuf Pathan, Pragyan Ojha, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, RP Singh
