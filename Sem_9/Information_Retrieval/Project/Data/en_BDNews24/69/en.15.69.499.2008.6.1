 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)The government will use all "avenues" to bring political parties to dialogue, communications adviser Ghulam Quader said Sunday. The adviser however did not explain the efforts to be made, when he spoke to reporters at the secretariat. "The political parties wanted dialogue. They said there should not be any condition attached to it. We did not impose any either. Now it is their responsibility to come to dialogue," he said. "We are not opponent of the political parties. We will not participate in the election. The political parties will contest the polls. If the political parties could be brought to a consensus a beautiful future could be built," Quader said. Replying to a question, the adviser said: "We have not yet received Awami League's letter expressing willingness to participate in the dialogue. I hope we will get it." Asked whether former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia would be brought to the dialogue, the adviser said, "I cannot say anything about it." bdnews
