 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP and its front organisations will observe the 27th death anniversary of Ziaur Rahman Friday, with the 1981 killing of the president in a military putsch at Chittagong Circuit House in memory. In a message on the eve of the anniversary, president Iajuddin Ahmed, who had been installed by the past Khaleda administration, expressed his "deep respects" to the memory of Zia. "The people will remember with respect Shahid president Ziaur Rahman's contribution in the glorious Liberation War. Shahid Zia's firm leadership in protecting democracy, independence and sovereignty is known to all," he said. "His deep patriotism, sense of duty, honesty and moral firmness was unparalleled. He freed press freedom from shackles and restored people's right to expression. He was the planner of modern Bangladesh," Iajuddin said. BNP observes the day as "martyr's day". The party flag at half-staff in party offices, wreaths at Zia's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar and prayers will mark the day. BNP and its front organisations have taken up day-long programmes of prayers and destitute-feeding. An evening discussion will be held at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB) auditorium. The party's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The programme is being observed on a limited scale because of the state of emergency." In a statement, secretary general of a BNP faction Khandaker Delwar Hossain urged party leaders and workers to maintain discipline while paying respects to the party founder. He urged the people to say prayers in mosques, temples and pagodas seeking salvation of the soul of Zia.
