 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday rejected an anticipatory bail prayer submitted by Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case. The HC bench of Justice Khandaker Musa Khaled and Justice Moinul Islam Chowdhury turned down the bail prayer. The court said in its verdict that the plea submitted that the case has been filed under a wrong motivation cannot be legally raised at this stage, as the case is still being investigated and no bail petition can be entertained now. Mojaheed was in court during the hearing. Mojaheed filed an anticipatory bail prayer with the HC on May 25. After the verdict, Mojaheed's lawyer barrister Abdur Razzak told reporters they would appeal to the Appellate Division against the verdict. Mojaheed told reporters that the case was filed with 'an ill motivation and for political harassment'. "I'll fight legally and politically facing the case," he said. The Anticorruption Commission on Feb 26 filed the case on charges of irregularities and corruption in appointment of the contractor for Barapukuria coalmine. The case also involves former prime minister Khaleda Zia, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former LGRD minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and former industry minister Motiur Rahman Nizami. bdnews24
