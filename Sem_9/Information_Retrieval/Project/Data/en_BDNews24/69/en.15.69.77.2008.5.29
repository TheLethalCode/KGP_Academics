<TITLE> Wrong time for Eriksson to coach Mexico, says Borgetti </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MEXICO CITY, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico's leading scorer Jared Borgetti criticised the possible appointment of Sven-Goran Eriksson as coach on Wednesday, saying it was not the right time for a European to take over. Borgetti, scorer of a record 43 goals in 86 matches, said Mexico should choose someone who understand the intricacies of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying tournament. Former England coach Eriksson, reportedly facing an uncertain future with his Premier League club Manchester City, is favourite to replace Hugo Sanchez who was sacked in March. The Mexican federation said on Tuesday that the Swede could take over next week. "It has to be someone who knows Mexican football, who knows the Mexican players, the lives of the Mexican players and who knows the CONCACAF world cup qualifiers, which are very different from Europe," Borgetti told reporters at the Mexican team's training camp. "I'm not talking about the standard, but in the way you take on the other teams. It's not just about football, you have to face other things. "When you go to play in Central America and the Caribbean, the conditions are very different to Europe." Borgetti suggested the presidents of Mexico's first division clubs, who form the committee which chooses the national coach, were trying to attract headlines. "The club owners want a renowned coach, who attracts worldwide attention, but that way we are not going to win anything because we are putting footballing matters to one side." The team is currently under the leadership of Jesus Ramirez, who will take charge for the two-leg World Cup preliminary qualifier against Belize next month. Ramirez led the Mexican team which won the world Under-17 championship in 2005
