 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is observing the former president and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman's 27 death anniversary Friday, without having announced any political programme on the occasion. Leaders and supporters of both BNP factions are paying tribute separately at Zia's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Those of the pro- reform faction, led by acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, are scheduled to lay wraeths at the grave at 3.30 pm. Earlier, president Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed paid their respects at the former president's grave at around 8am, with army chief general Moeen U Ahmed, navy chief vice admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam and air force chief Shah Md Ziaur Rahman being present among others. A smartly turned out army bugle band paid homage to Zia by playing military tunes. President Iajuddin Ahmed in his message for the day described Ziaur Rahman as 'the vanguard of Bangladesh's independence.' Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui also paid their respects at the late president's grave. Speaker Sircar told reporters: "Ziaur Rahman was an exponent of multi-party democracy. He successfully initiated a lot of innovative development, which helped revitalise the national economy." "BNP will participate in the election as a unified entity. People will vote BNP to power once again." Following the senior government figures, BNP's pro-Khaleda secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain led his faction's leaders and supporters in laying wreaths at the grave and praying for the salvation of the departed soul. Avoiding the rush, Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah paid respects separately to the late president's grave. Hannan Shah told reporters: "The BNP leaders and workers must stop pining for their lost leader and convert their mourning into strength for re-establishing democracy in the country." A voluntary blood donation programme was conducted and a milad mahfil was organised at Zia's mausoleum. Local BNP leaders across the country were reported to be organising food distribution for the poor and prayers marking the death anniversary. Ziaur Rahman was assassinated on May 30, 1981, at Chittagong Circuit House during 'a failed military coup'. Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujib and his family on August 15, 1975, Zia took over command of the Bangladesh Army. He took control of the nation as the chief martial law administrator in 1977 and took oath as the president of the republic on April 21, 1978. Zia was also famous for officially announcing the start of the 1971 Liberation War on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and subsequently organising and commanding the 'Z Force' throughout the war. However, Zia's later role in 'rehabilitating anti-liberation elements and war criminals' has raised a lot of questions in Bangladesh. bdnews24.
