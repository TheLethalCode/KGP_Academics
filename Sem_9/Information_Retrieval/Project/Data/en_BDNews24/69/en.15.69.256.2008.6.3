<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will begin their 5th SAFF Championship campaign Wednesday taking on Bhutan in their inaugural Group B match at Sugathadasa Stadium, Colombo, Sri Lanka. Bangladesh, the four time finalists, are looking forward to making a good start in their first match before facing emerging power Afghanistan and hosts Sri Lanka. Bangladesh's captain-cum-goalkeeper Aminul Haq, however, doesn't want to take any opponents lightly whether it is Bhutan, who have no records of winning against Bangladesh. "We respect all the opponents, but we certainly want to make a good start in our opener" Aminul was quoted as saying by a Bangladesh Football Federation statement Tuesday. Bangladesh faced Bhutan twice in the 3rd and 4th SAFF Championship and won by an identical 3-0 margin in both occasions. Aminul thought that his side was in a good shape after having played a goalless draw against Bec Tera Sassana in a warm-up match in Thailand. "All of us are in fine mood to play better football, especially after having played a good warm-up match against Bec Tera," Aminul said, "It will inspire the team performing better this time." The reliable goalkeeper said that they simply want to win against Bhutan. Aminul repeated that they first wanted to go step by step and qualify for the semifinals. The captain, however, was a bit worried over a few players, who caught cold.
