<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia appeared in court Sunday for the first time since she was sent to jail last year. The former PM was taken from the special jail to the nearby Special Judge's Court-9 set up in the Sangsad Bhaban area shortly after 11 am for charge framing proceedings in the Niko graft case. The road leading to Rokeya Sarani from Monipuripara was closed to public traffic since early morning as an extra security measure, resulting in severe gridlock in the area and disrupting commuters including HSC examinees. Two separate cases involving Canadian oil and gas company Niko Resources Ltd have been filed against former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, and were taken up by the court on May 26. Hasina was produced in special court on that day to face charges, but Khaleda was absent on the plea that she was indisposed. The BNP chairperson also faces charges in another corruption case that involves a controversial deal with GATCO. Sunday saw her Khaleda's first appearance in court since her arrest and detention. bdnews
