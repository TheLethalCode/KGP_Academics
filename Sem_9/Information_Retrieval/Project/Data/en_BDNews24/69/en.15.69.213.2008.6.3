But the businessmen said they were worried about the current stalemate after major political parties decided to boycott the talks, putting a question mark on dialogue. "We are not happy with the situation at all, as some will join the dialogue and some won't," FBCCI president Annisul Huq, who led 300 business representatives to the dialogue at the Chief Adviser's Office, told a news briefing. Leading negotiator and commerce adviser Hossain zillur Rahman said there should not be any confusion about December elections.
