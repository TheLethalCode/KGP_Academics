 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Thursday recorded testimonies against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the barge-mounted power plant scam case, amid a complaint by defence lawyers that termites had eaten up parts of a related document. Judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court set up on the Jatiya Sangsad complex fixed June 3 to record more testimonies in the case. The judge took a look at the damaged document after Hasina's lawyers drew attention of the court. The insects damaged parts of different pages of the 10-year-old document on the bidding by Wartsila Power Development Ltd Consortium, a company at the heart of the case. State lawyer ABM Sharifuddin Ahmed Mukul told the court that the case would not be affected despite damage to the document. Hasina's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman told reporters that it would have been possible to prove the allegation against Hasina false if the document had not been damaged. Rezaur alleged that it was wilful damage. "The document will be distorted if copied," he feared. Police officer Anwarul Islam who recorded the case details and Abdul Halim, additional director of the Power Development Board, testified in the case Thursday. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking Tk 3 crore in bribes in return for approving the installation of three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna during her term as prime minister. According to case details, the accused influenced the signing of the deal with Wartsila although New England Company offered the lowest cost in a reverse bidding to install the power plants. Hasina and former energy secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury were produced before the court Thursday. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 last year and she was shown arrested in the case on Sept 19. bdnews24.com/p
