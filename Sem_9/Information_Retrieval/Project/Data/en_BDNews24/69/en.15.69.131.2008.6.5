<TITLE> Strikes over fuel prices hit three Left-ruled states </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, India, Thu Jun 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Strikes shut down transport, businesses and schools in three communist-run states on Thursday after a rise in fuel prices, but there was as much anger at the shutdowns as over the price hikes. Communist allies of the ruling coalition kicked off a week of protests against Wednesday's price hikes by calling one-day strikes in the three states they rule, West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, leaving streets, offices and airports largely deserted. They say the government should have done more to insulate consumers from high global oil prices, even though it only passed on a fraction of surging crude costs when it raised heavily subsidised prices of petrol and diesel by about 10 percent. But anger at having to pay more for fuels competed on the streets with frustration at the communists for calling a strike that would deprive people of income and disrupt travel plans. "I don't support the strike. The politicians call them at the drop of a hat," said Manisha Mukherjee, who had gone to Kolkata's airport to see off a relative only to find the flight had been cancelled. "This is not in the common people's interest." Rickshaw puller Anwar Ali saw things differently. "The government does not care for poor people like us," he said. "Today they have raised fuel prices, tomorrow the prices of other essentials will go up and we will continue to suffer." Protesters, some waving red flags, stopped trains and buses in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, and even forced people out of cabs to enforce the dawn-to-dusk strike, witnesses and police said. Rain also helped keep people off the streets. Flights in and out of the state were cancelled, leaving hundreds stranded at the airport. There will be more pain on Friday, when the main opposition party in the state, Trinamool Congress, throws its weight behind a 12-hour strike. "We are almost pushed to the wall," said taxi driver Tarak Halder, who has to pay a moneylender every day to service a loan he took out for his vehicle. "The government should find ways to subsidise fuel prices. They can reduce many other expenditures." "But the strike, that too for two successive days, will only ensure that we suffer more, and even starve," he added. "Strikes are no solution, they only make our lives more difficult." India's main Hindu nationalist opposition also took out protest marches in several central and northern states it rules, a top party official, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, said. While consumers got used to costlier fuel, officials at state-run refiners said Wednesday's price rise was higher than they expected but still inadequate, given crude oil's record run. Shares of state refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd fell 6-7 percent on Thursday, continuing their fall after a brief spurt on Wednesday when prices were raised. THE BLAME GAME Stoppages also hit the tiny northeastern state of Tripura and the southern state of Kerala, where the container port of Kochi, an important commodities transit point, was shut. But software companies in Kerala's main cities were largely unaffected, transporting people to work as normal in company buses, but with police escorts. With state oil companies on the verge of bankruptcy, India's coalition government had little choice but to raise fuel prices, analysts say. But the decision is bound to push inflation, already at a 3- year high of around 8 percent, still higher, and cause more political headaches for a Congress party-led government facing re-election within a year. Rising prices of foods and other essential commodities have been driving inflation up and alienating voters, and a Reuters poll on Wednesday showed economists expect the fuel price increases to push it up to a 13-year high in early June. A few state governments agreed to a request from the centre to cut their own taxes on fuel to mitigate the impact on consumers, although this is only likely to add to overall government borrowing, economists said
