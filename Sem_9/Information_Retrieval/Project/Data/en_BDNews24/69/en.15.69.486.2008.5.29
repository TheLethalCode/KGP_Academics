 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  A woman arrested on charges of masterminding the killing of her son in Shyamoli confessed to her role in the murder before a metropolitan magistrate Thursday. Police arrested Mamtaz Begum on May 25 at her Shyamoli home with ties to the killing. Reaz Ahmed Chowdhury Sumon, a student of the pharmacy department of Asia Pacific University in Dhaka, was killed on May 14 in his room. Md Khalilur Rahman, another accused in the case, gave a confessional statement to metropolitan magistrate Md Al Mamun after Detective Branch inspector AKM Nasir took them to the court at the end of their three-day remand. The court sent the two and Farzana Hossain, sister of Sumon, to jail. Prashun Kanti Pal nicknamed Roni and Zakir Hossain, also accused in the case, gave confessional statements to the court on May 25. Abdul Haque, general recording officer of police at the CMM's court, told bdnews24.com that the intelligence wing of police had found Mamtaz to be behind the killing. Police had earlier said Mamtaz hired the three youths to kill Sumon who she alleged was an addict and involved in drug peddling. After the killing, Mamtaz herself filed a murder case with Mohammadpur Police Station. The case was later transferred to the Detective Branch for an investigation. Mamtaz had earlier admitted to police that she planned to kill her son three months ago because of his misconduct with family members. bdnew
