 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) - Aftab Ahmed leaves here for India Thursday to undergo a surgery on his injured finger. The middle-order batsman sustained an injury on his right hand's ring finger during the net practice at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on May 31 and he was dropped from the tri-nation ODI series at home and Asia Cup in Pakistan. Aftab's surgery will take place at Bombay Hospital with veteran orthopedic surgeon Parag Munshi conducting the operation. "Munshi is a renowned surgeon and associated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India and we expect a good result of the surgery," said national cricket team manager Shafiqul Haque Heera. Heera said that they had already sent all necessary medical reports to Munshi. Middle-order batsman Alok Kapali has come in for Aftab in the Bangladesh national cricket team for both the meets.
