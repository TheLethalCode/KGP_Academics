 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed, sued by the Anticorruption Commission Thursday on charges of graft, said he was not surprised and was ready to fight the case. Updated According to case details, Tofail was accused of amassing about Tk 2.45 crore in illegal wealth and hiding information about Tk 1.86 crore in assets. The case also involves Tofail's wife Anwara Ahmed and their daughter Dr Taslima Ahmed Zaman, police said. Golam Shahrier Chowdhury, deputy director of ACC, filed the case. Anwara and Taslima stand accused of assisting Tofail in "illegal acts", Ramna police sub-inspector Ahsan Habib Khan said. Speaking at an afternoon press briefing at his Banani home, the AL leader said he would fight a legal battle. Tofail said: "A process of harassing politicians is going on. The process must stop. The caretaker government should refrain from such activities." On inclusion of his wife and daughter in the case, he said: "The politicians may commit crimes. What is the offence of their wives and children? It is inhuman." "The case came when we held a successful extended meeting of the Awami League, when grassroots leaders said there would be no dialogue or election without Sheikh Hasina and it was passed in the central working committee." "I had been to jail during all regimes except the Awami League rule. I am not afraid of going to jail. I have seen the dark cells," he said. bdnews24.
