 MOSCOW Thu May 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday promised to spend $25 billion on science institutions in Russia between 2008-10 to help stop a decades-old brain drain and restore Russia's competitive edge in critical areas. "We have already earmarked sizeable funds to develop such promising sciences as nano- and biotechnologies, nuclear power, aerospace exploration and a number of others," Putin told a meeting with members of the Russian Academy of Sciences. "Only in line with special federal programs, around 600 billion roubles ($25.44 billion) will be spent on these areas in 2008-10." Russia has lost hundreds of thousands of mainly young and middle-aged scientists who either emigrated or took up alternative work during the nation's wild capitalist boom following the Soviet Union's demise in 1991. Putin pledged long-term contracts, housing at privileged prices and other benefits for young scientists who might otherwise seek jobs abroad. "I want to remind you that we have -- albeit not large -- but we still have presidential grants for young scientists," Putin said. "And I want to report to you that we plan to expand them starting next year." Putin also promised to boost average salaries of scientists to 30,000 roubles per month ($1,272) this year from current 20,000 roubles ($848.2). "In many successful scientific organizations the work of scientists is valued even more highly," he said. "A scientist's income must be directly proportionate to the results of his scientific activities." "We can't do without ... competition in science." Putin, who stepped down as president this month, is berated by critics for his cabinet's loose control over quickening inflation in an economy awash with petrodollars. The premier, though, is determined to continue increasing state spending, hoping to diversify the economy and offset ordinary Russians' losses from high prices
