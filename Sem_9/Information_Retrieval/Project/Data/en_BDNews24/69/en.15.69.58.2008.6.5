 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has again urged Awami League for a positive response on political unity for the sake of the nation in overcoming "the current crisis in the country". "Please say 'yes' instead of 'no' for people's sake," the leader of the party's pro-Khaleda faction said Thursday, in response to an AL leader's recent comments on Khaleda Zia's call for unity among parties. Delwar had this message for AL: "If you win in the election we will go to the opposition. But please don't refuse the call for political unity." "It is not possible on the part of any single party alone to overcome the current crisis in the country. All political parties should be united to that end," he said, while speaking to reporters at his NAM flat residence. Earlier in the week, mentioning BNP's alliance with religious fanatics, AL's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam had rejected the idea of any unity with the BNP on ideological grounds. Refusing Khaleda Zia's call the previous day for some kind of political accord, Ashraful, during an extended meeting of the Jubo League, said on Tuesday: "We do not want a repeat of the past. We will not launch a movement and shed blood just to see Khaleda Zia go to power. This cannot happen again." Terming the current situation a "serious crisis", Delwar told reporters Thursday: "Our detained party chief has asked people and political parties to be united. The 1/11 situation was a conspiracy that was made to happen to destroy the country's politicians." He referred to a number of successful movements including those of 1952, 1969 and 1990. "Those political movements were successful because of unity," he said. Delwar criticised the government's recent spate of mass arrests: "Some 14,000 people have been arrested so far. Most of them are leaders and supporters of Awami League and BNP." The BNP leader said: "BNP wants unity among the political parties for the sake of elections." Echoing Khaleda's comment in court on Wednesday, Delwar termed the government dialogue with political parties a "staged drama." After dissolving the party's metropolitan committee on Thursday, Delwar also told reporters: "Whatever changes or decisions take place in the party are taken under the directive of the chairperson. I am just a post box. The committee was scrapped following her directive." On when the new committee would be appointed, he said: "We will form the committee in consultation with the party under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." "But we will do it only with the go-ahead of the chairperson," repeated Delwar. bdnews24
