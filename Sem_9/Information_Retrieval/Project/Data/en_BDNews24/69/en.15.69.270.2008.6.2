 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday wrapped up a hearing on an anticipatory bail prayer by Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case. The court is expected to pass an order on the prayer Tuesday. The HC bench of Justice Khandaker Musa Khaled and Justice Moinul Islam Chowdhury heard both sides on the bail prayer and fixed the date for an order. Mojaheed was in court during the hearing. Mojaheed's counsel barrister Abdur Razzak said the "false case" had been filed against the former social welfare minister for political harassment. Mojaheed filed an anticipatory bail prayer with the HC on May 25. The Anticorruption Commission on Feb 26 filed the case on charges of irregularities and corruption in appointment of the contractor for Barapukuria coalmine. The case also involves former prime minister Khaleda Zia, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former LGRD minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and former industry minister Motiur Rahman Nizami. bdnew
