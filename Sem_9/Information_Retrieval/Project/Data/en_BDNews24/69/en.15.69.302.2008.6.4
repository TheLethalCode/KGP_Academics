 NAIROBI, Wed Jun 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign ambassadors urged Kenya on Wednesday to prevent more violence in forthcoming elections for five parliamentary seats that many fear could be a new flashpoint after this year's post-election crisis. The June 11 by-elections are intended to fill seats where two legislators were shot dead and another two constituencies remained undeclared during the chaotic aftermath of the east African nation's disputed December election. The fifth seat is in the constituency of Kenya's newly-elected parliamentary speaker. Already, campaigning ahead of next week's vote has been marred by scuffles, fraud accusations and bitter rivalry between candidates for the two parties of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Some fear there will be open fighting again among grassroots supporters of the various candidates, even though Kibaki and Odinga now form a coalition government. "We would like to take this opportunity to urge political leaders to publicly denounce all forms of violence, ethnic incitement and electoral malpractice," 12 ambassadors to Kenya said in a statement issued on Wednesday. The envoys from Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan, said their participation as observers of the by-elections did not represent an endorsement of Kenya's electoral commission, which was discredited by the dispute over the December 27 poll. "We are only too aware that the December general election revealed an urgent need for electoral reform including a re-structured electoral commission," they said. With Kibaki officially proclaimed winner, but Odinga saying he was robbed by fraud, the December vote sparked two months of violence, killing at least 1,300 people and displacing 300,000. "We don't want a repeat," US ambassador Michael Ranneberger told a news conference. "It is important that this election goes well in the eyes of Kenyans and the international community.
