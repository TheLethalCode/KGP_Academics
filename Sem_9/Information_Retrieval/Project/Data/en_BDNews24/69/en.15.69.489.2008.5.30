 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supermodel Naomi Campbell has been charged with assaulting a police officer after a disturbance on a plane at Heathrow's new Terminal 5, Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Thursday. The 38-year-old, who is based in New York, is due to appear at Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west London, next month charged with five offences over last month's incident. She was escorted off a U.S.-bound flight after she claimed that one of the two bags she had checked in had gone missing. "Ms Campbell has today been charged with three offences of assaulting a constable, one offence of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress and one offence of using threatening, abusive words or behavior to cabin crew," a CPS statement said. It added that Campbell faces up to six months in jail and a maximum fine of 5,000 pounds ($9,862) for the alleged assault.
