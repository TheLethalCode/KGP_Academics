 VIENNA,Wed Jun 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday demanded Syria give free rein to UN nuclear investigators after diplomats said Damascus would bar access to some sites Washington believes are linked to a secret atomic reactor. The United States says Syria was close to completing a reactor with North Korean help that could have yielded plutonium for nuclear arms before it was bombed by Israel last September. The UN nuclear watchdog began an inquiry after receiving U.S. intelligence documentation in April. International Atomic Energy Agency director Mohamed ElBaradei said on Monday that Syria, which had not responded to IAEA requests for explanations since the bombing, would allow in United Nations inspectors on June 22-24 to pursue the inquiry. Informed diplomats said Syria would let inspectors examine the al-Kibar site in its northeast desert, but not go to three other locations believed to house facilities or equipment for producing plutonium from fuel from the reactor. That prompted Gregory Schulte, US ambassador to the IAEA, to demand that Syria not hinder agency investigators in any way. "The United States welcomes the announcement that the IAEA will visit Syria and stands ready to support a rigorous IAEA investigation into Syria's clandestine nuclear activities," Schulte said in a statement sent to Reuters. "It is imperative that Syria fully cooperate with the IAEA and in no way hinder the investigation either by further delaying an inspection or by refusing the IAEA unfettered access to any site requested by the IAEA," he said. Syria, which has said the bombed site was a disused military building and that it has no clandestine nuclear program, has not confirmed publicly the IAEA visit. RESTRICTED VISIT But a senior Syrian official told an Arab League meeting outside an IAEA governors' conference in Vienna on Tuesday that the IAEA trip would go ahead and inspectors would get access to the al-Kibar site, diplomats in the meeting said. Syrian Atomic Energy Agency chief Ibrahim Othman told them, however, that Damascus would not permit checks of other sites Washington had urged inspectors to examine as possible places for processing nuclear material, diplomats said. They said the position of Syria, which is in a state of war with Israel, was that the other sites were off-limits military installations essential to national security and irrelevant to the IAEA because they had no nuclear connection. Syria was granting inspectors access to al-Kibar as a one-off gesture to dispel international doubts and it expected the IAEA to close the file after the June mission, they said. "There is concern Syria will not let inspectors move around freely or gather samples of whatever is relevant for their inquiry. The IAEA will clearly need more than one visit to approach any conclusions," said a senior non-Arab diplomat attending the 35-nation IAEA governors meeting. Some nuclear analysts, citing satellite photos, say Syria bulldozed and swept clean the al-Kibar zone after the bombing and erected a new building over it, possibly to erase evidence. Washington produced for reporters in April before-and-after aerial photographs of the alleged reactor as well as detailed interior images of what it said were important components. Syria has one old research reactor under IAEA monitoring. President Bashar Assad said earlier this week Syria was not seeking nuclear firepower but wanted access to peaceful atomic energy through a collective Arab project recently announced. Syria is a close ally of Iran, whose secretive uranium enrichment program has been under IAEA investigation since 2003 due to Western suspicions of a covert drive for atom bombs. Iran says it wants only nuclear-generated electricity but restrictions imposed on IAEA inspections mean the agency has been unable to verify Tehran's program is wholly peaceful
