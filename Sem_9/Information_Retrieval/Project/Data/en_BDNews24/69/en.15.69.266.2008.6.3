<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  A judge halted the proceedings of the barge-mounted power-plants graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others for a while Tuesday, apparently offended by a defence counsel's comment. Judge Md Firoz Alam restarted the proceedings after Hasina intervened from the dock and asked the lawyer to seek forgiveness from the court. "I will send you to jail, if I have to. But I won't let the dignity of the court go down," the judge of the special court-1, sited on the Sangsad Bhaban complex. Testimony-taking in the case continued Tuesday. The judge fixed June 8 to take statements from more witnesses. In a midday court session, defence counsel Sajoar Hossain was cross-examining a witness, Power Development Board director Abdul Halim, and asked the judge at some point to record details of the case evidence. "The evidence has already been recorded. There's no need of rerecording," the judge. The lawyer insisted: "It should be recorded. It must be preserved in history." The judge said: "You just cross-examine the witness and the points in cross-examining will be recorded." But the counsel insisted on rerecording the case evidence. The judge reacted sharply and said: "Why do you dictate the court? I'll send you to jail, if I have to. But I won't let the dignity of the court go down." The judge meanwhile asked a court official to bring in law books relevant to the issue. "If necessary, I won't conduct the case. I would inform the High Court in writing that I was too embarrassed to continue the case," the judge continued. State counsels then asked the defence counsel to apologise to the court. Hasina still in the dock asked Sajoar Hossain to seek forgiveness from the judge. Then all defence and state counsels apologised to the court, followed by Sajoar at the end. Former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury was also present in court. The case against the accused involves the allegations of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe in return for the contracts. The case was filed with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 last year. Eight people are accused in the case. bdnews24
