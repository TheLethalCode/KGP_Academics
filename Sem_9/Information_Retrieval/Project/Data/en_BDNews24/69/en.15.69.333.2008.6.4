 KARACHI, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paceman Mohammad Asif has been dropped from the Pakistan squad for the triangular one-day series in Bangladesh after he remained in custody at Dubai airport following his detention for the possession of illegal drugs. A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman told reporters on Wednesday that Asif's place would be taken by young fast bowler Sohail Khan, two days before the squad leaves for Bangladesh to play in the series that also involves India. "Logistically it is difficult to send Asif to Bangladesh now as his visa is not ready and we don't know when he will be home," the spokesman said. "The selectors have decided to send Sohail Khan instead." Khan made his debut against Zimbabwe earlier this year and has played in three one-day internationals. Asif, who has appeared in 11 tests and 28 one-dayers, was detained at Dubai airport on Sunday when he was returning to Lahore from India. Airport authorities found a small amount of an alleged banned substance in his possession. Shafqat Naghmi, the PCB's chief operating officer, said board and Pakistan embassy officials were pursuing Asif's case with authorities in Dubai. "I don't know when this issue can be resolved but the substance has been sent for lab tests as have blood and urine samples of the fast bowler," Naghmi said. "The reports will go to the public prosecutor and he will decide if charges are to be pressed against Asif or if he can be released," he added. The Pakistani paceman has been detained at the airport for the last three day
