 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced former state minister for communications Salahuddin Ahmed to 13 years in jail and a fine of Tk 2 crore for corruption. The BNP leader will have to suffer another year in rigorous imprisonment if he fails to pay the fine, according to a sentencing. Judge AKM Arifur Rahman of the special court-10 set up in the Sangsad Bhaban handed down the verdict. Salahuddin's wife Hasina Ahmed has been acquitted as allegations against her were not proved. Salahuddin was convicted of twin charges and was jailed for three years for concealing information about wealth and a further 10 years for earning wealth illegally. According to the verdict, the jail terms will run back-to-back, which means Salahuddin will have to serve 13 years behind bars. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Shafiqul Islam filed the case against the accused on June 14 last year. According to case details, the accused in their wealth statement to the graft watchdog had concealed wealth worth Tk 29.02 lakh. The couple also earned wealth worth Tk 4.05 crore beyond their known source of income, it was alleged. The Tk 4.05 crore worth of assets will be confiscated and handed to the government. ACC on Feb 18 last year published a list of 50 corruption suspects, including politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats. Salahuddin figured on the list. In a previous verdict, Salahuddin had been sentenced to seven years in jail on Feb 10 on charges of taking Tk 1 crore in bribe. bdnews24.
