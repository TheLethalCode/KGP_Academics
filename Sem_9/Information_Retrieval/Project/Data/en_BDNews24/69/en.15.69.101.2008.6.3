 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced former BNP lawmaker SAH Selim to five years in jail on charges of taking Tk 50 lakh in illicit tolls. The court also fined him Tk 50,000, which if he failed to pay, would keep him behind bars for another six months. Dhaka metropolitan sixth joint sessions judge Md Shafiur Azam delivered the verdict in a crowded court at 5pm Tuesday. Selim was in the dock. With this, Selim has been punished in two cases in a span of one week. Dhaka fourth joint sessions judge Nigar Sultana on May 27 sentenced him to seven years in jail for demanding Tk 12 lakh in toll and realising the amount. Later Selim was sent to jail. However, Selim's lawyers Md Almas Ali and M Nazrul Islam who were present in court said the extortion case in which Selim had been convicted was completely false and fabricated. Zahidul Islam Faruk, owner of a contracting firm at Panthapath in the capital, filed the case on June 10 last year. In the case, Faruk said he got the job of implementing Bagerhat Town Protection dam construction project on Sept 9, 2003 as the lowest bidder. But Selim asked Faruk's business partner Didarul Alam Babul to stop work after he had started work, according to case details. On Sept19 the same year, Faruk along with his business partner Babul went to Selim's office Silver Line Associates at Gulshan. At the time Selim demanded Tk 50 lakh in illegal tolls from Faruk and threatened to stop work if he did not pay the money, the case alleged. bdnew
