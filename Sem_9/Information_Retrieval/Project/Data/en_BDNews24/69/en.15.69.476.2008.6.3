 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh national cricket team got a shock ahead of the tri-nation one-day international series when they went five wickets down to the A team in the first of two day-night affairs at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Tuesday. Discarded Dhiam Ghosh and Naeem Islam put on 104 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket to steer the second string national team to home making 195 for five in 39.1 overs after the Tigers made a paltry 194 all out in 47.5 overs. The Bangladesh Cricket Board has arranged the practice match for the national cricketers to accustom to play under the newly-installed floodlights in Mirpur as all four matches of the series involving India, Pakistan and host Bangladesh will be day-night affairs. Openers Nazimuddin (39) and Junaed Siddique (22) gave a fine start before the A team collapsed to 91 for five at one stage. Dhiman remained unbeaten on 73 off 71 balls while Naeem made 39 not out. Pace duo Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Dollar Mahmud took wicket each. Earlier, the tigers still suffered a run-drought when they opted to bat first winning the toss and were reduced to 21 for three at one stage before the middle order batsmen put up some runs on the board to give the Tigers some respectability. Openers Tamim Iqbal and Shahriar Nafees returned cheaply with four runs on the board as Tamim (2) was bowled by pacer Mahbubul Alam while Shahriar Nafees got run out for nought. Mohammad Ashraful stroked two sixes putting signs of a quick recovery before being caught typically by Nazim Uddin off Rubel Hossain that left the team wobbling at 21-3. Ashraful made a 15-ball 16. Recalled wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim joined up with Roqibul to produce some resistance before the wicketkeeper was trapped leg before by Mosharraf Hossain for 25 off 35 balls that studded five fours. Roqibul departed scoring 52 off 98 balls with five fours and a six and the lower middle-order batsmen took the helm. Mahmudullah Riyad (26), Mehrab Hossain Jr (31) and Mashrafee bin Murtaza (24) all made good contributions to give the innings some respectability before they were dismissed in 47.5 overs. Mahbubul Alam and Farhad Reza grabbed two wickets each giving away 20 and 45 runs as Rubel Hossain, Mosharraf Hossain, Sohrawardi Shuvo and Alok Kapali took one wicket apiece. The second warm-up match will take place at the same venue on Thursday. bd
