 NORTH SOUND, Antigua, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan scored a patient and determined 128 on Tuesday to take his side to a draw on the final day of the second test against Australia. Australia, 1-0 up in the three-match series, retained the Frank Worrell Trophy. After Ricky Ponting declared before the start of play, setting West Indies an unlikely victory target of 372, the hosts were struggling at 95 for three at lunch but recovered thanks to a gritty partnership from Sarwan and fellow Guyanese batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul. The pair put on 143 for the fourth wicket before Sarwan was caught off Mitchell Johnson with the first delivery of the new ball.

Sarwan and Runako Morton steadied the innings before Lee returned for a second spell and trapped Morton lbw for 14. Chanderpaul joined Sarwan before lunch and the pair batted with few scares until tea although Sarwan survived an appeal to the third umpire for a stumping off MacGill The new ball was Australia's last throw of the dice and it brought an instant result with Johnson getting the ball to rise off a good length. Sarwan edged to Mike Hussey at gulley. Bravo was then caught by substitute Brad Hodge at point, as he got a leading edge trying to turn Lee to the onside, and suddenly there were nerves among another paltry home crowd. But wicketkeeper Ramdin (21 not out), who has looked shaky in this series, kept his nerve and West Indies held out for the dra
