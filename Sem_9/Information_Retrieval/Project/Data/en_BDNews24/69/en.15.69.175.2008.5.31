<TEXT>
 NORTH SOUND, Antigua, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian batsman Simon Katich celebrated his return from the international wilderness with a third test century against West Indies on Friday, a turnaround he credits to a more laid-back approach. The 32-year-old Katich's return to the side in the first test in Jamaica last week ended a two and a half year exile from the test team, during which he lost his contract with Cricket Australia. "It felt special because it's obviously been a long time," he said of his unbeaten 113. "As a test batsman that's what it's all about, trying to score hundreds." Katich's previous centuries came against India in 2004 and New Zealand in 2005. He said he had wondered if he would get a another chance. "I guess you never give up hope once you've had a taste of it, but at times you're always thinking at the back of your mind wondering whether that opportunity may come again," he said. "Particularly as the years were starting to tick over, It's just nice to be back and playing." Katich got his chance after some excellent domestic form. He scored a record 1506 Pura Cup runs at an average of 94.12. The retirement of Adam Gilchrist and injury to Matthew Hayden opened the door to a return to the test side in the role of opener. MORE RELAXED It is a more relaxed Katich that has taken this chance. "I sort of though to myself, whatever's left I just wanted to enjoy it," he said. "I think once you get to 30 a lot of people ask you what are you going to do when you finish playing and it was starting to dawn on me that it wasn't that far away. "That's changed my mindset... I think, well if I've only got a few years left I'm going to enjoy it, just take it as it comes." His skipper Ricky Ponting, said that despite two low scores in the first test, Katich had proved his ability and was now a more confident performer. "He has been in as good a form as anyone in the world, nevermind in Australia. To score that amount of runs obviously says you are doing a lot of things very well. "He is seeing the ball like a medicine ball at the moment. It's an amazing turnaround. "He is a lot more confident within himself now and knows his game probably a bit better now
