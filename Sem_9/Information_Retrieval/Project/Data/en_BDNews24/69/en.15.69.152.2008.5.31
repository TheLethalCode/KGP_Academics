 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)National oil, gas and mineral resources corporation Petrobangla is facing financial ruin with uncertainty looming over payment of bills to international oil companies for the month of May, a special aide said. The beleaguered corporation recently sought Tk 1,905 crore from the government to meet its deficit. Prof M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources, told bdnews24.com that Petrobangla had fallen into a serious financial crisis. If it continued, Petrobangla would be unable to pay IOC bills. "Petrobangla's revenue earning is not enough to pay the full bill," he said. Petrobangla officials said that Tk 250 crore had to be paid every month to international oil companies in gas bills. In addition, the corporation needs to finance subsidies of Tk 80 crore per month for gas bought at a higher than sale price, sinking it deeper into debt. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed told bdnews24.com Friday: "Petrobangla is in a financial crisis. We have sought a total of Tk 1,905 crore from the government to overcome the crisis." The corporation purchases gas from BAPEX and two other local companies for as little as Tk 7 per thousand cubic feet. However, it is also forced to buy gas from IOCs at a cost of between Tk 120 and Tk 240 per thousand cubic feet. The price of gas from local companies is also soon set to increase: from July it will cost Tk 25 per thousand cubic feet, and from 2010 it will rise to Tk 50. Among the IOCs, Chevron delivers the highest volume at 715 million cubic feet of gas each day. Of the local companies, Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Ltd and Sylhet Gas Field Ltd supply 873 million cubic feet of gas in combined supply daily. BAPEX supplies about 30 million cubic feet every day. bdnews24.c
