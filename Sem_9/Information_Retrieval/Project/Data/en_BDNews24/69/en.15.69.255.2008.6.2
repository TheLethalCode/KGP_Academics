<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Mon Jun 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday after warning that settlement expansion, including newly-announced building near Jerusalem, imperiled statehood talks. Israel disclosed plans on Sunday to construct nearly 900 new homes in areas of the occupied West Bank that the Israeli government considers part of Jerusalem, despite U.S. and Palestinian calls to halt all settlement expansion. The peace talks have also been overshadowed by a corruption scandal that threatens to topple Olmert. "If Israel does not halt these activities, it will be difficult to reach the political settlement," Abbas said at a news conference with visiting German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier just before meeting Olmert. Olmert has so far rebuffed calls that he leave office over allegations he took envelopes stuffed with cash from a Jewish-American businessman. Olmert and the businessman have denied wrongdoing. Israeli officials close to Olmert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his strategy was to push ahead with peace negotiations as if nothing has changed and hope that the investigation does not end in charges against him. After talks with Abbas at his Jerusalem residence, Olmert will fly to Washington for a three-day visit where he will meet U.S. President George W. Bush. The political crisis enveloping Olmert could trigger an early election and the disruption of peace talks launched at a conference hosted by Bush in November. Olmert says he will resign if indicted. OLMERT'S TROUBLES Israeli officials said Olmert's plight may have spurred his backing of the new construction tenders, which include an additional 763 housing units in Pisgat Zeev and 121 housing units in Har Homa, an area Palestinians refer to as Jabal Abu Ghneim. The 2003 peace "road map" requires a halt to all settlement activity on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood. The new building could help Olmert shore up support from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, a key member of his coalition government opposed to major concessions to the Palestinians on Jerusalem, the officials said. At the press conference with Steinmeier in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Abbas said of the new tenders: "We believe that these measures will be the biggest hurdle in the path of the peace process." Olmert has said the United States and the Palestinians have long been aware of Israel's intention to hold on to several large settlement blocs, around Jerusalem and elsewhere in the West Bank, in any final peace agreement
