 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Tuesday criticised acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam for his comment that the AL would not go for a united movement with the BNP, which was accused of being "responsible for 1/11". Speaking at a discussion, Delwar said the people wanted unity, and those who did not would be isolated from people. The BNP leader termed the AL leader's comment "adventurous" and asked him to stop making such comments. Meanwhile, Syed Ashraful Islam speaking as the chief guest at the extended meeting of the Awami Jubo League central committee at the AL central office Tuesday said the party would not launch a movement for "installing anybody else in power". "We do not want a repeat of 1990. We will launch a movement, shed blood and Khaleda Zia will go to power, which cannot happen again," he said. Delwar was speaking at a discussion on the 27th death anniversary of the founder of the party Ziaur Rahman at the National Press Club, organised by BNP's cultural front Jatiyatabadi Samajik Sangskritik Sangstha. Delwar said: "People will not forgive those who conspire against the country. The independence of the country was achieved in 1971 as people were united." After the meeting of Awami League's central committee secretaries at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi Monday, Ashraful in an oblique reference to the BNP said, "There can be no unity with those who were responsible for 1/11." Criticising the AL, Delwar said: "BNP did not go to elections in 1986, but the Awami League did. People are in favour of unity for overcoming a crisis and our leader has spoken in favour of unity. However, the way the Awami League general secretary reciprocated seems unwise." bdnews24.
