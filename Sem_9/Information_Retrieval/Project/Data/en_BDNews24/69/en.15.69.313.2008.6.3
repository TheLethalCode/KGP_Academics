 MANCHESTER, England, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has rejected a request from English county team Lancashire to allow Mohammed Yousuf to miss this month's tri-series against India and hosts Bangladesh, a Lancashire spokeswoman confirmed on Monday. The club signed Yousuf, 33, last month to cover for their Australian overseas player Brad Hodge who belatedly agreed to play in an Indian domestic Twenty20 event. Yousuf's stay was extended when Hodge was required by Australia on their West Indies tour, to cover for Michael Clarke who was on compassionate leave due to the failing health of his fiancee's father. "The PCB have been brilliant and very helpful in allowing Mohammed to extend his contract with us after Brad was needed in the Caribbean," the spokeswoman said. "We just hoped that they may allow us to keep him a little bit longer and we asked the question but they indicated that they wanted to take a full-strength squad to Bangladesh so he will be heading back to Pakistan on Tuesday." Yousuf is the third highest-scoring batsman in Pakistan's test match history with 6,770 runs from 79 games
