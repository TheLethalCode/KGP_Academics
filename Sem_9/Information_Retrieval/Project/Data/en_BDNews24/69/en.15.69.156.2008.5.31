 Dena Aubin NEW YORK, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. junk bond sales have nearly tripled in May to $12.05 billion, in the latest sign that credit markets are healing as fears of recession and financial meltdowns ease. May's junk bond sales are up from $4.4 billion in April and are the highest since October, when $19 billion was sold, according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite a still struggling U.S. economy, a string of recent data such as stronger-than-expected durable goods orders on Wednesday have supported the view that the country may not be in a recession. "The data, particularly this week, has shown that the housing market is awful but in general the economy is not that bad," said Andrew Feltus, portfolio manager for Pioneer Investments' global high-yield fund in Boston. "It's not growth, we're just sort of limping along, but that's not a disastrous scenario for high-yield." A rally in junk bonds has also renewed appetite for new issues. Counting interest and price changes, junk bonds posted investment returns of 0.35 percent in May-to-date and 4.17 percent in April, reversing a sharp loss in the first three months of the year, according to Merrill Lynch data. "The market is showing it has an appetite for good paper and that will continue," said Kingman Penniman, president of high-yield research firm KDP Investment Advisors in Montpelier, Vermont. Junk bond sales all but came to a halt earlier this year amid credit turmoil that culminated in the near collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns in mid-March. Capital-raising by banks, liquidity injections by the Federal Reserve and a rebound in stocks have made investors more comfortable taking risk. Demand has been especially heavy for bonds in the hot energy sector, where drillers and servicing companies are benefiting from record high oil prices. Oil and natural gas pipeline company El Paso Corp (EP.N: Quote, Profile, Research) sold $600 million of junk bonds last week while oil and gas driller Plains Exploration and Production Co (PXP.N: Quote, Profile, Research) sold $400 million, both $100 million more than originally planned. Other recent energy deals included $800 million from Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and $250 million from Forest Oil Corp (FST.N: Quote, Profile, Research). "Unlike what we saw in 2007, these are relatively high-quality, well-known, solid, defensive names," Penniman said. Preference for safer deals shows investors remain in a defensive mode, he said. "They're concerned about the economy, they're concerned about rising default rates and they're concerned that perhaps we haven't seen the last of financial disturbances," he said. U.S. junk bond defaults are expected to rise to 4.7 percent in the next 12 months from a 25-year low of 0.97 percent at the end of 2007, according to Standard & Poor's. Even so, with average junk bond yields topping 10 percent, the market is already pricing in a climb in defaults. "It's not that tough to argue you're getting compensated for the risk," said Pioneer's Feltus. Still, lower-quality borrowers remain all but shut out of the market, especially in hard-hit sectors such as media, entertainment, retail, restaurants and consumer products. Those sectors combined have sold just five new issues year year-to-date totaling a scant $4.4 billion, according to S&P. "These cyclical sectors rely heavily on consumer spending, which has recently declined after showing resilience in 2007," S&P said in a report on Thursday. Spillover from the housing slump has hit home-related consumer sectors, while rising raw material costs have further hurt earnings. Overall junk bond supply year-to-date remains down 69 percent from the same period in 2007 at about $22 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. "The significant improvement in markets notwithstanding, there are still signs of a mild credit crunch, especially for lower quality borrowers," Lehman Brothers said in a report on Thursday.
