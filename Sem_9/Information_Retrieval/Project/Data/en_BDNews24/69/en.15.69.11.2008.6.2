 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh has been elected a titular member to the governing body of the International Labour Organisation for the period of 2008-11, said a statement of Bangladesh mission in Geneva Monday. Bangladesh would represent the Asia Pacific Group of countries in the ILO. The elections for 18 new titular members were held Monday at the international labour conference in Geneva. The ILO governing body has 56 regular members. "To reflect the unique tripartite structure of ILO, the GB comprises of members from governments, employers and workers," the statement said. "The election reflects the international community's support to the country's adherence to various ILO conventions," acting labour and employment secretary Mahfuzul Haque, now in Geneva, told bdnews24.com. "Being a member of ILO GB, Bangladesh would be able to play an important role in protecting the rights of the working people at home and abroad," he said. "Presently, with ILO, Bangladesh is implementing a number of projects concerning elimination of child labour, withdrawing children from hazardous work, developing guidelines for ship-breaking industry, protecting workers from impending climate change related disaster," Haque said. It is believed, Haque said, the country will be able to undertake more projects with ILO assistance in promoting causes of the labour community following Bangladesh's elections. bd
