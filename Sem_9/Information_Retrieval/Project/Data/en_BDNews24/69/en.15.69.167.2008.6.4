<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) - The high-ups of the Bangladesh Football Federation Wednesday had a meeting with a three-member delegation of the Prince Aga Khan Shia Imami Islamic Council for Bangladesh to revive the Aga Khan Gold Cup in Bangladesh. The meeting discussed the details about how to revive the Gold Cup, which was a popular tournament in Bangladesh before and after independence. The meeting decided to send an estimated budget of organising the Gold Cup to Prince Aga Khan through Habib Hirzi, chairman of the Aga Khan Shia Imami Islamic Council for Bangladesh. "We have discussed the prospect of restarting the Aga Khan Gold Cup and nothing is yet to be finalised," said BFF president Kazi Salahuddin. Salahuddin said, "They asked for an estimated budget for the tournament from the BFF and the federation may submit it within a week." The BFF boss, however, said that the final decision would be made in Paris where Prince Aga Khan resides. Khan first discussed the matter with the Chief Adviser during his short trip to Bangladesh recently, and the BFF talked to the Council's members in line with that discussion. President Kazi Salahuddin, its vice presidents Badal Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, Kazi Nabil Ahmed and member Harun-or-Rashid were among others present at the meeting at the BFF House in Arambagh. The Aga Khan Gold Cup was last held in Bangladesh in 1982.
