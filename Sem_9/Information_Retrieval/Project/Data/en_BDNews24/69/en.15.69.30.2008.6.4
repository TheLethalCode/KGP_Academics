 BAGHDAD, Wed Jun 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 13 people in an attack on a senior police officer in Baghdad on Wednesday and gunmen shot dead three US soldiers in northern Iraq, officials said. The US military said separately that at least 10 decaying bodies had been found in a sewer shaft in east Baghdad, apparently victims of sectarian violence about two years ago. US and Iraqi officials have been highlighting an improvement in security in Iraq that has led to sharp drops in violence and in attacks on US soldiers five years after the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. But US commanders have stressed that security improvements are fragile and reversible. The suicide bomber drove a truck towards the house of police Brigadier-General Nadhim Taeih, in northern Baghdad, killing at least 13 people and wounding 52, police said. Police said the blast destroyed Taeih's house. His nephew was killed and other relatives were seriously wounded in the blast, Interior Ministry sources said. It was unclear if Taeih himself was injured. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has improved his standing by cracking down on Shi'ite militias in Basra in the south and Baghdad and al Qaeda in the north. U.S. and Iraqi military officials say al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq but remains a threat. An old woman who was wounded in the blast told Reuters Television a number of houses had been destroyed in the blast. "It was catastrophic ... I don't know what we did to deserve this. Is it a punishment from God?" she asked, at al Kindi hospital in Baghdad. The three American soldiers were killed by small-arms fire in the town of Hawija, 210 km (130 miles) north of Baghdad, the US military said. It gave no further details. In May, the number of US soldiers killed fell to 19, the lowest monthly death toll in a five-year-old war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 4,000 American soldiers. US military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Steve Stover said Iraqi police and US soldiers, acting on a tip, found the decaying bodies of between 10 and 12 people in a sewer shaft in the New Baghdad area of the capital on Tuesday. The bodies, believed to have been in the shaft for about two years, are likely to be victims of sectarian violence, he said. Violence in Iraq has fallen to its lowest level in more than four years, figures released by the US military last month showed. US President George W Bush sent 30,000 extra troops to Iraq last year to halt a slide toward sectarian civil war and has rejected calls by Democrats for 155,000 troops to be withdrawn as soon as possible, a hot issue in the US presidential race
