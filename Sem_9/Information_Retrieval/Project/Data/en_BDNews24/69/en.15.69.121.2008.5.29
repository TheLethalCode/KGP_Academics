 BUENOS AIRES, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina's World Cup qualifier against Brazil next month would be the ideal opportunity to reverse some poor results against their South American opponents, forward Lionel Messi said on Wednesday. Barcelona's Messi has bad memories against the five-times world champions, being on the wrong end of three-goal defeats in his first two meetings against them. He played when Argentina lost 3-0 to Brazil in a friendly in September 2006 in London and when they were beaten by the same score in last year's Copa America final in Venezuela. Previous to that, Brazil beat Argentina 4-1 at the Confederations Cup final in Germany in 2005 when Messi did not play. "We're very eager for this game," Messi told reporters at Buenos Aires airport. "In the last two matches, they have beaten us badly and we hope that this time it will be different." Brazil host Argentina in a World Cup qualifier on June 18 in Belo Horizonte. Messi said that he hoped to play in the Olympic Games in August, although he also wanted to play for Barcelona. "I want to play at the Games but I also want to help my club, because I want the best for both teams and both are important to me," he said. Messi is also in the squad for the friendlies against Mexico in San Diego on June 4 and against United States in New York four days later
