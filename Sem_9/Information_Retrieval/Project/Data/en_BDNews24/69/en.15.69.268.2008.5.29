 NEW YORK Thu May 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O: Quote, Profile, Research), the biggest US warehouse club operator, said on Thursday its quarterly profit jumped 32 percent, beating expectations, as shoppers flocked to its stores for discounts on food and gasoline. Costco and its rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N: Quote, Profile, Research) Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc (BJ.N: Quote, Profile, Research) have emerged as bright spots in the struggling US retail sector, as cash-strapped shoppers, worried about the weakening US economy, increasingly seek out deals in the clubs. Net income was $295.1 million, or 67 cents per share, for the fiscal third quarter, compared with $224.0 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier, when Costco took a charge related to increased reserves for customer returns. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 65 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales in the quarter rose 13 percent to $16.26 billion, excluding membership fees, which rose to $350.9 million from $317.7 million, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said. Customers pay an annual fee to shop in Costco's warehouse clubs, which sell everything from discounted TVs and fresh foods to bulk-sized packages of toilet paper and soda. Costco also operates gasoline stations at many of its locations, typically offering prices cheaper than local competitors. Its quarterly sales at locations open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 8 percent. Same-store sales at its US locations rose 6 percent, while international same-store sales advanced 16 percent. Excluding gasoline price inflation, it said US same-store sales would have risen 4 percent, while on a local currency basis, international same-store sales increased 6 percent. In a research note, JPMorgan analyst Charles Grom said given that Costco's quarter ended May 11, its 8 percent same-store sales increase "implies solid top-line trends at the beginning of the month." That means Costco could report May same-store sales of roughly 7.0 percent to 7.5 percent -- ahead of current Wall Street estimates for a rise of 6.3 percent, he said. Costco operates 538 warehouses worldwide, including 394 clubs in the United States and Puerto Rico, 75 in Canada, 19 in the United Kingdom, six in Korea, five in Taiwan, eight in Japan and 31 in Mexico. It plans to open an additional nine to ten new warehouses, including the relocation of four clubs, by August 31, which marks the end of its fiscal year
