<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday disbanded the party's Dhaka city unit committee to protect what a statement said was 'party interest'. In the statement, the BNP alleged that the president and general secretary of the committee had been involved in activities that went against the party interests. "The committee of the Dhaka city unit of the BNP remained inactive in the prevailing political situation," the statement said. Acting officer secretary Md Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, better known as Rizvi Ahmed, told bdnews24.com that the party secretary general had disbanded the committee. The latest move was meant to "inject momentum" into activities of the troubled party. A committee was formed in 1996 with Sadek Hossain Khoka, now mayor of Dhaka City Corporation, as its convener. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia announced a complete committee in 2000 with Khoka as president and Abdus Salam as general secretary. bdnew
