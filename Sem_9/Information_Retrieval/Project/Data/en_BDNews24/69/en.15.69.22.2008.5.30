<TITLE> Unpredictable surface for first test at </TITLE>

 ST JOHN'S, Antigua, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies and Australia will enter the unknown when they face off on Friday in the first test match to be held at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium. The second test of Australia's tour of the Caribbean begins on Friday with Australia looking to add a second victory to their triumph at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica last week. But while Sabina Park has decades of test match history behind it, the 'Sir Viv' has only hosted one-day fixtures at last year's World Cup. The result is that neither side really know what to expect from the surface over the coming five days. Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke said he expects the pitch to offer something for the bowlers from as early as the third day. "It looks very flat and very hard, it looks like a one day wicket," Clarke told reporters after practice on Thursday. "I think it will be very good for the batters probably day one and day two and then it is probably going to spin a bit, for Stuey MacGill to come in to his own I would imagine," added Clarke, who missed the first test as he was on compassionate leave. The surface, rock hard but likely to open up some cracks later in the match, may prompt West Indies to consider a start for slow-left armer Sulieman Benn, rather than go with an all-seam attack. But the return to fitness of first-choice pace bowler Jerome Taylor after excellent bowling from Fidel Edwards and Daren Powell in the first test makes that choice a tricky one. The hosts will not name their team until shortly before the game but coach John Dyson said the conditions would be a major factor. "The team will be selected based on the pitch and the outfield," Dyson told reporters. The pitch proved to be made for batsmen when the two teams met during the World Cup - the opening match at the venue saw Australia make a huge 322 in 50 overs before bowling out West Indies for 219. The outfield caused problems during last year's tournament with drainage difficulties leading to boggy conditions near the boundary. The surface in the deep is much firmer now but there are visible signs of work, of new grass having been fitted, resulting in a patchwork appearance and some unevenness which will mean that fielders will have to have their wits about them throughout the test
