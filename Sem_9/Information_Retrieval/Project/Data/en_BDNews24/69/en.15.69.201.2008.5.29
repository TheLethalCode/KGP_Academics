<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice for defending champions Boca Juniors as they were held 2-2 at home by Fluminense in a pulsating Libertadores Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday. Brazil's Fluminense twice trailed but a mistake by Boca goalkeeper Pablo Migliore, standing in for the injured Mauricio Caranta, allowed them to take a draw and two precious away goals back to Rio de Janeiro. Boca, banned from using the Bombonera after a linesman was hit by an ice cube thrown from the crowd in a previous round, staged the game at Racing Club's Presidente Peron stadium. On a cold, windy night, Riquelme put them ahead in the 12th minute when he set Rodrigo Palacio away on the right and side-footed home when the ball was returned to him. The visitors were level three minutes later when Thiago Silva outjumped the Boca defence to head in from a Thiago Neves free kick. Cristian Chavez nearly put Boca back in front in the 18th minute with a shot which struck the bar. Boca enjoyed more possession and Fluminense goalkeeper Fernando Henrique made good saves early in the second half to turn away a Gabriel Paletta header and a Chavez shot. The Argentines regained the lead in the 65th minute when, following two minutes of arguing over the position of the Fluminense wall, Riquelme scored with a deflected free kick. Undeterred, Fluminense charged forward and both Thiago Neves and Washington had shots saved by Migliore in quick succession. Thiago Neves equalised in the 77th minute with a 20-metre shot which slipped through Migliore's hands
