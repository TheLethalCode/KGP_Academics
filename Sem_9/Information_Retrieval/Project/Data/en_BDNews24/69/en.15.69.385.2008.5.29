 JAKARTA, Thu May 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hidden cameras have captured rare footage of critically endangered Javan rhinos in the jungles of Indonesia, which will help understand the animal's behavior patterns, the wildlife conservation group WWF said on Thursday. The rhinos have appeared twice on cameras one month after the devices were installed in the Ujung Kulon National Park in the westernmost region of Java island, with one rhino mother charging a camera and damaging it. "With fewer than 60 Javan rhinos left in the wild, we believe this footage was well worth the risk to our equipment," said Adhi Rachmat Hariyadi, who leads WWF-Indonesia's project in the national park. "It's very unusual to catch a glimpse of the Javan rhinos deep inside the rain forest," he said in a statement. He said the footage would help authorities understand the population dynamics and behavior of Javan rhinos in a more scientific manner. Javan rhinos are found only in Indonesia and Vietnam, with Java home to more than 90 percent of the population
