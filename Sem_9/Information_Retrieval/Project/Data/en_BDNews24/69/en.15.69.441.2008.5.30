<TITLE> Bahrain to execute Bangladeshi by firing squad: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)Bahrain is set to execute a Bangladeshi cook in a firing squad in a fast-track decision for killing a fashion designer, said a US news website Thursday. The case dates back to 2006 but the execution plan was expedited apparently after the murder of a Bahraini national by a Bangladeshi mechanic last week. Mizan Noor Al Rahman Ayoub Miyah, a cook, was convicted of murdering Bahraini fashion designer Sana Al Jalahama in 2006. "Miyah will be executed by firing squad, but a date has not yet been set," said All Headline News (AHN), based in Wellington of Florida, US. The case against Miyah was pending in the court for two years and was put on the fast track after reports that King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa gave permission to general public prosecutor Dr Ali Al Buanin on Thursday to carry out arrangements for the sentence, AHN said. Following the murder of Mohammed Jassim Dossary, a Bahraini national, by a Bangladeshi mechanic on the outskirts of Manama last week, some Bahrain lawmakers urged the government to expel all Bangladeshis. The Bahraini government then stopped issuing work permits to Bangladeshis. Bangladeshis make the second largest intake of foreign workers in the kingdom. According to official figures, there are 86,000 Bangladeshis in the Gulf kingdom. Activist Nabeel Rajab, from the defunct Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, criticised the decisions saying: "This decision comes at a time when the entire attitude of the country is anti-Bangladeshi." "This is a frightening decision at the wrong time. Was the Bangladeshi given fair trial and had access to a lawyer? Were the proceedings monitored by their embassy? There are several questions but no answers at this critical juncture," AHN quoted Rajab as saying. Meanwhile, Bangladesh has expressed regrets for the latest murder and urged Bahrain to lift the ban on workers. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, now in Singapore, Wednesday telephoned Bahrain's state minister for foreign affairs. "The whole nation should not be punished for one's crime," he said. Iftekhar urged the Bangladeshis living in the Middle East to obey local laws for their mutual benefits. bdn
