<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain asked the government Thursday to stop what he said was a game in the name of dialogue and to hold elections by releasing the two detained former prime ministers. "Stop the dialogue game and release the two leaders (Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina)," Delwar, who heads a faction of the divided party, told a meeting of four-party alliance leaders. The Paltan Jubo Kalyan Parishad organised the meeting and a prayer session at the Photo Journalists Association Auditorium in Dhaka on the eve of the 27th death anniversary of Ziaur Rahman, founder of the BNP. Terming the caretaker government "illegal" Delwar said: "Why should we sit with you for talks? Who are you representing?" "We need unity in nationalist forces to overcome the country's current crisis. We have to prepare for a movement. The dialogue and elections will not be successful without the two leaders." Delwar accused the government of launching a secret campaign to handpick candidates from rural areas for upazila lections. The BNP leader warned the upazila election-hopefuls of "public rage" and asked the government to give up the idea of holding upazila elections. "The only job of the caretaker government is to assist the Election Commission in holding a proper election and transfer power to elected representatives." "That's why the constitution allows the caretaker government a 90-day timeframe for the polls," he said. Delwar hit out at the government for alleged violations of human rights and setbacks to justice. "The government is not legally authorised to rule the country," Delwar claimed. Delwar denounced the government's anti-graft move. "This is not an anti-graft move. It's a move to take the politicians off the scene." Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, speaking at the meeting, said: "The government must release Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina and Motiur Rahman Nizami for acceptable elections." "The dialogue drama will not work." bdnew
