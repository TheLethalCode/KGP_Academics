<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England coach Fabio Capello said he was delighted with England's 2-0 win over the United States and praised John Terry's role in the success at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday. The Italian coach, speaking to reporters in his rapidly improving English, said: "I am very happy for John Terry and very happy for the way we played. "He had a very good game. He's a leader for Chelsea and a leader for the national team." Terry was one of seven players in the starting line-up who took part in the Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea last Wednesday when he was left traumatized after his missed penalty in the shootout cost Chelsea the chance of winning the final. He opened the scoring for England with a well-taken header towards the end of a poor first half and Capello said: "That goal was important for him. Now he can go on holiday and feel happier." A Steven Gerrard goal after 59 minutes and some neat passing moves were the other highlights of an otherwise largely forgettable friendly, but Capello left Wembley a happy man. "I saw a lot of the things on the pitch that we have started to do in training, a lot of good movement." He also said that seven of the nine players in the squad who were involved in the Champions League final last week would be allowed to remain at home and not travel to Trinidad & Tobago for the last international of the season on Sunday. He did not name the two who would go to the Caribbean saying he had not told the players themselves yet. Bob Bradley, the U.S. coach, said that Landon Donovan did not play and win his 100th cap as expected because he had a groin strain. He congratulated England's performance adding, "although we beat Poland recently, that doesn't mean you have arrived. England showed us we still have some way to go tonight.
