 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com) - A road show "Esho Bangladesh Gori" to be opened by agriculture adviser CS Karim gets underway at Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre Friday, an official said. A motorcade will move from Tentulia to Teknaf over a period of one month and a half to increase awareness about honest and efficient leadership. The road show will also focus on checking corruption, building a crime- and drugs-free Bangladesh, solving the food crisis and building the tourism industry, the convenor of the Road Show Committee, Anwar Faruque, told a press conference at the National Press Club Thursday. Faruque, director general (seed) of the agriculture ministry, said: "The road show has been arranged to disseminate the message of potential in different sectors among the people." The motorcade will cross 55 districts in the next 50 days and make stopovers in 25 district towns organising fairs there. At the fairs, five cars would be decorated on five themes of the road show. Debates and essay competitions will be organised for the students of schools and colleges in the district towns in cooperation with the district administrations. bdnews
