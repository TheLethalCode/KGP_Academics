<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday rejected a writ petition filed by detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, challenging the legality of the proceeding of the barge-mounted power plant case against her. The bench of justices MA Rashid and Md Ashfaqul Islam made the ruling. The court also cancelled two similar writ petitions filed by former BNP state minister Ruhul Quddus Talukder, five by BNP leader Mosaddak Ali Falu and one by former Awami League lawmaker AHM Mostafa Kamal known as Lotus Kamal. In its ruling, the HC said it was not logical that the trial court would not be able to continue the proceedings of a case, which was not disposed of in 60 days from its filing date. "Disposal of cases in 60 days is not mandatory, but a directive. There was no clear guideline in the law about the consequence of the cases which were not disposed of in 60 days' time," the HC said. Hasina's lawyer Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said it was not yet decided if the verdict would be challenged in the Appellate Division. Another defence lawyer Barrister Fazle Noor Tapash told bdnews24.com that proceeding of the barge-mounted power plant case would continue in the trial court the way it was. A lawyer for the Anticorruption Commission, Aziz Khan, told reporters that the trial court would press ahead with the barge-mounted power plant case and others. "The government has to answer why a case was not disposed of in the given time. So it is not fair that the trial court will not be able to carry out proceeding of cases," he said. The detained former prime minister filed the petition on May 11 challenging the proceedings on the grounds that the case had not been disposed of in 60 days under law. The High Court had earlier ordered the government, Anticorruption Commission and Dhaka Special Judge's Court -1 to explain why the delay, and why continued proceedings of the case should not be declared illegal, but did not stay the trial. The case is currently under trial at the Special Judge's Court-1, set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking bribes in return for allowing installation of three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna during her term as prime minister. bdnew
