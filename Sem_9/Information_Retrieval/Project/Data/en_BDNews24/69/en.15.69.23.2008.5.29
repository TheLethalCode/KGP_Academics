 SEOUL, Thu May 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rumors are a way of life when it comes to North Korea, one of the world's most secretive states, but a rare one on Thursday about the assassination of its leader led to market jitters in Japan. A little-known South Korean online news site reported Kim Jong-il had been killed, quoting a highly placed Chinese intelligence official.

Japanese investors were jittery about the news, while market players in Seoul, who over the years have learned to cast a cold eye on speculation about the inner workings on Pyongyang's leadership, mostly shrugged off the latest rumor. "If something like this did happen, news is going to come out. It can't be covered up forever," said Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group in Seoul.

When the North's founder Kim Il-sung died in 1994, the communist state kept the death secret for nearly two days to make arrangements for succession.
