 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Police have filed a case against 3,000 garment workers for their alleged ties to protests and a road blockade in Savar, a police officer said Wednesday . Garment workers blocked traffic in Savar Tuesday, vandalised vehicles and put up barricades on Abdullahpur-EPZ motorway to protest the rumoured death of a colleague in a road accident. Shafiul Alam, sub-inspector of Ashulia Police Station, said that the Savar correspondent of private television channel Ekushey was also named in the case on charges of fuelling the protests. Sub-inspector Obaidul Islam filed the case with Ashulia Police Station. ETV correspondent Nazmul Huda denied the allegation. "I reported the news quoting the police," Nazmul said. A speeding sand truck hit and seriously injured Rupali, a garments worker, at Narshinghapur of Ashulia Tuesday. Angry workers took to the streets when the rumour of her death spread by word of mouth. Rupali is now undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Her sister and another worker also suffered injuries in the accident and were sent to hospital. Shafiul Alam said a separate case had been filed against truck driver Abul Hossain by Sharmin Group. Seven factories filed general diaries with the police during the protests. bdnews2
