<TITLE> China telcos in mega-deals, Unicom to buy Netcom </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China unveiled two mega-deals on Monday as the government overhauls the world's largest telecoms industry, with mobile operator Unicom taking over a fixed-line peer and unloading an underperforming network. Unicom, smaller rival of China Mobile, said it will issue new shares and swap 1.5 shares for every share in Netcom, the smaller of China's two fixed-line carriers. Unicom said in a statement it would pay a total of more than $55 billion for Netcom, but did not say how it arrived at that figure -- which would be more than double Netcom's current market value. Unicom also agreed to sell a wireless network to fixed-line leader China Telecom and its parent for 110 billion yuan ($15.2 billion). Beijing last month unveiled a long-awaited revamp of the telecoms sector, aimed at improving competition and rolling out high-speed third-generation mobile services, in what has been called the world's largest industrial reorganization. Monday's announcements mark the first steps in a sweeping restructuring that is expected to usher China into a more advanced telecoms age while opening the door to foreign investment and billions of dollars in purchases from telecoms gear makers. Some analysts remained skeptical that 3G would be rolled out soon, after nearly a half-decade of waiting and several false starts. "The government is the owner of all the players and the umpire and determines the playing field," said Duncan Clark at consultancy BDA in Beijing. "This is the first step toward 3G, but does it mean 3G will come sooner? That remains to be seen." Analysts say China Telecom is paying a high price for a network that only broke even in 2006 after years of losses and which is a third of the size of Unicom's Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications network, which raked in 62.78 billion yuan in revenue in 2007. "This is the only way China Telecom is going to get into the mobile business", said BOC International's Allan Ng. Shares in China Unicom, Netcom and Telecom have been suspended since May 23, when the government first announced a series of telco leadership changes to smooth the restructuring. Unicom shares will resume trading on Tuesday. China Mobile, which under the industry blueprint will take over nationwide fixed-line carrier Railcom, continues to trade, closing up 2.5 percent, rebounding after losing about a tenth of its value as investors fretted about heightened competition with two larger, strengthened rivals. ADVENT OF 3G With the advent of 3G, China's 1.3 billion people should join those in advanced economies who already enjoy high-speed Internet access, games and a host of multimedia content from maps to music on their cell phones. Its rollout will unleash billions of dollars in spending for network equipment makers such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, Nortel and Siemens, as newly merged firms expand to compete. The industry reorganization opens the door to foreign investors who until now have been restricted to taking limited stakes in Chinese telecoms companies, such as Vodafone's 3.3 percent investment in China Mobile. China Telecom is in discussions with several potential strategic investors, said an executive with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. China Telecom's parent will pay 66.2 billion yuan for Unicom's Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, while its listed unit will pay another 43.8 billion yuan, according to Monday's statement, allowing the firm to offer wireless services and compete with China Mobile. It was unclear how China Telecom, which has 34 billion yuan cash on hand, will fund the acquisition. Analysts said the company may issue bonds or try to float shares in Shanghai, a market currently barred to foreign-incorporated firms such as Hong Kong-based China Telecom. "The firm has received investment interest from a few interested parties," the executive said. "It is now considering several fund-raising options, but hasn't decided yet." "China Telecom's debt burden is relatively light," said Nomura's Kelvin Ho. "The easiest way to finance the deal will be to sell bonds, then perhaps they'll consider foreign investors." JPMorgan, CICC and Lehman Brothers are advising Unicom on its two deals. UBS will advise the China Telecom group, while Citigroup and Rothschild are advising Netcom
