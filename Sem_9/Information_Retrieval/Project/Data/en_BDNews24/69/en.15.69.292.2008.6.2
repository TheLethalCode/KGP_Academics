<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Monday rejected BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's call for unity among all political parties. "There cannot be unity with those who are responsible for 1/11," he told reporters after a meeting of AL central committee secretaries at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi. The meeting continued from 6pm to 8.30pm. The AL leader came down hard on the BNP-led four-party alliance after he was asked to comment on Khaleda's call for all parties to unite. "They put the sovereignty of Bangladesh at risk by making an alliance with fanatic ultra-communalists." "They (BNP-led alliance) are responsible for this situation. They had prepared a voter list for a unilateral election and made Iajuddin Ahmed the chief adviser to capture power," he said. The AL leader protested the latest crackdown on district and upazila leaders and said: "The drive was meant to cloud the environment." bdnews
