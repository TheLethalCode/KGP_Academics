 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, June 3 (bdnews24.com) -- A prominent minister in the North-East Indian state of Assam was sacked after he was caught red-handed offering bribe to an officer of the country's apex investigating agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Ripun Borah, education minister of Assam, was arrested in the Indian capital city of New Delhi on Tuesday for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs 10 lakh to an officer of the CBI, which is investigating a murder case against him. Borah's associate Mukul Pathak, a journalist with an Assamese newspaper, was taken into custody at the Delhi airport after he landed from Guwahati. Ramesh Maheswari, a Delhi-based businessman, who allegedly supplied the money to Bora has also been arrested. Borah, who had a long innings as the spokesperson of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee, is a suspect in the murder case and had been questioned several times by the CBI. "This cabinet minister is a suspect in a crime being investigated by CBI. He had approached the complainant (CBI officer) through the middleman for negotiating outcome of the CBI investigation," said CBI spokesperson G Mohanty. The CBI officer, who is probing the murder of student leader Daniel Topno, filed a complaint on Monday that Borah had allegedly offered him a bribe to hush up the case. Topno, district president of All Assam Tea Tribe Students Union, was Borah's rival candidate in the Gohpur constituency during the 1996 Assembly elections in Assam. Topno was vocal against Borah, who lost the elections in 1996 but was elected from Gohpur in 2001. Topno was murdered on September 27, 2000. The CBI took over the murder probe in 2001 after the Assam Police failed to solve the murder. In an initial effort to protect his colleague, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had said that "the law will take its own course" just after the new of the arrest became public. But later, under intense pressure, he sacked Bora from his cabinet of ministers. bdn
