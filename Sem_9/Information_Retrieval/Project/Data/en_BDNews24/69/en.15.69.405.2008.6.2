 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  In a major army reshuffle, Lt Gen Masud Uddin Chowdhury, Principal Staff Officer to the Armed Forces Division, has been transferred to National Defence College as its commandant, officials said Monday. Gen Masud has been working as the chief coordinator of the national coordination committee on serious crimes, formed following the imposition of the state of emergency. Lt Gen Abu Tayeb Muhammad Zahirul Alam, the outgoing NDC chief, will join the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for appointment as ambassador or high commissioner, they said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said President Iajuddin Ahmed, who oversees defence during a caretaker administration, had signed the orders Monday. Later, Md Sirajul Islam, secretary (Public Division) to the President, confirmed the news to bdnews24.com by phone. "These changes have been made as far as I know," he said, when he was asked to confirm the news. However, a formal government announcement was still awaited. The new Principal Staff Officer to the Armed Forces Division will be Major General Abdul Mobin, currently GOC of Chittagong area. Bogra area GOC Major General Muhammad Shamim Chowdhury will go to Chittagong to head the 24th Infantry Division. Government sources Monday tipped Lt Gen Zahirul Alam to become the high commissioner to Australia. "A proposal has been initiated for the general to go to Australia, but a formal announcement will come only after approval from the Australian government," a highly-placed source said. bdnews24.c
