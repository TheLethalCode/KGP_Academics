<TITLE> Bhutan hold Bangladesh 1-1 in SAFF Championship </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh made a frustrating start Wednesday in the 5th SAFF Championship when they played a 1-1 draw against Bhutan in Group B opener at Sugathadasa Stadium, Colombo, Sri Lanka. Arup Kumar Baidya put Bangladesh ahead in the 26th minute, but Bhutan levelled the margin in the 79th minute, according to a message received here. The source, however, could not confirm the scorer of Bhutan. Lowly Bhutan held four times finalists Bangladesh for the first time so far as the last year's runners-up, Bangladesh, had earlier beaten Bhutan twice in the 3rd and the 4th SAFF Championship meets. With the unexpected against the low side, Bangladesh's mission to qualify for the semifinals might be risked as they have to face emerging power Afghanistan in the second match on Friday. The war-ravaged Afghanistan last month stunned all to beat Kyrgyzstan and held Bangladesh to qualify for the eight-team finals of the AFC Challenge Cup to be held in India. Hosts Sri Lanka are considered top favourites in the four-team Group B, especially after their stunning 7-1 win over Pakistan in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers and Bangladesh will probably face the toughest challenge from the hosts in their third and final match on June 8.
