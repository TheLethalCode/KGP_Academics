 PARIS, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new women's champion will be crowned at Roland Garros this year after fifth seed Serena Williams crashed out 6-4 6-4 to Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik in the third round on Friday. Williams, winner in 2002 and the only former champion in the women's draw, always looked second best on Court Suzanne Lenglen as Srebotnik, the 27th seed, claimed her first win over the American in four meetings in 90 minutes. "I just felt like I missed a lot of easy shots and a lot of key points that I felt like could have turned the match around. I wasn't able to capitalize on a lot of that," said Williams, who had only once before failed to reach the fourth round in seven previous visits to Paris. "I knew it was going to be a tough match, but what can I say? She just played unbelievable today," the American added. Srebotnik provided a taste of what was to come by breaking in the opening game but Williams, in her 34th grand slam event, leveled for 2-2. Williams ballooned a forehand wide to give the Slovenian a break at 4-3 and she netted one of several errant overheads to hand Srebotnik two sets points at 5-4. She saved both but finally conceded the opener on a fourth set point after 44 minutes when she netted a backhand. Williams looked sharper in the second, roaring encouragement with every winner she put away but she could not crack Srebotnik's resolve. The Slovenian, in her 10th Roland Garros campaign, carved out the break in game nine and eventually sealed victory on her third match point when Williams sent a forehand wide. Srebotnik had won just one set in their previous three meetings but the 27-year-old clenched her fist skywards at the moment of victory and can look forward to a fourth-round clash with either Swiss 10th seed Patty Schnyder or France's Emilie Loit
