 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)About 30 people were injured in what appeared to be gas pipeline explosions at Hotel Orchard Plaza in Naya Paltan in Dhaka late Sunday night. The "explosions" damaged parts of the interior of the hotel where some foreigners were staying overnight. Firemen rushed to the scene after a fire was spotted on a floor of the hotel. Law-enforcement agencies tightened security around the building and blocked a long stretch of the road, bdnews24.com correspondents report from the scene. The police did not have clear, immediate details on the nature of the twin explosions, with the first occurring at 9:15pm. But Major Mahbub Islam of the Paltan army camp, located close to the hotel, told bdnews24.com: "They may be a gas pipeline explosion triggered by a burning cigarette." The army officer who was on the scene referred to boarders' complaints against gas leaks in the hotel. Major Mahbub said he had talked to some people who were rescued from the building. According to initial details, a 43-year-old Sri Lankan national, AR Samantilak, was among those injured in the first explosion. He was taken to City Hospital. The second explosion that occurred around 11:30pm injured some newsmen after they arrived on the scene to cover the first explosion. Reporters saw shards of glass scattered on the road, with a long stretch blocked by the police and other security officials. The area had long been in power blackouts. Kathir Ehsan, a tourist from Singapore, who was rescued from the hotel, told bdnews24.com by phone: "I don't know what really happened. I just heard a big sound." "And I saw smoke." Firemen rescued Shrinivasan, an Indian national, from the room No. 930. Mohammad Shahjalal, director (administration) of Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence, said the explosions might have been triggered by faults with a gas pipeline. "They could also be gas cylinder explosions." bdnews24.c
