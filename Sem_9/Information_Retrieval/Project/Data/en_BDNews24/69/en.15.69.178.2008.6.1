<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club kept leaders Usha Krira Chakra in wait to taste the Premier Division Hockey League title till the last match when the black and white outfit handed a 3-2 defeat to Usha in their penultimate round Super League encounter riding on a superb hat trick from Syed Al Masum Sunday. Mohammedan, already out of the title race, dominated the match with a first-half lead at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. With the first defeat in 12 matches, the Old Dhaka outfit, Usha, stuck to their previous 33 points, five points ahead of second-placed Abahani Limited, who, however, played a match less than the leaders. Mohammedan, who went 5-3 down to Usha in their first-leg match, raised their point tally to 26 from 11 matches. Usha could have celebrated the title triumph with a match in hand had they beaten Mohammedan Sunday, but they now have to wait till their last match against Abahani on June 6. Usha can see the most coveted crown in their home if a youthful Mohammedan can produce another best to beat Abahani in their last match on Tuesday. The club cup champions, Abahani, will also have to overtake Mohammedan to see them in the title race. "We played on counter- attack and came out successful," said Mohammedan coach Barkatullah Chapal after the match. "Usha play on the basis of long passes and we blocked them successfully," Chapal said, "Usha's players looked tired and my boys did not mistake to take the advantage." Usha's Pakistani coach Jahir Ahmed blamed his forwards for failure to score and thought that his team played too many faulty passes in the half way of the game that led them to go down against the opponents. Ahmed, however, was confident of clinching the title beating Abahani in the last match. Compared with their previous 11 matches, Usha put up a poor performance as their Pakistani key player Akther Ali could not play up to the mark in the game. Syed Al Masum, a Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan student sitting for the Higher Secondary exam, drew the first blood in the 16th minute for Mohammedan with a fine reverse hit after being set by Pakistani former international Mohammad Sabbir from the right. Masum could have doubled the lead in the 21st minute, but the unmarked striker took enough time inside the box and a fellow Usha defender cleared the ball from the danger zone before Usha's Pakistani midfielder Tariq Aziz saw his goal-bound slow push to be blocked by Mohammedan defender Isa Mia. In the 30th minute, Sabbir ran down from the midfield to dodge two Usha players to get keeper Shakil alone, but he failed to beat Shakil in one-on-one situation. Usha could have levelled the margin three minutes from the break, but striker Rajon set by Habul sent the ball over the Mohammedan post to disappoint some Usha fans, who came to the stadium wearing their favourite team's jersey and playing drums. After the breather, Mohammedan's Masum and Usha's Kamal failed to find the target from close ranges before Kamal gave the Old Dhaka outfit an equaliser in the 57th minute. But, it lasted only two minutes as Masum again put Mohammedan ahead in the 59th minute, capitalising on a left side pass from Abdus Sajjad John. Masum completed his hat trick two minutes from time as the tiny striker set by Pakistan Kazim put Usha keeper Shakil past from a close range hit while Habul reduced the margin for Usha one minute from time.
