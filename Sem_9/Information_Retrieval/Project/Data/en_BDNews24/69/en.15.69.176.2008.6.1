<TEXT>
 NORTH SOUND, Antigua, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An emotional Michael Clarke wiped his brow and looked to the heavens after completing his century against West Indies on Saturday -- and there was no doubt who was on his mind as he took the applause. Clarke missed the first test win in Kingston last week because he was on compassionate leave to attend the funeral of his fiance Lara Bingle's father Graham. "It's obviously a very emotional, very special hundred for me because of what's happened over the past month for me back at home," Clarke told reporters. "I know all of my family and all of Lara's family wanted me to come over here and play and be a part of playing my first test tour in the West Indies. "Its hard being away from Lara and her family but today was obviously very special to make a century knowing that my to-be father-in-law would certainly have been proud of me." The Australia vice-captain had not played cricket in over two months, during which time he got engaged, then supported his fiance and her family as they coped with Graham Bingle's battle against cancer. In his first test as vice-captain, Clarke held together the Australia innings, with some superbly-timed shots, throughout a second day where they drove home their advantage making 479 for seven declared. "It was everything: a celebration as well, I'm so excited to score another test hundred, my first one in the Caribbean, my first one as vice-captain for Australia, and to have 470 runs on the board in the first innings," Clarke said. "Obviously there were a lot of emotions there. But a big part of it for me personally was to do it for him," he said. Clarke's ton was his seventh in test cricket and he said, given the circumstances, it was his most special. "For me personally, it is my most special hundred, no doubt. Only because of the surroundings, the reasons behind it, the work I've put in. "At home with personal stuff and for me to come out and be able to score a century with those emotions, for me it is my most special hundred." Clarke also picked up two important wickets with his left-arm wrist spin, dismissing Xavier Marshall and Runako Morton to leave West Indies at 125 for three. "If the captain keeps throwing me the ball I'll keep taking it seriously. I enjoy every opportunity I get to bowl, hopefully I'll continue to play a part during this game," Clarke added
