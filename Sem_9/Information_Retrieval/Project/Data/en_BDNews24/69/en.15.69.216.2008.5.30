 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP observed the 27th death anniversary of former president and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman Friday, with two rival factions paying tributes separately. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed paid respects to the former president by placing wreaths at the grave of Zia. The army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, navy chief Vice-Admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam and air force chief Air Marshal SM Ziaur Rahman had also been to the grave in the morning. A smart army bugle band paid homage to Zia by playing military tunes. President Iajuddin Ahmed in his message for the day described Zia as "the vanguard of Bangladesh's independence". Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui also paid their respects at the late president's grave. Speaker Sircar told reporters: "Ziaur Rahman was an exponent of multi-party democracy. He successfully initiated a lot of innovative development, which helped revitalise the national economy." "BNP will participate in the election as a unified entity. People will vote BNP to power once again." BNP leaders and supporters loyal to secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain placed wreaths at Zia's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar at 10.30am and offered prayers. Those of the pro-reform faction, led by acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, laid wreaths at the grave at 3.30 pm. Avoiding the rush, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah paid respects separately to the late president. Hannan Shah told reporters: "The BNP leaders and workers must stop pining for their lost leader and convert their mourning into strength for re-establishing democracy in the country." A voluntary blood donation programme was conducted and a milad mahfil was organised at the memorial to Zia. Local BNP leaders across the country organised food distribution for the poor and prayers marking the death anniversary. Ziaur Rahman was assassinated on May 30, 1981, at Chittagong Circuit House in 'a failed military coup'. bdnews24.com/sm
