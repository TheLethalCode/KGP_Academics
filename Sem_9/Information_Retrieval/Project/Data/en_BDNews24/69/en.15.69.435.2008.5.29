 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com) - Mohammedan Sporting Club recorded a hard-fought 2-1 win over Ajax Sporting Club in their Super League encounter of the Premier Division Hockey League at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Thursday. With seven wins in 10 matches, Mohammedan raised their point tally to 23, seven points behind leaders Usha Krira Chakra and two points less than archrivals Abahani Limited. It seemed that Mohammedan would overcome Ajax easily when the Motijheel-based outfit took a third minute lead with Jahid Bin Talib Shuvo converting a penalty corner. Afterwards, the youthful Ajax fought equally against the giants and forced them to be satisfied with a solo lead in the first half. After the breather, Ajax even levelled the margin when Nurunnabi converted a penalty corner four minutes into the second half. However, Mohammedan's players managed to leave the field with smiling faces when veteran defender Isa Mia sealed the match in the 54th minute converting a penalty corner.
