 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)In a change of mind, Bangladesh Bank has finalised a set of rules on the appointment of directors to private commercial banks from among depositors amid banks' objection, a senior official said. The central bank Thursday sent the rules to chairmen and chief executives of the banks and asked them to give opinions in a week, said Jahangir Alam, general manager of Bangladesh Bank's Banking Regulation and Policy Department. The central bank on March 13 issued a circular, asking all private banks to appoint two directors from among their depositors. The banks had objected to the circular. And central banker Salehuddin Ahmed on May 22 assured the bank owners at a meeting that they could choose independent directors to their boards. "But the banks will have to comply with certain rules and regulations in appointing independent directors," the Bangladesh Bank governor had said. Jahangir Alam told bdnews24.com Thursday that the central bank took a final decision on appointment of two directors from among depositors as there was no provision in the Banking Companies Act 1991 for any appointment of independent directors to private commercial banks in addition to 13 directors. He said the central bank would finalise appointments after the private banks sent their feedback to the rules. A depositor will have to continue transactions with the bank to become a director of any bank, the draft rules say. To qualify for the job, candidates must have graduations from a recognised university and proven track-records in their professions. Persons having higher degrees in economics, commerce and business administration will be given priority. Any director, adviser, employee or external auditor of financial institutions including banks or insurers or stock exchanges would not qualify to be directors. The directors or family members must not have more than 1 percent share in paid-up capital of the bank. He must not have any link to political parties either, according to law. Defaulters and tax-evaders will not qualify. A bank has to select two directors from among depositors and send their personal details to the central bank. The appointments will come into effect after Bangladesh Bank gave written approval to them. If the central bank thinks necessary, it may ask a bank to send more names. A director will be appointed for three years and will not be able to hold office for more than six straight years. Bangladesh Bank had earlier asked the banks to prepare a list of 25 such depositors and turn it in. The central bank will make the final selection of two directors from among the 25. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Nazrul Islam Majumder, chairman of BAB, said he was in London. He said he would comment on the issue after returning home. bdnews
