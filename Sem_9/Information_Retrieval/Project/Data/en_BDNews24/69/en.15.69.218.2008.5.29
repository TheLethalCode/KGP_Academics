<TITLE> Iraq asks creditors to cancel crippling debts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Thu May 29(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq pressed its creditors to cancel about $60 billion in debts at an international conference on Thursday, but two of its biggest lenders, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, sent only junior representatives to hear the call. The Iraqi delegation, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, basked in praise from international leaders lauding the country's economic and political development five years after the United States invaded to topple Saddam Hussein. The Stockholm conference is the first annual review of the International Compact with Iraq agreed in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh last year, which committed Iraq to implement reforms in exchange for greater international support. Maliki said the large debts -- some of which date back almost 30 years -- along with compensation payments for Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, were shackling the economy. Iraq is obliged to set aside 5 percent of its oil revenues as compensation payments, amounting to $3.5 billion this year, according to the Iraqi government. "Iraq is not a poor country. It possesses tremendous human and material resources, but the debts of Iraq ... which we inherited from the dictator, hamper the reconstruction process," Maliki told the conference. "We are looking forward to the brother countries writing off its (Iraq's) debts, which are a burden on the Iraqi government," he said, a pointed reference to Gulf states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which are Iraq's biggest Arab creditors. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were not present at Thursday's conference. Instead, Riyadh sent a junior minister of state for foreign affairs and Kuwait dispatched an under-secretary responsible for international organizations. A member of the Iraqi delegation told Reuters they were disappointed by the foreign ministers' absence. Some analysts have said Sunni Arab countries in the Gulf and across the Middle East have kept Iraq at arm's length since the fall of Saddam over concerns of a powerful Shi'ite-led country in their midst. A recent report to the U.S. Congress said the Gulf states, which supported Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, were resisting writing off Iraq's debts. About $66.5 billion of Iraq's $120.2 billion foreign debt has been forgiven, according to State Department estimates. More than half of the outstanding debt is owed to Gulf Arab states, mainly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Arab League chief Amr Moussa backed Maliki's call, noting that 39 countries had already offered Iraq debt relief. "I call upon everybody, including the Arab countries, to accelerate this issue," Moussa said. Maliki made a similar debt relief call at a conference of Iraq's neighbors in Kuwait in April, with Iraqi officials noting at the time that while many of Iraq's major creditors had cancelled its debts, its Arab neighbors had not followed suit. UN LAUDS PROGRESS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged the international community to engage with Iraq and for its neighbors to reopen embassies. No ambassador from an Arab nation has been stationed permanently in Baghdad since 2005. Opening the conference, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the Iraqi government for making "notable progress" in meeting economic, political and security benchmarks set at last year's conference in Egypt. "If we had to use one word to describe the situation in Iraq today I would choose ... hope," he said. "There is new hope that the people and government of Iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country." While security has improved in Iraq, with U.S. officials saying violence is at a four-year low, the situation is still fragile. A suicide bomber killed 16 people near a police recruiting station in northern Iraq on Thursday. Political progress in Iraq has also been slow, with national reconciliation mired in sectarian tensions between Iraq's Shia and Sunni sects. The main Sunni Arab political bloc, which quit the government in August, said on Wednesday it suspended talks to rejoin Maliki's Shia-led administration after a disagreement over a cabinet post. Maliki told the conference his government was pushing ahead with plans to hold provincial elections in October, despite the top US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, saying last week that November was a more likely date. Washington sees the elections as critical to bringing minority Sunni Arabs into the political process and easing sectarian tensions that pushed the country to civil war in 2006. Maliki said Iraq, which has the world's third biggest oil reserves, planned to raise exports to 3.5 million bpd, up from 1.84 million in April. He gave no timeframe for that target
