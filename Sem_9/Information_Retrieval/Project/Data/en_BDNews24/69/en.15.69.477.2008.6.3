 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)The north-east and middle zones in the country may experience moderate flooding towards the end of June due to excessive rainfall, said the June weather forecast issued Monday by the meteorological department. It may rain through the month of June excessively across the country, as a result of which the north-east and middle regions might see moderate flooding towards end-June, the monthly forecast said. A depression or two may brew in the Bay during the period. The forecast said the monsoons are likely to set in countrywide by Saturday. Sujit Kumar Devsharma, chief meteorologist of the meteorological department, told bdnews24.com Monday that the monsoon winds have already touched the Chittagong coasts, which may reach the middle regions within the following three-four days. The light westerlies interacting with the easterlies caused heavy precipitation in the capital and a number of other places across the country. Many areas in Dhaka city went under water as it rained torrentially for hours causing immense distress to the commuters negotiating any distances. Many automobiles were seen abandoned and standing on the roads everywhere and it took people hours to reach their destinations. The weather office said Dhaka city had about 85 mm rainfall in 12 hours starting 6 am to 6 pm. The same for Sylhet was recorded to be 24 mm, 54 at Srimangal, 46 at Bogra, 56 at Maijdi Court and 10 in Chittagong. Tuesday may see light to medium to medium-heavy rainfall at places across the country, the forecast said. May in 2008 saw less rains than usual, as the frequency of western lows traversing Bangladesh was low this year, resulting in mild to medium heat waves. The highest temperature recorded in the country in May was about 39 degrees Celcius at Rangamati. bdn
