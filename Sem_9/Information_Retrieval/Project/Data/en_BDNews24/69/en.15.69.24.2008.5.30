 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Time runs out for re-registration of mobile phone SIM cards bought before Feb 28, 2006. The mobile phone users, failing to sign up again by the deadline, will face disconnections, starting Saturday midnight, Md Rezaul Quader, director (systems and services) of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, told bdnews24.com. "It's a BTRC decision." Mujibur Rahman, managing director of state-run mobile phone operator Teletalk, said responses of users to re-registration were satisfactory. As of Thursday, 78 percent of Teletalk users filled out re-registration forms. Rahman hoped that 12 percent more would sign up by Sunday. All Teletalk re-registration points were open Friday. Teletalk users will be able to re-register their SIM cards until 8.00pm Saturday. "Re-registration points will be kept open even longer if necessary," he said. The Teletalk official said the company would submit a report to the telecoms regulator. On August 16 last year, BTRC asked mobile phone operators to take steps for re-registration of the SIM cards sold before February 28, 2006. BTRC had extended the deadline four times. "Users had crowed the re-registration points at the eleventh hour," Syed Yamin Bakht, director (public relations) of the country's largest mobile operator Grameenphone, told bdnews24.com. Sulayman Alam, head of public relations and information of Banglalink, said the company employed additional employees for re-registration. According to the latest estimate by BTRC, the number of mobile phone users in Bangladesh is 4.34 crore, with Grameenphone having the highest at 1.80 crore. Banglalink comes second at 86 lakh subscribers, followed by Aktel at 75 lakh, Citycell at 16 lakh, Warid Telecom at 29 lakh and Teletalk at 9 lakh. bdnews
