<TITLE> Oil falls as US Fed warns on inflation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON Tue Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell by around $2 a barrel to $126 a barrel on Tuesday, after the US Federal Reserve issued a rare warning on the inflationary risk posed by a weak dollar. US crude was down $1.78 at $125.98 a barrel by 1502 GMT after earlier hitting a session low of $125.65. London Brent crude fell $1.72 to $126.30 a barrel. One of the factors driving investment in commodities this year has been the weakness of the US currency, which encourages the buying of dollar-denominated commodities as a hedge against inflation. "(Federal Reserve Chairman Ben) Bernanke seems more concerned about inflation than growth and for the first time that I remember he brings the weak dollar into the macro picture by linking rising import costs -- inflationary -- to the front page," said Tom Sowanick of Clearbrook Financial. Some analysts say oil's rapid rise of about 30 percent since the start of the year had a speculative element. That was the view of influential hedge fund manager George Soros. "We are currently experiencing the bursting of a housing bubble and, at the same time, a rise in oil and other commodities which has some of the earmarks of a bubble," Soros said in prepared testimony before the U.S. Senate. "To be sure a crash in oil markets is not imminent." Analysts said there was mounting evidence demand for oil was easing and expectations that Asian economies, which have led growth in fuel consumption, will slash subsidies because they have become too costly. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan have already announced cuts to subsidies, while Malaysia said it would scrap fuel price controls in August in a move that could double pump prices. India was also expected to raise fuel prices on Wednesday. "The high oil price will clearly be more keenly felt by the end-consumer without these subsidies," said Tom Nelson, an analyst for the Guinness Global Energy Fund, which takes long-only positions in oil and gas firms. "It's difficult to ascertain the demand destruction this could lead to," he said. The head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told Reuters on Monday that world oil demand was shrinking more quickly than first thought and the IEA might cut its demand growth forecasts further. Most of that decline in demand has so far been in developed economies as sharp price rises bite for consumers and industry. "Demand figures are falling fast in Europe. We're seeing things cooling down," one broker said. "There are some big numbers being taken out of the market." More evidence on the state of supply and demand will emerge with the release of U.S. weekly stocks data on Wednesday. A preliminary poll showed analysts expected US crude oil inventories would have risen by 1.1 million barrels last week, gasoline stocks up by 600,000 barrels and distillates up 1.4 million barrels
