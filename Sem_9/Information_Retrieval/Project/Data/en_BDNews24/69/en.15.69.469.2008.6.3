<TITLE> Lehman mulls capital raising as one option </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Tue Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc has no need to raise capital and would only do so if the right market opportunity presented itself or if the firm thought it would help investor perceptions, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. The source said a move to raise capital was only one of "dozens" of options for the bank. Lehman Brothers spokeswoman Kerrie Cohen declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that said Lehman was considering raising billions of dollars in fresh capital. The newspaper cited analysts and Wall Street executives as saying Lehman was likely to seek $3 billion to $4 billion in additional capital. The plans suggest the investment bank will post a deeper loss than the $300 million that various analysts have been expecting, the newspaper said. Lehman may issue common stock, diluting current shareholdings, and will probably reveal its capital plans when it reports quarterly results the week of June 16, the WSJ said. Lehman's market value is about $18.7 billion, based on Monday's closing stock price of $33.83, Reuters data shows. Lehman shares, which on Monday fell 8.1 percent to close at $33.83, their lowest level since the bank's stock swooned in March amid panic over the meltdown of rival Bear Stearns Cos, were little changed in premarket electronic trading after initially falling about 3 percent. Lehman shares have nearly halved this year
