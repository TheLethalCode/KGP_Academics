<TITLE> US 'dismayed' more Russian troops sent to Abkhazia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, June 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Sunday expressed dismay over the deployment of additional Russian troops to Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, adding that it has addressed its concern to Moscow. Georgia accused Moscow of trying to annex the impoverished Black Sea region after Russia sent unarmed troops on Saturday to rebuild a railway in Abkhazia. Russia called the deployment "humanitarian aid." "The United States is dismayed by Russia's Defense Ministry announcement on May 31 that it intends to send more military forces, including railroad construction troops, into the Georgian region of Abkhazia without the consent of the Georgian government," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement. "We have expressed our concerns to the Russian government and are in touch with the Georgian government about this latest announcement of a Russian military buildup," McCormack said. McCormack said Russia's move was particularly difficult to understand in light of Georgia's statement to the U.N. Security Council last week that it had halted reconnaissance flights over Abkhazia. Georgia said on Friday it had stopped flights by pilotless drones over Abkhazia to quell Western fears that tensions between Tbilisi and Moscow could degenerate into war.
