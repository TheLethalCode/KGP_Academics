<TEXT>
 PARIS, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number two Ana Ivanovic recovered from an error-filled first set to beat Dane Caroline Wozniacki 6-4 6-1 and book her place in the last 16 of the French Open on Friday. The Serb, a finalist at Roland Garros last year, will meet Petra Cetkovska for a quarter-final spot after the Czech beat compatriot Iveta Benesova 6-3 6-3. Initially it looked like Ivanovic would roll over the 30th seed when she broke in the first game but the Serb was also struggling on her serve. Despite dropping serve twice in the opener, the second seed took command of the contest after 52 minutes by breaking for the third time in the set. Ivanovic showed signs of frustration on Centre Court but relied on her sharp forehand to break Wozniacki's resilience. Once the world number two broke the Dane's serve in the third game of the second set, she never looked back. Ivanovic piled on the pressure from then on, breaking again with one of her 19 forehand winners, before wrapping up victory on her first match point after 89 minutes. Ivanovic's path to the semis was also made easier on Friday when fifth seed Serena Williams, the only former women's champion in Paris, was knocked out by Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik
