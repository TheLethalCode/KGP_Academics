 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board has recorded an 8.4 percent rise in revenue year-on-year in July-April of the current fiscal year, said the chief adviser's special assistant MA Malek Saturday. Revenue rose to Tk 1,303 crore in 10 months from last year's Tk 1,202 crore, Malek told reporters at the Telecom Bhaban. Malek, who oversees the post and telecommunications ministry, said total revenue earned so far was two-thirds of the yearly target of Tk 1,987 crore. He hoped the state-run mobile phone operator would be able to reach its target by the end of the fiscal year. Referring to the expansion of mobile telephony in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Malek said equipment for digital exchanges for three hill districts would cost the government Tk 109 crore. "The government will now be able to save the money and increase revenue through mobile phone connections," he said. He said the landline connection system was made easier because of increasing demand to run fax. "We have to survive through better services in the competitive market," Malek said. The CA's special assistant said the authorities would launch video-on-demand service soon. "Through the services, a user will be able to watch television on mobile phone screen." He said the internet network would be extended to villages. At present, 10.3 percent of the population uses the internet. Asked if the government would lay off employees from the BTTB as it was in transit to becoming into a public limited company, Malek said; "There was no plan like this." bdnew
