<TITLE> Hayden to miss rest of Windies tour </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Antigua, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Opening batsman Matthew Hayden will miss the rest of Australia's tour of the Caribbean due to injury. Hayden, who was sidelined for the first-Test win over West Indies in Jamaica, had been expected to return for the second match in Antigua which starts on Friday but team physio Alex Kountouris said he would be sent home. "Matthew Hayden's right Achilles tendon injury has not made sufficient progress ... and as such he will not be able to participate in the second test and was highly unlikely to be available for the third test," Kountouris told reporters on Wednesday. "With the large volume of cricket to be played over the next 18 months it was decided he should return to Australia to undergo rehabilitation and consult specialists. This means he will (also) not be available for the five one-day internationals against West Indies." HODGE STAYING With Hayden going home, Brad Hodge will stay with the test squad and Cricket Australia will make a decision later on who will replace the hard-hitting opener in the one-day squad. Michael Clarke, who missed the victory at Sabina Park as he was on compassionate leave, will be available for the second test, with Hodge or Simon Katich standing down. Australia won the first test by 95 runs but West Indies are hoping to be back to full strength for the second game in the three-match series. Captain Chris Gayle could return from his groin injury while pace bowler Jerome Taylor is almost certain to come into the side for off-spinner Amit Jaggernauth, who has been left out. Left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn is in the squad but may have to settle for 12th man duties. Australia have won 12 of their last 13 tests against West Indies
