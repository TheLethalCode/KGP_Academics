<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)- The BNP pro-reform faction acting secretary general, Hafizuddin Ahmed, said Friday he had waited for an invitation from the other faction of the divided party to place wreaths the grave of the late president Ziaur Rahman together. Hafiz placed wreaths in the afternoon, along with members of his faction. He told reporters: "We want an honourable unity. I don't need any post. I want to work as a member of the party." More than 100 workers, including 15 former lawmakers, came to Zia's grave amid police protection. After laying wreaths, Hafiz said prayers. A seemingly sad Hafizuddin said, "We hoped to show respects to the late leader together. I had waited since morning. It is sad, but true, that we got no response from the other side. So we came in the afternoon." Hafiz expressed hope about unity in the party and said: "BNP shall be united. The unity of the party cannot be stalled for an individual." The acting secretary general nominated by the party standing committee said: "In different districts, our leaders and former lawmakers are being expelled unconstitutionally. But the party constitution did not give power to anybody except for chairperson Khaleda Zia to expel anybody from the party." Hafiz said: "Shahid Zia was a propagator of multi-party democracy. He did politics of development." Earlier in the day, BNP leaders and workers led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain, leader of the other faction, placed wreaths and offered prayers at the grave of Zia. bdnews24
