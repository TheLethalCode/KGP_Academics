<TITLE> Terry goal leads England to 2-0 win over United States </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - John Terry bounced back from his traumatic penalty miss in last week's Champions League final to score England's opening goal in their 2-0 win over the United States in a friendly international at Wembley on Wednesday. Although the goal was no real consolation for the nightmare he suffered in Moscow when his penalty miss cost Chelsea the chance of becoming European champions, it was hugely celebrated by his team mates and the crowd alike. Steven Gerrard added England's second after 59 minutes to give Fabio Capello his second win in his third match as England boss. But overall the two teams provided little quality entertainment for the 71,000 crowd although the second half was a vast improvement on a woeful opening 45 minutes. Terry, captain for the night as Capello rotates his candidates for the armband before deciding on his permanent choice, had a masterful game at the centre of defence alongside Rio Ferdinand and capped his performance with the opening goal after 38 minutes. It was his first goal for England since he scored in their first international at the new Wembley against Brazil almost exactly a year ago. He was the first to react to a well-flighted free kick from David Beckham, winning his 101st cap, and headed down powerfully, ironically from close to the penalty spot, leaving U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard helpless to save it. England raised the tempo after halftime and thoroughly deserved their second goal. The strike came a minute after Gareth Barry replaced Frank Lampard, and Barry, who could be a team mate of Gerrard at Liverpool next season, provided the final through pass for Gerrard. He timed his run perfectly, and then slid in a low angled shot that gave substitute goalkeeeper Brad Guzan no chance. Barry's inclusion on the left gave the England midfield more balance and bite and Jermain Defoe had two good scoring chances and Wayne Rooney another as England continued to dominate the match, restricting the visitors to a few isolated breaks that came to nothing. England, who have failed to qualify for Euro 2008, travel to Trinidad & Tobago on Thursday for their final international of the season on Sunday while the U.S. play friendlies against Spain and Argentina before beginning their World Cup qualifying campaign against Barbados in California on June 15
