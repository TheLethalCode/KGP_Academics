<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to form coordination committees in districts to build public-private partnership for better management of water bodies. The district committees will make an inventory of the water bodies, owned by the government, in one month. The decision was taken at a recent meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, according to a statement issued by the press wing of the CA's office. The meeting chaired by commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman also decided that it would ask the fisheries and livestock ministry to conduct studies on leasing policy and recommend a good model for the water bodies. The meeting stressed that the leasing of the water bodies should be for a medium-term so that the leased property could be used as a "bankable instrument", the statement said. The leasing of public water bodies is considered one of the issues of conflicts among powerful political cliques across the country. Fisheries are the second largest source of foreign revenue earnings, but many fishermen are "deprived of access to public water bodies" which are leased out, the statement said. Acting chairman of Regulatory Reforms Commission Muyeed Chowdhury, secretaries to the relevant ministries, Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation chairman Syed Mahmudul Huq and CEO of Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute MA Taslim attended the meeting. bdn
