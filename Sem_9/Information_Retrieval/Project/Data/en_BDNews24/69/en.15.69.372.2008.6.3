<TITLE> Israel's Olmert begins US visit under cloud </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Tue Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert began a three-day visit to Washington on Tuesday, under criminal investigation back home in a corruption scandal that is casting a shadow over US-brokered talks with the Palestinians. Breaking with his usual practice, Olmert did not hold a question-and-answer session with reporters on his plane during an overnight flight from Tel Aviv. Olmert, due to see President George W Bush in the White House on Wednesday, has rebuffed calls that he step aside after a US businessman testified that he gave the veteran Israeli politician $150,000 in cash and in unpaid loans. Both Olmert, who has described the money as legitimate election campaign contributions, and the New York-based fund-raiser, have denied any wrongdoing. The political crisis enveloping Olmert could trigger an early election and derail the peace talks, Israeli, Palestinian and Western officials say. Olmert says he will resign if indicted. Olmert kicks off his Washington visit with talks later on Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and an evening address to a policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group. Israeli officials had spoken before the trip of Olmert's plans to meet Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Democratic contenders Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. But one of the officials said after Olmert's arrival that no such meetings had been finalized. PEACE TALKS Olmert held talks in Jerusalem on Monday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has been politically weakened by the takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas Islamists last June. Officials said Olmert's strategy was to push ahead with negotiations with the Palestinians, as well as indirect talks with Syria, as if nothing has changed in the hope the police investigation does not end in charges against him. "This process will continue," Olmert's spokesman, Mark Regev said of the talks with the Palestinians. Regev said that Olmert recommitted himself during the meeting to trying to reach a deal on Palestinian statehood by the end of the year, before Bush leaves office. The statehood talks have shown few signs of progress. Before embarking for the United States, Olmert said he would discuss in Washington issues at the core of Israel's existence, an indirect reference to Iran's uranium enrichment program, which he has termed a threat to the Jewish state's survival. He and Bush met just last month, during the president's visit to Israel to celebrate its 60th anniversary. Iran has rejected US and Western allegations that it is seeking to build atomic weapons and said its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity. In an unsourced report, Israel's biggest newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, said Bush would offer Olmert a "farewell gift" -- a security package, including an advanced radar system that will enhance the country's defense against long-range missiles. The newspaper said Olmert would ask the president to allow Israel to buy the F-22 stealth fighter, an aircraft that has not been cleared for overseas sale. Olmert is scheduled to dine with Vice President Dick Cheney on Wednesday and to meet Congressional leaders on Thursday before flying home
