 Dhaka, June 1(bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court reset a hearing for June 5 to begin framing charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the Niko scam case. Special judge Amar Kumar Roy set the date Sunday after defence lawyers filed a motion with the Special Judge's Court-2, sited on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, seeking more time to prepare for the case. The lawyers claimed that they had not received the required case documents. The judge said he would also give a ruling on a bail plea on June 5. Hasina was brought from special jail to court around 10am, when two other accused in the caseformer energy secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury and former state minister Rafiqul Islamwere also present there. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia also appeared in court, for the first time since she was arrested and sent to jail last year, in a separate but similar case involving Canadian oil and gas firm Niko Resources Ltd. bdnews24
