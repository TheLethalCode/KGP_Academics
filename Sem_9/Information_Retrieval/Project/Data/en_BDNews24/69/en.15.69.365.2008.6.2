 Islamabad, June 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/BBC)  At least eight people have been killed in a car bomb attack near the Danish embassy in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, according to reports. More than a dozen people were wounded in the midday blast. Reuters said, citing police and hospital officials, a suspected suicide bomber blew up a car outside the Danish embassy in the Pakistani capital on Monday killing six people and wounding about 20. Reuters initial report said, a bomb went off outside the Danish embassy in the Pakistani capital on Monday killed at least four people and wounded several others. The blast destroyed the embassy gate and damaged the building and vehicles in the compound in the up-market district of Islamabad where other missions and diplomats houses are located. "Four people have been killed, there are no foreigners among them," said a security official at the scene. "It seems it was a car bomb," said the official, who declined to be identified. The blast left a crater about three feet deep on the road outside the mission. BBC report said, TV pictures showed extensive damage to the embassy building and several vehicles outside, and a large crater left behind by the blast. It was not clear who carried out the attack, as Pakistan's main militant group recently declared a ceasefire. Pakistan's top Taleban warlord Baitullah Mehsud is in peace talks with the authorities in an attempt to end fighting in the country's north-west. The blast will raise fresh questions about the safety of foreigners in Pakistan, even though militant attacks have dropped off since a new government came to power after a February general election vowing to negotiate to end violence. Danish newspapers infuriated Muslims around the world when they published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in late 2005. The cartoons, considered blasphemous by Muslims, sparked deadly protests and attacks on Danish missions. The embassy in Islamabad was temporarily shut in 2006 after violent protests over the cartoons. There was no claim of responsibility but residents of the neighborhood said they had feared an attack on the mission. "Since the printing of cartoons, we always had this fear," said Sana Khalid, a woman living in the area. "But what they did to our religion, they deserve it." The blast, which came just after 1 p.m. (0700 GMT), destroyed the embassy gate and damaged the front of the building and vehicles in the compound in the upmarket district of Islamabad where other missions and diplomats' houses are located. Police and security officials said all of the dead and wounded were Pakistanis and the bomb was suspected to have been set off by a suicide bomber in a car. The blast left a crater about three feet (one meter) deep on the road outside the mission. A car engine was lying about 30 feet from the crater. The bomb caused extensive damage to nearby buildings and vehicles. A Pakistani guard lay dead at the gate while men hauled blood-drenched wounded into ambulances. Pakistan's main stock index ended higher in low volume despite the blast and dealers said trade in the rupee, which ended for the day just after news of the blast, was not affected. "IT'S DANGEROUS" Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller condemned the attack, adding that a Pakistani employee of the embassy, a cleaner, had been killed and three other Pakistani employees wounded. No Danes died, he said. "It's terrible that terrorists commit such acts," he said in an interview on Danish television station TV2 News. "We already were working under a higher security level in Pakistan ... It's dangerous," he said, adding Denmark was reviewing security at all its embassies. Windows were broken in the nearby home of the Indian High Commissioner. Pakistani authorities said they were stepping up security at embassies and police were on alert in other cities. Pakistan went through a wave of suicide bombings in the second half of 2007 and early this year but most of the attacks were on the Pakistani security forces and politicians, including former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, killed in a December 27 attack. Attacks on foreigners have been rare since several in 2002, but a blast at an Italian restaurant in Islamabad in March killed a Turkish woman and wounded several other foreigners, including some U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. The new government has opened talks with militants through intermediaries. But the talks have raised questions in the United States and among some of Pakistan's other allies, who fear peace deals in Pakistan will free up Taliban and al Qaeda militants to intensify their war against Western troops in Afghanistan. The blast coincided with an anti-cartoon rally in the city of Multan attended by about 200 people. After hearing news of the blast, the protesters shouted "Allahu Akbar" (God is greatest). "Whoever commits blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammad will face more serious consequences than this," said city cleric Intizar Hussain. "If it is a suicide attack, then whoever did it will go to heaven." bd
