<TITLE> Wall Street jobs cuts may only hit 25,000: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New York City's financial sector might only slice 15,000 to 25,000 jobs in the current downturn, which could prove shorter than the mayor has predicted, the city comptroller said on Thursday.

The current job-losing cycle began in August 2007 and should run through March 2009, the Democrat added.
