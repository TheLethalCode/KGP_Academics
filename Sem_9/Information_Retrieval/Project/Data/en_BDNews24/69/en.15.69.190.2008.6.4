 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia said Wednesday the government dialogue with political parties was a "stage-managed drama". The BNP chairperson alleged that the caretaker administration was plotting a repeat of the 1986 election.

Talks are a stage-managed drama," Khaleda said in a special judge's court on the Jatiya Sangsad complex, during a hearing into charges against her in the GATCO scam case. Khaleda said the government created a situation to bar prominent political parties from contesting the polls.

The cases are false," she said. The former prime minister said: "I did no wrong. I worked for the country. I want justice. Please make an arrangement to hold the trial in an open court." Khaleda alleged that her two sons had been tortured in jail. In her 18-minute speech before judge Shahed Nuruddin, Khaleda demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency by the end of June and the election by October. "Why is the state of emergency been still in force, when the caretaker government is so popular?" she asked. She termed the proceeding of the case against her in the special court as an 'in-camera trial'. "Judges are not free. They have to do what they are asked to," she said in criticism of the judiciary, which promoting the judge to oppose the statement. "No. You are not right. Nothing was imposed on us. I am free," the judge said. Terming the 1/11 as part of a conspiracy against the country, Khaleda said: "Some greedy people made 1/11 happen. It is now clear to the nation. My family is ruined." "The people involved in the incident were not worried about the country and its people at all." "Nobody would be successful with their conspiracies. They will only cause us pain for some time," she said. Khaleda drew attention of the court to the detention of her two sons saying they having been languishing in jail for nine months without trial.
