 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka stocks closed lower Monday after three days of gains amid a massive index correction with prices of majors in banks and pharmaceuticals going down. Despite the fall in indices, market analysts termed the day's trading normal. Banks that had gone up substantially recently induced huge sell-offs by investors to lock in profits, analyst Yaweer Sayeed told bdnews24.com. The turnover board consisted of a mixed portfolio of banks, non-bank financial institution, pharmaceuticals, insurance, textile which indicates investor confidence in the market, he added. "It also shows trading was quite healthy," said Sayeed, CEO of AIMS of Bangladesh. Speaking on a note of the state of market, he said higher demand in the wake of poor supply of scrips led the market to overheat. "The market is overheated for quite some time. There is huge demand for shares. What is happening is, too much money is running after too few shares," said the top official of the private asset management company.
