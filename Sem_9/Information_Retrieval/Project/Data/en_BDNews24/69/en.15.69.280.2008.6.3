 WILMINGTON, Delaware, Tue Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - General Motors Corp on Tuesday announced a series of steps to cut jobs, costs and its exposure to slow-selling trucks and SUVs in response to a rise in gasoline prices that the automaker now sees as permanent. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, speaking to reporters after a restructuring plan was approved by the automaker's board, said GM would close four North American truck plants and add shifts at two plants making more popular car models. In addition, Wagoner said GM was reviewing the Hummer brand and could sell the military-derived SUV brand, which has become synonymous for gas-guzzling excess. "U.S. economic and market conditions have become significantly more difficult," Wagoner said, adding higher gasoline prices have caused consumers to swap out of trucks and SUVs faster than the automaker had expected. In a related shift, Wagoner also said GM's board had approved funding for a next-generation compact model for the Chevrolet brand as well as a new subcompact Chevy Aveo, expected to go on sale in the U.S. market in 2010. GM's board also allocated production funding to the Chevy Volt, a heavily touted, all-electric vehicle that GM expects to have in showrooms by 2010, Wagoner said. GM shares, which have lost almost 60 percent since their peak in October last year, were up about 1 percent in premarket trading. Wagoner said GM, which has lost a combined $51 billion over the past three years, was not ready to detail a timeline for returning to profitability. Some analysts questioned whether the embattled automaker had moved too slowly, particularly with regard to weighing its options for Hummer. "Unfortunately, it's just a sign that once again they're behind the curve," said Peter Jankovskis, a chief investment officer with OakBrook Investments, which owns GM shares in some of its portfolios. "If they were looking to sell the Hummer brand, the more sensible thing would have been to do it three years ago. They're not going to get anything for it. Just in terms of timing, it's a very poor example," he said
