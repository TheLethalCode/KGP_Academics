<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) The caretaker administration is considering a number of alternative schemes to reduce traffic jams in the capital, with a mass transit system high on the agenda. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed attended a meeting at the Old Airport in Tejgaon Thursday, where he was brought up to date with the latest proposals. "A number of short term-initiatives have been taken to reduce traffic jams in Dhaka," said the chief adviser. "A mass transit system for Dhaka is also being considered to assist in transporting large numbers of people at the same time," he said. The chief adviser said a recent meeting of the council of advisers had accepted the Strategic Transport Plan. One of the proposed projects is a link-road between Tejgaon Old Airport and Rokeya Sarani, which Fakhruddin said would be implemented soon. "I hope it will be completed before the deadline. The coordinated development project in the Hatirjheel area, including Begunbari khan, is also important from an environmental point of view." The chief adviser went on to say work on the link road between Zia Colony and Mirpur Cantonment is progressing well. He was also hopeful that a proposed bridge on the GulshanBanani Lake would further mitigate traffic jams in the capital. Fakhruddin stressed the need to improve the traffic signalling and management system throughout the capital. "We will succeed in making a qualitative improvement in the traffic management of the capital," he said. Also attending the meeting was local government, rural development and cooperation adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal, who blamed unchecked and unplanned urbanisation for the state of Dhaka's road system. He said 1.21 lakh new vehicles are coming on to the roads every year, which is exacerbating a situation already worsened by old and unfit vehicles not being removed. "Bus routes in the capital need to be minimised, and private buses brought under recognised companies," said Iqbal. Dr Md Shamsul Haque, from BUET, appraised the chief adviser of several projects currently being considered to improve the traffic situation. "If 10 of the projects are implemented the traffic jams would ease. However, long term projects are necessary to remove traffic jams throughout the country. This requires time and money," said Haque. "We can only save Dhaka by implementing long term projects," he added. The 2.6 kilometres Airport-Rokeya Sarani Link Road is estimated to cost Tk 2492.57 lakh, and will be 53 feet wide. The meeting was told the construction of the road would end in December this year. bdnews
