<TITLE> Myanmar warned over forcing cyclone survivors home </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Yangon, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar must stop forcing cyclone survivors to return to their shattered homes where they face more misery or even death, rights groups said on Saturday, as a US official accused the junta of being "deaf and dumb" to foreign aid pleas. The former Burma's junta started evicting destitute families from government-run cyclone relief centers on Friday, apparently fearing the 'tented villages' might become permanent. "It's unconscionable for Burma's generals to force cyclone victims back to their devastated homes," Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. "Claiming a return to 'normalcy' is no basis for returning people to greater misery and possible death," he added. Myanmar has said the rescue and relief effort is largely over and it is focused on reconstruction, but the United Nations has said the scale of the devastation means the relief phase after Cyclone Nargis struck on May 2 is likely to last six months. In some of the bluntest comments by Washington on Myanmar's response to the cyclone, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said tens of thousands had died due to the military government's refusal to allow foreign aid. Nearly a week after junta leader Than Shwe promised to allow in "all" legitimate foreign aid workers, 45 remaining U.N. visa requests had been approved on Wednesday, but red tape is still hampering access to the Irrawaddy delta. U.S. and other Western naval ships cruising nearby have also not been allowed to deliver aid directly to the devastated areas. Locals and aid workers said on Friday 39 camps in the immediate vicinity of Kyauktan, 30 km (20 miles) south of Yangon, were being cleared as part of a general eviction plan. "We knew we had to go at some point but we had hoped for more support," 21-year-old trishaw driver Kyaw Moe Thu said as he trudged out of the camp with his five brothers and sisters. They had been given 20 bamboo poles and some tarpaulins to help rebuild their lives in the Irrawaddy delta, where 134,000 people were left dead or missing by Cyclone Nargis on May 2. A government official said at one camp where people had been told to clear out at short notice that it was for their own good. "It is better that they move to their homes where they are more stable," the official said. "Here, they are relying on donations and it is not stable." GENERAL SHWE SHARS "JOYS AND SORROW" The United Nations could not confirm rumors that the evictions were occurring in state-run camps across the delta, but U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe told reporters in New York "any forced or coerced movement of people is unacceptable." The evictions come after official media in the former Burma lashed out this week at offers of foreign aid, criticizing donors' demands for access to the delta and saying cyclone victims could "stand by themselves". "The people from Irrawaddy can survive on self-reliance without chocolate bars donated by foreign countries," the Kyemon newspaper said in a Burmese-language editorial. The media is believed to reflect the thinking of the top generals, who until now have shown signs of grudging acceptance of outside assistance after the cyclone. Official papers on Saturday carried a commentary on a trip by Senior General Than Shwe to the delta area. "The image of the Senior General, who continued the trip even in the untoward hours and shared joys and sorrows with local people, will always be on the mind of the local people," it said. The English-language New Light of Myanmar showed photographs of Shwe comforting cyclone victims, including one besides neat looking rows of tents it said were in a relief camp in Pyapon. CONTRAST WITH ACEH AND BANGLADESH In Singapore, visiting U.S. defense minister Gates contrasted Myanmar's reluctance to accept aid from the U.S. military with the willingness of Indonesia and Bangladesh to accept help after the 2004 tsunami in Aceh and a fierce cyclone which struck Bangladesh last November. "With Burma, the situation has been very different -- at a cost of tens of thousands of lives," Gates told an annual gathering of Asian security and defense officials. Gates said Washington had tried as many as 15 times to get the junta to accept more aid in the current crisis. "It has not been us that have been deaf and dumb in response to the pleas of the international community but the government in Myanmar," he said, referring to international pleas to allow in more foreign aid and relief workers. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the conference that the junta were wary of admitting foreign aid workers because it would show they were not capable of handling the disaster. Four weeks after the disaster, the United Nations says fewer than half of the 2.4 million people affected have received help from the government, or international or local aid groups.
