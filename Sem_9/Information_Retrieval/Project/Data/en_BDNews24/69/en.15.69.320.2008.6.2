At least two explosions were heard from outside the hotel, but the police do not have clear details on the nature of the incidents. According to initial details, a 43-year-old Sri Lankan national, AR Samantilak, was among the injured. The police linked the injuries to the explosions. Reporters saw shards of glass scattered on the road, with a long stretch blocked by the police and other security officials. The area was in power blackouts. Kathir Ehsan, a tourist from Singapore, who was rescued from the hotel, told bdnews24.com: "I don't know what really happened. I just heard a big sound." "And I saw smoke." Firemen rescued Shrinivasan, an Indian national, from the room No. 930. Major Mahbub Islam of the Paltan army camp, close to the hotel, told bdnews24.com: "It may be a gas pipeline explosion triggered by a burning cigarette."
