 Nepal, may 29 (bdnews24.com/Nepal Times)--The 240-year-old discredited institution of monarchy will be read only in the pages of history from now on after the historic first meeting of the Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic today. As planned, the first CA meet late tonight decided to implement the republican agenda with an overwhelming majority of the Assembly members. Out of the 564 members present in the meeting, 560 went in favour of declaring the country a federal democratic republic, while only four members of the RPP-Nepal voted against it. Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula, on behalf of PM Girija Prasad Koirala, had tabled the motion in the meeting chaired by the eldest CA member, Kul Bahadur Gurung, for the implementation of republic passed by the interim parliament last year. "This first meeting of the CA declares that Nepal is officially converted into a federal democratic republic from today. Nepal shall remain sovereign, independent and integrated, secular and inclusive," the proposal tabled by the cabinet said. As the agenda of republic has been implemented with due legitimate process, all the constitutional, legal and administrative provisions that contradict this declaration shall be scrapped, said the proposal. The government proposal stated that all special legal, cultural, social and traditional privileges, rights, honour and facilities the former king and his family used to enjoy in the past shall be automatically scrapped. The cabinet also tabled a bill to amend the interim constitution to incorporate the provision of president. But the government will present another bill regarding the power, duties and responsibilities of the president in the next session of the CA scheduled for June 6 after the parties failed to agree on the issue today. The first CA meet also observed two-minute's silence to pay tributes to the martyrs of democratic movement and it decided to mark Jestha 15 (May 28) as the Republic Day from next year. The CA meet also passed the proposal to convert Narayanhiti Palace, its heritage and property into a national museum. Chairman of the meeting ordered the government to scrap the former king's personal secretariat within 15 days and protect the property within the palace. PM Koirala thanked the people and the international community for extending their support to conduct the CA polls. "We came to this stage overcoming all obstacles. We can also gain achievement if we move ahead together," Koirala said, adding: "Today is the day which fulfilled our long-cherished dream." The CA meet scheduled to take place at 11 am was delayed after the leaders of the major political parties failed to reach a consensus on the powers of the president. Chairman Gurung also read out a statement from India's Lok Sabha Speaker Somanth Chatarjee who congratulated Nepali people for the successful formation of the Constituent Assembly and hoped for the success of the CA in writing a new constitution
