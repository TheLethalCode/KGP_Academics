 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)The person who was in charge of the security of Hotel Orchard Plaza in Dhaka died Monday after he was injured in overnight explosions. Ali Azam Ahmed died while undergoing treatment at City Hospital in the city. Police and officials of the Fire Service and Civil Defence believe the explosions had occurred because of gas leaks at Orchard Plaza. Police have formed a three-member committee to investigate the incident with DMP additional police commissioner Abdus Salam as its head. A member from the Police Headquarters and a RAB official are also on the committee. The committee has been asked to submit its report within seven days. Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told reporters: "No explosives have been found there." About 30 people were injured in the explosions at Orchard Plaza late Sunday. The "explosions" damaged parts of the interior of the hotel where some foreigners were staying. The police did not have clear and immediate details on the nature of the twin explosions, with the first occurring at 9:15pm Sunday. But Major Mahbub Islam of the Paltan army camp, located close to the hotel, told bdnews24.com: "They may be gas pipeline explosions triggered by a burning cigarette." The army officer who was on the scene referred to boarders' complaints against gas leaks in the hotel. Major Mahbub said that he had talked to some people who were rescued from the building. According to initial details, a 43-year-old Sri Lankan national, AR Samantilak, was among those injured in the first explosion. He was taken to City Hospital. The second explosion, occurring at around 11:30pm Sunday, injured some newsmen at the scene to cover the first explosion. Reporters saw shards of glass scattered on the road, with a long stretch blocked by the police and other security officers. The area had long been in a power blackout. Kathir Ehsan, a tourist from Singapore, who was rescued from the hotel, told bdnews24.com by phone: "I don't know what really happened. I just heard a big sound. And I saw smoke." Firemen rescued Shrinivasan, an Indian national, from room No. 930. Mohammad Shahjalal, director (administration) of Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence, said the explosions might have been triggered by faults with a gas pipeline. "They could also be gas cylinder explosions." bdnews24.com/
