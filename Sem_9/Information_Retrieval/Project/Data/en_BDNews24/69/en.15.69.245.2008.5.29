<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Islamic Constitution Movement in talks with the government Thursday demanded trial of alleged 1971 war criminals. The Islamist party demanded elections to local government bodies ahead of the national polls and a parliament seat to be preserved for the national mosque's khatib, the chief cleric. An 18-point proposal the party presented at the dialogue includes relaxing emergency rules and identifying and preparing lists of "corrupt people and criminals". Party chief Mufti Syed Rezaul Karim led the ICM delegation to the talks at the Chief Adviser's Office. ICM asked the government to be careful in listing war criminals to protect innocent people from prosecution. It added that those who sheltered, nurtured and formed political alliances with the "war criminals" should also be prosecuted. After the dialogue, ICM secretary general ATM Hedayet Uddin told reporters that they had asked the government to relax the emergency rule for enabling everybody to hold free and fair elections. "We asked the government to identify criminals and corrupt people in all the 300 electoral seats and publish their particulars, so that people may be warned against these people and the listed bad guys might not become active again before the forthcoming elections." "We've stressed the need for foiling foreign interference in our domestic affairs." Hedayet said the ICM delegates spoke about the need for bringing a "qualitative change" to the country's politics. ICM proposed that a separate Shariah Bench might be constituted to foil any attempt at desecrating the diktats of Islam by taking advantage of religious misinterpretations. ICM had been involved in April clashes over a proposed women development policy with police near Baitul Mokarram mosque, which left at least 200 people injured. Briefing reporters, education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "Our discussion with ICM has been quite open and cordial at the same time. They stressed effecting qualitative changes in our political arena and we endorse that fully." The adviser hope that a specific way-out would emerge in the process of dialogue and said: "ICM recommended reforming the election processes. A long-term plan may be considered." The next round of dialogue will resume on June 2. The government will also hold talks with businessmen on June 3 instead of June 5 as earlier scheduled, at the Chief Adviser's Office. The businessmen's session will be attended by about 300 delegates representing all districts, which is being coordinated by the FBCCI, the apex trade body. The government dialogue with political parties began on May 22 with a first meeting with the Workers Party of Bangladesh. bdnews24.com/ehb
