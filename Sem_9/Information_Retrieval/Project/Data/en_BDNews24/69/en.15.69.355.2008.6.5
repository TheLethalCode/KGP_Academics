 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)A section of government primary school teachers scheduled to undergo training with BRAC officials ceased working for an hour Thursday to draw attention to demands to have their training programmes cancelled. The action follows a decision by the caretaker administration to train teachers in 30 upazilas across the country under the auspices of BRAC, a non-governmental organisation. Responding to calls from the Bangladesh Government Primary School Teachers Association, the teachers "downed tools" from 10 to 11 in the morning. "The work abstention programme was observed countrywide," association president Muhammad Abdul Awal Talukdar told bdnews24.com. Talukdar said an emergency meeting of the association's central committee will be called on June 6, when the possibility of further action will be discussed. "Under no circumstances shall we receive training under BRAC," he added. Earlier, on Tuesday, secretary general of the association Abdus Salam told a press conference in the city that if it were not for the state of emergency thousands of teachers would already have taken to the streets over the issue. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education in March said BRAC would train teachers as well as supervise and monitor primary schools in 30 upazilas. bdnews2
