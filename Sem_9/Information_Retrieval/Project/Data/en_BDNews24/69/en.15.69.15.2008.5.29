<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)The foreign ministry has started diplomatic efforts for the withdrawal of a ban on work permits for Bangladeshi workers in Bahrain. The Charge d' Affaires of the Bangladesh mission in Manama has held a number of meetings with Bahraini ministers, politicians and Bangladeshi community during the last couple of days. "In order to lift the ban on work permits for Bangladeshi workers in Bahrain, efforts at diplomatic levels are continuing," the foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday. "It is expected that Dr Iftekhar Chowdhury will raise the issue with his Bahraini counterpart during the meeting of Islamic foreign ministers scheduled to be held in Kampala (Uganda) next month," the statement said. The adviser Thursday in a personal letter to Bahraini state minister for foreign affairs expressed regret for the murder of a Bahraini citizen by a Bangladeshi mechanic, according to the release. "The entire Bangladeshi community should not suffer for the misdeeds of one person," Iftekhar wrote in the letter. The Charge d' Affaires of the Bangladesh mission in Manama had talks with Bangladeshi workers to motivate them to follow the rules of the land. Manama stopped issuing work permits for Bangladeshi workers after a Bangladeshi killed a Bahraini national. Earlier, a group of Bahraini lawmakers urged the government to expel all Bangladeshis from their country. According to an official figure, 86,000 Bangladeshis live in Bahrain legally. bdn
