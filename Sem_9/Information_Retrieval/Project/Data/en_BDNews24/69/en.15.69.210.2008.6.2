<TITLE> Wachovia ousts CEO Thompson after losses mount </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wachovia Corp ousted Ken Thompson as chief executive of the fourth-largest US bank in the wake of growing legal troubles and loan losses tied to the purchase of a big mortgage lender just before the nation's housing boom went bust. Lanty Smith, who replaced Thompson as chairman last month, was named interim chief executive, Wachovia said on Monday. Ben Jenkins, the vice chairman and head of Wachovia's retail and business bank, was named interim chief operating officer. Wachovia said it asked Thompson to quit a few days ago, and made the formal decision to replace him on Sunday. In morning trading, Wachovia shares fell 75 cents to $23.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen by more than half over the last year. Thompson, 57, had been chief executive since April 2000, and until last month had been chairman for five years. He joins a growing list of top banking chiefs to lose their jobs since the global credit crisis began last summer, including Citigroup Inc's Charles Prince and Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Stanley O'Neal. Wachovia this quarter raised $8.05 billion of capital, slashed its dividend, nearly doubled its first-quarter loss, and has announced well over $1 billion of potential charges related to legal and regulatory matters. "There has been a steady flow of negative news, all of which may have reduced confidence in the company's controls," said Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP. "Ken's credibility with investors may have fallen to a point where the board decided it would be better off with a new face." Speaking on a conference call with reporters, Smith said the board's decision follows a series of disappointments rather than any one overriding event, but that it is "absolutely not" true the bank faces a crisis. "We're very proud of where Wachovia has been," he said. "We're less proud of where it is today." Another lender with heavy mortgage losses, Washington Mutual Inc, on Monday said it will strip Chief Executive Kerry Killinger of his chairman's role. The largest U.S. savings and loan bowed to pressure from shareholders who voted for the change in April. GOLDEN WEST TARNISHED Wachovia has tripled in size since Thompson engineered the 2001 merger of First Union Corp with Wachovia. For many years, he held a reputation for smoothly integrating acquisitions, such as the $13.7 billion purchase in 2004 of another southeast US bank, SouthTrust Corp. But Thompson has admitted to poor timing for his $24.2 billion purchase in October 2006 of Golden West Financial Corp, an Oakland, California mortgage specialist and thrift. Losses from "option" adjustable-rate mortgages that let borrowers pay less than the interest due helped cause nonperforming assets to more than quadruple from a year earlier to $8.37 billion. Wachovia has also suffered from its investment bank's exposure to structured products and commercial real estate. Mounting loan losses pushed Wachovia in April to cut its dividend 41 percent, and raise $8.05 billion in capital. Smith said the bank doesn't believe it needs more capital, but that "one never says never." MOUNTING LOSSES Since the capital-raising, Wachovia nearly doubled its first-quarter loss to $708 million because of a write-down tied to life insurance policies. The quarterly loss was Wachovia's first since 2001. It also said it may take a $1 billion charge because of a federal court ruling over leases, and agreed to pay up to $144 million to settle federal allegations over telemarketers. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal said federal prosecutors are investigating the bank over alleged laundering of drug proceeds by Colombian and Mexican money-transfer companies. The bank has said it has a strong program to stop money laundering. Smith declined to say how long the search to replace Thompson will take. He said Wachovia will consider internal and external candidates, and that speed was "not the objective." Through Friday, Wachovia's market value had fallen by half to $47.4 billion from about $96 billion when it announced the Golden West purchase in May 2006, Reuters data show. "Wachovia has lost an incredibly large amount of market capitalization, and that came in part from how it chose to structure its business," Fitzsimmons said. "At this stage," he added, "Wachovia needs to aggressively address the problems in California. Many investors blame Ken for buying Golden West at the top of the market, and that was a tough thing to get around." Fitzsimmons rates the bank "hold.
