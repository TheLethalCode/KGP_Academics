 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  A special judge's court sentenced former secretary Ismail Zabiullah to 13 years in prison, on Thursday, for amassing wealth beyond his known income and concealing wealth-related information. Judge Md Serajul Islam also fined Zabiullah Tk 10 lakh or another one year's rigorous imprisonment on failure to pay. His wife, Ayesha Zabiullah, was sentenced to three years and fined Tk 1 lakh, or another six months behind bars, for assisting her husband. The judge also directed the state to confiscate all illegal earnings of the convicted couple. Both are currently fugitive. The verdict will come into effect from the day they are arrested or surrender. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against the couple on Nov 5 last year. The anti-graft body alleged that Zabiullah amassed wealth of Tk 1.29 crore beyond his known income and attempted to conceal information relating to assets of Tk 1.16 crore from the ACC. In his wealth statement submitted to the commission, Zabiullah had disclosed moveable and immoveable assets worth Tk 2.23 crore. bdnews24.c
