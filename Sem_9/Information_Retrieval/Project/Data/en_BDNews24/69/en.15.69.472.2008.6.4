From a seminar at the National Press Club, they also demanded tax breaks for industries owned by women entrepreneurs for up to 25 years. The budget for fiscal 2007-08 set the tax-free income ceiling at 1.5 lakh. In the keynote paper, Pratima Paul-Majumder of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies made a number of recommendations.
