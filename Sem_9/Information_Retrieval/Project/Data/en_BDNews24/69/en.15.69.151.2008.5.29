<TITLE> Iraq's Maliki asks for debt cancellation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Thu May 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq on Thursday renewed a call to foreign creditors to cancel about $60 billion in debts and asked that compensation payments imposed after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait be scrapped. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki made the call at an international conference convened in Stockholm to assess progress in a five-year plan to rebuild Iraq. "Iraq is not a poor country. It possesses tremendous human and material resources, but the debts of Iraq ... which we inherited from the dictator hamper the reconstruction process," Maliki told the conference. "We are looking forward to the brother countries writing off its (Iraq's) debts, which are a burden on the Iraqi government," he said, a pointed reference to Gulf states Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which are Iraq's biggest Arab creditors. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were not present at Thursday's conference, with junior officials representing both countries. A member of the Iraqi delegation said they were disappointed by the foreign ministers' absence. About $66.5 billion of Iraq's $120.2 billion foreign debt has been forgiven, according to U.S. State Department estimates. More than half of the outstanding debt is owed to Gulf Arab states, mainly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Arab League chief Amr Moussa backed Maliki's call for debt relief saying: "I call upon everybody, including the Arab countries, to accelerate this issue." Iraq is pushing for an end to the billions of dollars it pays in compensation for Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. At present it is required to set aside 5 percent of its oil revenues, which Iraq says will amount to $3.5 billion this year. Maliki made a similar debt relief call at a conference of Iraq's neighbors in Kuwait in April, with Iraqi officials noting at the time that while many of Iraq's major creditors had cancelled its debts, its Arab neighbors had not followed suit. The Stockholm conference is the first annual review of the International Compact with Iraq agreed in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh last year, which committed Iraq to implement reforms in exchange for greater international support. UN LAUDS PROGRESS Opening the conference, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the Iraqi government for making "notable progress" in meeting economic, political and security benchmarks set at last year's conference in Egypt. "If we had to use one word to describe the situation in Iraq today I would choose ... hope," he said. "There is new hope that the people and government of Iraq are overcoming daunting challenges and working together to rebuild their country." While security has improved in Iraq, with U.S. officials saying violence is at a four-year low, political progress has been much slower since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, with national reconciliation mired in sectarian tensions between Iraq's Shi'ite and Sunni sects. The main Sunni Arab political bloc, which quit the government in August, said on Wednesday it suspended talks to rejoin Maliki's Shi'ite-led administration after a disagreement over a cabinet post. Maliki told the conference his government was pushing ahead with plans to hold provincial elections in October, despite the top U.S. commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, saying last week that November was a more likely date. Washington sees the elections as critical to bringing minority Sunni Arabs into the political process and easing sectarian tensions that pushed the country to civil war in 2006. Sweden said on Monday that 97 delegations including 500 to 600 political leaders would attend the one-day conference in Stockholm, including Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and representatives from Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria. In a 75-page progress report to the conference, oil-rich Iraq stressed it was not looking for money from the international community but for technical help to get its economy back on its feet after decades of wars and sanctions. "The high-level meeting in Stockholm is not a pledging conference ... Instead, Iraq looks for partnership, technical assistance and economic exchange," it said. Iraqi oil revenues are expected to reach a record $70 billion this year
