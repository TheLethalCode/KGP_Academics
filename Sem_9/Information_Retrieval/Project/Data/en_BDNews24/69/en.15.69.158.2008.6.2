 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday sentenced former BNP MP Mosaddak Ali Falu to five years in jail and fined him Tk 5.35 lakh on charges of relief embezzlement. In a first verdict against the former BNP MP, judge Tanjina Ismail of the Special Court-6, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad complex, ruled that Falu would have to suffer one more year in jail in failure to pay the fine. Falu has been convicted of misusing tin sheets meant for relief to the poor. Other accused in the case Monirul Islam Sohel was acquitted as allegations against him could not be proved. The court issued an order to confiscate 900 pieces of embezzled tin sheets. Sub-inspector Ismail Hossain of Ashulia Police Station filed the case against Falu on February 10 last year. The case was filed after the police retrieved the tin sheets from Falu's Dhaka Shanghai Ceramics in Ashulia. Some other graft cases against Falu are awaiting trial. Joint forces arrested Falu on February 3 last year. bdnews24.co
