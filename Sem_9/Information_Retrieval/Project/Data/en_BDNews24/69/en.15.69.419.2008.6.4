 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum may play as a specialist batsman in the third and final test against England starting on Thursday because of a back injury.

"He is not in doubt to bat but there is a possibility he might not be able to keep." Reserve keeper Gareth Hopkins has been placed on standby for a test debut. England lead 1-0 in the series. England named on Wednesday the team who won the second test at Old Trafford by six wickets. It is the first time in 123 years that they have kept the same side for five matches in a row. "It's quite incredible really and it shows we have won a few games," England captain Michael Vaughan told reporters. "We feel we are developing as a side. We understand there are areas where we can improve on but we are showing a lot of character and resilience in positions that we might not have done six or seven months ago and that is always a good place to start developing a team from.

It's consistency all round that we need to improve to become a top team
