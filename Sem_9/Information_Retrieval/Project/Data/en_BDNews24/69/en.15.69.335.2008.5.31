 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)  Islamic banking in Bangladesh has come a long way since the country's first such bank began operating in Bangladesh in 1983, with deposits of Tk 14 crore and investments of Tk 6 crore. Some 25 years on, the total deposits of five major Islamic banks stand at Tk 27,000 crore and their investments exceed Tk 26,000 crore. "The Islamic banks are much more organised than other banks in the private sector. Their rapid expansion has occurred as they make more profit," Prof Anu Muhammad of Jahangirnagar University's economics department told bdnews24.com on the success of Islamic banking in Bangladesh. "Although the interest rate on loans is higher, many people prefer them for religious sentiment." "As a result, many foreign banks owned and run by non-Muslims are also showing interest in the Islamic banking system," said the economist. Six banks fully conform to the Islamic banking system in the countryIslami Bank Bangladesh, Export Import Bank Bangladesh, Shahjalal Islami Bank, Al-Arafah Islami Bank, Social Investment Bank and ICB Islamic Bank. There are also a number of Islamic non-banking financial institutions in the country. They include Islami Insurance, Islami Commercial Insurance, Tafakul Islami Insurance, Far East Islami Life Insurance, Prime Islami Life Insurance and Islamic Finance and Investment. Besides, Prime, South East, Dhaka, City Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank Al Falah, Premier and AB Bank operate 19 Islamic banking branches, while Bank Asia told bdnews24.com it has also received permission to open two such branches. Islami Bank Bangladesh, the first of its kind to start operations in 1983, began with deposits of Tk 14 crore, and investments of just Tk 6 crore. Its foreign exchange business was worth Tk 1 crore at the time. At the end of 2007, the bank's deposits stood at Tk 16,676 crore, investment at Tk 17,406 crore and the foreign exchange business is worth Tk 28,792 crore. Islami Bank recorded its rate of growth of deposits at 25.57 percent in 2007 over the previous year. The rate of investment growth of the bank was 40.42 percent in 2007, compared with the investment growth rate of 17.24 percent in the banking sector the same year, according to available statistics. Of Islami Bank's total investments in 2007, 51.43 percent went into industries, 31.98 percent into trade and commerce, 6.12 percent into the real estate sector and 3.10 percent into agriculture. Islami Bank's business in the import, export and remittance sector in 2007 recorded a 42.66 percent rise from a year ago, according to data provided by the bank. The number of officials and employees of the bank was 8,426 at the end of last year. Of them, 61 were women. On his bank's success, Islami Bank managing director Fariduddin Ahmed said: "Islamic banking does not carry out transactions based on interest and speculation. So the negative aspects of conventional banking are absent here." "In Islamic banking, the depositor takes an equal share of profit and loss. Besides, in conventional banking there is no limit of interest." "If one takes a loan and makes delays in repayment the amount of interest keeps on increasing. In Islamic banking, the system is different," he said. Prof Anu Muhammad said: "The aim of all banks is to collect deposits and make a profit through investment." Islamic banking is no different from conventional banking in profit-making, he said. "Moreover, the interest rate on loans in Islamic banks is higher than in conventional banks. So they make more profit than interest based banks." Al Arafah Islami Bank illustrates the Islamic banking system's popularity and success in Bangladesh, with an impressive deposit growth rate of 48.30 percent, and an investment growth rate of 36.46 percent over the past year. Shahjalal Islami Bank started its operations on May 10, 2001. In 2007, the bank's deposits soared to Tk 2,262 crore, investments to Tk 2,062 crore, with Tk 2,835 crore in total assets. Muhammad Ali, managing director of Shahjalal Islami Bank, believes Islamic banking is necessary for balanced distribution of wealth. "Islamic banking also works towards the development of economic activities. That's why people are becoming interested in this type of banking in Bangladesh." bdnews24.
