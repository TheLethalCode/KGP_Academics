 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Gano Forum in talks with the government Monday demanded that the state of emergency be relaxed in phases ahead of its complete withdrawal before the polls. The party also demanded "proper and effective" steps to try the alleged 71 war criminals immediately, party chief Dr Kamal Hossain told reporters after the talks at the Chief Adviser's Office. The 11-member Gano Forum delegation placed a set of demands to the government, including calls for an election free from the influence of armed activists and black money. The formation of a constitution review commission was also among the demands. The party recommended 'a government of national consensus' with 'like-minded political parties' after the election. "We have also asked the government to ensure participation of honest and efficient people in the polls," Dr Kamal said in a press briefing. Gano Forum asked the chief adviser to ensure that the Election Commission works independently. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, who also briefed the reporters after the meeting, said the government planned to hold talks at regional levels. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury were on the government side. bdnews24.com/
