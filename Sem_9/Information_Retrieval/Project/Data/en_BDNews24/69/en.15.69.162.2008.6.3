 NEW YORK, Tue Jun 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks rose on Tuesday after an unexpectedly strong report on factory orders added to positive sentiment generated by a sharp drop in oil prices. Dow component General Motors shares (GM.N: Quote, Profile, Research) rose 1.8 percent to $17.75 after its chief executive announced a plan to build more small and mid-size cars and cut back on truck output in the face of rising gasoline prices. "We'd love to get comfortable with the idea oil is not going to surge," said David Bianco, chief US equity strategist at UBS in New York. But the sharp increase in gas prices may not be all bad for the stock market. "We think the energy efficiency boom is a material positive to industrial companies," he said, referring to GM. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 24.42 points, or 0.20 percent, at 12,528.24. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 4.53 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,390.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 14.93 points, or 0.60 percent, at 2,506.46. The Commerce Department reported that new orders at U.S. factories rose unexpectedly in April as strong demand for quickly used nondurable goods offset a dip in orders for costly durable goods like cars and refrigerators. Crude oil prices fell $1.72 to $126.02 a barrel, weighing on energy stocks. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N: Quote, Profile, Research) shares fell 0.2 percent to $87.66 and Chevron (CVX.N: Quote, Profile, Research) stock was down 0.6 percent to $99.04. US automakers release May auto sales later on Tuesday, and economists in a Reuters survey expect a decline from April. Lehman Brothers' (LEH.N: Quote, Profile, Research) shares fell 4 percent to $33.40 after the Wall Street Journal said the bank may raise up to $4 billion in capital to shore up its balance sheet as the newspaper said it faced a quarterly loss. On Monday, Lehman tumbled 8.1 percent in the sharpest fall in financial shares after S&P said cut the ratings of major securities firms and said the outlook for large US financial institutions was predominantly negative
