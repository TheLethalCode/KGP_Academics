 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)About 97 percent of primary to SSC level students go for private coaching, according to a report released Saturday. In its annual report 2008 on primary education presented at the LGED auditorium Saturday, Sushiksha Andolon, a non-governmental organisation, said: "Only one in 31 students from the nursery to SSC levels doesn't take private coaching." The survey covered only 12 families. On yearly average, each family spends Tk 600 per student, the report says. If a government primary school averages 300 students, the amount in annual private tuition fees stands at Tk 1.20 lakh, a third of the amount spent on the teachers' salary and other allowances, the report says. The report says education aid is necessary to correct flaws in pre-primary education. "One of the grave sides to the system is that teachers are doing private coaching in classrooms." "Quality education" is the main challenge in Bangladesh, the report says. The environment for quality education could not yet be ensured in primary schools of Bangladesh for different reasons, it says. "It will not be impossible to ensure quality education in primary schools in the near future if the community and the state jointly took steps to improve the quality of education," the report says The report presented different problems and their probable solutions. Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud presided over the report publication ceremony. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, primary and mass education adviser Rasheda K Choudhury, primary and mass education secretary Muhammad Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, economist Dr Atiur Rahman, Prof Ahmed Kamal, Prof Abdullah Abu Sayeed, and member of Sushiksha Andolon Khandker Sakhawat Ali spoke. Rasheda K Choudhury said the salary of the community teachers was going to be increased, an issue now pending with the highest level of government. "From now on, new books will be provided for students of all classes in the primary level from the beginning of the academic year," she said. Hossain Zillur Rahman said that even the poorest family now realised the necessity of education. He said the aspiration for education was universal and a big achievement. "Quality education needed to be provided." He said that if the policy and reality matched at the field level, good results could be attained. bdnews
