<TITLE> Texas Pacific wades in to rescue Britain's B&B </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US private equity firm TPG Capital TPG.UL has agreed to take a 23 percent stake in Bradford & Bingley, providing a much-needed boost for the troubled lender as conditions in the UK mortgage market deteriorate. In a statement detailing tough UK conditions and a loss for the first four months of the year, B&B said Texas Pacific would invest around 179 million pounds ($353 million), becoming the single largest investor in Britain's biggest buy-to-let lender. The private equity group's surprise swoop mirrors moves by strategic investors shoring up US banks as financial institutions across the world have struggled with writedowns amid a credit crunch and economic downturn. The stake purchase will add to an emergency cash call first announced last month but trimmed on Monday to 258 million pounds from 300 million. The bank will raise a total of 400 million, net of expenses. B&B, which has seen its stock tumble almost 60 percent since it announced the rights issue in May, said on Monday all new shares will be issued at 55p, down from an initially planned 82p underwriting price in the 19-for-25 issue. B&B shares fell 27.5 percent by 0814 GMT to 64 pence, having hit its lowest ever level of 60p. At this price, B&B is worth around 400 million pounds -- a fraction of its 3.3 billion value at its peak in March 2006. Deepening concerns for the UK mortgage market and fears of rising arrears, B&B said underlying profits in the first four months of the year had halved to 56 million pounds. After more writedowns on assets buffeted by the credit crunch, however, the bank made a pre-tax loss of 8 million pounds. The bearish outlook for the UK market, news of rising arrears and the impact of higher funding costs on margins, hit the sector, with mortgage lenders HBOS down 8.6 percent and Alliance & Leicester down 7.6 percent. Dealers said B&B had fired a sharp warning shot across the European sector and showed even deeply discounted rights issues could fail amid a lukewarm appetite to invest more after a torrid year for most bank shares. Figures out last week showed UK house prices fell a record 2.5 percent in May, raising fears the property market downturn could soon turn into a crash that hits the whole economy. The Nationwide Building Society said the monthly drop in house prices, the largest since it started in 1991, wiped 5,000 pounds off the value of the average British home and was the worst fall since the economic slump in 1992. B&B has been under pressure since it surprised investors in May with news of an emergency rights issue, a month after saying it had no plans to do so. It said at the time it had waited for markets to stabilize before going ahead with the cash call. The bank announced the departure of its chief executive, Steven Crawshaw, on Sunday, blaming ill-health. Crawshaw, who joined the bank almost a decade ago ahead of its flotation, will be replaced at the helm temporarily by Chairman Rod Kent. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Citi and UBS
