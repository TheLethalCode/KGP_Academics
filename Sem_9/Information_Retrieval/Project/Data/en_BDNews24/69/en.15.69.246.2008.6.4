<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association Wednesday asked the government to introduce "industrial police" to protect the garment industry from vandalism. BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez made the call from a press conference a day after a group of people had attacked several factories in Savar over the rumoured death of a garment worker in a road accident. "This sector may not survive in a situation like this. We are very much worried about security to this sector," Chowdhury told reporters at the BGMEA office. The BGMEA leader ruled out involvement of workers in the attacks on factories. "Criminals attacked the garments industry. Some NGOs and labour organisations provoked violence," he alleged. Chowdhury demanded punishment to the attackers. Chowdhury said a number of garments factories set up in Ashulia, Tongi, Narayanganj and Savar areas need industrial police for tight security. bdnew
