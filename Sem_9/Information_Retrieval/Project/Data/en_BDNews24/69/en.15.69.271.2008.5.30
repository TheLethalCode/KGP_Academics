<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Credit for the bumper boro crop goes to farmers, said agriculture adviser CS Karim Friday, as he launched a road show with a series of themes to promote Bangladesh. Speaking as the chief guest at the inauguration of a "road show" at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, the adviser urged the farmers to keep up the trend of success. Four ministries, the Anticorruption Commission, Election Commission and Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission jointly organised the show with the esho Bangladesh gori slogan. After the opening, a motorcade set out for Tentulia in Panchagarh from Dhaka to cross 55 districts in 50 days. The agriculture adviser said, "The continuity of bumper boro production has to be kept up. Instead of suffering from self-indulgence, we will have to be self-confident." "Instability in the agriculture sector ravaging the world would not go so soon. For this, a green revolution is required." "The solution to the farm crisis is adequate production. We are optimistic that we will become self sufficient in food and also exports," Karim said. On the road show, the adviser said, the motorcade would go to different districts and encourage farmers. "Alongside, it will also play a role in development of the tourism industry." The road show will also focus on checking corruption, building a crime- and drug-free Bangladesh, solving the food crisis and building the tourism industry, the convenor of the Road Show Committee, Anwar Faruque, told a press conference at the National Press Club Thursday. Faruque, director general (seed) of the agriculture ministry, said: "The road show has been arranged to disseminate the message of potential in different sectors among the people." The motorcade will make stopovers in 25 district towns organising fairs there. At the fairs, five cars will be decorated on five themes of the road show. Debates and essay competitions will be organised for the students of schools and colleges in the district towns in cooperation with the district administrations. bdnew
