<TITLE> India decides on fuel price, details later: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, June 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government has reached a decision about fuel prices but the details will only be announced later in the day, possibly at a noon news conference, a cabinet minister told Reuters on Wednesday. The minister, who did not want to be identified, did not elaborate but shares of state oil firms, which would gain from higher fuel prices, were up more than 2 percent in a flat Mumbai market. Media reports, analysts and government sources say prices of petrol are likely to rise 10 percent, while diesel rates would go up by 5-6 percent, moderate increases which are unlikely to significantly dent demand in Asia's third-largest oil consumer. Two panels of cabinet ministers, dealing with political and economic issues, on Wednesday considered the oil ministry's proposal to raise regulated fuel prices, which are set by the government. As crude prices have risen sharply to record highs, oil firms have been hammered and are losing millions of dollars a day. The decision on the size of the rise has been delayed by a political rift in the government, which faces several state polls this year, a general election next year, and is struggling to calm inflation at a 3- year high of 8.1 percent. Oil ministry officials had pushed for increases of 15-22 percent for retail fuels state firms Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp were losing heavily as they imported costly crude and sold refined products at the low state-set price. At 0500 GMT, shares of BPCL were up 3.3 percent, while IOC and HPCL were up 2.4 percent in a weak Mumbai market, which was down 0.4 percent. Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, which is forced to supply cheap crude to state refiners, were up 2.6 percent.
