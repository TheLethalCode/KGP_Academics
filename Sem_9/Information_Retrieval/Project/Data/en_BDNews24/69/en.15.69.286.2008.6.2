 WASHINGTON, Mon Jun 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sen. Edward Kennedy, a leading Democrat and patriarch of a prominent US political dynasty, said he would undergo surgery on Monday for treatment of a brain tumor diagnosed last month. Kennedy, 76, said in a statement he would have "targeted" surgery on Monday at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, followed by chemotherapy and radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Surgery was to start at about 9 a.m. EDT and was expected to last about six hours, media reports said. Kennedy, the youngest brother of assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy, said he expected to be hospitalized at Duke for about a week. Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor called a glioma, a type of tumor that usually kills within three years, after suffering a seizure on May 17 at his family vacation compound at Hyannisport in his home state of Massachusetts. Kennedy, who has been a senator for 46 years, is one of the most respected figures in US politics and news of his condition prompted a wave of shock and sympathy in Washington. "I am deeply grateful to the people of Massachusetts and to my friends, colleagues and so many others across the country and around the world who have expressed their support and good wishes as I tackle this new and unexpected health challenge," Kennedy said. He said the surgery would be performed by Dr. Allan Friedman, chief of neurosurgery at Duke. "After completing treatment, I look forward to returning to the United States Senate and to doing everything I can to help elect Barack Obama as our next president," said Kennedy, who until the diagnosis had actively campaigned for Obama in his bid to win the Democratic nomination. Kennedy has been a vocal critic of Republican President George W Bush, particularly on his Iraq war, tax cuts for the wealthy and conservative nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court who he fears will push the high court to the right. Kennedy came to the Senate in November 1962 to fill a seat earlier held by his older brother, then-President John Kennedy. He currently serves as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
