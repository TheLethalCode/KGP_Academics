 Youxian, China, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has evacuated over 197,000 people from an area that risks flooding by landslide- blocked rivers near the epicenter of this month's earthquake in Sichuan province, Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. Police shouting "evacuate! evacuate!" through loudspeakers fanned out through the town of Youxian on the outskirts of Mianyang city, which was devastated by the May 12 quake. The town was almost completely deserted, with shops shuttered and apartment buildings silent, as officials searched for stragglers in makeshift tarpaulin shelters erected by refugees on the banks of the Fu River. Residents of Youxian were ordered to move to higher ground in the hills around the town as hundreds of soldiers dug dams and channels upstream in an effort to reduce pressure on the river and prevent it from overflowing, which could inundate the area. "We don't know how long they'll have to stay up there. It depends on the situation with the dam," a local police official, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The official death toll from the quake is 68,858 and is expected to rise, with 18,618 people still missing. Officials have said more than 30 landslide-blocked rivers could burst, flooding downstream towns and tent camps for refugees. A major part of the construction effort to contain the rivers, a sluice designed to discharge water from a lake at Tangjiashan, has been completed, Xinhua quoted Yue Xi, deputy chief of the water and electricity section of the People's Armed Police Force, as saying. He said the sluice was expected to drain water between Sunday and Tuesday. Xinhua reported that contingency plans provided for the evacuation of up to a total of 1.3 million people, depending on how the discharge proceeded. Long convoys of trucks drove into the disaster area piled with tents and other supplies for evacuees. An Airbus 380 superjumbo, the world's largest passenger plane, flew into the regional city of Chengdu on Saturday with emergency supplies. The movement of thousands of refugees through the disaster area, some of them traveling not on official instructions but out of fear of aftershocks from the quake, continued to hinder the work of reuniting families. Over 6,000 lost children have been reunited with their parents but 1,800 have still not been able to make contact with family or relatives, Xinhua reported. Meanwhile, the death toll from torrential rain in 12 provinces of southern and eastern China, including Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei, rose to 93 people, with 43 missing. The floods have affected over 9 million people and caused economic losses of 5 billion yuan ($720 million), China News Service quoted local authorities as saying. ($1 = 6.94 yuan)
