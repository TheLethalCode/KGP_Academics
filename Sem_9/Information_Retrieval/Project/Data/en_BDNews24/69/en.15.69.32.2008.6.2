<TITLE> Old foes lock horns in premier super hockey Tuesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited are looking forward to returning to the Premier Division Hockey League title race when the Dhanmondi-based outfit face old foes Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Super League encounter at Moulana Bhasani National Stadium Tuesday. Mohammedan, already out of the title race, have opened it wide after thrashing league leaders Usha Krira Chakra 3-2 Sunday and Abahani are desperate to take the opportunity beating the black and white outfit Tuesday. "We want to take cent percent opportunity created by Mohammedan and we are looking forward to beating the same rivals tomorrow (Tuesday) to keep our hopes of clinching the title alive," Abahani coach Mahbub Haroon told bdnews24.com Monday. League leaders Usha dominated the points table with 33 points from 12 outings, five points ahead of Abahani, who, however, played a match less than the league leaders. Joint-champions Usha will be crowned if Abahani either lose or draw against Mohammedan, who ended in a 3-3 draw against Abahani in the first-leg match despite taking a 2-0 lead in it. Keeping the scenario of the first-leg encounter in mind, Mahbub first wanted to protect his defense and then attack to win the match. Mohammad Sabbir, who represented Pakistan three times each in the Olympics and men's World Cup Hockey, kept Abahani's defenders at bay with his spirited run and superb stick work that eventually destroyed Abahani in the first-leg match. Abahani coach Haroon has also planned how to restrict Sabbir's terrific performance as it would be tough, he thought, to come back in the match in the event of going down in such big match. The sky blue outfit will miss the service of defender Faruque Ahmed following his booking and the coach thinks of bringing a midfielder down to marshal the backline. It is a do-or-die match for Abahani, but Mohammedan have no tension and want to push Abahani hard like Usha. "We will try to show our best to beat Abahani," Mohammedan coach Barkatullah Chapal told bdnews24.com. He said that they didn't want to give any room to Abahani, though his side was not in the title race.
