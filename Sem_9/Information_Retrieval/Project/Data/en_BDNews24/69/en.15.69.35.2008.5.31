<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)  Three goals each from Rasul Mahmud Jimmy and Mosharraf Hossain Kuti inspired Abahani Limited to blank Ajax Sporting Club 7-0 in the Super League encounter of the Premier Division Hockey League at Moulna Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Saturday. With nine wins in 11 matches, second-placed Abahani raised their point tally to 28, five points behind league leaders Usha Krira Chakra, who are only one win away from the title. Usha need a win in their remaining two matches against Mohammedan SC and Abahani Limited, and the spirited Old Dhaka outfit will look forward to wrapping up the title beating Mohammedan Sunday. Usha are only the unbeaten team in the 10-team hockey league as they had already overcome both hurdles of Abahani and Mohammedan in the first leg. Usha's trio Pakistani recruits are in superb form with forward Akhter Ali scoring almost in every match while locals Jahidul Islam Rajon and Maksudul Alam Habul are also providing great supports to keep their outfit in unbeaten run. Mohammedan, who are in third position with 23 points, will depend on duo Pakistani -- Mohammad Sabbir and Mohammad Asim -- to make an upset Sunday as the Motijheel-based outfit are comprised of mostly Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan players. If Mohammedan can hold Usha Sunday, then the title will be decided in the last match of the Super League between Usha and Abahani on June 6. In the day's one-sided affair, Abahani Limited dominated the first half scoring 5 goals in the space of eight minutes, though it seemed the match was going to be a competitive one. Ajax defense collapsed in the 17th minute with Jimmy opening the floodgate for Abahani while Mamunur Rahman Chayan doubled the lead three minutes later converting a penalty corner. One minute later, Kuti widened the margin while Jimmy made it 4-0 in the 23rd minute and Kuti scored his second in the 25th minutes to give Abahani a comfortable 5-0 lead in the first half. After the breather, Jimmy scored his third in the 49th minute through a field goal while Kuti scored his third and sealed the match in the 56th minute.
