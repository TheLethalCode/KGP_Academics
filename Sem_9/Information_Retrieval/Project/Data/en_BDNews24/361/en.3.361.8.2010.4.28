<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Russia on Wednesday published the files on the 1940 massacre of Polish officers by Soviet secret police at Katyn on the Internet, an unprecedented move aimed at improving relations with Poland. The publication, ordered by President Dmitry Medvedev, comes as ties between Moscow and Warsaw have been warming in the wake of the plane crash in western Russia earlier this month that killed Polish president Lech Kaczynski. "On the order of Russian President D.A. Medvedev, electronic copies of authentic archival documents on the 'Katyn Problem' from 'Packet No. 1', which were held for decades in the Communist Party archives, have been published on the website of the state archives," it said in a statement. The documents in question had been declassified in September 1992 on the orders of then-president Boris Yeltsin and shared with Poland, the statement said. But until now the originals had only been available to researchers visiting the archives and had never before been shared online, a spokeswoman for the Russian state archives told AFP. One of the documents posted online is a four-page memorandum from Lavrenty Beria, head of the NKVD secret police, to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin about the fate of thousands of Polish prisoners held by the Soviets. In the document, Beria proposes that the NKVD "quickly examine the use of the highest means of punishment -- death by shooting." Stalin's signature and a red stamp reading "Top Secret" are on the first page of the document, which is dated March 1940. Poland has long demanded that Russia open all its files on Katyn and the issue has strained ties between the two former Communist neighbours. The publication of the files online "is important but mainly symbolic," said Yan Rachinsky, a member of the board of directors of the Memorial human rights group. The publication of "Packet No. 1" does not have any effect on a separate case in which Memorial has been waging a court battle to force prosecutors to declassify a 1990s investigation into the Katyn massacre. Prosecutors closed the investigation in 2004 and have refused to open their files on the case. "It does not settle the problem. There are still classified files from the Katyn investigation," Rachinsky told AFP. Some 22,000 Polish officers were executed by Stalin's secret police at Katyn, in western Russia, and a number of other sites in present-day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in April-May 1940. The officers had been taken prisoner after the Soviets invaded and occupied eastern Poland in September 1939, dividing up the country under the terms of a secret pact with Nazi Germany, which seized the rest of Poland. For decades, Moscow blamed the Katyn massacre on Nazi Germany, until 1990 when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev finally admitted that the Polish officers had been executed by Stalin's NKVD. Ironically, Polish president Kaczynski had been heading to Katyn on April 10 for a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre when his plane crashed, killing all 96 people aboard. The tragedy sparked an outpouring of grief in both countries, which have long had a strained relationship. "We on the Russian side are showing absolute openness in telling what happened in Katyn and other places with Polish prisoners of war," state archive chief Andrei Artyzov said in an interview published on Russian news agencies. "All the basic documents about these events have been published," he ad
