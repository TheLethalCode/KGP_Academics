 KARACHI, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- In the Caribbean islands which spawned a conveyor belt of intimidating pacemen in the 1970s and 1980s, spin is poised to dominate the World T20. Gone are the days when lightning fast tracks were the norm in the West Indies and the slower bowlers are expected to prosper in the third edition of the 17-day run-fest which starts in Guyana on Friday. India, who won the inaugural T20 world title in 2007, and Pakistan, the 2009 champions, have the best spinners in the tournament and could dominate, according to former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram. "The pitches in the West Indies are more suited to spin now and Pakistan and India have plenty of options to bank upon," Akram told reporters.

"Spinners will definitely play an influential role in this World Cup, it just shows that slow bowlers can be effective in any format of cricket," he added. Former India captain Rahul Dravid said the combination of a strong spin attack and the inspirational leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni could fire the Indians to another title. "The conditions should suit India with the kind of spinners we have and I think he (Dhoni) will be very confident with the team we are taking to the West Indies," he told Reuters. "From the Indian side, Suresh Raina is someone I'm very keen to watch at the world level. He should be someone who will be absolutely sensational to watch."
