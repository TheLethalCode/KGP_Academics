 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has alleged that India wants to keep this government in power to advance its own interests. His allegations came in reference to the meeting between prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the just-concluded SAARC summit in Thimpu. However, the BNP leader lauded the two deals signed at the summit on trade in services and on environment cooperation. Expressing his reaction about the SAARC summit to journalists at his Armanitola residence on Friday, he only highlighted her meeting with the Indian prime minister. He did not mention her bilateral meetings with the Pakistani prime minister and the Maldives president. Delwar said that India was one of the few countries that supported the formation of military-backed caretaker government through the declaration of emergency in 2007. "Now they have installed a puppet government through the farcical election held on Dec 29, 2008", he said. In the meeting with Hasina, Manmohan expressed his country's support in the development of democracy in Bangladesh. Commenting on this, Delwar said that they were frightened by this promise of support to those (Awami League government), who have made a mockery of the elections and have now established 'fascism' in the country. The BNP secretary general claimed that the two leaders failed to find any solution to the outstanding bilateral issues. "The meeting failed to produce any concrete statement with regard to the solution of our longstanding problems." There were no discussions regarding the share of Teesta river waters, stopping the construction of the Tipaimukh dam and due share of the Ganges water, he claimed. Rather, it was said that the agreements signed during Hasina's India tour would be implemented soon. "We are alarmed by the prospect of implementation of the agreements that have not been raised in the parliament yet and which the people are unaware of." During Hasina's official visit to India in January, three agreements for reducing crimes and two agreements on cooperation in power sector and cultural exchange during 2010-2012 were signed. The contents of the agreements were published in the local media. In addition, chief whip Abdus Shahid said the details of the agreements would be put before parliament for discussion. BNP claims that there was another hidden agreement signed during the Delhi visit. Delwar proposed that the conflicts between any two countries should be resolved through SAARC. He also said that the SAARC charter should be modified to address bilateral issues. Mentioning the contributions of late president Ziaur Rahman to the creation of SAARC, he said that his intention was to build the foundation of cooperation among the South Asian countries for their development. bdnews
