 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  The US is introducing a new internet-based visa application form, effective from May 15. From now, visa applications can be submitted online, says a press release of the US Embassy at Dhaka. The new DS-160 will replace all existing NIV applications forms with a single interactive, online form. With the new form, each applicant will be required to upload a visa photograph, and submit the form via the Internet. Instead of bringing multiple forms to his or her interview, applicants using the DS-160 will need only a printed confirmation page. The new DS-160 is available at: http://ceac.state.gov/genniv and http://dhaka.usembassy.gov/ds160.html
