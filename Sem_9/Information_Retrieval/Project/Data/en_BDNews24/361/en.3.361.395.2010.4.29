 KATHMANDU, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Nepal's former Maoist rebels began gathering in Kathmandu on Thursday for a May Day protest rally to press for a return to power in what may herald a showdown with a fragile government. The Maoists say it will be the biggest demonstration since they quit the government last year. Supporters, many dressed in red, are housed in hundreds of schools and are being provided training on how to use sticks as well as martial arts. The former guerrillas headed a coalition government after a surprise win in the election for a special constituent assembly in 2008, a body tasked to prepare a new constitution that was part of a peace deal to end a decade-long Maoist civil war. But they quit after the president refused to approve their decision to sack Nepal's army chief in a crisis that has stalled the peace process and delayed the drafting of a new constitution. Nepal is strategically located between India and China and both Asian powers are vying for influence in the nascent Himalayan republic that is rich in potential hydroelectric power. "The protests are to press for a new government based on the national consensus," Narayan Kaji Shrestha, a top Maoist leader, told Reuters. "Since our party is the biggest in the constituent assembly we must be allowed to lead the new government." The ruling coalition, a loose alliance of 22 political parties, says it is ready to take the Maoists on board but has so far has refused to let the former guerrillas head a new cabinet. Shrestha insisted that the rally as well as the closure of transport, industries, businesses and schools would be "peaceful" but there are fears about violence as the authorities have put security forces on "high alert". "I am afraid that there may be violence during the protests. There must be peace so that we can earn our bread by working without any worries," said Karna Bahadur Lama, a labourer. The deadlock showed that the consensus seen during the peace process and to end the monarchy was turning into confrontation which could jeopardize moves to bring stability to one of the world's poorest countries. "Political parties and their leaders including the Maoists will be seen as collectively failing to lead the peace process," said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the daily, Rajdhani. "Altogether political system will lose its credibility." Diplomats urged parties to avoid confrontation and engage in dialogue. "This is a very critical moment for all political parties to work together ... try to find a consensus and avoid a constitutional crisis," U.S. Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Robert Blake told reporters in Kathmandu during a visit this week. The constituent assembly has until May 28 to ready the new constitution but the government may miss the deadline leaving a political vacuum. Some analysts say the sticking point behind the stalemate was how to settle the future of more than 19,000 Maoist former fighters -- Maoists want them to join the security forces while the government refu
