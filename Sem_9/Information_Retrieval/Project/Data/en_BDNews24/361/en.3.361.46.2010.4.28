<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)  A court in Dhaka has summoned five senior Jamaat-e-Islami leaders, including the party's chief Matiur Rahman Nizami to appear before the judge on June 29 in a case accusing them of hurting religious sentiment. Metropolitan Judge Mehedi Hasan Talukdar issued the second summons on Wednesday as the accused did not appear before the court on the pre-scheduled date and the court officials reported their failure to deliver the earlier summons. The court has also rejected a plea from the plaintiff in the case - Bangladesh Tariqat Federation secretary general Syed Rezaul Haque Chandpuri - to issue an arrest order against the five. The same court issued the first summons on March 30, after the case was filed nine days earlier. The case cited Dhaka City Jamaat amir Rafiqul Islam Khan's comparison of Nizami to Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) at a Mar 17 meeting of pro-Jamaat student front Islami Chhatra Shibir in the city. Various newspapers on Mar 18 reported Khan saying that the prophet in his lifetime was "tortured, falsified and conspired against" and "the same is happening in the case of Nizami". Others accused in the case are Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, executive committee member Delwar Hossain Saidee and the chief of Jamaat's Dhaka Metropolitan (South) unit ASM Yahia. b
