<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)--Labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain says readymade garment workers will get their remuneration under new salary structure within three months and asked them to calm down. He said a new wage board will be formed with necessary reforms to the salary structure. The announcement came in the wake of the recent worker unrests taking place in Dhaka, Gazipur and Narayanganj over the last couple of days demanding pay rise. The minister also admitted that the existing wage structure is not compatible with the current situation. The minimum wage of a RMG worker, set three years back, is TK 1,664. Mosharraf was presiding over a meeting on 'Crisis Management Cell'formed to resolve complications and unrest in the RMG sectorat his office on Wednesday. State minister for labour Monnujan Sufian, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar, acting labour secretary Nurul Haque, BGMEA's acting president Nasir Uddin Chowdhury and an apparel factory owner Anisul Haque Sinha, , among others, attended the meeting. "The minimum wage is in no way well-suited with the current situation," the minister told reporters. "It must be consistent with the price of daily essentials and inflation rate." He said the workers would get wage under the new salary structure before Ramadan. "The new wage board will finalise the salary structure by three months. The ministry will then announce it after having the proposal from the board and will implement it," the minister added. Mosharraf urged the workers to not get instigated by any quarters and said 'a certain political cluster' was trying to create trouble cashing in on the workers' dissatisfaction. "Measures will be taken against those masterminds," he said without elaborating. "And strict steps will be launched against the workers too, if needed," he added. BGMEA leader Nasir said the workers were not the rivals of the owners. "So the owners accepted the new board within the span of three years." Urging the workers to refrain from destructive work, Nasir said the destruction of the factories will also affect the workers as well as the owners. He asked for stern actions if there is more unrest even after announcement of reforms to the salary structure. bdne
