 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  Raw material supply to the Lafarge cement plant at Chhatak, Sunamganj is unlikely to resume soon. India's Supreme Court on Monday refused to lift a ban on limestone mining by the French multi-national in the north-eastern Indian state of Meghalaya. A Special Forest Bench of the apex court of India  comprising Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan and Justices S H Kapadia and Aftab Alam  said that it would not accept a report that the Indian environment ministry (MoEF) had recently filed stating that it had given go-ahead to Lafarge on some pre-conditions. "Till the time appropriate reports are submitted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, we are not inclined to accept the report of MoEF and permit the mining," the court said. The court was of the view that the MoEF report had not appreciated the recommendations of an expert committee that had called for comprehensive bio-engineering plan, periodical assessment of flora and fauna and a time bound plan for biodiversity conservation of the area. The court said it would consider lifting the stay order on mining only after the conditions mentioned in the report of the expert committee were fulfilled. That committee wants Lafarge to submit detailed comprehensive bio-engineering plan of the area as per the suggestion of the Indian Government's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. It also wanted the company to make periodical assessment of flora and fauna of the area including a time bound plan for conservation as recommended in the digital mapping report of the mining area. The apex court asked for a comprehensive bio-diversity conservation plan with a provision of time bound implementation to be prepared by the state government of Meghalaya and the fund should be provided by Lafarge in a time-bound manner. Lafarge was also asked to implement Surface Miner Technology to reduce environmental impact as recommended in the digital mapping report. Lafarge had earlier told the court that it was ready to pay Indian Rupees (INR) 600 million (Tk 936 million) for recreating the forest cover denuded by its limestone mining. It had also agreed to pay approximately INR 300 million annually for the two million tonnes of limestone it mines every year from Nongtrai in Meghalaya for development of the area and welfare of local people. The Indian government itself had mooted the proposal before a bench of the country's Supreme Court that Lafarge would pay for undoing the damage caused to the environment of the ecologically fragile area due to its limestone mining as well as for overall development of the region. The Supreme Court had on Feb 5 passed the order to temporarily halt limestone mining by Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited (LUMPL) at Nongtrai in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. The LUMPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Lafarge Surma Cement Limited (LSCL). The LUMPL had earlier been transporting limestone from Nongtrai to the cement plant of the LSCL and Spanish company Cementos Molins at Chhatak by a 17 kilometre long cross-border conveyer belt. The LSCL plant at Chhatak has a annual capacity of 1.5 tonnes of cement. The Supreme Court halted mining on a plea from a local indigenous organisation that exploitation of natural resources by Lafarge at Nongtrai was posing a threat to environment and changing rainfall pattern in the eco-fragile area. Nongtrai is in the vicinity of Cherrapunji, which had once received maximum rainfall in the world and had earned the sobriquet  the wettest place on earth. The Shella Joint Action Committee (SJAC), a local organisation, had filed a lawsuit alleging that rainfall in and around Nongtrai had drastically come down due to large-scale denudation of forest due to limestone mining by Lafarge. The Supreme Court on March 29 last ruled that it would not permit Lafarge to resume limestone mining without a fresh Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) done on the basis of the new guidelines of the Indian Government's Central Empowered Committee. A task force of the Indian MoEF carried out the fresh EIA. The report of the task force said: "Mining is not having any discernible adverse effect on human health. Samples of water, ambient air quality and stack emissions from crushing units were examined while the mine was in operation and all the parameters were within the prescribed limits." Indian government had told the Supreme Court on March 24 that the latter's order halting mining and supply of limestone from Meghalaya to Lafarge's cement plant in Bangladesh is disturbing the bilateral relation between the two neighbours. India's attorney general, G E Vahanvati, had told the court that the order to halt limestone mining had hit production at Lafarge's US $255 million state-of-the-art plant at Chhatak. Lafarge too had told the Supreme Court that Bangladesh government had written to the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka on March 2 expressing concern over halting of limestone mining and supply to the cement plant at Chhatak. The SJAC had alleged that Lafarge had been operating in a destructive way that would have long-term implications on people of Meghalaya and north-eastern India and their control over indigenous lands and right to use the resources in a sustainable way. The Indian MoEF in April 2007 stopped the LUMPL's operation in Nongtrai. The Supreme Court in an interim order on November 23, 2007 had allowed the company to continue mining. The SJAC had pointed out that while large-scale denudation of forest had lessened rainfall, what added to the problem was the fact that rainwater flowed off instead of being retained in the hilly stretch. The organisation had alleged that LUMPL had obtained environmental clearance by misrepresenting to the Indian Government that it would carry out mining in "wasteland and non-forest area consisting mainly of barren land, and rocks" although the area had thick forest. It had also alleged that tribal lands had been transferred to the LUMPL by the state government of Meghalaya for mining in violation of laws of the land. The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribal individual or entities. Lafarge in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on March 16 admitted that it had mortgaged tribal lands in Meghalaya to international banks to secure a loan of US $153 million to finance its plant in Chhatak. It, however, claimed that the mortgage as security to offshore lenders was approved by the reserve Bank of India  the central bank of the country  in March 2005
