<TITLE> EU calls emergency summit as Greece crisis deepens </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ATHENS (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Greece's debt hit near-pariah status Wednesday as fears of a default jolted markets and global finance leaders sought to press key governments to join a rescue operation. The European Union called a crisis summit as the mounting debt emergency threatened to suck in Portugal and other high-deficit nations. Discontent grew in Greece with new strikes erupting and protesters blocking tourists on one cruise ship. Greece acted to stop speculators operating on the Athens stock exchange as the interest rate it has to pay to borrow money hit 11.1 percent, only trailing Pakistan and Venezuela in the world's highest interest payers. Government efforts to meet a May 19 deadline to repay nine billion euros (12 billion dollars) took a critical new blow when the Standard and Poor's ratings agency downgraded its debt to junk status on Tuesday. Authorities responded by declaring a two-month ban on short-selling -- the sale of securities or commodity futures not actually owned by a seller who hopes to buy them back later at a lower price. Such speculation usually intensifies during a financial crisis. Standard and Poor's also slashed Portugal's rating and markets around the world took fright at the new threat to the tentative recovery from recession. The Tokyo stock market fell 2.57 percent and the main European markets were down about 2.0 percent on Wednesday. Europe and New York shares had already suffered Tuesday. With the euro falling to a 12-month low of less than 1.32 to the dollar, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said leaders from the 16 nations using the single currency would meet in Brussels around May 10 to try to agree a massive rescue operation. Speaking at an EU-Japan summit in Tokyo, Van Rompuy said there was "no question" of Greece defaulting and insisted that talks were advancing to enable Greece to tap up to 45 billion euros in loans from the EU and the International Monetary Fund. A Greek government source said that Athen was "negotiating" the precise amount the IMF could lend, following reports the global lender could boost its contribution by 10 billion euros. European leaders face difficult talks and Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou accused Europe of dragging its feet over the aid. He warned that the May 19 deadline was "crucial." IMF and World Bank chiefs Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Robert Zoellick and European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet were among financial leaders in Berlin on Wednesday seeking to convince the German government to give firm support to the bailout. They were to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel later Wednesday. Germany would be the biggest contributor to any EU fund, but helping a country which has let its public deficit hit 13.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to EU figures, is hugely unpopular in Germany, which will hold key regional elections on May 9. Greece would probably never repay any of the loans that Germany makes, top German economist Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the Ifo institute and a government advisor, said in comments which fueled the controversy. The S&P downgrade of Greek means certain investors such as pension funds can no longer buy Greek bonds. But the Greek government also faces intense pressure at home, with the General Workers Confederation announcing a general strike for May 5 against "neo-liberal blackmail" by the EU and IMF. Greek radio technicians launched a 48-hour strike on Wednesday, halting news broadcasts, while disgruntled applicants for civil sector jobs protested outside the finance ministry and teachers also launched stoppages. On Tuesday, a Communist protest blocked nearly 1,000 tourists at Piraeus harbour, delaying their cruise ship's departure by around 10 hours. The Portuguese stock market plunged 5.71 percent in early trade Wednesday, a day after its credit rating was slashed two notches to A- amid fears it could follow Greece into a debt crisis. Standard & Poor's said Portugal's outlook was negative because of the country's fiscal and economic structural weaknesses. "It is a decisive moment. The country must respond to this attack from the markets," Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said after the Lisbon market also fell more than five percent on Tuesday. But the Portugal downgrade, a weak showing by an Italian bond issue and a 4.19 percent fall in Spanish stocks has added to investor alarm. "There is a contagion effect from Greece," said Estefania Ponte, head of the economy and strategy department at BNP Paribas Fortis in Madrid. "Greece, Portugal and Spain are in the line of fi
