 BEIJING, Apil 30 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  A farmer attacked children with a hammer at a primary school in eastern China on Friday before fatally setting himself on fire in the latest in a wave of apparent copy-cat attacks, state media said. The rampage in Shandong province left five children and a teacher hurt but in stable condition, Xinhua news agency said, as China ordered stepped up security at schools nationwide to prevent further attacks. Before the incident, China had seen three stabbing frenzies at schools in the past month, including two this week alone, by mentally disturbed adults that left eight children dead and nearly 50 injured. The attacks underscore how China -- which has enjoyed lower violent crime rates than the West -- faces a growing public safety threat from disgruntled individuals amid rising mental illness rates and looser social controls. In the Shandong attack, farmer Wang Yonglai broke through a gate at the Shangzhuang Primary School in Weifang city with his motorcycle and began hitting children with the hammer. He also used it to strike the foot of one teacher who tried to block him, Xinhua said. Wang then poured petrol over himself and ignited it while holding two of the children in his arms. Teachers pulled the children to safety and the man died at the scene, the report said. The Ministry of Education on Friday issued an "urgent" notice calling on schools to strengthen security, tighten restrictions on campus visitors and devise emergency plans. "We must establish a safety first, prevention first concept," the ministry said in the notice, posted on its website. On Thursday, a jobless man injured 29 children and three adults with a knife used to slaughter pigs in an attack at a kindergarten in the eastern city of Taixing. Police said the man was angry about a "series of business and personal humiliations", according to Xinhua. A day earlier, a 33-year-old teacher on sick leave due to mental problems injured 15 students and a teacher in a knife attack at a primary school in southern China's Guangdong province. The assailants in both of those attacks were arrested and all victims were said to be out of life-threatening condition. The Guangdong attack occurred just hours after authorities in Fujian province in the southeast executed a former doctor for stabbing to death eight children and injuring five others on March 23 in a fit of rage after he split with his girlfriend. Authorities across China have already begun implementing measures to strengthen security at schools, reports from around the country said. They included increased police patrols near school grounds, and tighter monitoring of people known to be mentally ill. Police in a western district of Beijing have distributed 200 pitchfork-like implements to schools, for use by campus security and teachers to keep any attackers at bay, the Beijing News reported. Violent crime has increased in China as tight controls on society have been loosened in concert with the country's transition from a state-planned to a capitalist economy. Studies also have cited a rise in mental disorders, some linked to stress as society becomes more fast-paced and old communist-era supports were scrapped. A study last year estimated that 173 million adults in China have some type of mental disorder -- 91 percent of whom had never received professional he
