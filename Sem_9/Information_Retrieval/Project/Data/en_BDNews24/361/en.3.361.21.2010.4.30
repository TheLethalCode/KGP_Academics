<TITLE> Thai hospital near protest evacuates patients </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A hospital in Bangkok evacuated some of its patients on Friday after protesters forced their way into the grounds to look for soldiers they thought were there preparing an attack. More than 200 "red shirt" protesters had burst into the grounds of Chulalongkorn University Hospital, located next to the encampment of anti-government protesters, late on Thursday. They found no soldiers and left after roaming for an hour through the grounds, the lobby and car parks, some carrying wooden staves. Some wanted to return on Friday to make sure there were no troops but "red shirt" leaders ruled it out. "We have told them it was an inappropriate move. We truly apologise for any inconvenience caused. Some were very concerned the hospital was harbouring troops," Weng Tojirakarn told Reuters. The incursion raised concerns about how much control the leaders have over their followers, especially the "red shirt guards" in charge of security at the sprawling protest site. The hospital is near the Silom business district, scene of deadly clashes on April 22. It evacuated some patients from late Thursday but hospital director Adisorn Patradul said it would remain open and many in-patients who cannot be moved would stay. Hospital management denies there are troops on its site, but thousands of soldiers and riot police are in the area to contain a seven-week-old protest movement aimed at forcing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and hold elections. Tension remains high in Bangkok after a soldier was killed on Wednesday in a clash on a suburban highway packed with vehicles. The violence is taking its toll on the economy. On Thursday, the central bank raised its forecast for growth this year to 4.3-5.8 percent, but said it would have been nearly a percentage point higher without the unrest. The raised estimate was due to a strong first quarter, but the Bank of Thailand warned that political violence in April had hurt tourism, consumption and investment, and that would have an impact on second-quarter gross domestic product. Tourism accounts for 6 percent of the economy and employs 15 percent of the workforce. Arrivals at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport have fallen by a third since the violence broke out. After being big buyers in February and March, foreign investors have sold 8.5 billion baht ($263 million) of stock over the past six sessions. Standard Chartered Bank said on Friday it expected further inflows into stocks when political tension eased and that was bullish for the Thai currency, the baht. But Kim Eng Securities, Thailand's top brokerage, warned that investors may still be underestimating the impact unrest is having on economic growth. "With 60 percent of GDP growth hinging on consumption, there is downside risk," it said. DEFIANT The "red shirt" supporters of ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra remain defiant in their encampment in a ritzy shopping district, whose malls have been forced to close for a month. "We are ready for them to come to get us. Let's see how many of us they have to kill to satisfy them," said Saman Chantikul, 50, a fruit seller. "We are not going anywhere until this government listens to us." In all, 27 people have died and nearly a thousand have been injured in seven weeks of increasingly violent protests. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said troops at checkpoints on roads leading into the area would stop people bringing in weapons and might discourage more from going in. But red shirt leader Weng expected more protesters to join the mostly rural and urban poor seeking to oust the government. "We believe victory is near," he said on Thursday to cheers from thousands in their camp behind barricades made of tyres, sharpened bamboo poles, barbed wire and chunks of concrete. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban acknowledged on Thursday it would be hard to forcibly eject the red shirts because many women and children are among them. About 300 supporters from a rival protest group, the "yellow shirts", went to Prime Mminister Abhisit Vejjajiva's office on Thursday to demand military action to disperse the red shirts. "The red shirts have created a state within a state and they are getting away with it with impunity," said Suriyasai Katasila, a spokesman for the group, which closed down Bangkok's main airport for a week in 2008 and helped bring down a pro-Thaksin government. No one has been prosecuted for the airport blockade. Hopes of a deal to end the violence faded last weekend after British-born, Oxford-educated Abhisit rejected a red shirt proposal for an election in three months, saying he would not negotiate in the face of threats. The red shirts oppose what they say is the unelected royalist elite that controls Thailand and broadly backs Thaksin, who was toppled in a coup in 2006 but before that built up a following among the poor through rural development and welfare policies. The former telecoms tycoon was convicted in absentia on corruption-related charges and lives abroad to avoid j
