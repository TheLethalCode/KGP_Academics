<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27(bdnews24.com) - Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said that BNP was taking its time to launch an anti-government movement in order to let the new generation understand more about Awami League. Khaleda Zia made the comment following a press conference at her Gulshan office on Tuesday where she also rejected the Bhola election result and condemned the government decision to stop channel 1. She said, "Neither Bangladeshis nor foreigners have any confidence in the government," adding that the programme for movement would be announced after a divisional rally. "We are taking time to let the new generation understand what type of object the Awami League is," she said Khaleda also condemned the government decision to stop channel 1 and demanded that it be allowed to restart immediately. Rejecting the result of Bhola-3 by-election, Khaleda said, "No election was held in Bhola. EC failed to hold free and fair election there." "The commission is controversial. They should quit if they have any sense of responsibility," she said. Khaleda claimed, "Hafiz Uddin would have won if a fair election was held." Alleging that the incumbent government is not telling the truth about power generation, the BNP chief said, "The government did not generate a single megawatt of electricity during their one and half year rule." They are lying when they say that no power was generated during our regime, she said, adding that they could not beat the Awami League in lies. Venting her grievance over the closure of channel 1, Khaleda said, "Channel 1 was closed with a lame excuse. The government has closed the channel as more people watch the channel." "They did not think even for a single moment about the fate of 400 employees. Today they have become unemployed," she said Khaleda reiterated that this government should take steps to try the illegal government installed by Fakhruddin and Moinuddin. "Where ever they stay, they will be tried after bringing them back home," she said, adding that the 'illegal care-taker' played games with the people as well as the army. Khaleda criticised the government for price increases of daily necessities, unstable condition in the garment industries, extortion, tender manipulation and oppression on women. The press conference was also attended by BNP standing committee member Abdul Moin Khan, and vice-president Abdullah Al Noman.
