 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government's revenue collection has exceeded its target in the first three quarters of the current fiscal albeit by a slight margin. Officials of the National Board of Revenue said on Tuesday that income tax revenues had exceeded the target by 2.2 percent, and the VAT by 1.82 percent. The government earned 41, 648.23 crore against a target of Tk 41,474.88 crore between July 2009 and March 2010. Over the same period in the last fiscal the government's revenues amounted to Tk 35,203.34 crore. Revenues in the current fiscal grew by an impressive 18.31 percent. The growth in VAT is 25.66 percent and 20.10 percent in income tax. Earnings from import tariff saw a growth of 11.84 percent with Tk 16,342 crore, falling short of target by just 1.46 percent. National Board of Revenue chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed told a press conference that global meltdown and lower imports were the main reasons for the poor performance in this sector. However the NBR boss was confident about meeting the target of earning Tk 61,000 core by the end of the year. MONEY WHITENING According to the NBR officials, some 53 people have whitened their undisclosed income amounting to Tk 47.20 crore in four sectors. The amount is very little, the NBR chief noted. "We have up to June 30. We hope that many undisclosed incomes will be legalised within this period," he said. Most of the black money has been whitened in the capital market. Some 16 people have legalised Tk 17 crore. Some six people have whitened Tk 13.50 crore by setting up new industries and investing in the infrastructure, two people have whitened money of Tk 11 crore in repairing, modernising and extending old industries. Some 29 people have legalised money amounting to Tk 5.60 crore in real estate.
