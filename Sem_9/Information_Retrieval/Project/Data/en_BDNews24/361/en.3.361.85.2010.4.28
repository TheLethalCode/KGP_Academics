 Sunamganj, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  7,000 hectares of Boro crops have been submerged by water in the Sunamganj's haor areas as a crop protection dyke collapsed due to pressure from flood water. A sudden rush of water from the upper stream caused by torrential rainfall overflowed Ahammodkhali crop protection embankment and flooded the Sonir Haor in Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj on Tuesday. Nure Alam Siddiqui, officer of the upazila agriculture extension department, said that the the loss due to the flood is nearly Tk 30 crores. Tahirpur Upazila Council chairman Anisul Hoque pointed a finger at the role of water development board contractors. He added that the area should be declared an 'affected area.' The haor (water-body) is one of the largest in the area, covering land in three upazilas of the district. At least 34 of the 37 haors in the district have been flooded since the beginning of April, inundating nearly 148,000 hectares of paddy fields. However, the district water development board estimates show only 52,000 hectares were being flooded. bdnews24.co
