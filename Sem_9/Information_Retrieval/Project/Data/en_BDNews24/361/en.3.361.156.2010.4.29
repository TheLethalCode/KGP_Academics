<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)-- A special BDR court in Dhaka will frame on Nov 22 charges against 256 border guards of the hospital unit, accused of involvement in the Feb 25-26, 2009 Pilkhana mutiny. Outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who heads the panel of judges, set the date and adjourned the court until then. The special court-6, set up at the Darbar Hall at the paramilitary force's Pilkhana headquarters, began at around 10:30am and ended an hour later. All the accused were present before the court. Prosecutor Lt Col SMA Al Muyid, who presented charges against the accused, said that 84 members of the hospital unit were present during the mutiny and were directly involved with the rebellion. He said 16 members defied the commander's order, as many members did not come forward to save officials of the unit and 55 others left the unit without the permission of the commander. Eighty members looted weapons and ammunition and 38 took arms at their hands, 85 members did not try to stop the mutiny and 55 did not play any active role. Nine members provoked the hospital patients to join in the mutiny. Among them, one person was involved in more than one crime. Col Muyid named Torab Hossain Khan and Monoranjan among those who had led others in concealing the dead bodies. BDR DG Islam asked Torab what he was doing during the mutiny. Torab said in his reply that he was at the west gate of the Darbar Hall from 2pm to 5pm on Feb 25 and helped in removing 40-42 bodies. He was asked whether he could recognise anybody. Torab said he could recognise the then director general Major General Shakil Ahmed. Among the mutineers there were some patients, the prosecutor said. He said one mutineer named Nishan Molla had gone to the hospital's operation theatre to shoot at the doctors. One Sepoy appealed to him not to kill the doctors. Then he went out, prosecutor Muyid said. Islam asked Mollah whether that was true and he denied it. The prosecutor said Havilder Humayun Kabir asked for spirit from ward master Nayek Hashem Uddin to burn the bodies. He said the employees of the hospital unit, led by subeder Maj Ramendranath Biswas, had taken arms at their hands. The director general said this is the first and the last time that the special court is trying the mutiny cases. Changes are coming to the laws, he said. Gen Islam also asked the accused to appear before the court on Nov 22 with the same appearance they had on Feb 25 last year. The court began proceedings on Wednesday. Prosecutor Muyid said on Wednesday that four doctors were killed during the mutiny and female doctors were not even spared from torture. The Pilkhana mutiny saw over 70 people killed, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. The six special courts have been trying charges of mutiny, loot and arson. In the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts. bdn
