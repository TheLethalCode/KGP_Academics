 Pabna, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com) - Police arrested 19 people in a clash with Pabna University of Science and Technology students demanding a reduction in their admission fee. At least 20 were injured in the incident which took place on Monday. The students wanted to have the student's union and library fee excluded from the admission fee as the university did not have either a student's union or a library. On Monday morning, a six member committee including the VC Mojaffar Hossain and proctor Kamaruzzaman sat with the students. The VC said that as soon as they have been allocated land, the construction work of students' union and library building will start. But, as there was no agreement between the two sides, the students decided to hold a demonstration. The officer in charge of the sadr police station Matiar Rahman told reporters that the students tried to barricade the Nagarbari-Pabna on Monday noon, but a troop of police led by him persuaded the students to remove it.. The police claim that when the students returned to the campus, they started a rampage and the police were forced to start a baton charge. The OC said, "In the nearly one and a half hours clash, 20 people were injured including some police". Among the injured, Abdul Matin, 21, Kazi Alvi, 22, Shahin, 21, Abul Bashar, 22, Shahriar, 21, Sanowar Hossain, 23, Amjad Hossain, 21, and Rashid, 22, were admitted in Pabna general hospital. OC Matiar and sub inspector Majibar Rahman also received first aid in the same hospital. The arrested students are: Ekhlas, Qoafa, Rubel, Nabiul, Ruhul, Miajul, Rejaul Karim, Shamim, Arif, Alim, Raju, Rakib, Mahmudul, Ajmal, Anwar, Imran, Abdur Rahman, Shabuj and Fahim. Police superintendent Jamil Ahmed told bdnews24.com that a case will be filed against them for vandalising and breaking government property. bdnews24
