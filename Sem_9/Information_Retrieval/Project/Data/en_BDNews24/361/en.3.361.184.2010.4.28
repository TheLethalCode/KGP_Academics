 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir is not a part of Jamaat-e-Islami, claimed a delegation of the religious fundamentalist party on Wednesday. The Jamaat delegation made the claim at a meeting with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda at his office. The delegation said this through a letter relating to the comments of Jamaat, signed by Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojahid, the general secretary of the organisation. Before this, the EC had asked Jamaat for its comments regarding its connection to Chhatra Shibir in a letter on March 18. Jamaat-e-Islami on Wednesday informed the EC in writing that Shibir was not an organisation of Jamaat and claimed that the party had not violated the Election Commission regulations. Despite the claims, Chhatra Shibir has been the student wing of the fundamentalist party and is still widely perceived to be inherently linked with its mother organisation. Their integral link is quite evident since top Jamaat leaders attend different rallies and take part in the processions organised by Chhatra Shibir. In Rajshahi University, a Chhatra League activist was killed in a clash with the Chhatra Shibir, in which the police detained several Jamaat members including the city's Jamaat chief. The detained Shibir activists from the university gave statements quite openly admitting that central Jamaat leaders including the secretary general has spoken to the Shibir leaders over phone during the clash. Election commissioners Mohammad Sahul Hossain and Shakawat Hossain were present at the time. Advocate Jashim Uddin, the law secretary of the party, Ijjat Ali, a member of central election committee, Dhaka city secretary Hamidur Rahman Azad and law secretary of Dhaka city Kamal Uddin were among the delegates. Awami League, the ruling government, and the main opposition BNP also informed the Election Commission that Chhatra League and Chhatra Dal, respectively, were not part of the main organisations. bdnew
