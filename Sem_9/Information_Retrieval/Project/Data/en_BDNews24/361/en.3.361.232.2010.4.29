<TITLE> Miracle leaves Milan standing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com) Miracles rarely happen, but on Thursday, Chandpur court might have been a witness to one. Former BNP state minister Ehsanul Haque Milan entered the court in a wheel-chair but left on foot. The cause of this remarkable recovery remains a mysterywhich not even Milan could explain. Milan came to the court in a microbus guarded by police and was wheelchaired into the court. After staying there for 10 minutes, he got up out his wheelchair and went on foot to the police vehicle and got in. The rather dramatic incident tickled the humour of those present wondering whether this court house could become a new shrine. Milan told the reporters present in the court that the government had filed false cases against him and now they were trying to kill him by keeping him in jail. He also claimed that although he was very ill, he was sent back to Comilla jail without being provided proper treatment. The former state minister had been brought to Chandpur Judicial Magistrate's Court from Comilla jail in relation to three cases. The judge Md Asaduzzaman Nur, however, was not present at the court, and May 16 and May 30 was fixed as the new date Milan is facing 12 charges. bdnews24.c
