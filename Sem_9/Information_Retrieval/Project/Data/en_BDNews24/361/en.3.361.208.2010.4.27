<TITLE> Lib Dems open to Labour coalition after UK election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Britain's third party, which could hold the balance of power after next week's election, on Tuesday laid open the possibility of a coalition with the Labour party if it dropped its leader, Gordon Brown. Surveys indicate no party will secure an overall parliamentary majority on May 6 for the first time since 1974 -- a result Prime Minister Brown's Labour party and his main rivals, the Conservatives, are desperate to avoid. Such an outcome would be a boon for the long-overshadowed Liberal Democrats, or Lib Dems, whose support could be pivotal in forming a new government. The centrist party -- which has jumped into second from third place in the popular vote in many polls -- and centre-left Labour are seen as potential partners. But weekend comments from Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg suggested he would reject Labour if they came third in percentage terms. For a graphic of polls, click r.reuters.com/fyx59j Britain's winner-takes-all voting system means Labour will almost certainly get more seats than the Lib Dems, and could even outscore the centre-right Conservatives, with a smaller national percentage of votes. Speaking on BBC radio on Tuesday, Clegg indicated that he would not work with Gordon Brown as prime minister, but had not ruled out an alliance with his Labour party, which has been in power since 1997. "I think many people ... would find it a bit peculiar that someone could remain in Number 10 (the prime minister's residence) even though they've come last in terms of the votes cast," he said. David Cameron's Conservatives have tried to stem the Lib Dem surge by arguing that a vote for them would leave Brown, whose star has waned since he became prime minister in 2007, in power. However, Clegg's party has repeatedly said it would work with whichever party gains the biggest mandate from the public, which is more likely to be the Conservative party. The Conservatives have consistently led in the polls, but their lead has shrunk in recent months, and in the last 12 days it has been threatened by a surge in support for the Lib Dems after Clegg's strong performance in televised debates. The Conservatives are urging voters to give them a decisive victory to avoid a "hung parliament" with no absolute majority. They say this would unnerve financial markets, which want urgent action to cut the budget deficit, now over 11 percent of GDP. SOCIAL POLICIES Party spokesmen took to the airwaves on Tuesday to tout their social policies, but with public spending expected to be slashed whoever wins, parties have been reluctant to risk voter wrath by clearly identifying the extent of cuts. "Of course every party knows that we are going in for a period which is going to present a very tough public spending climate," Labour's Business Secretary Peter Mandelson told reporters at a news conference on child services. "That means that the choices that we make, the priorities we choose, the way in which we switch spending ... those are the bread and butter of this election," he said during a heated exchange with reporters eager to know where the axe will fall. Cameron gave a speech in London on knife crime, flanked by television actress Brooke Kinsella, whose teenage brother was stabbed to death in the capital in 2008. Fear of crime is often cited as one of the highest priorities for vot
