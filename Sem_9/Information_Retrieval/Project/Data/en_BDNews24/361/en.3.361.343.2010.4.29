 DUBAI, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Preparations for the London 2012 Olympics have not been dragged into the bitter election campaigning in Britain, with organisers confident of continued good relations with the party that wins next week's polls. "The Olympic Games have not tumbled from the lips of a single politician during this campaign," London Games chief Sebastian Coe told a small group of reporters on Thursday. "They have not become a political football." Britain is holding a parliamentary election on May 6, with the ruling Labour Party trailing the main opposition Conservatives in the polls, hinting at a potential change in the country's leadership two years before the Olympics.

Nothing specific," he said. Coe said organisers would also "very soon" finalise their venue plan with the relocation of rhythmic gymnastics and badminton. He also said organisers would unveil the mascot of the Games well before July 27, two years to the day of the Games opening, with sales to start on that day. The IOC caught a first glimpse of the tightly-guarded secret and approved it on Thursday. Coe refused, however, to reveal any details other than the IOC liking what they saw.
