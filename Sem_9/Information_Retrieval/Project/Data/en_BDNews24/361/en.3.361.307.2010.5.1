<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)--Awami League acting general secretary Mahbub-ul-Alam Hanif has warned opposition BNP against mistaking the tolerance of the ruling party for weakness. He sounded the warning on Friday after BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain had said earlier in the day that India wanted tokeep this government in power to advance its own interests. Delawar referred to prime minister Sheikh Hasina's meeting with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the just-concluded SAARC summit, where she also met Pakistan prime minister Syed Yousuf Raja Gilani and the Maldives president Mohamed Nashid. Hanif said in a statement: "There is no shirking the responsibility of the misdeeds (of BNP) by making provocative comments." He said an identified group was making every effort through newspaper write-ups and television talk shows "to impede the progress of the democratic government." BNP leaders are trying to mislead the countrymen by resorting to falsehood, he said and added that legal actions should be taken against them in the interest of the people. bd
