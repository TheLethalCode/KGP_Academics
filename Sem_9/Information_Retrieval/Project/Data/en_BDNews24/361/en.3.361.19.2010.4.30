 Pabna, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)At least 20 activists of Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami were injured as the police foiled their rally in Pabna on Friday. To avoid the bar over holding rallies inside the town, Jamaat decided to hold it at the residence of the party's nayeb-e-amir Abdus Sobhan at Zahirpur of Rajapur just outside the town. The police, led by Pabna Sadr police chief Matiar Rahman, charged the Jamaat activists with baton and dispersed them, who were making instigating statements from the rally which might have sparked untoward situation, police officials said. The district authorities on Thursday enforced a Section 144 in Pabna town to avoid a probable clash between Jamaat-e-Islami with pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League and Juba League over holding rallies at the same place and at the same time. Jamaat later organised a media conference at Sobhan's house where they said the police had attacked them without any provocation. Sobhan claimed that Chhatra League and Juba League had brought out demonstrations inside the town, but the police did not stop them. Pabna district Awami league president M Saidul Haque Chunnu told bdnews24.com that Jamaat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami and Sobhan had already been branded as war criminals. Jamaat would not be able to hold meeting on Pabna's soil until a single activist of Awami League was alive, he declared. Pabna police superintendent Jamil Ahmed said on Thursday that the decision to bar rallies was imposed to avoid untoward situation as both sides had announced programmes for Friday morning. The ruling party wings at 8:30pm on Thursday called a protest procession at the same place to prevent the Jamaat programme. bdne
