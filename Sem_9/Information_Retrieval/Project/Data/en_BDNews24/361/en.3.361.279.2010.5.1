 BERLIN, May 1(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an interview to be published on Sunday she would welcome a contribution from Germany's private sector to support a Greek rescue package. "I would very much welcome the voluntary participation from banks," Merkel said, according to advance excerpts of the interview to appear on Sunday in Bild am Sonntag. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef Ackermann is helping coordinate German private sector efforts to support the rescue package, a senior banking source told Reuters on Friday. The move would make it easier for political leaders to sell a bailout to the German public ahead of a key state election.

German banks have the second-biggest exposure to Greece after France. In a previous effort to help stabilise Greece's stretched finances, Ackermann met Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou in Athens in February. Germany is preparing to agree to contribute to a euro zone/International Monetary Fund aid package for debt-stricken Greece once IMF and European officials have agreed an austerity package for Athens. Berlin expects that to happen this weekend. Schaeuble said aid for Greece could involve banks. Merkel's coalition government is under pressure from Germany's largest opposition party, the Social Democrats (SPD), to bring banks into a solution. While Merkel's government does not need the SPD's support to get parliamentary approval for Germany's contribution to the aid package, the opposition party could slow down the process -- a scenario the ruling coalition wants to av
