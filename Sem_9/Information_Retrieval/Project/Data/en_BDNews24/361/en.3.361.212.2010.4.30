 Syed Nahas Pasha London, April 30 (bdnews24.com)--Over one million Commonwealth citizens living in the UK could vote and swing next week's British general election. A new figures published by The Royal Commonwealth Society suggest that Commonwealth citizens are potentially representing more than 2 percent of the UK electorate (roughly 45 million) and sometimes clustered in key marginal seats. All adult citizens of Commonwealth countries, who are resident in the UK (even if they are not British citizens), are eligible to vote in UK parliamentary general elections. By contrast, most citizens of the European Union (except those from Cyprus and Malta) are unable to vote in UK national elections. The Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS) estimates are based on data from the Labour Force Survey for the last quarter of 2009. The figure covers nationals of Commonwealth countries, of voting age, living in the UK. It does not include British citizens of Commonwealth origin. The biggest groups of Commonwealth nationals resident in the UK come from India, Pakistan and South Africa. More than half a million citizens from these three countries alone are eligible to vote in the UK. These communities are concentrated largely in West London, with sizeable clusters in Leicester, Bradford and Birmingham. Key marginal seats, such as Hampstead and Kilburn or Ealing Central and Acton, could be decided by their votes. This eligibility is based on long-standing ties between the UK and Commonwealth members. British citizens enjoy similar reciprocal rights in countries such as Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, and Trinidad & Tobago. Dr Danny Sriskandarajah, director of the RCS, said: "People often muse that the Commonwealth is no longer relevant to the UK but our research shows that it is very much alive--and voting. "Immigrants won't just be under the election microscope, they'll be wielding it too. A good million of them will be scrutinising what British politicians can offer them ahead of next week's election. While these voter rights represent the deep and important ties between Britain and the Commonwealth, they will almost certainly be included in any review of electoral reform by a new UK governme
