<TITLE> PMO alarmed at tender, women violence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)--The prime minister's office has acknowledged that "tender manipulation, tender snatching, extortion and criminal activities" by political parties have reached "an intolerable level throughout the country." The admission is contained in a letter, obtained exclusively by bdnews24.com, signed by Mollah Waheduzzan, secretary to the PMO, and addressed to home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar. The letter, dated Wednesday April 28, 2010 and titled "Criminal activities of members of political organisations" also acknowledges that "eve teasing and violence against women, including female students, is also increasing." While the letter does not refer to any particular political party  and itself suggests that "many political parties and their associate bodies" are involved  it goes on to say that the government is facing "a very embarrassing situation because of the unbridled rise of these activities." There is little doubt that the finger is being pointed at the ruling Awami League and its affiliate bodies, who have been accused of indulging in these illegal acts since the party came to power little over a year ago. Waheduzzan says that in light of this situation, the prime minister has called "for stern action" against those involved in these activities." The three-paragraph letter says that "the electronic and print media in particular and the people in general are now vocal against these illegal activities." In reference to violence against women by the political parties, it says, "These kinds of activities are foiling the efforts to empower woman and maintain social discipline, which is against the government's declared policy." The letter concludes that, "In these circumstances, the [prime minister] has ordered that stern actions must be taken against all kinds of tender manipulation, extortion and criminal activities" as well as "remaining strict against any violence against woman and female students." It says that the "law should be enforced without considering the political identity of the criminal." The letter, however, mentions no time frame as to when the action would be taken, or how long it would take to enforce the law and bring the "intolerable situation" under control. Independent observers say that such stern warnings by the prime minister would be seen as another empty bluster or rhetoric unless immediate exemplary actions are taken against the perpetrators. bdnews24
