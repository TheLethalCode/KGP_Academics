 KIEV, April 29 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Prosecutors have opened a criminal probe into the fighting that broke out in Ukraine's parliament this week during a debate over a Russian naval base, a spokesman for Kiev prosecutors said Thursday. "The Kiev prosecutors have opened a criminal enquiry into the hooliganism carried out by a group of deputies in the Verkhovna Rada," Myroslava Mushka, a spokeswoman for prosecutors in the Ukrainian capital, told AFP. In a chaotic parliamentary session on Tuesday, pro-Western opposition lawmakers hurled eggs and smoke bombs while fistfights broke out in the benches. The tumult broke out as the Verkhovna Rada was debating ratification of a controversial deal to extend the lease of a Russian naval base on Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula for 25 more years. Pro-Western opposition parties considered the deal a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and a selling-out of national interests to the country's giant neighbour Russia. However the parliament ultimately ratified the agreement, which had been signed the previous week by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev. Yanukovych on Thursday signed the parliament's bill ratifying the agreement, completing the ratification process in Ukraine. In a statement, Yanukovych hailed the agreement on the Russian base as a breakthrough in ties between Kiev and Moscow after they fell into a deep chill under his predecessor, the staunchly pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko. "After five years of shaping Russia into the image of the enemy, it was not easy to restore the Russian leadership's trust of Ukraine. But I succeeded in doing this," Yanukovych said in a statement. He also lashed out at pro-Western opposition parties, warning that they risked destabilizing Ukraine. "They need war. The last events in the Verkhovna Rada showed that political adventurers are ready to throw smoke bombs not only in the hall of parliament, but at all of Ukraine," Yanukovych said. The base agreement extends the lease allowing Russia to maintain its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol for another 25 years past 2017, with the option of another five year extension after 2042. In exchange for the lease extension, Russia granted Ukraine a 30 percent discount on natural gas imports, which is estimated to be worth 40 billion dollars over 10 years. The gas discount is expected to boost Ukraine's efforts to recover from a crushing economic crisis that saw its GDP shrink 15 percent last year. Russia had long been seeking to keep its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, but under Yushchenko's presidency, Ukraine insisted that the fleet would need to leave after the expiration of the previous lease in 2017. Yanukovych took office in February after Yushchenko was resoundingly defeated in first-round presidential elections in Janua
