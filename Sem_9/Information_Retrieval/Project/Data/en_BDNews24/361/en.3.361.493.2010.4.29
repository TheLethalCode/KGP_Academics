 Pabna, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  Section 144 has been enforced in Pabna town to avoid a probable clash between Jamaat-e-Islami with Chhatra League and Juba League over holding rallies. The decision, announced at 9:30pm, will be effective until further moves are made, Pabna police super Jamil Ahmed said. He said the decision was imposed to avoid untoward situation as both sides had announced programmes for Friday morning at the same place and same time. Jamaat scheduled its members' rally at Doel Centre and Doi Bazar of the town on Friday morning, where the nayebe ameer Abdus Sobhan is supposed to be present. The ruling party wings at 8:30pm on Thursday called a protest procession at the same place to prevent the Jamaat programme. District AL vice president Rezaul Karim Laal said, "They (Jamaat) will not be allowed to stage a rally in Pabna as long as a single AL supporter is living."
