 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  Some 19 upgraded live bird markets are set to be opened across the country with USAID assistance. According to the US aid agency the upgraded markets would ensure safe poultry products for the consumers. USAID officials said that poultry hygiene had been a matter of concern for Bangladesh since 2007 when the avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu broke out. In an attempt to address the needs arising from avian flu, an upgraded live bird market was inaugurated in New Market area on Tuesday under a USAID funded project called 'Improved Bio-Security and Hygiene production, collection points and Live Bird Markets (LBM)'. The funding agency said that market infrastructure has been developed to ensure poultry hygiene. Besides, cleaning and disinfection equipment have been provided to the traders. The markets would also have a trained team of cleaners to regularly wash, clean and disinfect the markets. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) worked with the Dhaka City Corporation and the market committees to upgrade the facilities. "It would make cleaning and disinfection of the market easier," the FAO country representative Ad Spijkers told the inauguration ceremony held at New Market. According to him, cleaner markets will help reduce the chance of disease spreading to customers, other markets and poultry farms. The pilot project would be implemented in 19 locations as models. "This project should be a part of the government's initiative to improve hygienic conditions of the market," said Spijkers adding that markets in general are tough to manage. Renovation of five markets in Dhaka has already been completed under the US$ 575,000 project (about Tk 40 million) and the remaining 14 will be done within a few months, according to a statemen
