 WASHINGTON, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- US President Barack Obama assured Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Monday of Washington's "unshakeable" commitment to the Jewish state's security, despite tensions over Israeli settlement building.

Gibbs also said Obama called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to wish him a speedy recovery from recent surgery and that they discussed "the importance of creating an atmosphere for peace in the Middle East." Egypt is considered a key player in any broader Israeli-Arab peace efforts. Earlier on Monday, the White House released a statement from Jones apologizing for a joke he made about a "Jewish merchant" and a Taliban fighter during a speech on Wednesday to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "I wish that I had not made this off-the-cuff joke at the top of my remarks, and I apologize to anyone who was offended by it," Jones said.
