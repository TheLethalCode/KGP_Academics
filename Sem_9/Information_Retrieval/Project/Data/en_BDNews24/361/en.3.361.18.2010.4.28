 KARACHI, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Famed Pakistani paceman Wasim Akram tipped India and Pakistan on Wednesday as joint favourites to win the World Twenty20, saying the sub-continental giants have the talent and passion to triumph. Pakistan will defend their title in the third edition of the World Twenty20, which starts in the West Indies on Friday. India won the first edition held in South Africa in 2007. Wasim said both India and Pakistan are eager to win. "Pakistan have been starved of cricket, so they have the thirst to win the title again," Wasim said before leaving for New Delhi where he is booked as an expert television commentator the World Twenty20. Wasim said Pakistan have a leader in Shahid Afridi. "You need someone like Afridi as captain in Twenty20 cricket. He has aggression needed in a leader and in a short Twenty20 match he will always sparkle," said Wasim, a member of Pakistan's 1992 World Cup winning team. He said Pakistan can rise to the occasion despite being short on international cricket. "Pakistan has played very limited international cricket and their players were not in the Indian league, then they have off-field problems resulting in bans, but whenever there is a World Cup Pakistani players rise to the occasion. "Look at the available talent, Afridi can single-handedly win a Twenty20 match as he is equally lethal with bat and ball, and then the depth in bowling makes Pakistan favourites." Wasim said India was also eager to win. "What I have seen is a remarkable passion in the Indian players as well as in the public to win this title, and they too have a very good team," he said. The famous left-arm paceman, who has never played a Twenty20 international as the format started after his 2003 retirement, took 414 Test and 502 one-day wickets, and also played for Lancashire county with distinction. "You cannot rule out an Indo-Pak final, which will do a world of good for international cricket." Pakistan is placed in Group A alongwith Bangladesh and Australia, while India is in Group C with South Africa and Afghanistan. Two teams from each of four groups will qualify for Super Eight Stages. Wasim said Australia and South Africa were also strong. "Australia and South Africa are also capable of winning but the nature of the West Indies pitches make Pakistan and India favourites, because they will help sub-continent spinners," said Wasim. "But to win a Twenty20 match you need to play good cricket for three and a half hours because the match can swing with one good performance, so teams on their toes all the time have good chances," said W
