 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  The historic May Day is being observed in Bangladesh along with the rest of the world on Saturday with the pledge to establish the rights of workers. The day is observed to commemorate the struggle of workers for their rights. On May 1, 1886, ten workers were killed when police opened fine on a demonstration in the US city of Chicago near Hay Market demanding an eight rather than a 12 hour working day. But that sacrifice ultimately led to the authorities yielding to the workers' demand and the eight-hour day has come to be introduced universally. On July 14, 1889 in Paris, an international workers' rally declared May 1 as the International Workers Solidarity Day in recognition of the Chicago workers' sacrifice and achievement and since 1890, the day has been observed globally as the International Workers Solidarity Day. In Bangladesh, the day is a public holiday. All industries and factories remain closed. Red flags have been hoisted at the offices of the political organisations. Worker organisations are hosting various programmes marking the day including processions, discussion sessions, cultural events and film exhibitions. Roads in the capital have been decorated with placards, banners and festoons. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and chief opposition leader Khaleda Zia gave separate addresses marking the day. The prime minister inaugurated a programme marking the day at the National Osmani Memorial Auditorium at around 10am. Bangladesh Television is broadcasting the programme, organised by labour and employment ministry. Jatiya Sramik League, the workers wing of the government party, brought out a procession after a meeting at Bangabandhu Avenue at around 10am. Jatiyabadi Sramik Dal, the workers wing of the main opposition party, will also take out a similar procession from their Naya Paltan office. bdnews
