 Thimphu, April 29 (bdnews24.com)--The SAARC leaders have stressed the need for a regional response to face climate change, but failed to take a resolution on legally binding emission cuts for the polluters. They also failed to take a unified position on the next round of climate negotiations in Cancun, Mexico later this year. At the insistence of host Bhutan, the SAARC member states set climate change as the central theme of the 16th summit. Thimphu also called for a common SAARC position at the next climate negotiation at Mexico. Eight top South Asian leaders said the "principle of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" will be the basis for an agreed outcome in the global climate negotiations. At the concluding session of the SAARC summit here on Thursday, the regional grouping adopted the first-ever statement on climate change. The statement said the SAARC countries are prone to climate change and face the challenges of ensuring development and combating negative impacts of climate change. The statement said the secretary general will take up measures for conducting a study to measure the scale of negative impacts of climate change in the region. Experts say the SAARC statement has referred to some positions taken by the developing countries such as China, India and Brazil. All seven countries other than India at the climate negotiation in Copenhagen demanded legally binding measures for the polluters following the expiry of the present Kyoto Protocol in 2012. Developed countries also tried to strike a deal on legally binding emission cut measures. But emerging economies such China, India and Brazil rejected the legally binding measures saying they would not compromise their development efforts which made them big polluters. They said the developed copuntries have caused the climate change for their increasing economic activities, but now ask the developing countries to slash energy consumption, the main cause of Earth-warning greenhouse gas emissions. "An agreed outcome of the global negotiations must emerge from an inclusive, transparent, transparent, open and democratic process of negotiations," said the statement. "South Asia could benefit from cooperative regional initiatives and approaches, exchange of experiences, knowledge, transfer of technology, best practices to address the challenges posed by climate change," it said. The statement called for creation of a SAARC body to deal climate change in addition to the present SAARC committee on environment. The leaders also authorised creation of three initiatives--mountain initiative, monsoon initiative and marine initiative--aimed at preserving and projecting different environment of the region. The statement said the leaders set a target of planting 10 million trees in the member countries in five years to 2015. It stressed that member countries should incorporate science-based materials in the educational curricula for better understanding of climate change.
