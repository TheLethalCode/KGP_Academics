 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government has asked the readymade garments owners to introduce trade unions in their industry. "Each factory should have a trade union. Otherwise the problems of the garment factories won't be solved," state minister for labour Munnuzan Sufian said at a programme on Saturday marking May Day. She asked the leaders of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association to take relevant initiatives to bring this about. Trade unions are internationally recognised as the appropriate bodies to represent workers and to bargain with the employers to achieve common goals including better workplaces and conditions - but the country's prime export sector does not allow it. Leaders of workers' organisations have for a long period been demanding the introduction of trade unions in garment factories - but it has not happened due to reluctance of the owners, the leaders allege. Abdul Matin Master, president of the pro-ruling Jatiya Sramik League, made a similar demand at the programme held at the Osmani Memorial Auditorium. "Workers of other kinds of factories can pursue trade union. Why not the readymade garment workers?" he asked. The leader also demanded fair wages for workers. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was the chief guest, asked both employers and workers of the garment factories to play an active role in protecting the industry. She told the workers: "You should be responsible for the maintenance and safety of the industry that provides your livelihood." She also asked the owners to be compassionate to the workers. Garment workers in Mirpur and Narayanganj last week took to the streets on several occasions over demands for a minimum wage of Tk 5,000 and payments of other bonuses and allowances
