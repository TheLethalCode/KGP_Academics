<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com) Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan stressed the need for awareness raising amongst workers and support from the owners in reducing occupational hazards. He was speaking at a seminar marking 'Occupational Health and Safety Day 2010' on Wednesday at the national press club. He noted that heath and safety of workers is related to production and development; so it is important to ensure these are provided at work places. Terming the present government as 'labour friendly', the minister said that the government is committed to ensuring welfare and rights of the workers. He also mentioned that a committee has been formed to set the minimum wage and the process is underway to amend the 'Labour Law  2006.' He also said that the last 'four party alliance' government closed many industrial plants during their tenure - but that the current government is now trying to re-start these factories in order to create employment. The seminar titled 'Emerging Risk and New Pattern of Prevention in a Changing World of Work' was organised by Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Foundation, a non-government organisation.
