 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned to capital Dhaka on Friday after attending the 16th SAARC summit in Bhutan which came to a close the day before. She arrived on a plane of Druk Air, the state carrier of Bhutan, at Shahjalal International Airport at midday. Maldivian president Mohamed Nashid was also with Hasina on the flight. Nashid left Bangladesh after holding a bilateral meeting with Hasina at the VIP lounge of the airport. Deputy leader of parliament Sayeda Sajeda Chowdhury, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury, prime minister's adviser HT Imam and other high-ranking government officials received Hasina at the airport. The prime minister left for Bhutan's capital Thimpu on Apr 27. Hasina, along with other leaders of the member countries, addressed the summit at the inaugural session of the summit the next day. She stressed creating a common power grid for the SAARC region and also expressed commitment against the use of Bangladesh territory for launching terrorism elsewhere. The summit later adopted an Indian proposal for a roadmap to create a SAARC market for electricity. Hasina met with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh and Pakistan premier Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani on the sidelines of the summit. Bhutan, for the first time after establishment of SAARC in 1985, hosted a summit. This year the main issue of the summit was climate change. SAARC foreign ministers also signed a deal on trade in services and a convention on environment cooperation. The deals will come into effect after ratification by all members. The South Asian leaders accepted a Bangladesh proposal for inclusion of the SAARC charter of democracy, but failed to take a resolution on legally binding emission cuts for the polluters. They could not take a unified position, either, on the next round of climate negotiations in Cancun, Mexico later this year.
