 WASHINGTON, April 30 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  The US economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the first three months of this year, the Commerce Department said Friday, reinforcing hopes of a sustained economic recovery as consumer spending ticked up. The first estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) was just below market expectations for growth of 3.3 percent, but marked the third consecutive quarter of economic expansion. The report was seen as further evidence that the world's largest economy is slowly recovering from the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. The rate of growth was well down on the final quarter of 2009, when GDP was estimated at 5.6 percent, the strongest growth in six years. Despite this, market-watchers took solace from news that household consumption -- traditionally a key driver of the US economy -- was up 3.6 percent. "Consumers spent a lot more on everything," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. Consumer spending was at its highest level since the start of 2007, before an economic collapse that cost more than eight million US jobs. Spending on long-lasting durable goods jumped 11.3 percent, well up on the previous quarter. Spending on services also increased to the quickest rate since the first quarter of 2007. "The increase in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures," the Labor Department said. Companies also continued to rebuild their inventories, pushing growth higher. According to Dean Barker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research that is "the first increase in inventories since the first quarter of 2008." But that was offset by increased imports and reduced government spending. The biggest hit came from a fall in government spending, which was down 3.8 percent at state and local level, as authorities struggled to balance their books. Although positive, some fear the current rate of growth is not enough to sustain a robust recovery. The figures were seen as "further confirming the end of the recession and that the recovery is only moderate and disappointing," said Peter Morici of the University of Maryland. "Looking ahead, data are not encouraging. After such a long and damaging recession, we should expect several quarters of five percent growth." Some analysts predict that positive growth might end later this year, or will not be enough to cut into near double-digit job growth. "Unless the pace of growth picks up significantly we will see high unemployment rates for years to come," said Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute. "If we grew at the 3.2 percent rate that characterized the past three months for next three years, we would see unemployment rates higher than were reached at any time during the 2001 recessio
