 ATHENS, April 30 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  The Greek prime minister urged his country to accept unpopular spending cuts Friday, warning that the nation's survival was at stake as the government closed in on an international debt bailout. Prime Minister George Papandreou made his appeal hours after fresh protests over austerity measures demanded by creditors in return for a European Union-IMF rescue deal which officials expect to conclude this weekend. Amid mounting social tensions expected to surge during labour day parades on Saturday and a general strike on Wednesday, Papandreou told the Greek parliament: "Today what is most important is the survival of the nation. "The measures which we must take, economic measures, are necessary for the protection of our country, for our survival, for our future so that we can stand firmly on our feet," he said. "It's a patriotic responsibility which we undertake no matter what the political cost." Greece, whose public deficit rose to an estimated 13.6 percent of gross domestic product last year, is racing to beat a May 19 deadline to secure funding that avoids a devastating debt default. German politicians say the loan package could be worth as much as 120 billion euros (160 billion dollars) over three years. A Greek government source said a deal would be announced by Sunday. Officials said European finance ministers could meet Sunday to seal their side of any accord, although a final agreement is subject to parliamentary votes in some EU states. Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said Greece, the EU, and the International Monetary Fund were "very close to a positive agreement." "We hope in the coming days to be able to wrap up the whole negotiations so that we can announce basic elements of the programme and the financing mechanism," he told an annual conference organised by The Economist magazine. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said he was confident a deal would be made "in the next days" and would stop the Greek debt crisis from spreading to other weak eurozone economies. "We believe that these solutions will be conducive to our actions and will prevent further possible effects of the contagion," Barroso said in Beijing. Papandreou vowed to protect poorer groups, after a night of violent protests in Athens against the cutbacks and the EU and IMF. "We are holding tough negotiations to protect what we can for the weak and the middle class in our country," he said. According to union officials who spoke to Papandreou, the IMF and EU are demanding wage cuts, lower pensions and higher taxes. The bailout is already deeply unpopular in Greece because of the harsh conditions attached. Police fired tear gas at hundreds of demonstrators trying to march on the finance ministry on Thursday night to protest against the cuts. Further clashes erupted outside parliament. More protests are to be held Saturday during traditional May 1 labour day rallies. Some strikes have already been launched and a general stoppage has been called for May 5. Union officials say the EU and IMF have demanded spending cuts of 25 billion euros (33 billion dollars) in the next two years on top of sacrifices already made. While fears persist that the crisis could spread to other heavily indebted European nations, markets appear to have been reassured by the news that some kind of a bailout for Greece was imminent. The interest rate demanded by investors to hold Greek debt dropped below 9.0 percent after soaring above 11 percent earlier this week. The yield on Spanish, Portuguese and Irish bonds also eased. Asian stocks rallied at the end of a tough week and the news also lifted the euro from one-year lows against the dollar. But European shares were down in afternoon trading after rebounding a day earlier. Prospects for a deal improved after German Chancellor Angela Merkel softened her opposition in talks with IMF and European Central Bank leaders on Wednesday. Berlin will be the leading European fund provider but the rescue is deeply unpopular in Germany where regional elections are to be held on May 9. One of the eurozone's newest members, Slovakia, expressed deep reservations about the deal, with Prime Minister Robert Fico warning that Greece should make sacrifices before getting help. "Unless there is some introspection, there won't be anything, no bailout," Fico was quoted as saying by TASR news agency. "It's the future of the euro that's at stake," said Fico, adding that he expected a tense atmosphere at upcoming talks of EU leade
