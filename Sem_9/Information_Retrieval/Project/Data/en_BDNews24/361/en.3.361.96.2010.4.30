 LONDON, 30 April (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair sought to bolster Gordon Brown's faltering election campaign on Friday with an appeal to voters to judge his successor on policy, not personality. Brown's ruling Labour Party trails in third place less than a week before the May 6 general election and he has struggled to regain the initiative after a damaging campaign gaffe when he called a party supporter asking about immigration "bigoted".

Allowing Blair to join the campaign trail is risky. Supporters say he is one of Labour's best leaders, while critics portray him as a fluent, but shallow figure who abandoned his political principles to gain power. His strong popularity early on slumped when he backed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. A million people marched in London against the war and Blair was later accused of exaggerating the evidence that underpinned the case for war. An investigation into claims Labour accepted money from lenders who were later nominated for peerages deepened his unpopularity. He became the first prime minister to be questioned by police in the course of an investigation. Unlike Blair and Conservative rival David Cameron, Brown is seen as a poor media perform
