 Habiganj, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  Nearly a hundred, among them policemen, were injured and one killed in a clash between residents of 10 villages at Olipur near Dhaka-Sylhet highway in Madhabpur upazila on Thursday morning. Both sides used local weapons, including spears and local version of harpoons, during the clash. Yunus Ali, 55, died on the spot from harpoon wounds. Road link between Sylhet and the rest of the country was also snapped as the clash continued for three hours halting traffic. Police fired more than a hundred rounds of rubber bullets and 20 teargas shells to quell the violence that erupted from a conflict over Tempo (improvised autorickshaw) fare. Habiganj's assistant police superintendent Naimul Hasan said trouble had begun from an argument between Olipur village resident Tenu Mia and a villager of Brahmandora over the fare. At one stage, residents of Brahmandora, Bishaura, Puraikala, Noagaon, Soiljura and Keshabpur got together and clashed with residents from Olipur, Suraboi, Nurpur and Purashunda villages following public declarations on speakers of the village mosques, Hasan said. Two platoons of riot police, led by additional police superintendent Zillur Rahman and ASP Naimul Hasan rushed to the spot and bought the situation under control. The injured were admitted to Habiganj Modern Sadar Hospital, Madhabpur Upazila Health Complex and other local union health complexes. Ten critically injured villagers were sent to Dhaka for treatment. bdn
