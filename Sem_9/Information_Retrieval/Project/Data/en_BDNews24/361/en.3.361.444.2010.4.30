<TEXT>
 KARACHI, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan captain Younus Khan has told an appeals judge he wants the country's cricket board to make public the evidence that led to them to impose an indefinite ban on him last month. "Younus not only wants an early resolution to his appeal against the ban but also asked the appeals judge, Irfan Qadir, to direct the PCB to make public all evidence on the basis of which they banned him," his lawyer Ahmed Qayyum told Reuters on Friday. "Younus is adamant that he is innocent and he told the appeals judge he had played diligently and with 100 percent commitment for Pakistan all his life and he didn't deserve the ban," Qayyum said. "Younus also asked the judge to hold his hearing on camera so that everyone knows on what grounds the board has banned him," he added. Irfan Qadir, nominated by the Pakistan Cricket Board's governing council to hear the appeals of six cricketers who were either banned or fined for indiscipline and misconduct on the tour of Australia, held his first hearing on Friday. The PCB banned Younus and Muhammad Yousuf indefinitely and imposed 12-month suspensions and fines of two million rupees each on Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved. Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi and brothers Kamran and Umar Akmal were fined three million rupees each. Yousuf retired from international cricket last month in protest at the ban. The next hearing of Younus's appeal is scheduled for May 8 and the appeals of Malik and Rana take place on May
