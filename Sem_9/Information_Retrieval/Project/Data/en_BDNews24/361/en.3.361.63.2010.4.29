 Sylhet, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com) -- A charge-sheet has been pressed against four activists of the outlawed Hijb-ut-Tahir. They were arrested while distributing handbills of a militant nature in Sylhet in February this year under Anti-Terrorism Act 2009. Kotwali Police Station sub-inspector Rakibuzzman submitted the charge-sheet at the chief judicial magistrates court on Thursday stating that the four, also students of Sylhet Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, were terrorists and a threat to public security. Of them, Farhad Shafi Chowdhury, 19, and Mahfuzur Rahman, 22, were arrested on Feb 5 from near the shrine of Shahjalal, and Ashrafuzzman, 25, and Mushfiqur Rahman, 26, on Feb 7 from the court area when they were distributing handbills. Farhad is a first year student, Mahfuz and Ashraf are second and third year students respectively and Mushfiq is a fourth year student at the engineering unviersity. The government banned the radical Islamist organisation last year. Submitting the charge-sheet, Rakibuzzaman told reporters: "Activities of Hijb-ut-Tahir constitute to threaten the state and the government. They're also a threat to public security." The charge-sheet says that the four were not involved in any political organisation before admission to the university.
