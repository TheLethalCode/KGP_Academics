 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will wage a movement against the government at 'the right time', the party's secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Wednesday. The opposition leader was speaking at a press conference at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. "This government is torturing the opposition leaders in the name of democracy. They are remanding the detained leaders with the police to force them to get confessions," he said. He criticised the government for torturing former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and former deputy minister for education Abdus Salam Pintu. "There is no legal basis of this kind of torture," Delwar said. The joint task-force arrested Pintu and Babar during the past military-backed interim government's regime. The BNP leader claimed that Pintu was not involved in the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on Awami League rally. But the government, 'for a political purpose', is sending him into remand. Concerning the pre and post-poll situation in Bhola-3 constituency, Delwar said: "Bhola was an example of what an Awami League-style election really is like. It was a pre-planned and one-sided election. Voters were prevented from casting their votes." The senior BNP leader also criticised the government move to shut down the private television channel Channel 1. "That was done for political advantage. We demand the channel should be opened immediately," Delwar said. Dhaka Layers' Association president Sanaullah Mia, advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Salahuddin Tuku and others were also present at the briefing. bd
