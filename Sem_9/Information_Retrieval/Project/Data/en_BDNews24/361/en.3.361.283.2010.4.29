<TITLE> South Korea mourns sailors, broods on North's role </TITLE>

 PYEONGTAEK, South Korea, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea on Thursday mourned the loss of 46 sailors who died when a Navy ship sank after a blast widely believed to have been the result of a North Korean torpedo. President Lee Myung-bak, wary of the impact on economic recovery efforts, has signalled Seoul would not retaliate by force, calming investor concerns about escalating tension surrounding Asia's fourth-largest economy. Lee attended the funeral services held at the home base of the navy corvette Cheonan in this west coast port city 200 km (125 miles) from the disputed waters bordering the North where it sank. He awarded each of the dead an Order of Military Merit. Leading the service on a brisk, windy spring morning, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Kim Sung-chan vowed to hunt down the culprits and punish them. "We will weed them out and make them pay the price," Kim said. Lee did not speak at the service. The sailors were killed in what would be one of the deadliest strikes by Pyongyang on its rival since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The North has denied involvement. But a South Korean online news agency said this week the North's ruling Workers' Party had been bragging about the "great revenge" its military had taken against its neighbour, adding to anger in the South where many suspect it was a North Korean torpedo that sank the Cheonan on the night of March 26. North Korea's nominal leader and its parliament chief, Kim Yong-nam, is expected to arrive in China on Thursday to attend the opening of the World Exposition in Shanghai. The sinking is likely to be discussed among some world leaders there. Lee is also going to Shanghai. It will be the first time he will have been near a North Korean leader since taking office more than two years ago and ended years of aid to the South's impoverished neighbour until it stops trying to build nuclear weapons. China, the closest the North can claim to a major ally, has remained low key in the aftermath of the sinking in apparent displeasure at its unruly communist neighbour, reportedly agreeing to put on hold six-country talks it had hosted aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Seoul has said it would issue its final verdict on what caused the ship to sink after an international team of investigators complete their probe. It has not given a date. Lee needs to prevent turning the emotionally charged affair into a weapon for his political opposition at home ahead of June local elections which could, if his ruling party suffers a serious setback, damage his authority and ability to push through promised pro-business reforms. A public opinion poll released this week showed support for Lee inching up slightly to 45 percent and his Grand National Party stretching its lead against the opposition ahead of the June elections. Relations between the two Koreas, still technically at war, have turned increasingly hostile since Lee took office, with the North accusing him of deliberately ruining any chance of peaceful reunification of the peninsula that has been divided for more than half a cent
