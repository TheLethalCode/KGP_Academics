<TITLE> Minister slams WDB for slow work </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  Disaster management minister Abdur Razzak slammed the Water Development Board for not completing the renovation of the embankments even 11 months after Cyclone Aila destroyed them. "WDB is the responsible authority for rebuilding the dykes. But they've delayed the process chasing different formalities," Razzak told reporters after a seminar in the city on Wednesday. "They're doing the work in the eleventh hour and even that that is being damaged by the tides," he added. The minister assumed that around 75 percent of the damaged dykes could have been renovated after the current full moon's effect is over. During this time tides become higher and currents become stronger. "We'll get 12 to 14 days after the full moon. Then we'll be able to ascertain whether the dykes can be rebuilt or not." He also expressed concern over the repair of some dykes in certain unions of the Aila affected areas in the south-west. The seminar, on the trend on regional disparity and poverty in Bangladesh, was jointly organised by Save the Children-UK and Institute of Microfinance (InM). Sazzad Zahir, director of Economic Research Group, presented the keynote paper, where he emphasised on the need to revisit the purpose of poverty measures and define poverty accordingly. He recommended that initiatives needed to be launched to encourage local ownership over data generation and processing. It was argued that regional differences were natural fallouts of economic growth. However, geographic locations of the major pockets suggest that there has been a failure to translate natural resources into viable capital due to our failure in water & flood management in the northwest, haor areas and coastal belt, Zahir mentioned in his paper. He observed that road connectivity had facilitated labour movements as the Dhaka-centric growth, facilitated by biases in allocation of such strategic resources as natural gas, is alleged to have accentuated regional differences. Zahir hoped that the Sixth Five Year Plan would draw up the vision for dispersed growth poles maintaining balance with efficiency in resource use. Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman said, "We're at a new crossroads in terms of poverty and in order to understand poverty, it is important to understand the interface of poverty." He also said that the major challenges remain at the poverty frontier  those not only being in the monga, haor, coastal areas but are also emerging in the urban areas. Professor Abul Barakat stated: "Poverty is not just about per capita income  it is more about the 3D's  distress, deprivation and destitution." He said that poverty could be eradicated but depended on whether this is relative or absolute. Absolute poverty can be eradicated but not relative poverty. ASSISTANCE FOR THE AFFECTED The minister projected that the economy of the Aila-hit areas would be revitalised through agricultural rehabilitation programme after the people are assisted to settle down. He said the affected people have already been listed. "They will be given corrugated iron sheet and money to rebuild their houses." Asked if there was any political leaning during the listing, he said, "The number of receivers is so high that everyone will get the assistance." "So there would be no partisanship." bdn
