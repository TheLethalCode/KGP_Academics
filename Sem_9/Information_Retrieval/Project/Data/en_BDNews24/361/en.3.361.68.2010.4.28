<TITLE> Can Barca pull it off? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain,April 28 - To suggest that Barcelona will have to pull off the mother of all comebacks would be overstepping the mark, but there can be no denial of the fact that the reigning Spanish and European champions will have to stage a dramatic rally in the second leg of their semi-final tie against Inter in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The 3-1 deficit from the first leg at the San Siro last week means that the Catalans will progress to the final if they win 2-0, but a goal from the Nerazzurri will force them to score at last thrice. The last time the two sides met in Barcelona was in the group stages of the Champions League earlier in the season, with Barca winning 2-0. It was a game in which Pep Guardiola's side typified their footballing identity and philosophy as Inter had no answers whatsoever to Barca's creativity, coherence and superior game plan. But things have changed since then, as the Italian champions showed in the first leg when they comprehensively defeating Barca. Barcelona warmed up for this potentially nerve-jangling fixture with a comfortable 3-1 win against Xerez in the Primera Division in Spain on Saturday evening which maintained their one-point advantage over Real Madrid in the race for the Liga title. Barca have a formidable record at home both in the league and in the Champions League: the last time they hosted a side at Camp Nou in a European Cup tie, they won 4-1. That was against Arsenal in the second leg of the quarter-final. Nevertheless, Barcelona will be aware that Inter are a much more intelligent and stronger side than the Premier League team and that the Italians will start as slight favourites. The Inter midfield overran their Barca counterparts in the first leg and the Catalans will be keen to see that they win the battles in the middle of the park from the start. Messi</TEXT>
