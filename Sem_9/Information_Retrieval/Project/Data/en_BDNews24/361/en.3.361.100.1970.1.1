 LONDON, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain must start withdrawing its 9,500 troops from Afghanistan within the next four or five years, opposition Conservative leader David Cameron said on Friday during a campaign rally for next Thursday's election. It was the clearest signal yet of the timetable for withdrawal that the centre-right Conservatives would follow if they win the election. Britain has the second-largest foreign military contingent in Afghanistan after the United States. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has set no timetable for pulling out British troops, but has said Afghan troops will gradually take over security responsibilities as they are trained. "I don't think we should set some sort of artificial deadline, but we've been there already for eight or nine years," Cameron said, answering a question at the rally. "That's already, in my view, a long time. So we can't be there for another eight or nine years. "It's got to be in the next parliament that these troops really start coming home -- as soon as possible but based on success, not an artificial timetable," he said. The term of a British parliament is four or five years. "I want to do everything to try and bring the troops home as soon as we can," he said.

The Conservatives lead in the polls but not by enough to be confident of winning a majority in parliament, raising the chances of an indecisive outcome next week. Cameron's comments on Afghanistan brings the party closer to the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats, whose support the Conservatives may depend on if they fall short of a majority. The Lib Dems say a successful strategy should allow British troops to come home during the next parliament. U.S. President Barack Obama says Washington will begin to withdraw its troops in mid-2011, although U.S. officials say the withdrawal will not be abrupt and its pace will be determined by the capability of Afghan forces. The Dutch ruling coalition fell apart in February over whether to extend the country's military mission in Afghanistan. Canada has said it will withdraw all its 2,800 soldiers from the southern city of Kandahar by the end of 2011. Afghanistan's security forces will need four to five years before they are fully capable of taking over responsibility for security, the country's Defence Ministry said this we
