 Jahangirnagar University, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com) At least six activists of pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League were injured at Jahangirnagar University on Thursday night. The dispute involved two feuding groups of Bangabandhu Hall about congratulating the winning teachers in the university's senate election. Election to the teachers' representatives of JU senate was held on Thursday, the first time in four years. Pro-Awami League teachers won 32 among the total 33 posts. Witnesses said that after the poll result was published at 10pm on Thursday, Bangabandhu Hall Chhatra League leader Samiul Bashir Sami and his followers went to congratulate the victors. On their return to the hall, other Chhaatra league activists, led by SM Shamim, rebuked them for going there. At one stage, both the factions fought each other leaving six of the activists including Sami and Shamim seriously injured. The other injured are Md Sharif (Batch 34 student of History Department), Nazmul Islam (Batch 37 student of Philosophy Department), Tapadeb Bishwas Jitu (Batch 34 student of Botany Department) and Nazmus Sakib (Batch 34 student of Economics Department). All the injured were admitted to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Sami, leader of one faction of Bangabandhu Hall BCL, told bdnews24.com , "We can congratulate our teachers. No one was harmed by that. But Shamim and his loyal activists suddenly attacked us." Shammim, leader of the other faction, told bdnews24.com , "It was Sami along with his armed cadres that attacked us first. We then tried to save ourselves." Later, at midnight, the BCL Pritam group from Mir Mosharraf Hossain Hall came in support of the Shamim group. Subsequently, some other supporters bought the university proctor Arzu Mia and police to the area and the clash came to an end. bdn
