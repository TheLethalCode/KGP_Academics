<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Moudud Ahmed was subjected to a heavily sarcastic attack by senior Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed on Tuesday. "This principled person went to Bhola on Apr 23, knowing full well that the Election Commission had prohibited any outsiders from entering the constituency," he said whilst speaking at a press conference held at the political office of the AL president at Dhanmondi Tuesday afternoon. "On being barred, Moudud pushed a Lt Col of the RAB and a police officer. He hoped that they would retaliate." Tofial went on to say, "How strong is this man's principles that he contested twice from a constituency from two different parties?" "We don't change parties here and there." The BNP's standing committee member had been an Awami League activist during the 1970s. He then moved to the Jatiya party. On losing the 1996 Elections, he immediately switched to the BNP and stood as a candidate in a constituency vacated by Khaleda. But, he lost again. bdn
