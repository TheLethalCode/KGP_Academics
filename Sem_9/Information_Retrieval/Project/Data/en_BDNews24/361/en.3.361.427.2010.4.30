 SEOUL, APRIL 30(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean president Lee Myung-bak held talks with his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao in Shanghai on Friday that touched on security risks caused by the North's suspected attack on a warship from the South. China, the reclusive and impoverished North's biggest benefactor with the most influence in Pyongyang, wants to prevent further tensions that increase the chances of war but is not about to punish its neighbour, analysts said. "The bottom line is that Pyongyang knows that Beijing will not forsake them even if they behave in this provocative manner." said Peter Beck, a specialist on Korean affairs who is a researcher at Stanford University. Lee, who met Hu on the sidelines of the World Expo in Shanghai, has signalled Seoul would not retaliate by force, calming investor concerns over Asia's fourth largest economy. "I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to those who were sacrificed in the Cheonan sinking and to their families," Yonhap news agency quoted Hu as telling Lee. South Korea lost 46 sailors when their ship was attacked last month by what is believed to be a North Korean torpedo in what would be one of the deadliest strikes by Pyongyang since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. South Korea's defence minister told parliament investigators have found a piece of aluminium that appears to be not part of the sunken corvette. Military experts say aluminium debris is consistent with a torpedo attack. Lee has been looking for regional support in the wake of the crisis, which experts say could result in economic and political moves to punish Pyongyang if Seoul formally names it as the culprit. Lee may also have his first face-to-face meeting with a top member of the North's ruling class in Shanghai. The North's nominal number 2 leader Kim Yong-nam, who serves as the face of the government, is also attending the Expo. Analysts say Lee's government, which has cut off once lucrative aid to the North and has few economic means left to hurt Pyongyang, risks pushing the North even closer to China if it decides to act tough. "If the drive to cooperate with China starts producing results, North Korea's policy of ignoring the South will become more blatant, as will its hardline position against the South," said Cho Myung-chul of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, who was formerly an academic in the North. North Korea may also try to raise tensions by resorting to sabre rattling, experts have said. Japan's Asahi newspaper quoted unnamed military sources as saying the North could test fire its mid-range Rodong ballistic missile from its east coast toward Japan some time next month. The Rodong, with an estimate range of up to 1,400 km (870 miles), can hit all of South Korea and most of Japan. The North is barred from test-firing its missiles by UN resoluti
