 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com) The government is set to suspend transmission of Channel 1, founded by controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun. Telecom minister Raziuddin Ahmed Raju suggested almost as much. Rumour of Channel 1 shutting down anytime has spread throughout the media grapevine. Raju said machinery and licence of television channels are not transferable. But Channel 1 had put its machinery to auction. At present, the channel is using instrument that were imported by other companies, the minister said. "The government cannot let this institution run under the circumstances. The channel should be shut down for its offence," the telecom minister said. A number of letters were sent to the private channel in this concern. "But their reply was not satisfactory." Raju said the decision concerning the channel's shut down process would be finalised within a few days. The minister said that the government had no partisan motive behind the decision. "We did not even consider who the owner is. If we had done so, many other channels would also have been closed." Giasuddin Al Mamun, the channel's founder, is known for his close association with BNP chief Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman. Raju said, "The government has taken a rightful decision." Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chairman Ziauddin Ahmed was also present with the minister. bdnew
