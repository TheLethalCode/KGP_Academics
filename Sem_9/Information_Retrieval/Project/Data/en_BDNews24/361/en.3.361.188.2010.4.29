 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh suffered a seven-wicket defeat against England in their final warm-up match at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday ahead of the ICC World Twenty20. Cricinfo adds: The left-arm spinner Michael Yardy was the star of the show with 3 for 20 in his four overs, before Ravi Bopara marked his return to the national side with a calm 62 from 48 balls, to seal the contest with 17 balls to spare. Yardy claimed his first international wicket for almost three years when Mohammad Ashraful was caught down the leg-side, and he doubled his tally as Aftab Ahmed holed out to Tim Bresnan for 8. In his next over, Shakib Al Hasan was bowled for 7, and when Mushfiqur Rahim was crassly run out for 2, the backbone of the innings had been broken, even though Mahmudullah hung around for a useful 38 not out from 31 balls. The run-chase was launched by two Twenty20 debutants, Kieswetter and Michael Lumb, who are set to be England's 16th opening pairing in 26 matches when their tournament proper gets underway against West Indies on Monday. Lumb, however, wasn't able to mark his moment in style - he reached 8 from 10 balls before carving Syed Rasel to point. Kieswetter gave a hint of the fireworks that could follow later in the competition when he blazed a massive six over the imposing 3Ws stand, but on 22 he was bowled neck and crop by a ripper from Shakib that lured him down the track and spun viciously past his flailing bat. But Bopara and the captain Paul Collingwood guarded against any mishaps in a dominant but measured third-wicket stand of 71 in 56 balls. The only anti-climax from England's point of view came when Bopara ran himself out with the scores level, but by then the job had been done. Score Summary Bangladesh: 126-7 in 20 overs (Mahmudullah 38, Ashraful 21, Kayes 14; Yardy 3-20, Anderson 2-23) England: 127-3 in 17.1 overs (Bopara 62, Collingwood 32 n.o ; Shakib 1-23 Rasel 1-23) Result: England won by seven wickets Toss: Bangl
