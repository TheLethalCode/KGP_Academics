<TITLE> HC rules against illegal billboards </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has rejected a petition to stop removal of illegal billboards. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Delwar Hossain on Thursday judged the petition challenging a notice of Dhaka City developer Rajdhani Unnayan Kortipokkho (Rajuk) to remove illegal billboards on the roofs of buildings. Human Rights Organisation and Peace for Bangladesh had submitted a petition on Mar 21, asking for an order to remove all illegal billboards from Dhaka. The court said in the ruling that every illegal billboard is subject to removal. The court then ordered Rajuk and relevant authorities to remove all illegal billboards. Rajuk had advertised on Sep 8, 2007 requesting removal of illegal billboards on roofs of the buildings in Dhaka. Rafiqul Islam, chief of the advertisement firm owners' association, challenged the advertisement in the High Court. Association's lawyer Imtiaz Ahmed said that Rajuk had infringed upon the rights of the petitioner. The lawyer for RAJUK, Manjil Morshed, said that no one was permitted by the law to jeopardise public safety by setting up illegal billboards. After the death of two persons as billboards fell over them on Mar 15, the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), backed by police, began taking them down from Mar 18. But as the Shahbagh Police Station did not cooperate, DCC could not complete its mission. The number of legal billboards and mega signs in the capital is 500. But according to the DCC there are some 2,500 billboards in addition to the legal ones. bdne
