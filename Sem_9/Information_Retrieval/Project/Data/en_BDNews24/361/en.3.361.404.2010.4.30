<TITLE> Possible outcomes in British election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britons go to the polls on Thursday in what is expected to be the closest election since 1992. Following are some possible outcomes in terms of seats for the 650-member parliament and their impact. ONE PARTY WINS OVERALL MAJORITY (326-PLUS SEATS) The centre-right Conservatives lead in opinion polls but most polls see them failing to gaining 116-plus seats they need to guarantee a majority. To do so would require voters switching allegiances in numbers seen only once since World War Two -- in 1997 when Tony Blair won his first landslide victory for Labour. Markets are looking for as clear an outcome as possible to the election and most favour a win for the centre-right Conservatives, who they believe would get to grips quicker with a record budget deficit. It is worth noting that a majority of upwards of 25 seats is normally required to guarantee a stable single-party government. Anything less leaves the ruling party hostage to rebellious MPs. Prime Minister John Major won the 1992 election for the Conservatives with a 21-seat majority. But this unravelled during his five-year rule as the majority was whittled away through MPs' deaths and departures. ONE PARTY WINS 300-PLUS VOTES, BUT NO MAJORITY Polls suggest that the Conservatives could end up in this situation -- the strongest party but barely short of an outright majority. Were that to happen, they could try to govern with support from small nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales on a case-by-case basis. That might be enough to get the emergency budget passed, something the Conservatives plan within the first 50 days in office. However, Conservative leader David Cameron has already targeted Northern Ireland as an area where state spending needs to shrink, and the cost of keeping these groups sweet could prove too high for a lasting alliance. CONSERVATIVES LARGEST PARTY IN "PHOTO FINISH" WITH LABOUR The Conservatives are comfortably ahead of Labour in opinion polls but the arithmetic of the constituency system means Labour could end up with a similar number of seats. The Conservatives could end up with 265-280 seats, with Labour between 250 and 265 and the centrist Liberal Democrats between 80 and 100. The Liberal Democrats have indicated they would work with the party that wins most seats and the largest share of the votes. They would push for reform to a more proportional voting system -- a stumbling block because Conservatives oppose this. The Lib Dems also share Labour's view that spending cuts should wait until economic recovery is assured. The Conservatives want to cut harder and faster than Labour and have identified an additional 6 billion pounds of efficiency savings they say could come in this year. A Conservative-Lib Dem alliance could stop short of a formal coalition, based instead on an agreement to support the government on key issues such as its legislative programme and budget. Markets could take fright if talks drag on for too long after May 7, and there is always the spectre of a fresh election within months if the partners fall out. LABOUR WINS MOST SEATS BUT FALLS SHORT OF MAJORITY Polls put Labour support at under 30 percent but that could still be enough to leave it as the largest party -- even if it finishes third in terms of percentage vote share. This is when things really start to get complicated. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has indicated that he would not work with Prime Minister Gordon Brown under this scenario, but has not closed the door on agreement with Labour under a different leader. That is tricky for two reasons -- firstly the outgoing prime minister has first refusal on trying to form a government and Brown is unwilling to let this go lightly if his party does remain the largest. Secondly, choosing a new Labour leader is a long and complex process, meaning a caretaker successor would have to be hastily installed to negotiate a deal with the Lib Dems. Markets hate uncertainty and this scenario is fraught with many unknowns and potential delays. Ending up with a prime minister who did not lead the parties into the election would look weak and that could also keep markets jittery. One outside possibility is Clegg pushing to be prime minister with a largely Labour cabinet but that too would be fraught with dangers because Clegg is almost certain to have a smaller number of MPs than the other two parti
