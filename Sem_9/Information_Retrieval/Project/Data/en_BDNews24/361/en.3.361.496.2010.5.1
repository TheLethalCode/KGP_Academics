 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has alleged that a third party is involved in the RMG sector unrest. She said addressing a programme marking May Day on Saturday that the government has proof of such instigation by outsiders through the intelligence agencies. "I've come to know that certain quarters are involved with these occurrences." Referring to the recent demonstrations in Mirpur and Narayanganj, Hasina said the government is keeping an eye on them but did not reveal their identity. "But I do have a few names and evidence of what they have done." A common demand at all the demonstrations includes a minimum wage of Tk 5,000 per month. This was the second time that AL president Sheikh Hasina, after forming government, promised to fix minimum wage according to market prices. She made the same promise on May Day last year in a meeting of the Jatiya Sramik League at Paltan Maidan. Labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has already announced that a new minimum wage structure will be declared within the next three months and urged workers to be patient until then. The prime minister urged workers not to be easily influenced by the vested quarters. She assured them that her government is dedicated towards the workers and has already formed a wage commission and a minimum wage board. "We will declare a new scale following the recommendations." Referring to sudden destruction and strikes in the RMG sector, Hasina said failed to understand such activities since damaging factories and destroying their stocks would hardly benefit the workers. She said although initially the owners incurred the losses, it was eventually the country that lost. "Thus it is also your duty to preserve and protect the RMG sector." At the same time, Hasina urged the factory owners to be sympathetic towards their workers. "It is because of the workers that your luxurious lives are possible." The prime minister then reasoned that it was the owner's duty to make sure that the workers got the minimum sustenance. After urging the owners to provide accommodation for workers, the prime minister assured them of government support from its housing allocations. Elaborating on the various government measures to improve the workers' condition for the improvement of workers' condition the prime minister said the government is working to amend the labour law with an eye to protecting workers' interest. Other than this, a regulation to eradicate child labour has also been drawn up and the labour policies would also be modernised. She also pointed out that various steps have been taken for the benefit of 70 lakh Bangladeshis working abroad, including formation of an expatriate bank. Highlighting that she formed the government during a global recession, she said "We have countered conspiracies to raise market prices and have already bought market prices under control." She also said that thousands of workers had been unemployed during the tenure of the former BNP-led government as mills and factories were shut down. The May Day programme was organised by Labour and Employment Ministry at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the capital. The chief guest Sheikh Hasina began her speech remembering the workers who died in the labour movement in America's Chicago in 1886. bdnews24.co
