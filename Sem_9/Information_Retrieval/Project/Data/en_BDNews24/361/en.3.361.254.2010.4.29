 Sirajganj, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Erosion triggered by a sudden rise in water level of the river Jamuna has threatened the Brahmaputra flood control dyke in Sirajganj district. Water Development Board officials said erosion has taken place at different points in the dyke's 17 kilometre area from Meghai in Kazipur upazila to Shimla in Sadar upazila. They said three spars of the dyke  Meghai spar numbers 2 and 3 and Shimla spar number 2 -- might become ineffective anytime due to the high velocity of water and formation of whirlpools. Board officials said 10 spars were built between Singrabari in Kazipur upazila and Shuvogachha in Sadar upazila at a cost of Tk 95 crore during the previous Awami League government to check the Jamuna erosion and divert the river course. But most of the spars have been ineffective, as the board was reluctant to maintain them during the successive four-party alliance government, they said adding that the Shoilabari 'groyn', spanning around one kilometre, has been engulfed by the river. The officials said the board sought an allocation of Tk 27 crore from the government early this year for repairing and rehabilitation of the spars, but have yet to receive any fund. Sirajganj Water Development Board executive engineer Sujoy Chakma, however, said they have taken prompt measures to repair the Meghai spars. "Sand bags have been put on spar number 2 to check erosion. And adequate blocks have been kept piled to protect spar number 3," he said. PROTECTION OF SIRAJGANJ TOWN Meanwhile, Water Resources Minister Romesh Chandra Sen has said dredging in the river Jamuna would start soon for permanent protection of Siranjganj town from erosion. "Permanent protection to Sirajganj town will be ensured in one year through dredging, using 16 dredgers collected from India and Qatar that will change the course of the river," he told journalists Monday evening, after viewing the rehabilitation works in Sirajganj town protection embankment. Asked if the dredging would be effective in high velocity water during full monsoon, the minister said that the "people of Sirajganj will be astonished to see 16 dredgers working together," adding that "a large shoal will be created on the Siranjganj side of the river by the dredging. The shoal itself will protect the town." The minister had assured the people of Sirajganj in July last year that it would shortly start dredging of the river, when 1,000 feet of the town embankment was engulfed by the river. The minister, however, had not kept his commitment; when the Water Development Board had started dredging with only two traditional dredgers they had to stop it due to high current. Board's high officials from Rajshahi, Bogra and Sirajganj and administrative officials accompanied the minister during his visit. bd
