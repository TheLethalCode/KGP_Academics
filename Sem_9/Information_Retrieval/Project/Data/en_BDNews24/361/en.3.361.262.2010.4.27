 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  Ramna thana OC SM Shibli Noman sought forgiveness from a Dhaka court on Monday for failing to comply with the court's order. He appeared at Dhaka's Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court of Mehadi Hasan Talukdar on Monday. Addressing the magistrate, Shibli said that he had misunderstood the court's order. The magistrate on Mar 24 had ordered the OC to accept a case involving allegations against four persons including Md Sharful Alam, the secretary of the fisheries and livestock ministry on different charges including fraud activities, looting and extortion. However Shibli only submitted an investigation report to the court without taking the case as a complaint. The magistrate on Apr 6 ordered the police officer to come to the court in seven days and explain why he did not obey the order. After receiving the OC's apology, the court on Monday again ordered Shibli Noman to take the case as statement of the complaint. The case was filed by one Shorifullah Mazumder, who lives at an apartment owned by the secretary. bdne
