 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)A government policymaker has alleged that the chief of the recently created investigation agency on 1971 crimes against humanity, Abdul Matin, was once an activist of an Islamist student organisation. Prime minister's advisor Alauddin Ahmed made the startling revelation at a roundtable conference organised by media firm 'Vision 24' at Dhaka Reporters Unity office on Friday Ahmed, who advises the head of the government on education and politics, said that Matin was once a presidential contender of a college section of the defunct student organisation Islami Chhatra Shangha, which later became the Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat's top leaders are alleged to have grossly perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the nation's war of independence from Pakistan. "With him heading the agency, it is easy to conceive the future of the trial, the matter should be treated seriously", he said. A tribunal was formed on May 25 for holding trials for crimes against humanity during the 1971 war. A seven-member investigation agency was also constituted with Matin, a former additional secretary to the government. Revealing that one of the agency's members has refused to start work yet, apparently for his lack of confidence in the agency chief, Ahmed said, "He is being persuaded to change his mind." The advisor said he already took the matter up with the prime minister and assured the audience of finding an amicable solution to the controversy surrounding the investigation agency and the prosecution panel. He told the roundtable titled 'Islam, Law and War Criminal Trial in the International Perspective' that if the trials were not held comprehensibly then the entire process would be hampered at every step. Elaborating on the reason for his fear, he said the war criminals and their associates have infiltrated the administration to such extents that they are even hampering the issuing of small circulars. Ahmed also commented that the Bangladesh embassies abroad have not been properly activated to garner support from foreign governments toward holding a fair trial. He also said the government has reports of obstacle being raised in the collection of documentary evidence. The advisor also insisted that the trials would be held during the tenure of this government and there is no scope for ambivalence regarding the government's determination. He urged the younger generations, who believe in the spirit of the liberation war, to "continue their movement for holding the trial and not leave it to the government alone". JSD chief Hasanul Haq Inu, who was present, urged the prime minister to probe the weaknesses and errors in the formation of the investigation agency and prosecution panel. Former Dhaka University vice chancellor AK Azad Chowdhury and Jatiya Party (Ershad) secretary general Sheikh Shahidul Islam, among others, spoke at the roundtable. bdnews2
