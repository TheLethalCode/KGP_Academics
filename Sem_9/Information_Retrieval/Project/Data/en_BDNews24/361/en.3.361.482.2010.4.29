<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  Inflation, food prices and agricultural issues came up as major concerns in a pre-budget discussion on Thursday. The discussion between finance minister AMA Muhith and media editors also stressed the grave issue of power and energy. Touching on the projections for the next fiscal year, Muhith predicted that that economic growth would be around 6.5 percent and inflation will remain "stable". "The size of the budget would be around Tk 1300 billion (1.3 lakh crore) and the annual development program would be of Tk 400 billion (40,000 crore)." He also said that there would be a "slight variation" in the normal procurement policy regarding power and energy. Mahbubul Alam, editor of the daily Independent emphasized the issue of connectivity as it hampers investments and other economic activities of the country. Discussants identified agriculture as a major means of tackling inflation. "Agriculture is the key to controlling food inflation," said Khondokar Maniruzzaman, acting editor of the daily Sangbad. He raised concerns about the recent flash floods. The daily Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamal Dutta said that the differences between what farmers get and what consumers pay should be reduced. He suggested budgetary measures for an efficient agro-marketing system. Channel I head of news, Shaikh Siraj echoed this point. "We should consider setting up a body which will fix the target of farm output as well as handle procurement." He added that the body should be strictly monitored by the government. Going further, Siraj said that the farmers are not happy with the rice price of Tk 17-25 per kg as the cost of irrigation was high this year. He focused on rural-based economic growth, so that farmers can take part in the consumer economy, otherwise any growth would be "flimsy". "The farmers don't have a platform to speak like the RMG workers, though at any moment their anger could erupt." The rise of tobacco farming also came up in the discussion about agriculture. Shaikh Siraj pointed out that about 30,000 hectares of land had gone under tobacco farming in the last year in the districts of Cox's Bazaar and Bandarban. He recommended that maize farming should be promoted as an alternative to tobacco for farmers. "We only produce 30-35 percent of our demand for maize, which is mainly used as poultry feed." Referring to the central bank's recent directive to banks against providing loans for tobacco farming, Financial Express deputy editor Shamsul Haque Jahid said it shows the lack of clarity in the government's policy towards the industry. "The sector contributes a substantial portion of the government revenue." Touching on the crucial power issue, Jahid asked what would be the amount of subsidy provided for power in the next budget. "It would cost the government Tk 13-14 per unit to buy power from rental power plants whereas, the PDB sells on average Tk 3-3.5 per unit." Responding to the issue, Muhith said that there was no other alternative for the government other than paying such a huge amount. "It's a tragic situation," he said. Toufique Imrose Khalidi, editor-in-chief of bdnews24.com questioned the necessity of providing tax-free cars to MPs  and in this was supported by Bhorer Kagoj's Shyamal Dutta. Muhith strongly defended saying that the MPs do need transportation as they are engaged in "public welfare". Responding to the issue, he said that the original decision was to provide cars by the government, but complexities like poor capacity of the government's transportation pool led the decision to allow MP's to import tax free cars. Zero tax on imports of newsprint paper along with VAT exemption, and the withdrawal of tax at source on advertisements was also suggested by the discussants
