 NEW DELHI, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Congress-led government won a key confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday by a stronger-than-expected 84 votes despite the coalition suffering problems from high inflation to a cricket scandal.

The demand for the vote on Tuesday was sparked by the government's decision in February to raise petrol prices by 6 percent and diesel by 7.75 percent, angering opposition parties.
