 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  Police were given four more days to question radical Islamist Golam Mostafa, and member of the banned outfit, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), in an anti-terrorism case on Tuesday. He had earlier been remanded in police custody for four days on Apr 17, before being sent to jail. The order was given by Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Nazrul Islam's following an application from DB inspector Fazlul Huq for a seven day remand. Mostafa was arrested on Apr 16 from Sylhet and is accused of reorganising and strengthening the banned outfit secretly. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque claimed that Mostafa is also wanted in London in relation to offences involving money laundering and terrorism. Haque, a British citizen, came to Bangladesh when the London police sought to arrest him, said the Commissioner. The alleged militant had earlier been arrested on Dec 2, 2007 from a house in the capital's Bashundhara residential area, which is also Dhaka's diplomatic zone. A British passport, a pistol and five jihadist books were also recovered from his possession. Mostafa was sentenced to 17 years in prison in Bangladesh but managed to get bail from the High Court. It is claimed that on his release, he started organising HuJI and was involved in different criminal acts. It is also claimed that he tried to free other HuJI leaders including its top-ranking leader Abdus Salam who is at present behind bars, police said. Mostafa is also said to have directly participated in the war against Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Bangladesh police will request Interpol to provide more information on the alleged militant, the commissioner added. The police, based on Mostafa's information, seized some jihad-related books from his father-in-law's house in the capital's Hazaribagh. bd
