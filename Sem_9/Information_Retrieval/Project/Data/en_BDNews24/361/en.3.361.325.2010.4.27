<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  A South Korean climber on Tuesday became the first woman to scale the world's 14 highest mountains, live television pictures showed, although her record bid has been clouded by a disputed ascent. Footage broadcast in South Korea showed Oh Eun-Sun planting her national flag on the summit of Annapurna, a 8,091-metre (26,545 foot) peak in Nepal -- beating other female competitors racing to collect the 14-summit record. The achievement meant Oh, 44, became the first female climber to claim to have conquered all the world's mountains measuring over 8,000 metres. "Mansae! (Hurrah!)" Oh shouted, waving and bowing towards an accompanying cameraman from South Korea's KBS television. "I am happy and thank you," she said, weeping with joy. In a televised message to her parents, Oh said: "Mama, Papa, I miss you. Now I want to go back home." However, Oh's place in climbing history is far from certain. Last week, her 2009 ascent of Mount Kanchenjunga on the Nepal-Tibet border was thrown into doubt when a leading authority on Himalayan mountaineering said fellow climbers had expressed scepticism. Elizabeth Hawley said Oh's climb would be considered "disputed" as fellow mountaineers, including her chief rival for the record, Edurne Pasaban, had questioned whether she made it to the top. Pasaban, 36, conquered Annapurna earlier this month, becoming the first Spanish woman ever to do so and leaving her with just one more mountain to scale. Pasaban is now heading to Tibet, where she will attempt to climb her last "eight-thousander", Shisha Pangma, the smallest of the 14 peaks at 8,027 metres. Just 18 people had previously made it to the top of the 14 eight-thousanders, which are all in Asia's Himalaya and Karakoram ranges, since Italian climber Reinhold Messner became the first person to do so in 1986. Oh's attempt to secure the record by climbing one of the world's most dangerous peaks sparked a media frenzy in her home country. She was accompanied by another professional mountaineer carrying a camera, and KBS television showed hours of live coverage. Pasaban, is en route to the Shisha Pangma base camp in Tibet after her own successful Annapurna ascent. Her expedition organiser, Anjan Rai of Thamserku Trekking, told AFP that Pasaban was pushing ahead with her schedule. "She is already well acclimatised from Annapurna, so she might be able to do (Shisha Pangma) in three weeks," he said. Next in line for the 14-mountain bid is Austria's Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, who has climbed all but the world's two highest peaks, Everest and K2. The 39-year-old, who climbs without oxygen, is currently acclimatising on Everest, preparing for her ascent of a little-used route up the north f
