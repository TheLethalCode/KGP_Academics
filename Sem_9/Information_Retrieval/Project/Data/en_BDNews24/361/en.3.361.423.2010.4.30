 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com) BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has accused the government of taking control of the trade unions and harassing the pro-opposition workers by transferring and sacking them. In a statement issued on Friday on the eve of the May Day, the opposition leader has called upon the workers across the country to resist the government's steps that are harmful to the national interest. May Day is celebrated since 1890 as a day of solidarity for the working class. "Rather than addressing the problems of the workers, the government is busy gaining control of the trade unions, harassing the supporters of the opposition party by transferring and sacking them," she said. She also accused the government of being more interested in trade rather than production and thus destroying the local industries. Khaleda said the government has taken a strategy of lying to hide their failures by blaming others. She said that her party will stand by the workers in any movement demanding the implementation of election pledges of the government. In her statement, she also said that hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs due to the closure of industries for riling party hooliganism and extortion by party toughs. In 1886, workers in the US city of Chicago came out on the street with demands for appropriate wage and eight-hour working day. Police fired upon the demonstrators killing 10 workers. Three years after the bloody incident, an international conference of the workers in Paris declared May 1 as a day of solidarity for the workers across the nations. bdne
