<TITLE> PM pitches for regional grid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Thimphu, April 28 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has stressed creation of a common power grid within SAARC in her opening speech at the 16th summit of the regional grouping. Kamran Reza Chowdhury reports from Thimphu. In her address to the 16th SAARC summit at Thimphu's Grand Assembly Hall, she also proposed that the SAARC charter should have the provision of promoting democratic governance in the member countries. The prime minister reiterated Bangladesh's commitment not to allow its territory be used against any country. "Recent trends indicate immediate need for cooperation at bilateral, sub-regional, and regional levels to harness each other's capacities and resources," she said. "This includes developing a regional power-grid, harnessing renewable energy sources like hydropower, solar, biofuel, wind, and reducing dependence on fossil fuel," she said. She referred that continuous economic growth in the member countries had resulted in enormous demand for power, which had caused climate change. "At global level, COP-15 at Copenhagen last November has given hope of a comprehensive, long term programme. "There is no need to lock in the key global players in the COP16 at Mexico City later this year for concrete commitment covering green house gas emission cuts, and guaranteeing fund and technology," she said. "At the regional level, a unified approach is of essence, and calls for the SAARC to establish a Himalyan Council in the model of the Arctic Council, for assisting affected countries in the region". The prime minister proposed a regional grid of power as the SAARC countries have the potential to produce hundreds of megawatts of hydroelectricity by using mountainous rivers in India, Bhutan and Nepal. Experts say about 90,000MW from hydro electric projects can be produced in Nepal while Bhutan has the potential to generate 30,000MW. India currently has energy grid connections with Bhutan and Nepal to trade in electricity. Energy-starved Bangladesh has recently started connecting its grid with India to import electricity. Dhaka and Thimphu are in discussion on trade in electricity. The summit will also issue a statement on climate change with an effort of charting out common South Asian position at the climate change negotiation in Mexico. Hasina referred that all the member countries currently have democratically elected government in power and noted that people aspired for democracy. "I believe this sentiment needs to be included in the SAARC charter," said Hasina who was jailed by the immediate-past military-installed interim government in Bangladesh. Diplomatic sources say the council of ministers have accepted a Bangladesh proposal on inclusion of promotion of democracy in the SAARC charter. This is likely to be endorsed by the summit on April 29. Bangladesh has a history of frequent military interventions since the mid-1970's. Prime minister Hasina condemned religious terrorism too. She said, "We categorically reject claims of those who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of Islam, or any other faith to justify violence." "We are also committed against the use of Bangladesh territory for launching terrorism elsewhere," said Hasina who earlier proposed formation of a South Asian Task Force to combat terrorism. She observed that some vested quarters were trying to foil the good intention of the SAARC member states for regional integration. "As SAARC strives at intensifying connectivity to draw member states closer for mutual gains, certain wrong-doers and terrorists are out to undo our good intentions and the growing trust among ourselves," said Hasina. Her party pledged in the last election to work with other South Asian neighbours to combat extremism by forming a South Asian Task Force Against Terrorism. But the proposal is yet to be approved by SAARC. Meanwhile, heads of states and governments of SAARC gathered at the Grand Assembly Hall Wednesday for the two-day summit in the capital of Bhutan, which is for the first time hosting such event. Bhutanese prime minister Lyonchhen Jigmi Y Thinley presided over the opening session of the summit Wednsday. At the outset, Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksha handed over the chairmanship to Bhutan. Afghan president Hamid Karzai, Indian premier Manmohan Singh, the Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed, Nepalese prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, Pakistan prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani and Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksha also delivered their speeches. The leaders will sit again at 4.30 pm at the same venue Thursday for adoption of the Thimphu declaration with 90 points. The summit will also issue a statement on climate change, the central theme of the event.
