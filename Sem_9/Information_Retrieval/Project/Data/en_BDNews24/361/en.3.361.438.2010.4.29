 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  Afroza Abaas, wife of former BNP minister Mirza Abbas, secured bail from the High Court on Thursday in two cases alleging her failure to pay taxes. A High Court bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhab Miah and JBM Hasan issued the order following an application from Afroza. In Sep 2, 2007, during the caretaker government regime, a Dhaka court convicted and sentenced Afroza to five years in jail in relation to the two tax cases  though she was not present in court at the time. When, on April 11 2010 she surrendered herself to the lower court, she was sent to jail. However, she later filed a writ petition with the High Court against the lower court verdict. The court granted her bail in the two cases as her appeals against conviction had not been settled. Advocate Ahsanul Karim stood for the petitioner while deputy attorney general Bhishma Deb Chakrabarty argued for the government. bdne
