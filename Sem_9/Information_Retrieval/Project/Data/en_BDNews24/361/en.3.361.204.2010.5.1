 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, the workers' wing of the main opposition BNP, has accused the government of breaching its electoral pledge by laying-off workers rather than employing them. The organisation's chief Nazrul Islam Khan urged workers to wage a movement against their treatment at a party program marking May Day on Saturday. "The government in its election manifesto promised to provide employment to at least one member of each house. But once it got into power, it forgot its promise," Khan said The Sramik Dal chief said that there was a lack of investment in the country forcing the closure of many factories and industries - with many workers losing their jobs. He did not specify the number of workers who have been laid off or the name of the industries. Expatriate workers are also returning to the country after losing their jobs, he said. To deal with the crisis, Khan urged the workers to unite. Workers who took part in the programme, demanded a rise in the minimum wage to Tk 5,000, the right to trade unions, safe workplaces and the resumption of operations of closed mills and factories. The organisation later bought out a procession from its Naya Paltan headquarters that ended in the Muktangan. bdnews
