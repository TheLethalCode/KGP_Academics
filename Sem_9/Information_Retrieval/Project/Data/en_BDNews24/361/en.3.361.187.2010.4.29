 MILAN, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AS Roma's players and fans will go against everything they hold sacred this weekend when they cheer on bitter rivals Lazio against Inter Milan. Claudio Ranieri's Roma surrendered the Serie A lead to Inter last weekend when they lost for the first time in 25 league matches at home to Sampdoria. Now with three games left, they must first win at Parma on Saturday (1600 GMT) before risking the wrath of the Roman gods by supporting Lazio for the first time in their lives in the home match with Inter on Sunday (1845).

"We've got to believe, the battle for the scudetto is not over," Ranieri told reporters. Treble-chasing Inter will be back in the capital again next Wednesday for the Italian Cup final against who else but Roma. Faltering AC Milan, in third, need a win at home to Fiorentina on Saturday (1845) with Sampdoria four points behind them in the race for the last automatic Champions League berth. Samp, two above Palermo in the fight for fourth spot and a Champions League qualifying round place, host already-relegated Livorno on Sunday (1300). Siena will follow Livorno through the trapdoor if they fail to beat Palermo (1300) or Bologna pick up at least a point at third-bottom Atalanta, who could also go down if they lose and other results go against t
