<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of farmers demonstrated against irregularities in agricultural subsidy distribution at in front of the local Bangladesh Krishi Bank office at Haimchar. They laid siege to the bank from 10am to noon on Thursday. Then the police took control of the situation. The farmers demonstrated after the bank failed to give them the subsidies on several designated dates. The farmers alleged that they had to pay Tk 100 for opening bank accounts and another Tk 100 for getting subsidies. The present government had announced that farmers would be allowed to open accounts for a nominal fee of Tk 10. Some of the farmers named Mosharraf, Ferdous, Jahangir, Harun, Alamgir and Sekandar of South Algi, Kamlapur and Bhingulia area of the upazila said that they had given Tk 100 for opening bank accounts to get the subsidy. But the bank missed between four and five designated dates for subsidy distribution. The farmers complained that they had been told to come to the bank on Thursday morning to get the subsidy. But the bank distributed subsidies only to those who had paid the bank officials from Tk 100-Tk 200. The farmers said that they were allotted Tk 800 in diesel subsidies and had come to the bank stopping their work for the day. Some of the farmers pointed out that many had to forego their daily wage up to Tk 150 per day working as a farm labourer. After harassing them for several days, the bank officials began to give the farmers only Tk 600, which is Tk 200 less than the fixed amount. They alleged that Abdul Hamid, the local bank manager used to take the money through his middlemen. Hamid could not be contacted for reaction in this concern. Syed Ahmed, the acting manager of the bank told bdnews24.com that Tuesday had been designated as the date to distribute money among the farmers. But the date was rescheduled as it coincided for several villages, which the bank officials suggested would have been too much to handle. OC of Haimchar Police Station, Helal Uddin, said that they had deployed police at the spot to avoid any untoward incident. bdnews24
