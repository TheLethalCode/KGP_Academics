 Narayanganj, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  A Narayanganj court on Tuesday gave CID four days to question former deputy minister of the BNP government Abdus Salam Pintu in relation to the bomb attack on the Chashara Awami League office. Arifur Rahman of the Narayanganj Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court granted the remand petition brought by the investigating agency. This application was filed on Nov 25 last year, but the hearing was deferred due to his sickness. Pintu was produced at the court under tight security. This is the fourth time that he has been remanded in police custody. The bomb attack on Chashara AL office on June 16, 2001 left 20 dead and about 50 AL members including former MP Shamim Osman were injured. bdnew
