 LIVERPOOL, England, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Surveying the remains of a season littered with failed domestic and European challenges, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has a clear image of what lies ahead of him. "The future is (Sunday's league match against) Chelsea," Benitez told reporters Thursday after being asked if he was confident he would still be at the Anfield club next season. When asked what came after that: "Er, Hull," he added after watching his side fall to an away goals defeat against Atletico Madrid in their Europa League semi-final. Liverpool's season had promised so much after they finished runners-up to Manchester United last year but despite winning 2-1 Thursday, the 2-2 aggregate defeat extinguished the side's final chance of winning any silverware this campaign.

Seventh-placed Liverpool have just two fixtures remaining and trail fourth-placed Tottenham by two points with the London side having played one match fewer. "We are realistic and we know that it is not easy but we will try and we will see," Benitez said on his side's chances of usurping Spurs. A desperate lack of fire power has crippled their ambitions this season and Benitez is confident that the club, currently up for sale, can attract the right pedigree of player to improve the squad despite a possible absence of European soccer next season. "We will be in the same situation. Liverpool is a massive club, we will try to do our best. I think the name of the club is enough," Benitez said. "In the past, players have said we need maybe three, four or five new players. I agree with th
