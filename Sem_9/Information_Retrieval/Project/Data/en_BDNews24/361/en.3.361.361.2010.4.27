 Pabna, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com) Pabna University of Engineering and Technology has closed for a month on Tuesday after the students clashed with the police for two consecutive days. The university will open again on May 29, said a press release signed by Faruque Hossain Chowdhury, the university's public relations officer. But the university authority said the closure was for summer vacation and had no relation with the students clash. The university students have since Sunday been calling for a reduction in their tuition fees. They reject a Tk 4500 admission fee which included a student's union and library fee even though the university did not have either facility. There were a clash on Monday between students and police which resulted in 28 people injured. The police arrested 19 students and have filed a case against 14 students under the Speedy Trial Act. bdnews24.co
