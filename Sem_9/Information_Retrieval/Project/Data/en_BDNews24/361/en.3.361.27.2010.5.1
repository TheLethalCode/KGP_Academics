 Chittagong, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)--Ten ward councillors have accused Chittagong's mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury for running the city corporation 'according to his whim'. They made the accusation at a press briefing at Chittagong Press Club on Friday. The councillors areJalal Uddin Iqbal, Chowdhury Hassan Muhammad Hassani, Rehena Begum Ranu, Tareq Soleman Selim, Jafar Alam Chowdhury, F Kabir Ahmad Manik, Rekha Alam Chowdhury, Ferdous Begum Munni, Ghias Uddin and Lutfunnesa Dovash Baby. All the councillors are either current or former Awami League activists. Among them, all except Hassan Mahmud Hasni, were once known as the followers of the mayor. The press briefing was arranged to protest the decision to arrange the scheduled monthly meeting, due for Sunday, at the newly built Thandachharhi Resort at Fatehabad in the city. The resort was constructed under the initiative of the CCC. There is an ongoing dispute over the resort's land with Baitus Shorof, a local organisation. The councillors alleged that in the monthly meetings they are barred to discuss different projects undertaken by the corporation. Councillor of Pathorghata ward, Jalal Uddin Iqbal, read out a written statement. Later, Jalal questioned the mayor's role regarding the ownership and transparency in the financial statements of Bijoy TV, Mayor Hajj Kafela and Premier University. Jalal said, "Bijoy TV was launched without approval of the general meeting. Later, we passed it in a general meeting after the mayor and others were arrested in the aftermath of 1/11. "But later we came to know that it is privately owned." He also said specific accounts of the Mayor Hajj Kafela project were never made available to them. Dewan Bazar ward councillor Hasni, replying to a question from journalists, said, "We could never ask about the ownership and financial issues of the Hajj Kafela and the university. "We were rebuked if we had done so," he added. He alleged that the decision to hold the general meeting at the resort was part of a conspiracy to grab the land. The written statement said that a case between the corporation and Baitus Shorof over the ownership of the Thandachharhi Resort is still ongoing. The councillors also criticised the construction of a swimming pool at the historical Laldighi. Councillor Rehena Begum Ranu said, "No tender was called for the construction of the Tk 2 crore swimming pool." The Awami League's Chittagong metropolitan committee is yet to constituted because of a conflict between Mohiuddin, also the city AL president, and Nurul Islam BSC, vice president and MP from Chittagong-8. bdnews
