 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  Police barred a Jamaat-e-Islami protest rally demanding an end to the water and power crisis on Thursday. The rally was set to be held in Muktangon in the afternoon. Meanwhile, regarding the bar, both the police and Jamaat gave contradictory statements. Metropolitan Jamaat chief Rafiqul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com that they had taken permission from the Dhaka City Corporation. But police suddenly charged batons on Jamaat activists as they were preparing for the demonstration, the Jamaat leader claimed. Khan also claimed that police arrested 30 to 35 protesters. However, police said they arrested 25 Jamaat men. Paltan zone assistant commissioner Mahfuzur Rahman claimed that the Jamaat activists arranged the programme without permission of the concerned authorities. "After failing to stage the rally, they tried to gather on different streets of Paltan 'in the name of rally'." "So we arrested 25 of them from different places," the official told bdnews24.com. He also said that legal steps would be taken against those proven guilty. bdnews24.c
