 BARCELONA, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho held court at his old stomping ground on Tuesday, the exuberant Portuguese highlighting the debt of gratitude he owed from his time at Barcelona's Nou Camp. Mourinho, who worked at Barca under Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal in the 1990s, and Inter take a 3-1 advantage into Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg as the Milan club seek a first win in Europe's top competition for 45 years. Mourinho cracked jokes with reporters, paid tribute to his former bosses and even found time to accuse the Catalan club of being obsessed with reaching May's Champions League final at the home of their arch rivals Real Madrid.

The Portuguese was asked the secret of his success in combating Barca's Argentine forward Lionel Messi, who is the top scorer in this season's Champions League but had a quiet game in the first leg.
