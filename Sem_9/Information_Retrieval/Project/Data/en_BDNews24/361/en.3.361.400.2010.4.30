The Boeing 767-300ER aircraft will arrive at the Shahjalal International Airport on Saturday, the company said in a media statement on Friday. This is the first time a B767-300ER has been brought to Bangladesh. The 262-seat new, wide-bodied Boeing will have business and economy class to cater for the clientle. Shayan F Rahman, director, Beximco Group, which owns the majority stake in GMG, said, "This is the beginning of a new era for GMG. With the addition of a new aircraft, GMG will continue to expand its wings across the globe." Beximco has been injecting crores into the airline since it bought a 50 percent stake last June to rev up the wobbling carrier.

The management is also redesigning the company's website to make it become the first Bangladeshi airline to let customers book flights online from anywhere in the world with credit or debit cards. b
