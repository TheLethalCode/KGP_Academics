 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  Rapid Action Battalion and police each arrested a man they claimed to be 'Haider'  the name of the man alleged to be the killer of Dhaka city's Bangshal police station sub-inspector Gautam Kumar Roy. The police officer was shot dead at Dholaikhal on Apr 20 midnight while coming back home after duty. RAB said they arrested "Gautam's killers Zakir Hossain alias Kailya Zakir, 25, and Ali Haider" on Sunday night from the city's Jatrabari and Lalmohan Saha street areas. However, police also claimed that they arrested Gautam's killer Haider, alias Hadi. The two men, who were brought before journalists at a RAB press conference at its headquarters at Kurmitola on Monday afternoon, each blamed the other for the police officer killing. Zakir told reporters: "Haider called me out that night asking for work. As we came on the street at Dholaikhal, Gautam Roy intercepted us and frisked our friend Manik. When he (Gautam) attempted to search me, Zakir shot him. Later, I fled to Comilla." On the other hand, Ali Haider said: "Zakir came to my house and told me to go with him. He was accompanied by Manik. When we came to Lalmohan Saha Street, Goutam searched us. At that point Zakir shot him. And we all fled the scene." However, night guard Mona, 60, witness to Gautam's murder, who was present at the RAB press conference, identified Zakir as the killer. "Kailya Zakir shot Gautam. He shot three rounds of bullet... And Haider fled the seen," he said. But, the night guard said, "Gautam sir intercepted Haider and Manik as soon as they come on the street. He started frisking the two. Then Zakir come out and shot at him." Mona said he had heard that Shamim, who was accompanying Gautam at the time of incident, was shot at, but he did not see him being shot. Haider told journalists that Zakir had a meeting with Shamim four days before the incident and he gave Shamim Tk 10,000. But Haider did not say anything about what was said at the meeting. A senior RAB official said the killer had meetings with Shamim on Apr 15 and 17. "But we cannot know the subject of the meeting. We've informed police of the meeting since they're investigating the incident," he said. RAB advised police to arrest Gautam's friends Shamim and Azam, who also accompanied the police officer when he was shot dead.
