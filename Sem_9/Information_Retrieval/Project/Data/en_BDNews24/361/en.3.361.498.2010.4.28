<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  Lack of agreement among the concerned officials is bringing further delays to DCC drive against the illegal billboards in the capital. As the drive started on Tuesday night at the Dhaka University area, the executive magistrate and the official of estate department of the Dhaka City Corporation, could not agree which billboards were illegal. Estate officer Mohsin Uddin stopped a billboard on the entrance of Suhrawardy Udyan from being dismantled, saying that the it was a legal structure. According to the DCC rules, a billboard cannot be larger than 600 square feet. But magistrate Khalil Ahmed questioned its size and ordered it to be measured  but the estate officer opposed this. The drive at DU was earlier launched on Apr 23, but due to protests from students, it was suspended. The drive follows a High Court order in March requiring the DCC to dismantle all illegal hoardings in the capital. The order followed the deaths of two people in Gulshan when a billboard was torn loose from a rooftop during a storm. The city authority launched the drive, starting in Shahbagh, on the night of Mar 18. But the planned "overnight drive" came to a halt at around 11.30 pm, after just two hours, as two teams of Shahbagh Police, who had been providing protection, left the scene. According to DCC, there are only around 500 legally erected hoardings in the whole of Dhaka. The rest, an estimated 2,500 billboards and mega signs, are illegally erectedthough DCC admits even they don't know the exact numbermany of which are in a hazardous condition. DCC chief planner Sirajul Islam on Tuesday said the responsibility of approving installation of billboards and identifying those illegal will be carried out by the 'waste department'. Tuesday's drive was launched at 10pm with 22 police members, 40 workers and necessary equipments. It will continue till dawn. bdn
