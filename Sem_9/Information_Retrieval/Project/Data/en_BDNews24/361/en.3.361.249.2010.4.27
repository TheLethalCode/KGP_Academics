 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com) - Garment workers belonging to the Opex Group based in Mirpur demonstrated on Tuesday demanding a minimum wage of Tk 5,000. Local people and witnesses said that workers from the company's garment factory, situated at Section 13, came out on the street at around noon and brought out a procession in the area. Some of the demonstrating workers told bdnews24.com that they were demanding an increase of minimum wage to Tk 5,000 and other facilities. From the procession, the agitated workers asked those from the nearby factories to join them  but they did not take part. Mozzammel Hoque, supervisor of Dream Wear Garments told bdnews24.com that workers from the Opex Group came to their factory and asked them to strike with them. As the workers from Dream Wear Garments refused to take part, the Opex workers became angry, he added. Harun-or-Rashid, general manager of the group said some of the workers staged a demonstration in front of the factory. "Our workers have not demanded a hike in wages, bonus or tiffin-allowance from the owners." The agitated workers are alleged to have attacked at least 15 factories including Tunic Fashions, Saroj Apparels, Natural Wool Wear, Loadstar Fashion Limited and Dream Wear. Opex closed the factory for the day. Earlier in the day, traffic came to a halt on the Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet highways for four hours on Tuesday due to a blockade by garment workers in Narayanganj. bdnews24.com/
