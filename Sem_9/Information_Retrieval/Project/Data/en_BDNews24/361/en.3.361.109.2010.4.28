 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Thimphu, April 28 (bdnews24.com)--The 16th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation starts Wednesday in the Bhutanese capital as the regional grouping turns 25 since its inception in Dhaka in 1985. Afghan president Hamid Karzai, the Maldivian president Mohamed Nashid, Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksha, Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Indian premier Manmohan Singh, Nepalese prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal and Pakistan's prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani will deliver their speeches at the opening session. Lyonchhen Jigmi Y Thinley, the Prime minister of Bhutan, which for the first time is hosting South Asia's biggest gathering of top leaders, will chair the session. Besides, the Thimphu declaration, the two-day summit will adopt a SAARC statement on climate change, the central theme of the event. Despite 25 years of its existence, critics say the regional grouping has so far failed to achieve anything substantial that would have cut poverty and improve the life of more than 1.5 billion people of the region. The widely-held impression about SAARC in the member countries is that it is a forum for an annual gathering of top leaders, where they make bold promises but fail to implement them. "The SAARC summit gives the South Asian top leaders an opportunity to meet face to face without the presence of media and bureaucrats," Bhutanese foreign secretary Daw Penjo told bdnews24.com Sunday night at the Bangladesh embassy. He said the face to face interaction of the leaders contributes to the improvement of relations. "The 16th SAARC summit will chart out a 25-year road map as per the aspiration of people of the region," said the secretary. Meanwhile, the SAARC foreign ministers have finalised the drafts of the two agreements for approval at the summit - the convention on cooperation on environment and the convention on trade in services. The council of ministers and the standing committee also prepared the Thimphu declaration and the Thimphu statement on climate change, the central theme of the 16th summit. The member states will announce a common SAARC position on climate change, though the declaration will not include a text on legally binding emission cut targets for the polluters. As per the proposal of Bangladesh, the declaration will include a SAARC charter for democracy with a view to promoting democracy in all eight countries, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Meanwhile, all the heads of states and governments other than Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh have reached Thimphu, a beautiful hilly city. Singh will arrive Wednesday morning before the summit starts at 2.30 pm. The summit will also see the inauguration of the headquarters of the SAARC Development Fund in Thimph
