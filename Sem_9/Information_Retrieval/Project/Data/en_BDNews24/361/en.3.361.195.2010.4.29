 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Thimphu, April 29 (bdnews24.com)The 16th summit has adopted an Indian proposal for a roadmap to create a SAARC market for electricity. Leaders of the South Asian regional group in the Thimphu Declaration strongly condemned terrorism and vowed to root it out. They accepted a Bangladesh proposal for inclusion of the SAARC charter of democracy. The summit urged the member countries to quickly ratify the trade in services deal to open their service sectors. "The leaders recognized the need to enhance cooperation in the energy sector to facilitate energy trade, development of efficient conventional and renewable energy sources including hydropower," said the Thimphu Declaration adopted unanimously. "The leaders noted the proposal from India for preparing a roadmap for developing a SAARC market for electricity on a regional basis, as SAARC is considering electricity trading, supported by enabling markets in the member states," it said. The leaders emphasised the need to undertake studies to develop regional energy projects, promote regional power trade, efficiency, conservation and development of labeling and standardization of appliances, and sharing of knowledge and technologies, according to the declaration. Earlier, Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hssina in her summit speech proposed for a regional grid of electricity in the SAARC region. Energy-starved Bangladesh has been in negotiation with India and Bhutan to import electricity from the neighbouring countries. Experts say, Nepal has the potential of producing 90,000 megawatts of electricity while Bhutan can produce 30,000 megawatts by utilising their steep rivers. India has grid connectivity with Nepal and Bhutan to trade in electricity. Bangladesh has initiated a process of connecting its grids with India with a view to importing electricity. The SAARC's signing of the trade in services will open up the potential of trade in electricity. "The leaders welcomed the signing of the SAARC Agreement on Trade in Services and expressed that this will open up new vistas of trade cooperation and further deepen the integration of the regional economies," said the declaration. "They called for the early ratification of the agreement." "The leaders also called for the early conclusion of negotiations on the specific schedule of commitments under the agreement," it said. To make the trade in services, the summit accepted Bangladesh proposal on harmonisation of curricula of educational institutes in the region. "The leaders strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and expressed deep concern over the threat which terrorism continues to pose to peace, security and economic stability of the South Asian region," said the declaration. "They reiterated their firm resolve to root out terrorism and recalled the ministerial declaration on cooperation in combating terrorism adopted by the 31st Session of the Council of Ministers in Colombo". "The leaders emphasized the need to strengthen regional cooperation to fight terrorism and transnational organized crimes", it said. As per the proposal from Bangladesh, the summit adopted the proposal of regional cooperation to strengthen good governance through sharing of experiences and best practices. "They noted the proposal by Bangladesh to convene an inter-government meeting in Dhaka on the idea of a SAARC charter of democracy on which Bangladesh offered to circulate a concept paper," said the declaration expressing satisfaction that all member countries democratically elected governments. Hasina in her summit speech talked in favour of charter of democracy in SAARC. The summit declared 2010-20 as the decade of intra-regional connectivity in SAARC. "They agreed on the need to expedite negotiations with a view to finalising the two agreements on motor vehicles and railways." The proposed motor vehicle agreement will allow the free movement of vehicles of one country to another SAARC country. Pakistan earlier objected to the signing of the deal and demanded fresh examination before signing. Bhutanese prime minister Jigmi Y Thinley presided over the concluding session at the Grand Assembly Hall. Afghan president Hamid Karzai, Hasina, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, the Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed, Nepalese prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, Pakistan prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani and Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksha attended the concluding session.
