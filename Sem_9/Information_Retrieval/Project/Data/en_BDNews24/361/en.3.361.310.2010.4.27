 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  The sequence of events that led to the alleged mutiny and killings at the Pilkhana BDR headquarters on February 25 was set out by the prosecutor in the special BDR court in Dhaka on Tuesday. Following this, the court, presided over by outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, set Nov 1 to frame charges against the soldiers of 44 Rifles Battalion accused of mutiny  before which the accused were told to provide their statements and list of witnesses. It also asked the accused to appear before the court, located in the Darbar Hall where the mutiny took place, with the same appearance that they had during the mutiny. In front of the 675 accused present in court, Lt Col Kazi Aniruddha, commanding officer of the 44 Rifles Battalion, explained that the men involved in the mutiny had taken an oath "in a darkened room" on Feb 24 to be present at the parade ground on the 25th morning to undertake the mutiny. Sepoy Selim was the first to arrive that morning  but he almost left in despair as he waited alone, the court heard. It was only as he was about to leave that he was joined by other men coming from the Darbar Hall, the prosecutor said. The men decided to carry out their plan at a time when a meeting that was due to take place in the Hall was delayed. The prosecutor claimed that Selim Reza, Sepoy Altaf and others had looted the armoury on the direction of DAD Nasir. "Sepoy Tazul and others were the first ones to spark the rebellion at Darbar Hall. Reza had ordered the DG and other officers to 'line up' and 'go one by one'. "The buildings looked like they were war-hit after Feb 26. Arms, grenades and bullets were all over the ground." "Seven days before the mutiny, a grenade was recovered from a water tank behind the 44 Battalion building  this was their command post during the rebellion. "They killed three officers at the CC Club room. They are the killers of most of the 57 army officers killed in the bloody rebellion," Aniruddha alleged. Aniruddah - assisted in the court by special prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal, Mohammad Shahnewaz Tipu and Manjur-e-Alam - requested the court to give them exemplary punishment so that such a rebellion never occurs again. He also claimed that Selim, Tazul, Habibur, Jashim, Rafiqul and Obaydullah - all 44th battalion sepoys - looted the DG's house. Most of the accused soldiers belong to the 44th Rifles Battalion, and all 675 are facing charges of mutiny that killed 74 people including 57 army officers, deputed to the paramilitary force, during the Feb 25-26, 2009 carnage. Some 405 accused have been detained since April last following a case filed with the New Market Police station. The remaining 270 were arrested on Monday. Until then they had been on duty in the BDR headquarters. Lt Col AKM Golam Rabbani and Maj Sayeed Hassan Taposh assisted the BDR DG during the court proceedings. Deputy attorney general Mohammad Ullah Kislu was present in the court on behalf of the attorney general. Following the Pilkhana mutiny, rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. The government in November last year formed six special courts to bring the BDR rebels to justice under BDR act. Already four of these courts  in Panchagar, Feni, Thakorgaon and Shatkhira  have returned verdicts. The first verdict was given in Panchagar on Apr 7. All the 29 accused soldiers were given punishment. Thakorgaon special court on Apr 12 acquitted one soldier among the accused 51. The Feni court on Apr 18 convicted 57 and acquitted five BDR rebels. The most recent verdict was given in Satkhira where 56 of the 60 accused were convicted. 24 soldiers were given the maximum punishment of seven years. bdnews
