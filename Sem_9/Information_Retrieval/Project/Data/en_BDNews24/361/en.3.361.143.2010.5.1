 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Seven employees of Pragati Industries, including its general manager, were beaten by a mob on Friday when they tried to recover the car of a man who had failed to pay his financial installments. When the car was being repossessed, it is claimed that Aminul Huq, the man who had failed to pay for the car, told local people that the vehicle was being stolen - and as a result they were set on by a mob. The Pragati officials, led by its general manager Abul Hossian, had taken Aminul Huq's Eicher pick-up from Laalpool as he had not been paying his installments regularly. The driver started to take the car to the Pragati's factory at Sitakunda, but he was obstructed at Baroirhat by 10-12 miscreants. The Pragati driver then was forced to take the car back to Laalpool, where Aminul told people that the Pragati driver was 'stealing' his pick-up and he was soon under brutal attack with rods and bamboos. When his colleagues came to rescue him, it is claimed that they were also attacked by some passers-by and 40 or 50 workers of two hotels, owned by Aminul and his brothers. "They were very badly beaten. The mob wanted to pull out one of the person's eye, and one's skin was cut all over his body," the managing director of the state-run vehicle assembling and selling company, Zahir Uddin Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Friday. Abul Khayer Chowdhury, one of the Pragati officials, also told bdnews24.com that the people were beating them so badly that he thought 'they would kill us'. He said, "They also snatched our valuables, money and other documents." Zahir Uddin said, "There was a police car belonging to the next police station at a nearby filling station and although they came to the scene, they failed to take any action. "Then they called the Feni Model Police Station for help. "The situation was brought under control when they came. The injured were rushed to Feni Sadr Hospital and later to the police station," he continued. Zahir Uddin went to the police station on Friday morning and brought the officials and drivers to Chittagong Medical College Hospital. He said legal steps will be taken soon. "Pragati Industries has the right to seize any vehicle if a client fails to pay the instalments regularly. "Until all the installments are paid, the ownership stays with Pragati," Zahir added. He said Aminul's outstanding amount stood at Tk 272,000 even though it has been eight years since he purchased the pick-up. Aminul could not be contacted on Friday for comments, but he told the police that locals attacked the Pragati men, who were trying to take the vehicle, suspecting that they were muggers. Model police station OC Sirajul Islam said, "When the officials tried to take the vehicle away, some hotel workers began to shout uttering 'muggers'. Then some miscreants appeared at the scene and beat them severely." bdn
