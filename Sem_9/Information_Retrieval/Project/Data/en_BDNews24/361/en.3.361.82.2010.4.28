 SRINAGAR, India, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!)- Who is buried at a small shrine in Kashmir? Jesus or medieval Muslim scholars? Renewed debate over whose remains are actually in the Rozabal shrine, which attracts hundreds of tourists to Srinagar, has led caretakers to close it to visitors after allowing access for several years. A decades-old theory that Jesus survived the crucifixion and spent his remaining years in Kashmir had drawn many people to Rozabal, a single-storey shrine with a traditional sloping roof located in a congested residential area of the capital Srinagar.

Local Muslim scholars and historians, however, ridicule Kashmiri's theory. Muslims revere Jesus as one of God's prophets, but they do not believe he died during his crucifixion.
