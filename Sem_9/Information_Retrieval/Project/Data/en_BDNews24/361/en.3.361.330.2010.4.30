<TEXT>
 Sherpur, Apr 30(bdnews24.com) Increased water flow from the upstream of Jamuna River has forced farmers of Char areas in Sherpur to harvest half-ripe paddy and other crops. Farmers say more than a thousand acres of cropland in nine villages have been inundated with water from the sudden rise in the Jamuna River. The excess water flow in the last three days has submerged lands at the joining of the Old Brahmaputra and Dos Ani rivers in Darshana area. Sherpur's deputy commissioner Mohammed Nasiruzzuman told bdnews24.com that crop fields of paddy, jute, ground nuts and sweet potato on Brahmaputra river banks have gone under water. He also added that the Department of Agriculture Extension and the relief section are working to assess the damage to crops in the affected areas. Arrangement to provide necessary assistance to the affected farmers would be made, he added. Affected villages are Tan Kachar, Dakater Gop and Munshirchar of Charmocharia Union; Bagholdhi, Takimari and Dikpara of Charpokkhimari Union; Number 6 Char and Goal Para of Kamarer Char Union. Farmers are trying to salvage crops from the submerged fields and have been forced to harvest half-ripe paddy from the adjacent lands fearing further increase in the water level. Farmers are fearing that a further 2/3 thousand bighas (33 decimals = 1 bigha) of croplands might go under water if the level continues to rise. Anwar Hossain, a farmer who has lost crops in two acres of paddy, one acre of jute and sweet potato to the rise, said he is in a fix about what to do with his family and their future. Farmers said that it is unusual to have that much rise of water during this season. Anisur Rahman, a local, said that such rise in the water level during this season is unprecedented in the last 26 years. Mohammed Shajahan, deputy assistant block officer of Munshirchar's agriculture department, said if the water did not recede within one or two days, damages would increase. He also added that 70/80 acres of land were flooded in the Tan Kachar area alone. bdn
