 Narayanganj, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)--Workers of two garment factories blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway for two hours demanding a pay rise, grinding traffic to a halt. Workers of Arrow Apparels Anirban and Arrow Apparels Mohammadi initially demonstrated inside the factories in Tatki area of Rupganj upazila, said Rupganj police chief Forkan Sikder. Later they took to the streets at around 11am. Police arrived at the scene at around 12:30pm and tried to bring the situation under control. The demonstrators chased away the law enforcers and hurled stones at them, he said. Police charged them with batons and drove the workers off the highway at around 1pm. About 2,000 workers are employed in the two factories, the police officer said. On Tuesday, workers of Opex Garments in Narayanganj had blocked the highway over a similar demand. bdnew
