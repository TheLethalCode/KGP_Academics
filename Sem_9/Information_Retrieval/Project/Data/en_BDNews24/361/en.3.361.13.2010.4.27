The channel's director Mazidul Islam also said that Prime Bank, who had financed the original purchase of the channel's equipment, had not in fact handed it over to the new owner following its auction The bank had auctioned the equipment as the channel had failed to pay the bank for the cost of the equipment. BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed had earlier claimed that the company had not responded appropriately to show cause notices sent to it, and that it had violated the telecommunications law by handing over its broadcasting equipment to another entity. The One Entertainment Limited director was speaking at a press briefing at the Channel 1 office minutes before the channel went off the air at 6.41. He said that Channel 1 had filed a case against Prime Bank regarding the auction, but the court had ruled against the channel.
