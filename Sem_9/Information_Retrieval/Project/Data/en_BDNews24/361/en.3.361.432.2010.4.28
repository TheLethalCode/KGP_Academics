 BANGKOK Apr 28 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -  A soldier was shot in the head during a tense confrontation on Wednesday between Thai security forces and anti-government protesters in Bangkok that left 16 people injured. The stand-off, which followed a period of relative calm in the city, came as hundreds of soldiers and police officers blocked a convoy of "Red Shirt" protesters who had left their fortified rally base in central Bangkok. "One soldier was shot in his head," said army spokesman Major General Dithapron Sasasamit, adding that his condition was unclear. Officials said earlier that riot police and soldiers had fired warning shots. Emergency services said 16 people were hospitalised in the clashes near Don Mueang International Airport in the north of the capital. About 2,000 protesters had earlier moved out of their sprawling rally site in pick-up trucks and on motorcycles to travel to the north of the capital, which is under a state of emergency. Thai media reported rubber bullets were fired during the face-off, and Red leaders accused troops of using "war weapons" against the protesters, who want immediate elections to replace Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's government.

They are fighting with unarmed people," protest leader Nattawut Saikuar said from a stage at the site in Bangkok's commercial district that has become the focus of the weeks-long rallies. "The government wants to lure us to go there so that they can come and disperse us here," added Nattawut, who warned earlier in the day that the Reds were "ready to fight to the death". Street clashes earlier this month and grenade attacks last week in the heart of Bangkok have left 26 people dead and hundreds more wounded in the country's worst political unrest for almost two decades. The Reds -- many of whom come from Thailand's rural poor and urban working classes -- have beefed up their defences with barricades made from truck tyres and bamboo stakes as they brace for a crackdown by security forces. Raising the pressure on the embattled premier, the Constitutional Court agreed to hear a recommendation by an election body to dissolve the ruling party for alleged misuse of grant money, a court official said. He declined to give a time-frame for the case but said Abhisit's Democrats would be asked to provide a written defence. Abhisit said in an interview with the BBC Tuesday that he would step down if he believed he were an obstacle to stability. He said the issues were "not a purely political problem. There are security problems involved, there are terrorist problems involved", adding that there was no imminent likelihood of martial law being declared. Abhisit, regarded as elitist and undemocratic by his opponents, has rejected an offer by the Reds to disperse if elections are held in three months' time. Army spokesman Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said Tuesday that security forces were ready and waiting "for the right time" to retake the Reds' rally area, which has paralysed traffic and caused many major hotels and stores to close. Sunsern has previously warned protesters they could face real bullets in any new clashes and said troops had set up checkpoints to prevent people bringing in weapons to the confrontation zone.

The Reds have denied involvement in any such plot. Earlier, two grenade attacks hit a Bangkok bank and military checkpoint -- the latest in a series of blasts to hit politically significant sites -- but nobody was wounded, police said. Britain has extended a warning against visiting Thailand, urging its nationals to avoid anything but essential travel to all of the tourist destination due to "violent incidents of an unpredictable natu
