 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's largest private passenger carrier GMG Airlines on Saturday took delivery of a wide-bodied aircraft to thrust its business ahead. Salman F Rahman, vice-chairman of Beximco Group, civil aviation secretary Shafique Mehedi and GMG managing director Sahab Sattar were present at Shahjalal International Airport on the occasion. GMG launched its new logo at a programme at Radisson Water Garden Hotel in the afternoon. The new addition to the six-strong fleet, the Boeing 767-300ER--brought for the first time to Bangladesh--has 264 seats and will have business and economy class to cater for the clientele. The aircraft will fly to Dubai, Doha, Riyadh and Jeddah of the Middle East destinations, officials of the private airliner said. Majority stakeholder Beximco, the country's biggest business conglomerate, has injected crores into the airline since it bought a 50 percent stake last June to rev up the wobbling carrier. Salman said later at a news conference that more aircrafts will be added to the fleet to launch new routes in future. Rahman pointed to the dominance of foreign operators to say that they currently control 85 percent stakes in Bangladesh's aviation sector. "GMG, being a local operator, has been competing well with them," he said. The airline flies two MD-82 and one MD-83 planes to eight international destinations and three Dash-8 aircraft to six domestic routes. It is also in the process of acquiring another wide-bodied Boeing 767 aircraft and two narrow-bodied new generation aircraft. b
