 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP will march towards the Election Commission on May 3 demanding cancellation of the Bhola by-election. The main opposition also demands resignation of the election commissioners. The party's standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan announced the programme at a rally at Muktangon in the city on Wednesday. He said: "There has been a farce in Bhola in the name of election. So the poll results have to be cancelled and the election commissioners must resign." Khan announced that the march towards Election Commission would start at 3pm from Muktangon. BNP is demanding cancellation of Bhola-3 by-election results and resignation of the chief election commissioner and two other commissioners alleging the EC of favouring the ruling party candidate. The rally at Muktangon was part of the BNP's countrywide district and municipality-level demonstration to press home their demands. Khan said: "The Election Commission held a farcical election to make the ruling party candidate win". Ruling Awami League's Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon won the election defeating BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed on April 24. BNP vice-president Abdullah Al Noman alleged: "Ruling party cadres obstructed the voters from exercising their franchise resorting to human rights violation." He demanded judicial inquiry into those activities and threatened, "Otherwise BNP will hold the trial when it comes to power." BNP leader and Dhaka City Corporation mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka presided over the rally, addressed, among others, by party advisory council member Shamsuzzman Dudu, joint secretary general Amanullah Aman, organising secretary Fazlul Haq Milon and Abul Khair Bhuiyan MP.
