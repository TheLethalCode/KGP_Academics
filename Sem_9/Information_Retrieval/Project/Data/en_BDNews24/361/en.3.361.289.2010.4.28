 Pabna, April 28 (bdnews24.com)  Nearly 4,000 hectares of Bhangura Upazila in Pabna was inundated Wednesday noon when a crop protection dam gave in. The Puibeel dam in the Chalan Beel caved in to increasing water of the Gumni river. The sudden rush of water flooded Dilpashar, Khanmorich, Osthomonisha and Chorbhangura areas. Farmers tried to salvage the submerged paddy as much as they could. They said the dyke had been under threat and accused the administration for not taking any measures. Upazila nirbahi officer, Ananda Kumar and agriculture officer Debesh Chakrabarti told reporters that the administration had called for locals to join hands in repairing the dyke. Officials said that they did not have any allocation for repairing the dike. The upazila agriculture department estimates that if the dyke is not repaired within 24 hours, boro crops on 4,800 hectares will go under water. Abdur Razzak, upazila vice-chairman, said that locals had failed to repair the dyke till 5pm. bdnews2
