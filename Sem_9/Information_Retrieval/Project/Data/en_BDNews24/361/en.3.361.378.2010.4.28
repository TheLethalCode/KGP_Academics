<TITLE> S Korea hails woman climber amid controversy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, April 28 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  South Korean media hailed Oh Eun-Sun on Wednesday after she claimed to have become the first woman to scale the world's 14 highest peaks, ignoring controversy surrounding her bid. All major newspapers ran a front page photo of the 44-year-old Oh holding a national flag at the snow-covered summit of the 8,091-metre (26,545-foot) Annapurna in Nepal. Oh's claim to be the first female climber to have conquered all the world's mountains over 8,000 metres is under scrutiny, however. Last week a leading Himalayan mountaineering authority expressed doubts about Oh's May 2009 ascent of Mount Kanchenjunga on the Nepal-Tibet border. In South Korea, there were no such reservations however. "Your successful ascent (of the 8,000 metre mountains) was a process of human victory that underscores the meaning of challenge," President Lee Myung-Bak told Oh in a congratulatory message late Tuesday. Chosun Ilbo newspaper said in a headline: "Iron lady 154 centimetres tall becomes a 'giant' over 8,000 metres." Other papers carried similar exhaustive coverage, with little or no mention of the dispute. Mountaineering expert Elizabeth Hawley, who publishes the authoritative Himalayan Database, said in Kathmandu that Oh's ascent of Kanchenjunga would be considered "disputed". She said other mountaineers, including Oh's chief rival for the record Edurne Pasaban, had questioned whether she made it to the top. "I'll be waiting to meet her when she gets back to hear her version of what she has to say about Kanchenjunga," Hawley told AFP Tuesday. Pasaban, 36, conquered Annapurna earlier this month, becoming the first Spanish woman to do so and leaving her with just one more mountain to scale. Pasaban is on her way to Tibet, where she will attempt to climb Shisha Pangma -- the smallest of the 14 peaks at 8,027 metres. She maintained doubts that Oh had conquered Kanchenjunga. "It is a doubt which we already had last year, because when she climbed Kanchenjunga we were already there and we climbed it after her. Our doubts emerged when she presented some photos, and other climbers shared them," she told public radio from Shisha Pangma. A picture provided by Oh shows her standing on a bare rock but those taken by Pasaban's team shows them standing on snow. "The confirmation came this year while at the base camp at Annapurna when I met with the Sherpas who climbed with her and they confirmed that they did not reach the peak of Kanchenjunga," said Pasaban. "When she returns to Kathmandu she will have to prove it, she will be questioned and we will see what happens." Spanish sports dailies AS and Marca published testimony from Norweigan climber Jon Gangdal who said he believes Oh did not reach the summit of Mount Kanchenjunga in May 2009 as she claims. "In my opinion, she descended when she was 50 or 100 metres from the summit," Gangdal, who was on Mount Kanchenjunga at the same time, told Marca. Oh has previously dismissed the doubts as groundless. "I can say that I have stood at the summit of Mount Kanchenjunga," she told a Seoul press conference last year. "It was bad weather. Three sherpas told me that I reached the top and one of them took the picture." Just 18 people have previously been to the top of the 14 eight-thousanders, all in Asia's Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. Italian climber Reinhold Messner became the first person to achieve the feat in 19
