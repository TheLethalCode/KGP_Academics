<TITLE> SAARC to manage water regionally </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Thimphu, April 27 (bdnews24.com)--The proposed SAARC convention on cooperation on environment, set to be signed by the leaders during the two-day summit, has for the first time accepted the regional approach to water management and conservation. The convention also inserted the term "soil erosion and sediment", which may give the countries sharing common rivers the chance to manage rivers regionally, experts say. Lower riparian country Bangladesh has been discussing the issue for years with the upper riparian countries-- such as India, China, Nepal and Bhutan-- for regional management of the big rivers so that it can have enough water for agriculture. In the past, Dhaka also raised with India the issue of managing sediment, which causes river erosion and choking up of the rivers downstream. But Dhaka never got any serious consideration from the upper riparian country. "The council of ministers has approved the idea of regional 'water management', 'water management and conservation'," foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes told bdnews24.com Tuesday at the Bangladesh mission in Thimphu. "If the summit approves, the convention will be adopted," he said. The secretary said this approach would benefit both the upper and lower riparian countries. "The regional management of water was never discussed at the SAARC," QAMA Rahim, a former secretary-general of SAARC, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. "I don't know the details of the agreement, but this will benefit a lower riparian country like Bangladesh," he said. "This is a positive development". Bangladesh has 57 common rivers, of which 54 come down from India and three from Myanmar before entering the Bay of Bengal. Agriculture, which is the mainstay of Bangladesh economy, is heavily dependent on three big rivers--the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and Meghna--all coming from India. In 1974, India constructed the Farakka barrage in the upstream, which it used to divert water from the Ganges. The diversion of water turned the whole northern and southwestern Bangladesh into a veritable desert in the dry season, wreaking havoc to agriculture. The Brahmaputra, which carries 60 percent of Bangladesh's total water, is going to be another problem as China has been planning to divert its water from the upstream. If the plan goes ahead all the countries in the region like India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh will be affected. Diplomatic observers say if the lower riparian states forge an alliance, New Delhi will be able to create pressure on Beijing to abandon its plan of water diversion from Brahmaputra. Bangladesh also suffers from the heavy burden of sediments from the upstream. According to the water development board, the common rivers carry two billion tons of sediment every year and dump the whole load on the country. The huge volume of sediment chokes up rivers in one hand and causes river erosion on the other, according to water experts. The river erosion leaves thousands of people homeless every year, resulting in the swelling of the ranks of the poo
