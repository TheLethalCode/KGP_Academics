<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  Readymade garment workers of Mirpur and Narayanganj demonstrated again on Wednesday demanding pay hike. Workers of Opex & Sinha Textiles took position on the main road of Mirpur 13 at around 9am demanding a minimum wage of Tk 5,000 and attendance bonus. Traffic from Mirpur 10 through Mirpur 14 remained suspended. Police charged batons and fired tear gas shells to disperse the demonstrators. Later the workers withdrew their blockade and took position in front of the factory. Meanwhile, labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain on Wednesday said that there would be a new wage structure for RMG workers within three months. At a meeting of the Crisis Management Cell for the RMG sector, comprising government officials and representatives from the concerned bodies, he also stated that the process will go under a new board and necessary reforms will also be undertaken. The minister asked workers to have patience till implementation of the new salary structure. Workers of Opex & Sinha Textiles said they placed their demands in writing to executive directive Mujibul Islam on Wednesday as they heard that the demands of the workers in another factory in Kanchpur, belonging to the same owner, were met a day before. They alleged that Muzibul had the factory gates closed after chucking away the piece of paper that had the workers' list of demands. This prompted the blockade, workers said. Kafrul police chief Delwar Hossain told bdnews24.com: "The workers took position on the highway at around 9am." "So transport on the road came to a halt." They came off the road after two hours after the police requested them. Harunur Rashid, general manager of Opex & Sinha, told bdnews24.com that leaflets were distributed among the workers on Wednesday morning following a resolution of demands in Kanchpur, but some workers began agitation rejecting the resolution. "A vested quarter is instigating the agitation," Harun claimed. Narayanganj's chief government inspector of factories and firms Mahmudul Haque told bdnews24.com: "We have heard their demands and some of the demands have already been accepted." The demand for a minimum wage of Tk 5,000 will be discussed later, Haque said. bdnews24.com's Narayanganj correspondent reported that workers of Arrow Apparels Anirban and Arrow Apparels Mohammadi blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway for two hours demanding a pay hike, bringing traffic to a halt. They also damaged a number of vehicles. The workers initially demonstrated inside the factories in Tatki of Rupganj upazila, said Rupganj police chief Forkan Shikder. Later they took to the streets at around 11am. Police arrived at the scene at around 12:30pm and tried to bring the situation under control. The demonstrators chased away the law enforcers and hurled brickbats at them, he said. Police charged batons and drove the workers off the highway at around 1pm. About 2,000 workers are employed in the two factories, the police officer said. On Tuesday, workers of the Opex Group, based in Mirpur and Narayanganj, had demonstrated over a similar demand. bdnews24.co
