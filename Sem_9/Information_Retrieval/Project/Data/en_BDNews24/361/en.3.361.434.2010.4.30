 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)Readymade garment workers of Mirpur took to the streets again on Friday demanding pay hike in a second such incident of agitation in the apparel factory-dominated area of Dhaka in two days. Witnesses said that hundreds of workers of Vision Group at around 9am took position on the both sides of the main road of Mirpur 14. Vision Group workers also staged demonstration in front of nearby Tunic Fashion Ltd and Saroj Apparels Ltd and urged workers of those two garment factories to join in. A number of workers of the Tunic Ltd later responded, witnesses said. Police, at midday, charged batons to disperse the demonstrators. Additional police and RAB forces have been deployed on the spot to avert further agitation. Vision Group cutting master Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com, "The salary that we are paid is not sufficient for our survival. Nearby Opex Textiles workers' demands were met as they demonstrated on the road. But our demands are never accepted." Tunic Fashion worker Shefali Begum said they were not being paid for overtime for last two years; even the Eid bonuses were also pending. Earlier on Apr 28, workers of Opex & Sinha Textiles took position on the main road of Mirpur 13 demanding a minimum wage of Tk 5,000 and attendance bonus. Labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain later on that day said that there would be a new wage structure for RMG workers within three months. At a meeting of the Crisis Management Cell for the RMG sector, comprising government officials and representatives from the concerned bodies, he also had stated that the process will go under a new board and necessary reforms will also be undertaken.
