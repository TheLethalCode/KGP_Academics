Healthcare expenditures also have been higher in the United States than in Canada since the 1970s.

The interviews were conducted in 2002 and 2003 during the first joint survey by Statistics Canada and the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics to provide fully comparable data.

Researchers may try to conduct another survey to update new developments in light of the recent healthcare reform measures in the United States, he ad
