 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court will judge on May 18 prime minister Sheikh Hasina's petition to withdraw the frigate purchase corruption charges she faces. The bench of justices Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiqui set the date on Wednesday after hearing both sides in the case. Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh conducted the hearing for the AL chief while Mizanur Rahman argued for the Anticorruption Commission. Formerly Bureau of Anti-Corruption's official Mir Mohammed Joynul Abedin Shibli filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina and four others on Aug 7, 2002. The case alleges that the 1996-2001 Hasina administration had procured a frigate for the navy at a cost of nearly $105 million, causing the government Tk 447 crore in losses. On Aug 3, 2003, the investigators pressed charges against the accused in the court. The High Court, in the same year, stayed the proceedings of the case following Hasina's appeals. The court has annulled seven other corruption cases against Hasina over NIKO, Mig-29 purchase, barge-mounted power plants, Meghnaghat power plants, Novotheatre until Apr 22 since the Awami League-led government came into office.
