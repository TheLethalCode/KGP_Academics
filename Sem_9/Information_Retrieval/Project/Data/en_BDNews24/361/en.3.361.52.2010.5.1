<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)--After a break of two months, fishing will start again in Meghna River on Saturday. A ban was imposed on fishing on 100-kilometre stretch of the river from Shaitnol of Chandpur to Char Alexander of Lakshmipur, for two months starting from March 1. Restriction on fishing in the river was imposed as part of ban on fishing Jatka (Hilsa fish fry) to protect the growth of Hilsa. However, the ban on catching Jatka will remain in force, Chandpur district fisheries officer Kazi Iqbal Hossain said. The Jatka protection programme runs from November to May. He also said that the ban on fishing in the 100 km stretch of Meghna has been in place since 2006 after it was declared a Hilsa sanctuary. Since February, 23,335 fishermen in the Chandpur district were receiving 30 kg of rice per person in compensation and the programme will run through May. Last year the number of fishermen was 22,900 and they each received 10 kg of rice. Khan Mohammed Mujahid Ibn Habib, field coordinator of the Centre for Natural Resources Study, a non-governmental organisation, told bdnes24.com that they had provided material assistance to 713 fishermen. bdnews
