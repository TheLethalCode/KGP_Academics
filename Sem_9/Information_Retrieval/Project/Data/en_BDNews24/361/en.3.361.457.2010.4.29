 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)-- Civil aviation minister GM Quader says there will be no flight disruptions for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims this year. The minister also says that airlines other than Biman Bangladesh Airlines and Saudi Airlines can transport Hajj pilgrims. "There will not be any flight complications this time," Quader said at the inauguration of a three-day 'Hajj and Umrah Fair, 2010' at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre premises on Thursday. He also elaborated on the reasons of the complications. Pilgrims flying under Biman's management do not usually face hazards, according to the minister. The problem, he said, occurs when they travel with private and other organisations, who now will have to stay alert. The fair, held for the third time, was co-organised by the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh (HAAB) and an event organising company called E-3 Solutions Ltd. It aims to inform interested pilgrims about the facilities and benefits offered by the 76 participating Hajj agencies this year. HAAB president Ibrahim Bahar said there is also scope for interested individuals to participate in a three-day training programme about the role of pilgrims during the Hajj so that they do not have to face embarrassing situation at Makkah and Medina. The lowest package under private management offered in the fair is Tk 230,000, which is only Tk 2,000 more than the government package. The highest package cost has been offered by MA International Tours at Tk 350,000. The company officials said their package would ensure all top-class facilities including luxurious accommodations. State minister for religious affairs Shahjahan Mia was also present at the programme. b
