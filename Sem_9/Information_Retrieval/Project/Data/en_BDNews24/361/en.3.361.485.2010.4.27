 Thimphu, April 27 (bdnews24.com)--Belying strong speculations, Sheikh Hasina and her Pakistan counterpart did not discuss Bangladesh's upcoming war crimes trials when they met on the sidelines of SAARC summit on Tuesday. Officials said that the two leaders concentrated on discussing the strengthening of parliamentary democracy and enhancement of trade between the two countries. "The honorable prime minister discussed democracy and the parliamentary system. They emphasised the importance of person to person contact," Abul Kalam Azad, Hasina's press secretary, told reporters after the meeting with Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani. Bangladesh obtained independence from Pakistan in December 1971 following a 9 month long war in which the Pakistan military forces and their local collaborators are accused of killing hundreds of thousands of Bengali citizens. The tribunals recently set up by the Bangladesh government will only prosecute Bangladeshis accused of war crimes and other related offences - although it is inevitable that evidence of offences committed by the Pakistan military will be heard as part of the court proceedings. Recently the Pakistan High Commissioner confirmed that Paskistan would in no way interfere in the Bangladesh government's decision to hold trials. The two prime ministers arrived in the Bhutanese capital Tuesday morning to attend the SAARC summit taking place on April 28-29. Their commitment for democracy has special significance, as the SAARC foreign ministers have adopted a Bangladesh proposal for promoting and protecting democratic governance in the South Asian region. The 16th summit declaration will call for a SAARC charter of democracy. As per the decisions of the SAARC council of ministers, Bangladesh will host a SAARC meeting to find ways of protecting and promoting democratic systems and institutions in the region, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes told bdnews24.com Both Pakistan and Bangladesh have a history of military regimes. Hasina and Gillani have both been put in jail on charges of corruption in their respective countries when the military were involved in the country's politics.. Recently, Pakistan amended its constitution making Asif Ali Zardari a ceremonial president with executive power in the hands of prime minister Gillani
