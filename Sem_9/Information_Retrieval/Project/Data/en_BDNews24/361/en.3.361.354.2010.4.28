 Chittagong, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University vice chancellor Abu Yusuf has said that the striking students demanding his resignation are tiring as the protest started its tenth day on Tuesday. Yusuf told bdnews24.com that, "The misled strikers have grown tired. Students are returning to the campus." But the strikers at a rally on Tuesday declared that they would continue their strike until the demands are met. Activists of the ruling party students' wing Bangladesh Chhatra League, which called the strike, brought out a procession in the city demanding resignation of the VC and the arrest of the killers of their fellow Md Asaduzzaman. Assistant proctor Chondon Kumar Poddar told bdnews24.com that the situation had improved a bit. On the tenth day of the strike, the university has partially come back to life with the science faculty resuming its activities. Some of the students have started to return to the campus and classes, and exams were also held in some departments. Tight security was seen in the campus on Tuesday as two shuttle trains and eachers' buses operated with police protection - though no private buses travelled between the university and the city. bdnews24.com
