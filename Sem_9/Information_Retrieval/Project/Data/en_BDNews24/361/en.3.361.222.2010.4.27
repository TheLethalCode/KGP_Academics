<TITLE> ANALYSIS - US global warming bill shows signs of life </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Senator John Kerry was supposed to have been spending Monday basking in the achievement of bringing the United States a gigantic step closer to tackling global warming. But instead of attending media events to announce a compromise climate change bill backed by key US industries, the Democrat has found himself right back to where he's been over the past six months-- holed up in talks with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and independent Senator Joseph Lieberman. That the three are even talking means that the bill, which would require industry to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for global warming, is stalled-- but not yet officially dead. It may provide some solace to business that negotiations are continuing because it is loath for the Environmental Protection Agency to be left to regulate emissions, as the agency has said it would do. "Any and all reports of the demise of energy legislation are greatly exaggerated," said a Senate aide, who asked not to be identified. "Not only is this bill very much alive, but the senators are aggressively moving forward to remove any obstacles to getting it passed this year." The drive to bring a climate change bill to the Senate floor after more than six months of difficult negotiations was ruptured on Saturday, when Graham pulled out. He angrily accused Senate Democratic leaders of having "destroyed my confidence" the bill would be considered, after they raised the prospect of first doing contentious immigration reform. With little time left before November's congressional elections, some think the Senate will barely have time for one more big piece of legislation much less two. A Monday evening meeting of the Kerry-Graham-Lieberman trio could help illuminate whether climate legislation is alive or dead after a string of setbacks. But the three senators may not have the power to decide its fate. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and President Barack Obama's White House likely will be calling the shots. "What we can say is that both (immigration and climate legislation) are neck and neck in terms of importance to Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, and that timing is yet to be determined," a Democratic aide told Reuters. The Senate aide added: "We've always been on a path to try to do something this summer." Doing "something" will not be easy, even if the fight over legislative priorities is resolved. Maggie Fox, head of the Alliance for Climate Protection, founded in 2006 by former Vice President Al Gore, said last weekend's developments were a "dramatic bump in the road." Still, she said there has been a positive effect. "It has in an interesting kind of way reignited and reinvested us with a sense of purpose," Fox said. "The sense of it really slipping away has everyone running back to put it back together with determination." Her group is flying 40 people from several states to Washington to put pressure on senators to act and Fox said she thought media events set for Monday will be rescheduled to roll out a climate change bill in a dramatic way. But one official of a major environmental group said if Kerry manages to roll out his bill soon, the key will be who is on the podium with him. "Is Senator Graham going to be there and if he is, under what circumstances?" the official asked. By May, the EPA is expected to set forth rules defining the size of factories and power plants to be regulated for carbon emissions, another step in taking action on climate. The agency got the ball rolling last year with a finding that declared the emissions are a threat to human health and welfare. The EPA's roll-out of the new rule, said Christine Tezak, an analyst at Robert W. Baird and Co., "would perhaps be a precipitating event and put the bill back on the front burner" in the Senate. That's because many emitters feel they would have influence in the crafting of legislation, while EPA rules would represent top down command and control. "The main power of the EPA threat isn't the certainty of strict regulations," said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, LLC. "It's the uncertainty about what you're going to get." But political considerations by Senate Democratic leaders and the White House, including whether tackling climate change or immigration helps their November election prospects more, are still a factor. A senior Senate aide speculated that senators from both parties might be looking for ways to avoid acting on either bill this year to avoid angering different constituenc
