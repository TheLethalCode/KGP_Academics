 Bhola, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  Police on Wednesday took a BNP Chaatra Union leader in Bhola under protective custody after she alleged she was raped by Jubo League men. This leader of BNP's local women's wing was allegedly kidnapped and raped on Monday night. Locals rescued her on Tuesday morning. That afternoon she was taken to a local clinic. The victim was then taken to Abdus Salam, assistant superintendent of police of Bhola Sadr Circle, under the supervision of former Bhola BNP president Mozammel Haque. The woman recounted the violation she had suffered. She was then taken to the police super. Bhola police super Bashir Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "I ordered the Tajumuddin police chief to file the case after listening to her complaint." "Those involved with the crime will not be spared," Bashir said. Tajumaddin police chief Mohammad Irfan said the case was filed by the victim herself at around 8pm, where she accused Juba League cadres Rakib, Sohel, Nazu, Abbas and Al Amin. Following this, the Bhola BNP demonstrated protesting the rape in Tajumaddin, Lalmohan and Bhola town demanding arrest of the rapists and their punishment. Maj Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, who lost in the by-elections of Apr 24, led the demonstration at 10am in Lalmohan. While addressing a rally at his home, Hafiz said, "The so-called by-election has led to the burial of democracy." He alleged that a dreadful situation was prevailing in Lalmohan, where lives and property of the people were not secure. "Miscreants of the ruling party are swooping on the innocents," he claimed. Meanwhile, rivals drove a BNP activist from his shelter under the Hawlader Residential Project in Dewalkandi area of Lalmohan. The activist, Bacchu, alleged that a group of AL supportersled by local AL leader Amzad, beat him severely. However, Amzad denied the allegations. When contacted, the newly elected MP, Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon, told bdnews24.com: "Lalmohan and Tajumaddin will be the two hubs of peace." "No injustice or persecution will be tolerated here." Shaon vowed that stern action would be taken against those involved in any criminal or wrongful activities. bdnews2
