 CARACAS, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez opened a Twitter account on Tuesday, launching himself into the digital fray to combat opponents who have seized on the micro-blogging site to criticize his socialist government.

"The Internet is a battle trench because it is bringing a current of conspiracy," Chavez said earlier in March. Critics say the president intends to censor the Web, and that a plan to channel all Internet traffic through the state telecom company is a sign he plans to silence online dissent. Chavez denies any intent to censor, despite having said previously that the Internet "cannot be free."
