 BEIJING, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China was 'pained' by the loss of a women's gymnastics team bronze medal from the Sydney Olympics but respected the decision to withdraw it after team member Dong Fangxiao was adjudged to have lied about her age. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked for the medal to be returned Wednesday after an International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) probe into Dong's age concluded she had been younger than the minimum age requirement of 16 in 2000.

The FIG also investigated Yang, who also won a bronze in the uneven bars in Sydney, but found there was insufficient evidence to prove age fraud and she was let off with a warning. The case against Yang, the wife of China's three-time Olympic champion Yang Wei, was triggered when she admitted on Chinese television before the Beijing Games that she had been 14 when she competed at Sydney. During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the FIG was ordered by the IOC to investigate the age of China's He Kexin, women's team and uneven bars gold medallist. He, along with team mates Jiang Yuyuan, Yang Yilin, Li Shanshan and Deng Linlin, were subsequently declared eligible by the FIG two months after they won China's first ever Olympic team gold in women's gymnast
