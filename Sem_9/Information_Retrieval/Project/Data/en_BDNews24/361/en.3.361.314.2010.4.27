 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Thimphu, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  Member states have accepted a Bangladesh proposal on guaranteeing fair opportunities to professionals of all countries as the SAARC summit is set to sign a deal on trade in services, officials say. Dhaka proposed harmonisation of curriculum of all educational institutes in the SAARC so that all eight countries can survive in the trade in services by producing quality human resources after the agreement on trade in services comes into force. The foreign secretaries of Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the SAARC standing committee meeting Sunday accepted the proposal made by Bangladesh foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes, an official attending the meeting told bdnews24.com Monday. The two-day Thimphu summit, to be attended by the head of states and governments, on April 28 and 29 will sign the SAARC agreement on trade in services, which was not incorporated into the SAFTA agreement.

Officials say that the proposed services deal is a framework agreement similar to the General Agreement on Trade in Services of the World Trade Organisation. The officials involved in the process say that the agreement will have no timeframe for opening up markets of the member countries. As per the draft, the respective professional bodies of member countries will decide the process of recognising each other's certificates.

This schedule will essentially provide the conditions and requirements for liberalising different service sectors.
