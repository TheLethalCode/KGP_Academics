 JAKARTA, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Thailand Thursday warned the international community not to meddle in its political affairs as anti-government Red Shirts called for EU observers on the streets of Bangkok. Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya told reporters after meeting his Indonesian counterpart, Marty Natalegawa, that the Thai government was "in control" of the situation and did not need foreign assistance. "There is no need for international intervention at this point in time," Kasit told a press conference when asked if Thailand needed outside help to deal with its political turmoil. "I think we're very much in control of the situation and it's still very much an internal affair of Thailand." Red Shirt leaders on Thursday made a further attempt to broaden the month-long dispute that has several times erupted in violence, killing 27 people and injuring almost 1,000 in Bangkok. The movement -- which wants immediate elections -- released a letter it sent to EU ambassador David Lipman making an "urgent request" for Europe to send monitors to Bangkok to prevent another crackdown. The letter followed an invitation issued by Red leaders to Bangkok's diplomatic community asking them to visit the sprawling protest last week. Kasit said his government had been "concerned" that some diplomats had taken up the offer, although he did not specify who. "We do not want to see that happen again," he said. "We're trying to solve the problem within the confines of the rules of law, and trying to avoid the use of force and trying to talk to the protesters for them of course to come to the negotiating table and... disarm," Kasit said. He said he was visiting Indonesia, a fellow founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to express his government's gratitude for Jakarta's expressions of concern. He also wanted to give a first-hand account of the situation and outline the steps the government plans to take to end the crisis. "There's no need for ASEAN help but the expressions of concern by each ASEAN country we fully appreciate," he said. "We are a functioning government. We are in a position to handle the situation." Kasit met Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono later in the day and received assurances that Indonesia "respects the sovereignty of Thailand," according to a presidential spokesman. "The president hopes a political solution can be achieved in a way that is peaceful, democratic and in accordance with the rules of law," spokesman Dino Patti Djalal told report
