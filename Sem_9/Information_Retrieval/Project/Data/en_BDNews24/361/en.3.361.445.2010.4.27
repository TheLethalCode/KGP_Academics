 WASHINGTON, Apr 27(bdnews24.com/Reuters)- US President Barack Obama on Monday launched an effort to get voters who propelled him to victory in 2008 to rally behind Democrats and help turn back Republicans in November congressional elections. Obama, in a video message distributed to his supporters, formally leaped into the election campaigns for November in which Democrats are trying to protect their strong majorities in the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Democratic fortunes have sagged in recent months and most political analysts believe Republicans are poised to make major gains in November. Obama rode to victory in 2008 with the benefit of millions of first-time voters who had not been involved in politics. He is seeking to recapture that grassroots appeal for his party this year, specifically reaching out to young people, African-Americans, Latinos and women. Energizing voters is a potentially difficult step because Obama's name is not on the ballot in November and voter turnout in non-presidential election years is typically much lower than in years when a presidential election is held. In the video message distributed to 13 million supporters by email, Obama said party loyalists were asked a few months ago to help set priorities for 2010 and provide advice on how best to win elections in November. "You told us your first priority was to make sure the same people who were inspired to vote for the first time in 2008 go back to the polls in 2010. So that's what we're going to do," Obama said. He added: "If you help us do that-- if you help us make sure that first-time voters in 2008 make their voices heard again in November, then together we will deliver on the promise of change, and hope, and prosperity for generations to come." Obama has already done several fundraisers for Democratic candidates and is expected to do more in the months ahead as well as stump for individual candidates as is traditional. In Los Angeles last week raising money for endangered Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, he acknowledged that Democrats face a hard fight in November, citing the struggling U.S. economy. 'TOUGH RACE' "It is always a tough race if you're the incumbent in this kind of economic environment," he said. Many Americans are in a restive mood over the 9.7 percent unemployment rate, are dubious about a healthcare overhaul Obama pushed through Congress and are concerned about the size and cost of the federal government. "The fundamental problem facing President Obama and the Democrats isn't that they haven't tried hard to sell their agenda, it's that voters in increasing numbers, and particularly independents, just aren't buying it," said Brian Walsh, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. All 435 House seats are up for grabs in November as well as more than a third of the Senate's 100 seats. Experts believe Republicans could threaten Democratic control of the House and make gains in the Senate. More Republicans in Congress would make it more difficult for Democrats to carry out Obama's ambitious agenda. Democrats would like to push through an overhaul of US financial regulations, climate change legislation and immigration reform while they still have strong control of Congr
