 COLOMBO, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera scored undefeated fifties to lift Sri Lanka to 262 for three against New Zealand at stumps on the first day of the second Test on Wednesday. The pair shared an unbroken 147 run fourth-wicket partnership to leave Sri Lanka with a solid first innings platform on a dry pitch. Jayawardene batted the longest, facing 210 balls for his workmanlike 79, an innings of patient accumulation that included just seven boundaries. Samaraweera was left unbeaten on 78 from 139 balls having hit 10 boundaries by the close.

Vettori passed the milestone when he dismissed Tharanga Paranavitana (19) and Kumar Sangakkara (50) either side of lunch.

Although disappointed not to have taken more wickets, Vettori would have been pleased with the efforts of his bowlers, who showed greater discipline than in the first Test. Sri Lanka had to graft for runs and scored only 146 in the first 56 overs in the morning and afternoon before Jayawardene and Samaraweera raised the tempo in the final session. The only casualty for the hosts during a truncated 90-minute morning session was opener Paranavitana, who was caught by Ross Taylor in the slips off Vettori. After the lunch interval, Tillakaratne Dilshan was caught and bowled by Iain O'Brien off a leading edge for 29. Sangakkara stroked a stylish 50 from 96 balls with nine boundaries before mistiming a slog sweep and being caught at mid-wicket off Vettori. Sri Lanka made three changes to the team that won the first Test, bringing in batsman Chamara Kapugedera, spinner Rangana Herath and fast bowler Dammika Prasad. Spinner Ajantha Mendis was left out due to a back problem, Angelo Mathews was omitted with a hamstring strain and Nuwan Kulasekara was rested as a precautionary measure after a heavy workload in recent weeks. New Zealand were uncha
