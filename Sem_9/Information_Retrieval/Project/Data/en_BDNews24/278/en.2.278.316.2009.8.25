 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The government has approved three projects worth Tk 1.52 billion to upgrade three of the country's premier sports stadia ahead of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, a minister said on Tuesday. "Bangladesh will co-host the cricket world cup for the first time. It is a glorious achievement, so these three projects have great importance in the upcoming arrangements," AK Khandokar, the planning minister, told reporters after a meeting of the National Economic Council's executive committee. Some Tk 310 million has been allocated to renovate and develop Bangabandhu National Stadium, which is scheduled to host the opening ceremony of the cricket world cup in 2011. Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur will see Tk 640 million targeted to upgrade the facility to ICC standards, while Tk 570 million has been allocated to improve Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Narayangonj, as a back-up venue for the event. Khandokar said the projects would be wholly financed by the government and implemented under the youth and sports ministry. He said the improvements should be completed this year. The tournament's first match, slated for Feb 19, will also be held in Bangladesh, although the venue is yet to be finalised. Seven other matches, including a quarter-final, will also be held in the country. Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka will co-host the tournament. The prime minister, who presided over the NEC meeting, directed the planning ministry to consider Chittagong's request to host some of the matches. bd
