<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  The government is moving to reduce migration costs to curb illegal human trafficking, the labour and overseas employment minister said on Tuesday, a day after 175 Bangladeshis who had been detained in the Andamans were handed over by India. "The process of reducing migration costs has already started in consultation with the International Labour Organisation, recruiting agencies and countries concerned," the minister, Khandker Musharraf Hossain, told reporters at the Secretariat. He said the current "cost of migration" turned out to be around Tk 84,000. The minister said the government was aiming to half the cost to around Tk 40,000 on average. On the return of the 175 Bangladeshis, Musharraf said: "An unexpected illegal gang is involved with human trafficking. They traffic in humans by cheating people, promising them to send abroad at a low cost." Thai authorities originally captured some 448 Myanmar and Bangladeshi nationals in the Bay of Bengal as they were trying to reach Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They were later reportedly put on six large boats by the Thai Navy and abandoned in the deep sea. Indian Coast Guards eventually rescued them as the boats drifted westward to the Andaman coast. After verification of nationality, 49 Bangladeshis were sent back earlier this year. The second batch of 175 Bangladeshis reached Kolkata from Port Blair last week. bdne
