 SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Monday its new operating system for Mac computers will go on sale this Friday, a bit earlier than expected, as the company looks to continue to expand its share of the PC market. Apple's new Snow Leopard software will sell as an upgrade for $29, starting August 28. Apple had previously said it would ship in September. Apple sold 2.6 million Mac computers in the June quarter, up 4 percent from a year ago. The company is the No. 4 PC maker in the U.S., according to research group Gartner, with 8.7 percent of that market. It does not rank in the top 5 in global shipments. Apple rival Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system is due in October. Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple fell 75 cents to $168.47 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq
