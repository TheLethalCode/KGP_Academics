 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)Kowmi, Doulatpur and one unit of the Adamjee jute mills will resume operations soon, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on jute and textiles ministry said on Tuesday. "The ministry has approved the resumption of operations in the Kowmi and Doulatpur jute mills soon, while one unit of the Adamjee Jute Mills will start productions by this year," Akhtaruzzaman Babu told reporters after attending a meeting of the watchdog in parliament. The parliamentary panel had recommended to the ministry for the resumption of operations in the mills, Babu added. Production in Doulatpur Jute Mills in Sirajganj stopped in 2002 and Khulna's Kowmi in 2007. Adamjee Jute Mills were shut on June 30, 2002 and most of the mills were handed over to Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority. A garment factory has already been set up there. The committee chair said, "There was a conspiracy to destroy the jute industry while neighbouring India was setting up new mills." He added that the jute production was satisfactory. "Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation has collected jute worth Tk 210 crore. The government has taken initiatives to run the mills profitably with the collected jute." The BJMC governs country's 27 jute mills. bdnews
