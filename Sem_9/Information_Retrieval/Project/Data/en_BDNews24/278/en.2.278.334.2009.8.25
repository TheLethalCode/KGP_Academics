 GOHEUNG, South Korea Aug 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's first space rocket blasted off on Tuesday, carrying a scientific satellite in a launch likely to boost its nascent space program that is being warily monitored by North Korea. The payload separated from the second stage booster about eight minutes after lift-off and entered Earth's orbit, a ground control announcer said at the space center on the southern coast of the country about 350 km (220 miles) from Seoul. The launch was expected to rile prickly North Korea, which was hit by UN sanctions after it fired off a long-range rocket in April in what was widely seen as a disguised missile test. Pyongyang, which chastised the world body for the punishment, said earlier this month it was paying close attention to the South's rocket and how the world would react to it. The launch came on the second attempt after the scheduled lift-off on August 19 was aborted because of a glitch with pressure gauge software. Fuel had been removed after the halt, requiring several days to reschedule. The development of the rocket, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or Naro-1, depended heavily on Russia's Khrunichev space production center, which built the first stage booster, conducted tests and provided technical assistance. The satellite is designed to monitor the Earth's radiant energy. The Naro-1 is 33 meters (108 ft) long and the two-stage rocket was built at a cost of 502.5 billion won ($400 million). South Korea wants to build a rocket on its own by 2018 and send a probe to monitor the moon by 2025. It also wants to develop a commercial service to launch satellites. But its space program lags far behind Japan, China, India, and to some extent North Korea. Seoul is betting that a successful launch will give it the technical prowess to catch up quickly with its rivals. Apart from North Korea, few doubt the South's launch will be anything but for its civilian space program, although it does raise questions about implications for regional security. Budget and legal constraints will weigh on South Korea even as it tries to move forward with the program, Jane's Intelligence Review said in a report last week. "South Korea's pursuit of international co-operation and commitment to exploring outer space peacefully combined with budget constraints will preclude Seoul from embarking on large-scale and accelerated SLV development," it said. South Korea's space agency had tried to play down expectations, saying that only about 30 percent of countries' first attempts to put a satellite into orbit succ
