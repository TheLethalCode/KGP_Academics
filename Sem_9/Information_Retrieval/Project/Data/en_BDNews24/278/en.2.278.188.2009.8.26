 COLOMBO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat first against New Zealand in the second Test of their two-match series on Wednesday. Sri Lanka made three changes to the team that won the first Test by 202 runs, including batsman Chamara Kalugedera, spinner Rangana Herath and fast bowler Dammika Prasad. Spinner Ajantha Mendis was left out due to a back niggle, and Angelo Mathews was omitted because of a hamstring strain. Nuwan Kulasekara was also rested due to concerns about his workload in recent weeks. New Zealand named an unchanged team. Sri Lanka: Kumar Sangakkara (captain), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Tharanga Paranavitana, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Prasanna Jayawardene, Muttiah Muralitharan, Thilan Thushara, Rangana Herath, Dammika Prasad, Chamara Kapugedera New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (captain), Tim McIntosh, Martin Guptill, Daniel Flynn, Ross Taylor, Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Iain O'Brien, Chris Martin
