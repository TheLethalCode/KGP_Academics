<TITLE> Victorious Bangladesh on right track, says coach Siddons </TITLE>

 DHAKA, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons is hopeful his young charges will not be taken lightly by opponents after back-to-back series wins in West Indies and Zimbabwe. Bangladesh swept the Tests and one-day series against a boycott-hit West Indies before thrashing Zimbabwe 4-1 in a one-day series this month. The International Cricket Council (ICC) was criticised for prematurely awarding Test status to Bangladesh in 2000. They had lost all but seven of their 59 Tests, with one win against Zimbabwe, going into the Caribbean tour. Siddons felt the situation was beginning to change. "There is now no doubt that despite the negativeness from some quarters following the performance in England in the ICC World T20 this year, this group of players is gaining ground on the big boys of international cricket and they are improving with every series," he said Wednesday. "We all know that we have a long way to go to be classed as a real threat to the top four teams but they will no longer take us lightly," he told Bangladesh Cricket Board's official website www.tigercricket.com. "There is definite signs of us improving and that we are on the right track for big things in the future." The team were given a warm welcome on their return last week following the back-to-back tours. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has announced a public reception after the Muslim fasting month Ramadan. Bangladesh became the first team to win all games in a Test and one-day series in West Indies. They went on to register their highest one-day total of 320-8 and then successfully chased a 300-plus total for the first time in the Zimbabwe ODIs. Bangladesh have a tough season ahead and their Australian coach urged supporters to be realistic. "We have a very big season coming up, especially from the end of December," he said. Bangladesh face Sri Lanka and India, tour New Zealand and face England at home and away, with the next World Twenty20 to be staged in May. "We would all love instant success at all levels but we should be realistic and be enthused by the prospects of this group," Siddons
