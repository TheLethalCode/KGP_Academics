 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)Thirteen more cases of swine flu have been detected in Bangladesh, taking the total number of cases confirmed in the country to 117, an IEDCR official said Tuesday. "We confirmed 13 new H1N1 flu cases both in and outside of the capital. They are almost all being treated at home due to the slight symptoms," Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told bdnews24.com. Dr Rahman said the majority of cases in the country were initially detected in individuals coming from abroad, but the trend had shifted to patients who had become infected within the country. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. Earlier two of the city's top English-medium schoolsScholastica and Sunbeamsannounced they were suspending their academic activities for an indefinite period from Sunday. The moves, however, were not in line with any governmental directive. Meanwhile, in Mymensing a seminar on the H1N1 flu virus was held at Mymensing Agriculture University's microbiology department on Tuesday. Members of the department cautioned against panic, saying medicines and treatment facilities were in place throughout the country. "However, any laxness in monitoring or public awareness could spread the H1N1 flu virus throughout the country next winter," said Alimul Islam, professor of the microbiology department. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. bdnews2
