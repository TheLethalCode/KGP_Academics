 JAKARTA, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian police said on Tuesday they had no information about a possible plan to attack Barack Obama's convoy when the US president visits Indonesia, as reported by Reuters last week. Dynno Chressbon, an intelligence expert at the Jakarta-based Centre for Intelligence and National Security, in an interview with Reuters last week said that a police investigation into last month's Jakarta hotel bombings showed that militants planned to use snipers to attack Obama when he visits Indonesia. But a spokesman for the national police told reporters on Tuesday that the police did not have such information from records and testimony in the investigation. "From the existing documents, no," said Nanan Soekarna when asked about reports that an attack on Obama had been planned by militants. "In fact from police documents there is no such indication," he said, adding "but whatever the information is, the police will take precautions." Chressbon told Reuters he was close to the police investigation into the attacks. Local media have reported on rifts within the police. "Dynno Chressbon is not an adviser to Detachment 88 (Indonesia's counter-terrorism unit), nor to the police chief," Soekarna said. The police confirmed on Tuesday that funding for the suicide bombings at the JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton hotels on July 17, in which nine people died and scores were wounded, came from abroad. Soekarna said police were still investigating where the money came from. Chressbon told Reuters that the overseas funding came from a group linked to Al Qaeda. He said two of four wanted suspects -- Ario Sudarso and Mohamad Syahrir -- who police released pictures of on Wednesday had been prepared as snipers for an attack on Obama, who is due to stop over in Indonesia when he attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Singapore in November. Since the hotel bombings, police have arrested at least five people and three others have been killed during raids, while police said a plot to attack Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had been thwarted. Chressbon also said that militants had discussed a plot to attack the APEC summit in Singapore, although the Singapore government later downplayed the report.
