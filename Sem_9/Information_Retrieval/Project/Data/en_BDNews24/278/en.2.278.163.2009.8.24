<TITLE> Flintoff to have knee surgery a day early </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By John Mehaffey LONDON, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will undergo knee surgery on Monday, a day earlier than planned, with the aim of getting fit in time for England's three one-day internationals in Bangladesh next March. Flintoff, 31, retired from Test cricket after England's Ashes triumph over Australia in the fifth Test at the Oval on Sunday but hopes to continue playing for his country in limited-overs games. He was scheduled to undergo an exploratory operation on his injured right knee on Tuesday but the operation has now been brought forward a day. "The fortunate thing about winning a day early is it brought my operation forward and I will get that done tonight and for me it's all about getting fit again," Flintoff told a news conference on Monday. "The surgeon has got a good idea what he's going to find. We will see when I wake up where I'm at with it. There's a tour of Bangladesh which I desperately want to be involved in so realistically that will be my first target." Flintoff, whose celebrations after England regained the Ashes at the same venue four years ago have become part of English folklore, said he had been more restrained this time. "It was different, I had a few beers last night and then went to bed," he said. "As good as it was last time, this was more poignant. I couldn't ask for a better way to finish surrounded by friends, family, a special team. I played a part in an Ashes victory, it doesn't get much better."
