 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has upheld the High Court orders that allowed senior Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedee to travel abroad. The five-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin on Monday rejected the government appeal against the High Court ruling. Barrister Abdur Razzak, the counsel for Sayeedee, told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the former Jamaat MP had no legal bar to go abroad now. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said in the hearing that the Jamaat leader had not yet admitted that his role during the 1971 war of independence was wrong. The High Court on Aug 12 ruled illegal the government action on his travel bar. The Appellate Division stayed that rule within hours. The High Court had also asked the government why his travel bar should not be declared illegal. On July 24, immigration officials at Zia International Airport stopped the Jamaat leader from his Saudi Arabia travel. Rafique Bin Sayeedee, Sayeedee's son, told bdnews24.com that huis father was to fly to Jeddah to join a seminar there at the invitation of the Saudi religious ministry. But the immigration police refused to let him go without showing any reason and he returned home, Rafique said. The seminar Sayeedee was going to attend takes place every year. He was also scheduled to perform Umrah. Sayeedee filed a writ petition on July 27 challenging the government. bdne
