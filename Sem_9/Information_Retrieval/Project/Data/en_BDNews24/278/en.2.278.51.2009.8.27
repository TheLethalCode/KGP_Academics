 LONDON, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier League leaders Tottenham Hotspur recorded their fourth win in as many matches on Wednesday with a comfortable 5-1 win over second division Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup second round. First half strikes from midfielders Tom Huddlestone and Jamie O'Hara and a first goal for England forward Peter Crouch put Spurs 3-0 ahead halftime. The 2008 League Cup winners and losing finalists last season added two more after the break through David Bentley and Russian international Roman Pavlyuchenko after Rovers had pulled one back from the penalty spot. Wigan Athletic, beaten 5-0 by Manchester United last Saturday, endured a miserable evening at second division Blackpool losing 4-1 and becoming the first Premier League team to exit the competition. Elsewhere, there were wins for Carlisle United, Cardiff City and Newcastle United. The third round draw, which takes place Saturday, introduces the Premier League sides involved in European competitions this season.
