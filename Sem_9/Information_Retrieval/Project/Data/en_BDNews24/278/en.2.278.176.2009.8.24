 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court is expected to start hearings from Tuesday on the president's reference seeking directives on the BDR mutiny trial process. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking the chief justice's opinion on whether the BDR mutineers could be tried under the Army Act. The special reference has been included in Tuesday's work-list. A full Appellate Division bench, of 11 members headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, scheduled to begin a hearing at 9.30am. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam will table the reference, following which the amici curiae appointed by the court will give their opinions. The Supreme Court appointed 10 amici curiae, or senior lawyers, on Aug 19 to assist in the reference hearing. The amici curiae are Kamal Hossain, Rafique-ul Haque, TH Khan, Amir-ul-Islam, Mahmudul Islam, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Ajmalul Hossain, ASM Mesbahuddin and AF Hassan Ariff. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under military or civil law. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 26-28 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. bd
