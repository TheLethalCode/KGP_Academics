<TITLE> ICC's umpires rules need changing, says Bird </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former English Test umpire Dickie Bird has joined the chorus of people imploring the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change their rules to ensure the best officials are appointed to the biggest series. Under ICC regulations, umpires are banned from standing in matches involving teams from their own countries, ensuring matches are overseen by "neutral" umpires. Critics have argued that the best umpires should be appointed regardless of their nationality and the teams involved, and the issue came to a head during the recent Ashes series between England and Australia. Australia's Simon Taufel has been officially recognised as the ICC's umpire of the year for the past five seasons but was prevented from officiating in the Ashes, which was clouded by a series of contentious decisions. "I don't know whether the ICC or the ruling body has got the best umpires, but you must get the best umpires, especially to do an Ashes series when there's so much at stake," Bird told Sky Sports on Tuesday. "Decisions can cost a Test match or a player's career. It looked at times as if the pressure got at the two umpires out in the middle." Bird, 76, said he sympathised with the umpires who did control the Ashes series because of the extra scrutiny they were under but said their jobs would be made easier if more video replays were allowed. "It's not an easy job, it's very difficult, but now there are electronic aids so they should be able to get most of the decisions right," he said.
