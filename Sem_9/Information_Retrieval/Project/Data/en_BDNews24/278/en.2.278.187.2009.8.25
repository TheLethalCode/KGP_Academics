 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The UK's Charity Commission is reaching out to Muslim organisations and mosques around the country, encouraging them to register as charities during the month of Ramadan. It is estimated that there are over two thousand mosques in Britain. Many of them are not charity registered, though they traditionally collect charity donations during Ramadan. It has also become common for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani TV channels to raise funds for Muslim organisations and mosques by live broadcast. Ghulam Rasool, Head of the Charity Commission's Faith and Social Cohesion Unit, said: "During the month of Ramadan, Muslims seek spiritual salvation through fasting, praying and through their support of the poor and needy, both in their own communities and abroad." "This Ramadan we are encouraging organisations and mosques that raise funds or carry out charitable work to take a look at the Charity Commission website to find out about registering as a charity." "Registration, which is a legal requirement for most mosques, brings many benefits, and will help you maximise the money you raise so you can make an even greater contribution to those in need." The Charity Commission, the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, for the first time, is running an advertisement campaign on ethnic satellite television channels during the month of Ramadan. The campaign is one part of the Commission's ongoing work with faith-based charities, and encourages mosques and Muslim organisations that may be charitable to register as charities. Commission believes over Ramadan many Muslim organisations and mosques around the country will benefit from the generosity of those in their communities. However many of these organisations don't realise that registering with the Charity Commission is a legal requirement. It also helps ensure that the donations these organisations and mosques are given go further and can enhance their reputation. The Commission's campaign, on four satellite television channels, will remind viewers of the many benefits of registering with the Charity Commission. The Commission says charities registered with them will have the benefit of a charity registration number and the badge/brand of charity, increasing public trust and confidence in their organisation. It also can maximise the financial benefit of donations through Gift Aid arrangements. This means that currently for every 1.00 donated through Gift Aid charities can claim back up to 28p from the Government. Benefit from generous tax break and can have access to free expert advice. Amjid Raza, secretary of Dudley Central Mosque, which registered in January this year, said: "Our mosque is the heart of the community, both as a place of worship and through the other services we provide locally." "Being a registered charity shows everyone that we're open and accountable and we've also been able to apply for more funding since registering. The Commission provided us with free expert advice during the registration process and we know we can go back to them if we need further support." In February 2009 the Charity Commission engaged a research company to carry out a survey of mosques in England and Wales. In total, 716 mosques were contacted by telephone and interviews were completed with 247 of these organisations. The report's key findings included the following:  Around two thirds (67%) of respondents reported having had contact with the Charity Commission;  Close to half (49%) reported that they would go to Charity Commission staff for advice and support;  The mosques had an average of 11 people on their trustee board or equivalent body;  Over half (52%) had people aged between 18 and 30 with management responsibility.
