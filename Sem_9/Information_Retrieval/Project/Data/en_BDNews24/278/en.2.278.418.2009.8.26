 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)The government has said it wishes to regularise overseas work opportunities for Bangladeshis in Libya and Iraq, two countries that have been attracting increasing numbers of home-grown workers without proper paperwork. "Bangladeshi workers are travelling to Libya and Iraq illegally as we don't have any agreements with those countries regarding manpower," expatriates welfare minister Khondker Musharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com at the Secretariat. Hossain said over 2,000 Bangladeshi workers headed to Dubai every week, but most of them ended up travelled on to Iraq or Libya to look for employment opportunities. He said the government was now looking to establish missions in the two countries to legitimise and exploit the trend. "Envoys may be appointed to Iraq soon," said Hossain. Bangladesh closed its mission to Iraq at the onset of hostilities in 2003. "Export of Bangladeshi manpower did not reduce during the global economic downturn, rather it increased," said Hossain. The minister said in the first eight months of the year, around 3,000 more workers went overseas to work than in the same period in 2006. "The number will increase even more by the end of the year," he said. Meanwhile, Romania has also shown interest in the Bangladeshi workforce, while New Zealand is set to take an initial batch of 60 agricultural workers, to be followed by further groups in the future. A high-powered meeting, headed by finance minister AMA Muhith is scheduled to discuss manpower related issues, including scope for fresh markets, at a meeting on Oct 30. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and commerce minister Farook Khan are also expected to participate in the meeting. b
