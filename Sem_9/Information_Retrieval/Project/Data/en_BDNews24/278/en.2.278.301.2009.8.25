 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)-The main opposition BNP has called countrywide procession and rally on Sept 6 and 7 to protest what it said were the price hike of daily essentials, worsening law and order, tender manipulation by ruling party cadres, killings and violence. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain declared the programme at a news conference held at the BNP's central office at Naya Paltan on Tuesday. Procession and rallies will be held in six divisional cities, including Dhaka, on Sept 6 and throughout the country the next day. Delwar said, "The government has completely failed to curb the price level. They had previously said that they would take initiatives to keep the price of essentials under the purchasing capacity of the people during Ramadan. But the prices have escalated in the last three days of Ramadan. They have failed to control prices." He said, "Their men are manipulating tender and took possession of halls. Law and order has worsened. The government has failed everywhere. Being 'people's party' BNP is protesting the failure of this government." BNP has already declared a three-day programme on Sept 3, 10 and 11 to celebrate the day of the release of party chief Khaleda Zia from prison on Sept 11 and her elder son Tarique Rahman's release on bail on September 3. BNP's joint secretary general Mirza Abbas, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, former MP Selim Reza Habib and Jubo Dal joint general secretary Abdus Salam Azad were also present at the conference. bd
