 TEHRAN, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mourners gathered in Tehran on Thursday to mark the death from cancer of a leading Iraqi Shi'ite cleric and politician, whose passing may intensify political turmoil ahead of Iraq's national elections. Mourners carried the coffin of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who headed the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (ISCI), one of Iraq's most powerful Shi'ite parties, outside Iraq's embassy in Tehran, the ISCI's television station showed. A day after Hakim died in Tehran, Iranian news agency IRNA reported his body would be taken to the city of Qom, a major center of Shi'ite learning, for another ceremony before being removed to Iraq's Shi'ite holy city of Najaf for burial. Iranian state media reported that former Iraqi prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari and Iranian officials including Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki attended the ceremony in Tehran. The death of Hakim, who was born in 1950 and became the ISCI's leader in 2003 when his elder brother was killed in a car bomb, could thrust the group into a succession struggle even though Hakim's son Ammar has been groomed to take over. Ammar, in his late 30s, was named interim chief, but top ISCI clerics are expected to announce a permanent leader soon. A smooth succession will be important as the party, whose once formidable support has waned in the past year, prepares for January's parliamentary elections in which it could face off against Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. A major partner in Maliki's coalition government and until recently an unquestioned ally, the ISCI announced days before Hakim's death the formation of a new Shi'ite alliance that does not include Maliki's Dawa party. Hakim's death fuels uncertainty just as Iraq struggles to recover from major attacks that have undermined public confidence in the government, including August 19 truck bombs that killed almost 100 people at two ministry buildings. Maliki is staking his political future on improving security after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from urban centers. From Najaf, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, added to the expressions of sorrow that have poured in from across Iraq's political and religious spectrum. "His eminence Sistani received news of the death of cleric Abdul Aziz al-Hakim with great sorrow, after long years of sacrifice serving his people and nation in order to save it from injustice and dictatorship," his office said in a statement. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement carried by Iranian news agency IRNA, said of Hakim's death: "It is a big loss for the Iraqi nation and government and for the Islamic Republic of Iran it is a painful loss."
