 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England regained the Ashes with a sweeping 197-run victory over Australia in the fifth Test at The Oval on Sunday despite a battling century from Michael Hussey which threatened to take the game into a fifth day. A capacity crowd basking happily on a sun-baked evening erupted in scenes reminiscent of the corresponding Test four years ago when a draw was enough to bring the Ashes back after 16 years. "It's a special moment for us, we had to dig deep in a very hard series. It has not sunk in yet," England captain Andrew Strauss said in a pitchside interview. Australia, who needed at least a draw to retain the Ashes they won back by crushing England 5-0 in 2006-7, were dismissed for 348 in their second innings after being set a record 546 for victory. The series was tied 1-1 after Australia won the fourth Test at Headingley within three days. Only Hussey defied the England attack for any length of time, scoring his 10th Test century. He was the last man out, caught at short-leg by Alastair Cook for 121 in five-and-a-half hours at the crease. "We have not been good enough. Full credit to England and Andrew Strauss for the way he has led the team," Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. Australia made brave noises on Saturday evening about scoring more than 100 runs more than any team to win a Test. Their confidence had been boosted by an assured opening partnership of 80 before the close but in reality both the target or the prospect of batting more than six sessions to secure the draw were out of reach. Simon Katich and Shane Watson resumed on another fine, hot day with a capacity crowd anticipating an England victory. The partnership lasted only another six runs and 15 minutes before Katich (43) misjudged an arm ball from Graeme Swann. The little left-hander thrust his right pad out without offering a shot and was given out lbw. Watson succumbed for 40 in the next over, also lbw, when an off-cutter from Stuart Broad thudded into his pads. DETERMINED PONTING An early finish seemed likely with Broad exploiting the variable bounce and Swann getting the odd ball to grip and turn. But Ponting, at his most determined, and Hussey, at his most obdurate, fought hard against the pair who had taken nine wickets between them in the first innings. They went to lunch with the score at 171 for two, after Hussey had offered a half-chance to Paul Collingwood at first slip when the bell flew between the fielder's legs to the boundary. Ponting mistimed several attempted pulls but otherwise played with stern self-discipline. He reached his half-century in what will probably be his final Ashes Test in England before edging Swann on to Collingwood's left boot. Collingwood turned quickly but was unable to gather the rebound. Two run-outs in the space of six balls accounted for Australia's two best batsman. Hussey called for a swift single after driving Steve Harmison to Andrew Flintoff at mid-on. Ponting (66), who hesitated momentarily, was run out a magnificent flat throw which struck the stumps at the striker's end. Clarke followed to a bizarre dismissal in the following over without scoring when he played the ball on to the foot of Alastair Cook at short-leg. Strauss, running around to leg from first slip, seized the ricochet and flicked the ball on to the stumps with Clarke scrambling in vain to make his ground. Hussey on 55 survived a chance to the unfortunate Collingwood before Marcus North was stumped by Matt Prior off Swann for 10. Hussey and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin raised Australia's hopes with a lively seventh wicket partnership of 91 from 135 balls. Haddin used quick footwork to counter the bounce, cutting and gliding his way to 34 before hoisting Swann to Strauss in the unaccustomed position of deep mid-wicket. Mitchell Johnson fell for a duck caught at second slip by a grateful Collingwood off Steve Harmison. Peter Siddle was out to the same bowler for 10 and Stuart followed next ball to put Harmison on a hat-trick. Swann, who took the final wicket, was the most successful of the bowlers with four for 120 from 40.2 o
