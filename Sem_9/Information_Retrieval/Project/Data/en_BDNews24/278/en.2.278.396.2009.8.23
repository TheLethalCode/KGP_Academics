 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two dramatic run-outs in the space of six balls accounted for Australia's two best batsmen on the fourth day of the fifth and final Ashes Test against England on Sunday. Captain Ricky Ponting was brilliantly run out by Andrew Flintoff for 66 with a direct hit on the stumps while Michael Clarke failed to score after straying out of his crease. At tea Australia, set a world record 546 to win, were 265 for five. The Australians, who need at least a draw to retain the Ashes, battled to 217 for two in the afternoon session when Michael Hussey pushed Steve Harmison to mid-on where Flintoff grabbed the ball and threw down the stumps at the striker's end with a magnificent throw.

The variable bounce and the amount of spin extracted by Swann indicated an early finish but Ponting and Hussey, surrounded by a cluster of fielders, fought hard to take Australia to 171 for two at lunch. Ponting brought up his half-century after the interval and then received a let-off when a ball from Swann hit Paul Collingwood on the foot at first slip. The ball fell behind the fielder who was unable to gather the catch. Collingwood, England's best all-round fielder, also dropped Michael Hussey on 55 from a Swann delivery, a catch he would normally have accepted without any trouble.
