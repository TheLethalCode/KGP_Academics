 Chittagong, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)Berth operator Everest Enterprise has said it will seek compensation through the courts from former shipping adviser MA Matin over alleged irregularities in the allocation of a container handling contract at Chittagong Container Terminal in January. "Everest will seek Tk 25 crore compensation for financial and goodwill losses, after failing to win the contract despite being the lowest bidder," Shahadat Hossain Selim, owner of the company told a press briefing in Chittagong on Monday. Selim said the case, to be filed soon, would also name the then shipping secretary Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain. "Everest Enterprise was not awarded the deal despite repeated recommendations by the tender evaluation committee," said Selim. "Matin and Motahar violated government guidelines during evaluation of a second tender, which awarded the container deal to Esack Brothers on their last day in office on Jan 6 this year," he said. Meanwhile, on Aug 13, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said the current administration would move to charge Matin over alleged irregularities in the deal. Khan had said he would follow recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry, and refer the case to the Anticorruption Commission to press charges against Matin over "massive irregularities" in awarding the contract to the Esack Brothers. The standing committee, led by Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, formed a sub-committee in May to investigate the allegations against Matin, a retired major-general who was also director general of the Bureau of Anticorruption, the ACC's predecessor. Matin has said he did not breach any rules in the allocation of the contract. bdne
