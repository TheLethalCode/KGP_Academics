<TITLE> Vettori claims 300th wicket in Sri Lanka Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori became the first left-arm spinner to take 300 Test wickets before Sri Lanka reached the opening day tea interval on 146 for three in the second Test on Wednesday. Vettori passed the milestone when he dismissed Tharanga Paranavitana (19) and Kumar Sangakkara (50) but he was unable to remove a stubborn Mahela Jayawardene, who needed 104 deliveries to compile 31 by the break with Thilan Samaraweera on 15. Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat on a dry pitch at the Sinhalese Sports Club and despite making a solid start, they were given a much tougher examination by a New Zealand attack that bowled poorly in the first Test defeat at Galle last week. The hosts rattled along at between four and five runs per over in the 202-run victory at Galle but they have been unable to break free in the 56 overs bowled in the opening two sessions in Colombo. The only casualty for the hosts during a truncated 90-minute morning session was opener Paranavitana, who was caught by Ross Taylor in the slips off Vettori. After the lunch interval, Tillakaratne Dilshan was caught and bowled by Iain O'Brien off a leading edge for 29. Sangakkara stroked a stylish 50 from 96 balls with nine boundaries before mistiming a slog sweep and being caught at mid-wicket off Vettori. Sri Lanka made three changes to the team that won the first Test, bringing in batsman Chamara Kalugedera, spinner Rangana Herath and fast bowler Dammika Prasad. Spinner Ajantha Mendis was left out due to a back problem, Angelo Mathews omitted because of a hamstring strain and Nuwan Kulasekara rested as a precautionary measure after a heavy workload in recent weeks. New Zealand were unchanged.
