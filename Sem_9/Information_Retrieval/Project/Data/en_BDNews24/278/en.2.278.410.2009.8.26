 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com) The government is giving over 700,000 acres of land for tree plantation this year as part of Bangladesh's Climate Change Strategy Action Plan, which was finalised on Wednesday by an inter-ministerial committee. "The government is planning to plant trees on 758,000 acres of land, through a national campaign," state minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud told reporters after the committee's meeting. The government will allocate public land for forestation, which will be worked by members of the public, said Mahmud, who added that the stakeholders would sell the trees when they reached maturity, keeping up to 80 percent of the profits. The remaining money will go to the government, he said. "Guidelines for the social forestation project are now with the law ministry for vetting. The process will be completed in a few weeks. We hope to implement the project this year," said Mahmud. Planning minister AK Khondker, head of the cabinet committee tasked with oversight of the climate change plan, said the government had already allotted Tk 700 crore for the forestation initiative. He said the initiative would also include river dredging to maintain navigability in the nation's vital waterways. The overall budget is likely to be in the region of Tk 30,000 crore over 30 years, he said. "We have to be mindful of climate change issues." There are 44 separate initiatives under six themes in the Climate Change Strategy Action Plan. bd
