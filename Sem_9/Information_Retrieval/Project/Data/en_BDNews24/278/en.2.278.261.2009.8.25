 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The first day's hearing by the Supreme Court of the BDR reference ended on Tuesday with amicus curiae TH Khan stating that Bangladesh Rifles personnel cannot be tried under Army Act as the border force did not fall under the definition of a "disciplined force". Khan told an 11-member Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin, "All forces are run by their respective laws including the trials of their offenders." "The Manual of Bangladesh Military Law says army personnel committing crimes may be tried under the MBML provisions. But BDR members cannot be tried that way, as they aren't a regimented body." "Defence personnel committing crimes may be court-martialled, but BDR jawans cannot be subjected to such legal measures." He also said, "The true purpose of this reference hearing is to court martial the BDR mutineers, though the reference doesn't state that explicitly. The government cannot just try them under the military law even through public notification." "Under the BDR law, the highest punishment for mutiny is seven years jail sentence." Khan said, if necessary, the BDR Act or the Constitution could be amended for the proper trial of the mutineers rather than seeking the Supreme Court's approval for court martial. "Parliament will sit next on Sept 7. The government can then amend the constitution as well as the BDR law." The Supreme Court began hearing the president's BDR mutiny reference in the morning, with attorney general Mahbubey Alam placing the reference in front of a full Appellate Division bench. Alam, presenting the reference from 9.45am, began describing the events of Feb 25-26. He said 73 people had been killed in the mutiny, including 57 army officers. He then went on to present the relevant provisions of the BDR Act and Army Act that might be applied for trying the mutineers. The placing of the reference is being followed by statements from the amici curiae appointed by the court. The Supreme Court has appointed 10 amici curiae, or senior lawyers, to advise on the reference. The 10 are Kamal Hossain, Rafique-ul Haque, TH Khan, Amir-ul-Islam, Mahmudul Islam, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Ajmalul Hossain, ASM Mesbahuddin and A F Hassan Ariff. After Khan gave his statement, Rafique-ul Haque began his statement to the court before the hearing concluded for the day at around 1.30pm. Proceedings will continue on Wednesday. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the BDR mutiny trial process. bd
