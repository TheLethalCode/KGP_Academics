 HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Bill brought rain and heavy winds to Nova Scotia in eastern Canada on Sunday, which could flood and damage coastal areas and possibly impact offshore oil and gas facilities. The Canadian Weather Office's Hurricane Center said it expected the storm to slow as it moved to Newfoundland later on Sunday, although heavy rain and waves of up to 10 meters (32 feet) could cause damage. "This is not something to be taken lightly," meteorologist Peter Bowyer told a morning briefing. "The waves put on a good show, but enjoy them from a safe distance. Do not try to enjoy them up close and dangerous." The main area under threat on Sunday is the scenic island of Cape Breton, one of Nova Scotia's main tourist areas. Flights were canceled there, and in the provincial capital Halifax, and ferry services were suspended. Bill, the first hurricane of the 2009 season, has already dumped rain on Bermuda and pushed powerful rolling surf onto the shores of the 20-square-mile (52 sq km) British territory, a center for the global insurance industry. No casualties were reported and damage appeared minor. It also brought heavy surf, swells and rain to the US Atlantic seaboard, including the island of Martha's Vineyard, where President Barack Obama and his family are due to start a summer vacation. Atlantic Canada, where the storm is heading, is an energy-producing region, exporting oil, natural gas and refined products to the US Northeast and elsewhere. The Sable Offshore Gas Project, off Nova Scotia, has evacuated staff, but the operator of the massive 98,200 barrel per day Hibernia platform said it would continue to operate normally. Both Sable and Hibernia, a platform that was built to withstand the icebergs that are common in the region is operated by Exxon Mobil Corp. An iceberg sank the Titanic off the coast of Nova Scotia and some 150 of the ship's victims are buried in Halifax. Bill is now a Category 1 storm packing top winds of 85 miles per hour (140 km per hour). Category 1 storms are the mildest on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but are still potentially threatening. Canadian officials said they were particularly worried about heavy rain and the fact that high tides would exacerbate the storm surges that hurricanes bring. The storm will slow somewhat by the time it reaches Newfoundland, but it could still be dangerous
