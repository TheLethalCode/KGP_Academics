 Abdur Rahim Harmacchi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's trade deficit fell for the first time last year by more than half a billion dollars. Economists said import costs remained low over the last fiscal due to the depressed prices of oil, food and fertiliser in the global market amid the economic downturn. Low import costs led to a reduced gap despite a fall in exports, counter to the country's previous history of widening trade deficits year-on-year. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman told bdnews24.com on Monday the reduced trade deficit has been good for the country's balance of payments. He also praised farmers, for bumper crops last year, and "farmers' sons, the remitters", for their contributions to the economy. The trade deficit stood at $6.94 billion for FY 2008-09, down by $576.39 million from the previous year. The $7.52 billion trade deficit in FY 2007-08a year of natural disasters for Bangladesh coupled with high food and oil prices in the international marketwas nearly double the $3.45 billion deficit of 2006-07. Bangladesh Bank data shows imports costs rose by just 4.06 percent last fiscal, compared to a 26.07 percent increase in 2007-08 over 2006-07. According to the central bank, Bangladesh imported goods worth $22.50 billion last fiscal, and $21.63 billion in FY 2007-08. Low import costs more than offset accompanying low growth in the export sector. Exports grew by just 10.31 percent in the last fiscal year amid the global recession, compared to 27.45 percent growth recorded in 2007-08. The country's exports totalled $15.56 billion in the last fiscal, compared to $14.11 billion the previous year. Bangladesh Bank boss Atiur Rahman said the reduced trade deficit has positively impacted the country's economy and balance of payments, despite the low growth in imports and exports. "Reserves reached a more than satisfactory level and are increasing daily. Foreign reserves surpassed $7 billion just one-and-a-half months ago and now stands at $8.3 billion," said Rahman. He said remittances from overseas workers have contributed to the country's reserves: "We can say farmers and their sons are contributing the most overall to our economy." "On one hand, farmers are saving our foreign currency from being used to import food with their bumper crops, and on the other hand their sons are sending back foreign currency earned through their backbreaking labour overseas," said Rahman. Zaid Bakht, senior research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, also said the trade deficit had fallen because food imports came down almost to zero and the cost of fuel and fertiliser had reduced in the global market. "However, imports of capital machinery also reduced, and this is evidence of one kind of sluggishness in the economy in terms of investment," said Bakht. "Whatever the reserves are, no benefits will come if investments do not grow," he said. Imports of rice came down to almost zero last fiscal as a result of bumper Boro and Aman crops. This was in contrast to 2007-08, when the twin disasters of flooding and Cyclone Sidr caused widespread damage to many crops, and a global food crunch caused prices to spiral in the international market. The price of rice reached $1,000 from $400 per tonne that year, which combined with rapidly increasing prices of fertiliser and oil to make imports more costly compared to any time in the past. Imports of rice and wheat declined by 38.31 percent in the last fiscal year in comparison to the 2007-08. They increased by a massive 142.72 percent in the 2007-2008 compared to the previous year. bdnews24.
