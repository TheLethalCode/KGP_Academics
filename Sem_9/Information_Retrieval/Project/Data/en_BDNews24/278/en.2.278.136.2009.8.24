<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will have knee surgery and has withdrawn from the one-day squad to play Australia next month and for the Champions Trophy, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Sunday. Flintoff, 31, will undergo surgery on his injured right knee on Tuesday after helping England to a 2-1 Ashes series victory over Australia at the Oval on Sunday, his final Test. The selectors have opted not to replace Flintoff at this stage for the seven-match one-day series against Australia in September, and a stand in for the Champions Trophy in South Africa from September 22-October 5 will be announced in due course, the ECB said.
