 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)A cell phone number was "traced" after a death threat was sent by SMS to civil aviation minister GM Quader on Tuesday, said the minister's personal secretary. The SMS came from a Grameenphone number to the minister's cell number at around 2:30pm. The message read, "Time and tide wait for none. But one person wait for you. Do you know who is he? He is Azrail. He must come and take your jaan. So, be careful. It is high time." Quader told bdnews24.com later that night, "The police will take action; a general diary has been filed." The minister's personal secretary Abu Tayab told bdnews24.com he had earlier filed a complaint with Uttara Police Station on behalf of the minister. Uttara police chief ABM Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com, "A general diary complaint has been recorded. But we have not been able to identify the sender of the SMS." Tayab, however, told bdnews24.com he had called the number from which the SMS was sent. "After ringing the number repeatedly, a young man answered, saying he was from Darshona in Rangpur." Tayab said the man denied that the SMS was meant as a threat. "He claimed he didn't mean to threaten the minister's life. He told me he sent the SMS as he 'was fond' of GM Quader," said Tayab. "We have informed police of the latest development," he said. Quader told bdnews24.com he believed the man may have been "forced" by others to send the SMS. bdn
