<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court granted anticipatory bail to sacked Proshika chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed on Thursday in a case relating to a violent clash and destruction of property at the NGO's headquarters in Mirpur on Aug 1. The bench of justices Syed Mohammod Dastagir Hossain and Md Rois Uddin also granted anticipatory bail to 14 other individuals named in the same case. The case was filed on Aug 2 by Proshika employee Shamsul Islam at Pallabi Police Station. The governing body of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-governmental organisations, replaced founding chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed in May following repeated allegations by employees of corruption and nepotism. Then, on Aug 1, the ousted chairman led over 200 supporters in a demonstration to the NGO's headquarters and attempted to force their way into the building, sparking violent clashes with Proshika employees that left at least 35 injured. On Aug 11, Faruque obtained High Court permission to enter the NGO's headquarters in Mirpur. bdne
