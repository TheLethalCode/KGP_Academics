 BOGOTA Aug 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombia accused Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Monday of meddling in its internal affairs and said it would lodge a formal protest before the Organization of American States. The accusations came just days before a summit where Chavez is expected to try to rally support against a deal to allow the US military more access to Colombian bases, a plan that has raised concerns across the region, from Brazil to Bolivia.

Former soldier Chavez often clashes with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, a US ally, over charges Venezuela has interfered in Colombia's domestic politics and over Colombia's US-backed war on cocaine traffickers and leftist guerrillas. Regional leaders will meet in Argentina on Friday for a summit of the Unasur group, where governments are expected to discuss the base plan.

"We are not going to put anyone in the dock," Fander Falconi, Ecuador's foreign minister, said during a news conference in Brasilia.
