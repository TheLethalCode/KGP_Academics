 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)India handed 175 Bangladeshi nationals, who had previously been detained in the Andamans, to Bangladesh authorities on Monday. Two sub-inspectors from the Kolkata reserve police handed over the Bangladeshi nationals to Jessore additional district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Banik, officer-in-charge of Benapole check post Khalilur Rahman told bdnews24.com. After completing some border formalities, the group was handed over to representatives of the local Red Crescent Society. "ICRC, Bangladesh has been cooperating fully with the foreign ministry in repatriating the Bangladeshis stranded in the Andaman's," International Committee of the Red Cross tracing officer Shireen Sultana told bdnews24.com. "The Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata also played a role in this matter. "They are now undergoing medical screening at Benapole in view of the swine flu epidemic," she said. Thai authorities originally captured some 448 Myanmar and Bangladeshi nationals in the Bay of Bengal as they were trying to reach Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They were later reportedly put on six large boats by the Thai Navy and abandoned in the deep sea. Indian Coast Guards eventually rescued them as the boats drifted westward to the Andaman coast. After verification of nationality, 49 Bangladeshis were sent back earlier this year. The second batch of 175 Bangladeshis reached Kolkata from Port Blair last week. A spokesperson at the foreign ministry said the repatriation was being supervised by the foreign ministry through the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and deputy high commission in Kolkata. The Deputy high commission in Kolkata sent two officials from the mission to Andamans and they have accompanied them up to Benapole. Earlier, the ministry verified the nationality of these returnees, the spokesman added.. The returnees were being sent to Chittagong and Cox's Bazar under government arrangement. bdnews24
