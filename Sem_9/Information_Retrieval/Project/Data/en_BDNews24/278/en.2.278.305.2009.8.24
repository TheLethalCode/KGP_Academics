 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet committee for economic affairs has approved deals with Tullow Oil plc and ConocoPhillips for oil, gas exploration in three offshore blocks. The decision was taken in a meeting of the committee chaired by finance minister AMA Muhith on Monday. The companies will not be able to work in any disputed waters within the blocks, said Muhith. The minister told reporters it was decided to permit exploration in blocks 5, 10 and 11. Block 5 will be allotted to Tullow Oil, one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration companies in Europe, headquartered in London. ConocoPhillips, the third largest petroleum company based in the US, will get blocks 10 and 11. Monday's decision ends some of the year-long uncertainty regarding the allotment of offshore blocks previously selected by state-owned Petrobangla for IOCs to explore. ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil were shortlisted, among seven IOCs, by the past caretaker government for exploration deals in nine out of Bangladesh's 28 blocks in the Bay. Among the nine blocks, eight are deep-sea and one is shallow. ConocoPhilips won all eight deep-sea blocks it bid for, while Tullow bagged the lone shallow water gas block it competed for. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, after coming to power in January, said Bangladesh was planning to go ahead with awarding of the offshore contracts in the nine blocks after proper scrutiny. Oil and exploration in the Bay has been pending since Khaleda Zia's last BNP administration suspended decisions on energy issues in the final phase of its rule. The subsequent caretaker government also held back from making a final decision on exploration contracts in the face of national debate on whether an interim administration had the authority to make deals with foreign companies. bd
