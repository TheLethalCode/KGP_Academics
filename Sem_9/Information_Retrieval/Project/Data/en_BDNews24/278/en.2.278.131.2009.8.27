 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has suggested the foreign ministry realise compensation from the recruiting agents for cheating Bangladeshi job-seekers abroad. The parliamentary standing committee on foreign ministry also recommended holding an inter-agency meeting to bring back 12 Bangladeshis caught in Vietnam for working there illegally. "There is provision for realising compensation from the recruiting agents for cheating job seekers. But we cannot make it effective," A H Mamood Ali, the committee chairman, told reporters after the meeting at parliament building on Thursday. "Though the task goes to expatriates welfare ministry, foreign ministry must be associated in the process." "Repatriation and collection of compensation lie with the expatriates' welafre ministry. But all Bangladesh missions abroad has no officers of the expatriates' welfare ministry. "So, the foreign ministry should be authorised to repatriate the cheated Bangladeshi workers," said the chairman. "Otherwise, sufferings of the cheated people and their families will increase," he said. Ali, a diplomat-turned-politician, said the recruiting agents sent 12 Bangladeshis to Vietnam promising work there, but they had tourists visas. "The Vietnam authorities caught them one month ago and put them in a hotel resulting in a huge hotel bill. "Now, the question comes, who will pay the hotel bill? This problem is standing in the way of their repatriation," he said. The chairman said their recruiting agents must carry the cost of the return and provide compensation. "We have recommended holding of an inter-agency meeting to bring the 12 cheated Bangladeshis back home," said Ali. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes also attended the meeting.
