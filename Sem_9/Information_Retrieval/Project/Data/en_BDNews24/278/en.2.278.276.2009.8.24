 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)A suspected gangster was killed in a reported gun battle with RAB in Sutrapur in the capital on Monday morning, said police. Sub-inspector Monir Hossain of Shyampur Police Station said Mohammd Masud aka 'Bautta Masud', 26, faced at least four cases--two for murder. He had more cases filed against him with other police stations in Dhaka, Hossain added. RAB-10 deputy director ASP ABM Enamul Kabir said that Masud had thrown a Molotov cocktail at a patrol vehicle of RAB-10 adjacent to Jurain graveyard at around 3:45am. As RAB members challenged him, Masud opened fire and RAB retaliated, leaving him died on the spot. Police retrieved a shutter gun, six rounds of .22 bore rifle bullets, seven rounds of ammo. There were evidence and signs of a cocktail detonation, the sub-inspector said. At least 12 people have died in the last three months in the city in 'encounters' with RAB. Local and international rights groups say the deaths in so-called 'encounters' and 'crossfire' are simply killing without trial. bd
