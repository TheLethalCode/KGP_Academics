 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)-Legal experts Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed and Rafique-ul-Haque have told the Supreme Court that the government can try the BDR mutineers under the Army Act by issuing gazette. Their observation came in contrast to the argument of another senior Supreme Court lawyer T H Khan who had said in the first day's hearing that the renegade border guards cannot be tried under the Army Act since they were not a "disciplined force". Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin led the 11-strong full Appellate Division bench to hear the president's mutiny trial reference for the second day on Wednesday at around 9:45am. Ahmed, an amicus curiae, said: "BDR is not a regimented force, its trial cannot be held under the Army Act." "They can be brought under the Army Act by issuing gazette," he said. The government can issue two gazette notifications one to bring the trial process under the Army Act and the other to suspend the effectiveness of BDR Order on those who would be tried, Ahmed said. Cases like killing the army personnel and looting could be tried under the Army Act, he added. Article 35 of the constitution might be a hindrance here, he observed, as it states that the perpetrators should be tried under the act that was effective on the day of the occurrence. Another amicus curiae, Haque, earlier said: "It is possible to hold trial under the Army Act by issuing gazette." He said since the BDR director general is deputed from the armed forces, the border guards are under his supervision. On the opinion of the Appellate Division he said: "The trial courts are bound to obey the opinions of the 11 judges. The bench of five/six judges of the higher court can ignore the opinion. "But it will not be right to ignore the decision of the 11 judges," Haque said. On the first day, Haque said: "The president can seek legal opinion from the Appellate Division. No question can arise about the law here. The court should give its opinion since the president has referred it." He cited the references sent by presidents of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. "The courts are not bound to obey the opinions of the Appellate Division. But the recent practice is that the trial courts are bound to obey the opinion. The higher court also does not disobey the opinion," Haque told the court on Tuesday. Another amicus curiae, TH Khan, also presented his statement in Tuesday's hearing. He stated that BDR personnel cannot be tried under Army Act as the border force did not fall under the definition of a "disciplined force". "All forces are run by their respective laws including the trials of their offenders." "The Manual of Bangladesh Military Law says army personnel committing crimes may be tried under the MBML provisions. But BDR members cannot be tried that way, as they aren't a disciplined force." "Defence personnel committing crimes may be court-martialled, but BDR jawans cannot be subjected to such legal measures." President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the BDR mutiny trial process. The Supreme Court has appointed 10 amici curiae, or senior lawyers, to advise the court during the reference hearing. The amici curiae are Kamal Hossain, Rafique-ul Haque, TH Khan, Amir-ul-Islam, Mahmudul Islam, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Ajmalul Hossain, ASM Mesbahuddin and AF Hassan Ariff. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. bdne
