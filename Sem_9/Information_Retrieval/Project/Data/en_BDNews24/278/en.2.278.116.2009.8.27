<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)The High Court quashed an arms case against jailed Awami League leader Joynal Abedin Hazari on Thursday in which he was given a life sentence. The bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and SM Emdadul Haq gave the order on an application from Hazari seeking cancellation of the lower court's verdict. In Aug 2003, a Feni court sentenced Hazari, and his personal assistant Farooq Hossain, to life imprisonment after police recovered a quantity of illegal arms and ammunition from the former AL MP's house in 2001. Following Thursday's High Court ruling , Hazari's counsel Shahjahan Shaju told reporters his client had now secured bail, been shown released or had charges dropped in all 23 cases that have been filed against him in the past. "There is now no bar to his release from prison," said Shaju. Hazari stood accused in a raft of cases during the AL's 1996-2001 tenure, but fled the country on Aug 16 when a caretaker government came in at the end of that administration. The then AL government had been widely condemned for turning a blind eye to Hazari's criminal activities during the period. The Feni native, after eight years away, returned to Bangladesh, reportedly from India, soon after the current AL government took power. Hazari surrendered to a Feni court on April 15 this year, and was immediately sent to Comilla jail, where he is still incarcerated. bdne
