 COLOMBO, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thilan Samaraweera scored an unbeaten 134 to help guide Sri Lanka to 372 for five at lunch on the second day of the second Test against New Zealand on Thursday. Samaraweera followed a brilliant 159 from the first Test at Galle with his 11th Test century, an equally impressive knock spanning 221 balls that included 17 boundaries and one six. Wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene was on five not out at the interval. Sri Lanka resumed on 262-3 and added a further 110 runs during the second morning to leave themselves in a very strong position, although New Zealand will be relieved to have at least removed two important top-order wickets. Mahela Jayawardene missed out on a 27th Test century when he was caught behind off seamer Iain O'Brien, ending a 180-run stand for the fourth wicket. Jayawardene scored his 92 from 234 balls and hit seven boundaries. Chamara Kapugedera, playing ahead of injured all rounder Angelo Mathews, stroked 35 before lofting a catch off spinner Jeetan Patel. O'Brien finished with 2-73 from 22 overs and skipper Daniel Vettori claimed 2-103 from 40 overs. Sri Lanka lead the two-match series 1-0 after securing a 202-run win in Galle last week.
