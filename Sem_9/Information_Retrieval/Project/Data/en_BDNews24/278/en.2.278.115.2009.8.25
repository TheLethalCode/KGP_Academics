 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended a stay on High Court bail and release orders granted to jailed former minister Shahjahan Siraj. An Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, gave the stay on hearing a government petition against the High Court orders. It also ordered the government to file a regular leave to appeal against the High Court orders within one week of the Supreme Court's return from vacation on Oct 4, until which time the stay would be effective. The Appellate Division on Sunday issued a one-day stay on a High Court order to authorities to release Siraj on bail "within an hour" and produce him before the court. A High Court bench issued the release order on a contempt petition filed by Siraj. Siraj's petition sought to have contempt of court charges pressed against the government for failing to release him despite his being awarded High Court bail on Aug 18 and Aug 19 in four separate cases against him. The government immediately sought to appeal against the High Court release order. Additional attorney general AKM Jahirul Haque had argued on the day that the Appellate Division had stayed previous bail orders in two of the four cases prior to Aug 18, but Siraj received bail anew from the High Court despite the earlier stays. Siraj, a former forests and environment minister of the BNP government, was sent to jail after he surrendered to court on June 30 in connection with all four cases. The chief justice's bench, on Tuesday, stayed the High Court's Aug 18 bail orders in two cases accusing Siraj of illegally grabbing forestland. The Appellate Division bench, however, upheld Siraj's Aug 19 bail in the two other cases, one for posession of illegal wealth and one for tax evasion. He has been convicted in the two latter cases. He was sentenced to eight years on Aug 29, 2007, for tax evasion, and to 13 years on April 23, 2008, in an illegal wealth case. His wife Rabeya Siraj, son Rajib Siraj and daughter-in-law Farzana Khan have also been convicted in tax evasion cases
