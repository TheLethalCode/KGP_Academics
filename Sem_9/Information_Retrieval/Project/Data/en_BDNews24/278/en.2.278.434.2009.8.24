<TITLE> SC allows Moudud to draw funds from F/C account </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division has allowed senior BNP leader Moudud Ahmed to draw funds from a foreign currency bank account that was frozen by the National Board of Revenue in 2007 on suspicion of tax evasion. A five-member bench, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, gave the orders on Monday after Moudud filed a petition seeking to reactivate his account. Moudud, a barrister and former law minister, represented himself in the hearing against attorney general Mahbubey Alam. The NBR directed scheduled banks to freeze all Moudud's accounts in 2007 on suspicion of concealment of real income and tax evasion. Five of Moudud's bank accounts were frozen in March that year following the NBR directive. The High Court, on petitions by Moudud, has permitted him to make deposits and withdraw up to Tk 5 lakh a month from his accounts. The court in May last year also issued a rule upon the government to explain why the act of freezing the accounts should not be declared illegal. More than 300 bank accounts of politicians and businessmen were frozen on allegations of graft during the two-year tenure of the immediate past caretaker government as part of the administration's anti-corruption drive. Some have subsequently been reactivated after graft allegations were found groundless. In January this year, the NBR said it would allow reactivation of further accounts after deducting tax evaded by the account holders and fines. bdnew
