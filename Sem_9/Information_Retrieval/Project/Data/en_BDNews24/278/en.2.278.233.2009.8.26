<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary probe into alleged endemic corruption within the halls of Nagar Bhaban has faltered due to a lack of cooperation from Dhaka City Corporation mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, the head of the probe committee said on Wednesday. "The mayor is not cooperating with us, perhaps with the intention of keeping his own misdeeds shrouded," Rahmat Ali, president of the parliamentary standing committee on local government, told reporters after a meeting of the committee. "The mayor allegedly adopted unfair means in appointing contractors, allocating shops, leasing bus terminals and activities related to the Jatrabarhi flyover project among other things at DCC," said Ali. The parliamentary standing committee, in its eighth meeting, constituted the probe committee, with Awami League MP Monwar Hossain Chowdhury as its convenor. It is tasked to investigate alleged widespread corruption at Dhaka City Corporation over the past eight years. Ali said the committee requested a room be allocated for its use at the DCC head office, Nagar Bhaban, but the mayor had informed the committee's president in writing that no such room could be made available for their use. Ali said: "The mayor claimed DCC had no place for any graft. He also said the parliamentary standing committee was only after his blood." "The gravity of the mayor's corruption would make you shudder," said Ali. The committee president said they would now conduct their investigations from the parliament building, and would summon necessary files from DCC. Ali said they would call the mayor before the parliamentary committee when necessary. The other members of the committee are Awami League MPs Ali Ashraf Khan Khasru and Mostafizur Rahman and BNP MP Abul Khair Bhuiyan. bdnew
