 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)-The Supreme Court began hearing the president's BDR mutiny trial reference on Wednesday for the second day. The hearing started at around 9:45am at the 11-strong full Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin. Amicus curiae Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed in his statement said the government can hold the trial under Army Act by issuing gazette. The government should issue two gazette notifications one to bring the trial process under the Army Act and the other to suspend the effectiveness of BDR Order on those who would be tried, Ahmed said. Cases like killing the army personnel and looting could be tried under Army Act, he added. Earlier, another amicus curiae barrister Rafique-ul-Haque presented his statement. On the first day, Haque said: "The president can seek legal opinion from the Appellate Division. No question can arise about the law here. The court should give its opinion since the president has referred it." He cited the references sent by presidents of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. "The courts are not bound to obey the opinions of the Appellate Division. But the recent practice is that the trial courts are bound to obey the opinion. The higher court also does not disobey the opinion," Haque told the court on Tuesday. Another amicus curiae TH Khan also presented his statement in Tuesday's hearing. He stated that BDR personnel cannot be tried under Army Act as the border force did not fall under the definition of a "disciplined force". "All forces are run by their respective laws including the trials of their offenders." "The Manual of Bangladesh Military Law says army personnel committing crimes may be tried under the MBML provisions. But BDR members cannot be tried that way, as they aren't a disciplined force." "Defence personnel committing crimes may be court-martialled, but BDR jawans cannot be subjected to such legal measures." President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the BDR mutiny trial process. The Supreme Court has appointed 10 amici curiae, or senior lawyers, to advise the court during the reference hearing. The amici curiae are Kamal Hossain, Rafique-ul Haque, TH Khan, Amir-ul-Islam, Mahmudul Islam, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Ajmalul Hossain, ASM Mesbahuddin and AF Hassan Ariff. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. bdne
