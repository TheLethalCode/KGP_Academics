 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has decided to summon prime minister's adviser HT Imam, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud to explain the government's decision last month to retire two judges without the consent of the Supreme Court. The three will have to appear before the parliamentary standing committee on law to clarify their role in sending Supreme Court Judicial Association president Md Abdul Gafur and its secretary-general Mohammed Shahjahan into retirement on July 30, a decision that was overturned just days later. Thursday's meeting of the committee disclosed that law minister Shafique Ahmed and his deputy Kamrul Islam did not know of the decision, either. Committee chairman Suranjit Sengupta told reporters that the government's decision on the retirement of judges, and their reinstatement just days later, "embarrassed" the prime minister's office. "According to the papers submitted to the committee, we have seen that the prime minister's adviser HT Imam had initiated the file on forceful retirement of the two judges. "Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud also played a role in the process. "We have unanimously decided to call the three before the committee to give their justification for the decision," Sengupta told reporters after the committee's meeting that was also attended by the law minister. The chairman said they would need to clarify whether they sought opinion of the Supreme Court, as per Article 116 of the Constitution, before making such an imortant decision. "The papers also show that neither the law minister nor state minister for law had signed the retirement order. "Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal will be summoned first to appear at our Sept 9 meeting to explain his action," said Sengupta. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina through an executive order on July 30 sent the two judges into retirement soon after they led a demonstration at the law ministry protesting certain procedures in the government's separation of the judiciary from the executive. Supporters of judges Gafur and Shahjahan opposed the decision to retire them and issued a deadline for their reinstatement. The government reinstated the two judges on Aug 2. The parliamentary committee on Thursday also formed a sub-committee, headed by Awami League MP Rahmat Ali, to recommend ways for improving the work of public prosecutors and government prosecutors.
