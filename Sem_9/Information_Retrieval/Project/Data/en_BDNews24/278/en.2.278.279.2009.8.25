 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The civil aviation minister said the government would be unable to reappoint over 700 former Biman employees who went into voluntary retirement during the caretaker government's tenure, despite the advice of a parliamentary committee. GM Quader, the minister, made the government's position clear at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on the civil aviation ministry at the Balaka building on Tuesday. He said in line with a contract with the World Bank, the government could not reemploy the former employees at the national flag carrier. Mosharraf Hossain, chairman of the standing committee, told bdnews24.com that the committee was, however, still in favour of their reappointment. "Most of the standing committee members talked in favour of the workers reappointment. They said the staffers were 'forcefully' sent into retirement by the interim government after 1/11 changeover," Hossain said. However, GM Quader told bdnews24.com after the meeting: "I made it clear to the meeting, quoting the finance minister, that we cannot re-induct the voluntarily-retired Biman staff as per a contract with the World Bank." "Some committee members supported their reappointment. But I said that it was not easy as legal matters were involved in the process," said Quader. "The financial claims of staffers were settled. They got additional money for decisions to take golden handshakes. "Why should they be reappointed?" the minister said. Quader said it was not fair to say that all the staffers went into retirement due to "military pressure". Following imposition of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007, over 1,800 employees of Biman chose to go into voluntary retirement as the interim government took measures to clean up the flag carrier. Out of the total, the caretaker government reemployed 1,100 workers. The remaining employees have pressed for their reinstatement since the general election at the start of the year. Chairman of the standing committee Mosharraf Hossain said they had suggested the ministry reappoint the remaining 700 plus Biman officials. Hossain said Biman could not function after the so called voluntary retirement of Biman officials and workers. "If necessary, the workers will return their money to the public exchequer," he said. Meanwhile, former officials and employees crowded round the standing committee chairman at the Balaka Bhaban to press home their demands
