 ROME, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Marcello Lippi has ruled out returning to club coaching when his stint as Italy boss is up. "I say this officially -- after my experience with the national team you will never see me coach a club again," Lippi told Swiss media expert and freelance journalist Klaus Davi. "In part it's because I couldn't be there answering the pundits' questions for half an hour after a match that has not gone well," he added in an interview broadcast on the internet (www.youtube.com/klauscondicio) Wednesday.

Lippi also voiced scepticism about government plans to make fans obtain a supporters identity card to be able to see their team play away from home. The scheme is part of efforts to combat hooliganism in Italian soccer. "On first impression, this instrument does not convince me," Lippi said. "I think of supporters who go for a meal Saturday night and want to see the match the next day in Milan or Turin but cannot because they don't have the card. "I don't like any form of labelling, least of all regarding fans." The government believes the initiative, which will come into force in January, will make it easier to police matches and track down troublemakers. Supporters from all over the country plan to stage a protest against the introduction of the cards in Rome on Se
