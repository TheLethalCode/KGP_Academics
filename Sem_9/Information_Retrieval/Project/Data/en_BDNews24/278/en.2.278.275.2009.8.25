<TITLE> Hunger is the key for US Open champion Serena </TITLE>

 OAKLAND, California, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams is prepared to go without another victory this year, as long as she mounts a successful title defence at next week's US Open. "I have to stay focussed and consistent and, most importantly, hungry," the American told Reuters in an interview ahead of the season's final major which starts on August 31. Williams, who took her haul of grand slam crowns to 11 by winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon earlier this year, said she would not be satisfied with two majors in 2009. "If I crashed out at the Open for no reason I'd have to win everything else the rest of the year," she said in an interview arranged by WTA Tour sponsors Sony Ericsson. "I'd win zero tournaments in order to win the Open again." Williams has had a mediocre year outside of the grand slams, reaching only one other final, at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami in April when she lost to Belarussian Victoria Azarenka. After beating her sister Venus to land a third Wimbledon title in July, world number two Serena had a chance to grab top spot from Russia's Dinara Safina ahead of the US Open. She failed to take her opportunity, though, losing in the quarter-finals of the Stanford Classic in California, in the third round of the Cincinnati Open and again in the semi-finals of last week's Toronto Cup. LONGER BREAK Williams acknowledged that maybe she should have taken a longer break after Wimbledon. "Everything has taken a toll on me," she said. Serena will face stiff competition in New York, especially from Venus. Twelve months ago Serena scraped through their all-Williams quarter-final 7-6 7-6 before picking up the trophy by beating Serb Jelena Jankovic in the final. The two sisters have won five of the last 10 US Opens, Serena capturing the title in 1999, 2002 and 2008 and Venus doing likewise in 2000 and 2001. Serena's next major crown would draw her level with fellow American Billie Jean King in sixth place on the list of all-time women's grand slam singles winners. "I probably should have won (last week's semi-final against Russian Elena Dementieva) but I didn't," she said. "I can't say I was especially feeling the fire but obviously I wanted to do well. I really hope to have another go at her at the US Ope
