<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court began hearing of the president's BDR mutiny reference on Tuesday, with attorney general Mahbubey Alam placing the reference in front of a full Appellate Division bench, of 11 members headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the BDR mutiny trial process. The Supreme Court has appointed 10 amici curiae, or senior lawyers, to assist in the reference hearing. The amici curiae are Kamal Hossain, Rafique-ul Haque, TH Khan, Amir-ul-Islam, Mahmudul Islam, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Ajmalul Hossain, ASM Mesbahuddin and AF Hassan Ariff. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under military or civil law. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 26-28 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. bd
