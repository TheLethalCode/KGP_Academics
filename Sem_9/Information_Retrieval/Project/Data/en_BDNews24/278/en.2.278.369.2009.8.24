 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)-The government is shifting the headquarters of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority to Naranyanganj from Dhaka. The decision came from the regular cabinet meeting presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday, said her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad. "In 1979, a cabinet meeting discussed shifting the headquarters of BIWTA to Barisal. Later, in 1984, the partial work started. But then the work stopped. Today's meeting has finalised the relocation to Narayanganj," Azad said in a news briefing at the information directorate. Another decision was taken to sell abandoned houses to martyred freedom fighter's families and wounded freedom fighters at the price of 1972. Azad said 154 abandoned houses have already been allocated. The meeting decided to use solar panels and CFL bulbs at all government, semi-government and autonomous organisations in the next three years. It also made directions to keep the air conditions in offices off for one hour everyday. Azad said the meeting also discussed referring to Japan's example to attend offices wearing soft dress during Mar-Nov to reduce the usage of air conditions. In addition, the cabinet approved climate change trustee fund policy. Previously, there was a steering committee in the trustee fund, now there will be a trustee and a technical committee. The cabinet gave the final approval to the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (Amendment) Law, 2009. There will be one chairman and four members on the board instead of one chairman and three members. Decision was taken to set up privately owned duty-free shops at airports, seaports and land ports. Zia International Airport has such shops. There were such shops in 1985 but under Parjatan, said Azad. bdne
