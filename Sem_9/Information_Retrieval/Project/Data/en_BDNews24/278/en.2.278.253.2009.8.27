<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 27 (bdnews24.com)Navana CNG Limited, a concern of Navana Group, will start trading on the country's bourses from Sunday by direct listing. The Dhaka Stock Exchange authority set the date on Wednesday, a DSE official said. "It was decided in a meeting yesterday that Navana CNG would start trading on Aug 30," DSE senior vice-president Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Navana CNG is set to float 18 million ordinary shares of Tk 10 each through direct listing, an option that avoids an initial public offering (IPO) with the price of scrips being fixed directly by investors in the secondary market. Navana CNG, which converts cars to run on compressed natural gas and operates re-fuelling stations, will be the eighth entity to hit the stock market through direct listing in Bangladesh. On Sunday, investors will bid for Navana CNG shares for 10 minutes in order to fix a price, selling will then start based on the highest bid. Trading on the shares will be suspended on Monday and resume on Tuesday, according to a post at the DSE website. Navana CNG's paid-up capital prior to the listing is Tk 366 million, while its authorised capital is Tk 500 million. The company, whose earning-per-share (EPS) to May 20, 2009 stands at Tk 4.04, has nine CNG conversion workshops across the country. Five are located in Dhaka, two in Chittagong and two each in Sylhet and Bogra.
