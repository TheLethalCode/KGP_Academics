The Dhaka-bound truck lost control at Hashara, ran over the two and fell into the nearby ditch at around 9am, Sreenagar police chief Sakhawat Hossain said. The dead were identified as 16-year old 'Imu', a school student, and 35-year old 'Ranjit', a passer-by. Another critically injured was taken to a local hospital.
