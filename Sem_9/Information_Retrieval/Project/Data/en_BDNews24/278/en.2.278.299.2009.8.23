<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)Operation Clean Streets, meant to tackle Dhaka's traffic problems, got off to a slow start in the capital on Sunday for lack of magistrates, with just two mobile courts of the proposed 10 working to remove illegal vehicles from the roads. Meanwhile, the committee, tasked with coordinating the activities of government departments and agencies having a connection to traffic issues, held its first meeting with law enforcers on the day, said the committee's head Shafique Alam Mehdi. Mehdi, additional-secretary of the communications ministry and head of the 12-member coordinating committee, told bdnews24.com he had initially requested the responsible ministry for 20 magistrates to operate mobile courts in ten locations in the capital. But only the two BRTA mobile courts were operating on the first day of the special drive. He said the eight additional courts would also hit the streets eventually. Between them, the two mobile courts realised Tk 16,700 in fines on Sunday, while the city's gridlock seemed to go up a gear, if anything, on the first day of Ramadan. "The courts only operated till noon due to a lack of magistrates," AKM Masudur Rahman, magistrate of one of the mobile courts, told bdnews24.com. "We made five arrests and seized 16 vehicles in that time. Seven of the vehicles were impounded," he said. The courts operated at just two points, at the Sat Rastha intersection in Tejgaon industrial area and Farmgate, in the city centre. "We are seizing vehicles whose drivers don't have licenses, as well as ones that have problems with their fitness certificates or other paperwork," said Rahman. Tapan Kumar Sarker, director of enforcement at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), said initially just the two mobile traffic courts will operate over Ramadan. "They are aiming to tackle the city's chronic traffic jams, and will work under the supervision of BRTA," Sarker told bdnews24.com. Metropolitan police commissioner AKM Shahidul Huq said the police will work in tandem with the mobile courts to reduce city gridlock. Coordinating 11 depts, 9 agencies Mehdi said his committee was tasked with coordinating the activities of 11 government departments and nine city agencies, including law enforcers, having a connection to traffic issues. The committee sat in its first meeting on Sunday, with Dhaka Metropolitan Police. Mehdi said a series of meetings with the different departments and agencies would identify the main traffic problems and their causes, and come up with inter-department and inter-agency strategies. He said any shortcomings in legislation would also be amended. Measures will be taken too against illegal shops obstructing the streets or pavements of the capital, he said. Earlier in the week, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain said no road violations would be spared by the mobile court drive, including those by public officials. The communications minister said many initiatives had been taken by earlier administrations to reduce the capital's traffic jams, but all had failed due to a lack of coordination and political will. bdnews24.com
