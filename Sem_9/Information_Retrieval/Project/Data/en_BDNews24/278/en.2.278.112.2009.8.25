 Chittagong, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)--Chittagong University on Tuesday expelled four students tied to Bangladesh Chaatra League on charges of assaulting the proctor, assistant proctor and a student advisor at midday. The authorities also asked 15 other pro-ruling Awami League students to defend themselves over the charges. They also will face expulsion in the event of failure to explain reasons behind the incident. The decision came from an emergency meeting of the university's disciplinary committee, chaired by vice-chancellor Abu Yusuf after the attack in the noon. Proctor Mohammad Jashimuddin told bdnews24.com that they had been declared unwanted and suspended for breaching an on-campus embargo on political activities and attack on teachers. The students punished are Jahidur Rahman Jewel, the BCL science and technology affairs deputy secretary and fourth-year undergraduate student of chemistry (declared permanently unwanted on the campus), Ahsan Siddique Rimon, master's student of marketing (suspended for one year and declared unwanted until further orders), Quazi Mohammad Alam, fourth-year anthropology student (suspended for one year and fined Tk 80,000) and Shantanu Biswas, third-year student of history (suspended for one year). However, the expulsion order said Jewel was not a student. He was earlier expelled on two occasions. The teachers were injured when they attempted to stop a procession by the BCL demanding trial of the perpetrators of the attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. The AL formally severed ties with the BCL in the national council in July and party chief Sheikh Hasina had threatened to quit as the ceremonial organising chief after a wave of violence by the organisation in educational institutions across the country. The university was closed for a week after 25 students were injured on May 15 as BCL and Jamaat-e-Islami- backed Islami Chhatra Shibir activists clashed to take control of the residential halls. Dhaka University's Poet Jasim Uddin Hall authorities suspended studies of eight students over a BCL factional clash on Monday night. Teachers assaulted The BCL activists swopped on the teachers and broke a video camera of the university administration. The VC told bdnews24.com at 1:30pm that the BCL activists attacked the people arriving from the administrative block to stop their agitations. Proctor Dr Mohammad Jasimuddin, assistant proctor Chandan Kumar Poddar and students welfare adviser Dr Mohammad Touhid Hossain received injuries, he added. The BCL activists damaged property worth Tk 80, 000. The VC said political activities remained suspended on the campus, but some indisciplined students were trying to upset the environment. The BCL university unit vice-president Anisuzzaman Emon told bdnews24.com, "We organised a silent procession to demonstrate condemning the Aug 21 grenade attack." "But it turned into a vocal demonstration when the university administration tried to stop us." "As we were marching in a silent procession at 12:30pm at the railway station compound, the university administration wrested our banner away. "Police put a cordon around us and started threatening us. As we tried to carry on with our programme, we found ourselves jostling against the proctor, assistant proctor, student adviser and the police." CU assistant proctor Chandan Kumar Poddar told bdnews24.com: "Using a national issue as their shield, the BCL has planned to breach the embargo slapped on political activities at CU." "We've only tried to stop them from breaching peace and therefore took their banner away." Jasimuddin, the proctor, told bdnews24.com that when they tried to foil the agitation programme, the activists swooped on them. bdnew
