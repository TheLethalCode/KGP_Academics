 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The National Board of Revenue may fail to meet the revenue targets in future unless the government appoints more tax inspectors, a parliamentary panel has said. The parliamentary standing committee on finance ministry on Thursday asked the ministry settle legal disputes on appointments to fill 1,100 vacant posts of inspectors. "Appointment of tax inspectors has been stalled during the last 20 years. "Unless the government initiates the recruitment, the NBR will fail to meet the revenue targets," AHM Mustafa Kamal, the standing committee chairman, told reporters after a meeting Tuesday at parliament building. He said inspectors were the backbone of the tax department. The appointment of new inspectors has been stalled since the NBR tried to sack a number of officials of the Mujibnagar government. The officials have filed over 70 cases at the court for redress. "Given the circumstances, we have recommended the ministry holding talks with the officials to start appointment," said Kamal. "We hope the problems can be settled through dialogue," he said. "In addition, we will ask law ministry to suggest the ways of settling the disputes". The chairman said the government should start the process of filling over 2,000 vacant posts including 1,100 inspectors in the NBR. He said the manpower strength of the NBR remained the same for decades though the activities of the board had increased manyfold.
