The flames spread out from fast food shop 'Taco Bell', when an overheated cooker caught fire, an official said.

Police blocked traffic on Panthapath Road for about an hour during the incident. Hundreds of onlookers crowded the road despite the late hour, forcing extra deployment of police and RAB. Fire Service chief Brigadier Abu Nayeem Mohammed Shahidullah told reporters at around 1am, "We came here on the news that a shop on the seventh floor had caught fire. The fire has now been doused. "We're looking into what caused the fire and how much damage has been done." 'To open as usual' Bashundhara Shopping Mall Owners' Association president M A Hannan said, "There is no reason to panic. The market will remain open on Tuesday as usual."
