<TITLE> Muralitharan joins Victoria for Twenty20 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  Muttiah Muralitharan has returned to the MCG several times since he was called for throwing by Darrell Hair during the Boxing Day Test 14 years ago. But this coming season Muralitharan will come a full circle by turning out as a hometown hero at the MCG after being signed by Victoria for the Twenty20 Big Bash. According to a report on Cricinfo, Victoria have confirmed Muralitharan as the second of their two international signings for the Twenty20 tournament after the West Indian allrounder Dwayne Bravo also joined the Bushrangers for 2009-10. Muralitharan will join his fellow Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis, who has signed with South Australia, in adding an element of mystery spin to the Australian domestic season. "What a thrill it will be to play in front of a 'home' crowd at the mighty MCG, representing Victoria in a strong competition," Muralitharan said. "It's an exciting prospect and a great honour, and I look forward to playing my part in the Bushrangers team and hopefully entertaining Victorian and Australian fans. Shane Warne and I share the honour of having a trophy that bears our names, and I'm delighted to be following in his footsteps as a Victorian spinner." Each state team is allowed to sign two international players for the domestic Twenty20 tournament and Victoria have become the first to fill both vacancies. By adding him to their squad, the Bushrangers may have created significant competition for a place in the side with Bryce McGain and Jon Holland already likely to compete for slow-bowling roles throughout the summer. The coach Greg Shipperd hoped Muralitharan would be able to help develop the left-arm finger-spinner Holland, 22, who has played for Australia A and is working on his own version of the doosra. Shipperd said he was not concerned about Muralitharan, 37, potentially taking the place of a younger player. "It could be an all-spin attack because really we've got (Brad) Hodge, (David) Hussey and (Cameron) White, Murali and also Holland and McGain," Shipperd said. "Across the (Twenty20) competition Australian batsmen have shown some weakness in the past to spin. "My business is about developing players, and this decision has not been taken lightly. And it has been taken with the view that there are 53 days of first-class cricket in the Australian calendar year and this represents only five of those. We think that the interaction of him and others over that five- to seven-game period still allows plenty of time for players to develop in all forms of the game." Victoria have also substantially strengthened their Asian links by announcing a new major sponsor for the next three years. An agreement with Dheeraj and East Coast (DEC), which is one of the leading property developers in the Middle East and has substantial interests in Dubai, means the team will now be known as the DEC Bushran
