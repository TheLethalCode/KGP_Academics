 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister has called for a huge river dredging project in the nation's vital waterways to maintain navigability and halt erosion, a ministry official said on Tuesday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina asked the relevant ministries to formulate a 'mega plan' to realise the initiative, a water resources official told reporters after the first meeting of a recently-formed water resources and river dredging committee. The meeting was told it would be possible to start dredging operations in the Gorai, Dhaleshwari, Pashur, Karnaphuli and Jamuna rivers by November. Costs for the project were initially estimated at Tk 1,700 crore, although the official said the budget was likely to come down to around Tk 1,300 crore, of which approximately Tk 800 crore would be spend on six dredgers. The project is likely to get the nod from the National Economic Council's executive committee in Nov, said the official, who asked not to be named. The meeting was attended by finance minister AMA Muhith, agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan and foreign minister Dipu Moni, among others.
