 PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia ,Aug 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's prime minister on Tuesday urged a woman whose caning conviction for drinking alcohol has triggered concerns over the use of Islamic laws in the moderate Muslim country to appeal. Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarnor, a 32-year-old mother of two, will become the first woman in the Southeast Asian country to be caned under rarely enforced Islamic criminal laws and, instead of appealing against the sentence, has asked that it be carried out in public. "Kartika should appeal instead of being too quick in asking for punishment," Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters in the country's administrative capital, adding that "the authorities are sensitive to the implication of the punishment". Kartika's case has drawn criticism from groups concerned about the rise of Shariah (Islamic) laws amid increasing Islamisation of the country's majority Malay-Muslims, who make up 55 percent of the 27 million population. She was sentenced to six strokes of the cane and a fine after she was caught by Islamic enforcement officials drinking beer at a hotel lounge two years ago. She received a temporary reprieve on Monday when a state government official said her punishment would be carried out after the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Malaysia has a dual-track legal system with Islamic criminal and family laws which are applicable to Muslims running alongside civil laws. Her case has divided opinions among Muslims in the country, with conservatives coming out in support of the punishment. "We do not want the Shariah courts to be seen as inconsistent or powerless," the opposition Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) Youth leader, Nasrudin Hassan, told Internet news website Malaysian Insider. PAS is part of a three-party grouping led by Anwar Ibrahim, himself a former Muslim student activist, and is battling for the critical Malay vote against Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the biggest party in the ruling National Front coalition. Neither PAS nor UMNO can afford to upset conservative rural Malays and the ratcheting up of language designed to appeal to those voters. PAS earlier this month called for the full implementation of an alcohol ban in the state of Selangor, Malaysia's richest which is next to the capital Kuala Lumpur, upsetting the mainly Chinese Democratic Action Party, one of its allies. A top Selangor official from PAS on Monday empowered mosque officials to detain Muslims who consume alcohol in public places. "We are doing this to save Muslims from committing a big sin that can cause problems in families and the Muslim society," Hasan Ali, who is in charge of Muslim Affairs in Selangor, was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times newspa
