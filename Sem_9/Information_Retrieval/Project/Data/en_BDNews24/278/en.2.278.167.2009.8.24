<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has ordered defence lawyers to explain by Aug 30 why bail for two defendants should not be cancelled in the explosives case of the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. Judge ANM Bashirullah of the First Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, Dhaka gave the order on Monday after the government petitioned two Dhaka courts against bail granted to Arif Hassan Sumon and Mofizur Rahman in two separate cases. The two secured bail on Aug 12 from speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain. Investigating officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand moved against the bail orders on Sunday, at two separate courts after the cases were transferred last week from the speedy trial tribunal. The explosives case is now being conducted at the First Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court and the murder case at the Second Metropolitan Special Court, counsel for the state Abul Kalam Azad told reporters on Sunday. On Aug 3, the speedy trial tribunal had ordered further investigation into the 2004 grenade attack on a petition by state prosecutors. The court also asked the inspector general of police to submit the investigation report within two months. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as the new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including BNP leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, his brother and alleged grenade supplier, Maolana Tajuddin, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Of them, 13 defendants including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars, while the remaining are on the run. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the two cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. b
