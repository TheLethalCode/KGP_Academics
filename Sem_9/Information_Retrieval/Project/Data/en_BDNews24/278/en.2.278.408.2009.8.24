<TITLE> 14 Bangladeshis 'tricked' into UK detention </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)Fourteen Bangladeshis are being held by Britain's Home Office as suspected illegal immigrants after they were unwittingly driven to a detention centre near Cambridge. The men, as they were boarding a bus in London, believed they were heading to work on a Lincolnshire farm 150 miles away. But they were taken instead to the detention centre, as part of a 'sting' operation by UK Border Agency officials apparently in league with an undercover reporter of British tabloid News of the World. Border Agency officials are now questioning the suspected illegals. The News of the World reported Sunday that a coach load of 44 Bangladeshi men were driven from East London to the immigration centre in Longstanton, near Cambridge. The operation was part of an investigation into alleged illegal workers based in Wapping, East London. A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said two alleged Bangladeshi gang masters, in particular, are being investigated. According to News of the World, Britain's biggest selling Sunday paper, the 44 illegal workers were supplied to an undercover reporter by the Bangladeshi "gang masters" Belal Rouf and Forid Miah. Fourteen of them were suspected illegal immigrants. Belal and Miah reportedly run curry restaurants in Thetford, Norfolk, and East London. Rouf, according to News of the World, bragged that he and Miah could deliver 1000 workers at short notice. The paper said the pair charged 500 for arranging the secret work force. It said the workers were willing to toil 12 hours a day for just 1.60 an hour in cash, well below Britain's minimum wage of 5.73 an hour. The Bangladeshis reportedly boarded the coach from Miah's River Spice restaurant in Wapping, East London, thinking they were heading to a farm in Spalding, Lincolnshire, for six months' work. The News of the World reporter said he first approached Bangladeshi Rouf, 30, at his family restaurant Nimmi in Thetford. Rouf reportedly told the undercover journalist: "I can get you people. Illegals, it's about 20 a day. They will work 12 hours a day. These guys are poor people. They're in London, they're in Luton walking round with nothing to do. You pay them cash in hand. Just give them 20 in hand and accommodation." "Anything will do. As long as they've got somewhere to sleep, somewhere to bathe, somewhere to go to the toilet," News of the World quoted Rouf as saying. Later, Rouf reportedly put the journalist in contact with his London associate Miah. British- born Miah was quoted by the paper as saying: "Whatever people you want I can supply them. You want 50 but if you want 1000, I can do it. But you do know that they don't have paperwork." Miah, 29, allegedly agreed a 500 commission for sorting out the illegal workforce.
