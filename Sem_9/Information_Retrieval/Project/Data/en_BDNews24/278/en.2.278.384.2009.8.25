 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Bashundhara City Shopping Complex authorities on Tuesday formed a probe body to look into the cause of the latest incidence of fire at the mall. The fire broke out at fast food shop 'Taco Bell' on the seventh floor of the posh complex around midnight Monday. The four-member committee has been asked to report within seven days Bashundhara City security manager Kamrul Mehedi said. Abdul Malek Mirza, chief of engineering at Bashundhara City Development Ltd, heads the committee. Mehedi said, "No damage resulted from the fire. Only some wiring has been burnt." "The food shop had only a small stock of goods. There will be no need for an insurance claim." Deputy director of Dhaka divisional fire service, Abdur Rashid, said they had formed no separate committee on the fire incident. Seven Basundhara employees died after Bangladesh's largest shopping mall turned into a towering inferno on Mar 13 this year. An enquiry committee on Mar 18 said negligence of the Basundhara City authorities had caused the devastating fire. bd
