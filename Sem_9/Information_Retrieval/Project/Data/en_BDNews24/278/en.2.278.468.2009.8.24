<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)State counsel Anisul Huq sought a date on Monday, from an Appellate Division bench headed by the chief justice, for hearing of long-pending appeals in the Bangabandhu murder trial. "I approached the regular bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin this morning for an appeal hearing date. The chief justice asked me to go to the Appellate Division chamber judge," Huq said at his Supreme Court chamber afterwards. Huq said he would apply to the chamber judge that afternoon. Huq said on Sunday the state would apply for an Oct 4 hearing date to begin the long-stalled appeals process as a step to finally concluding the Bangabandhu murder trial. He said as it was not possible to start the hearing before August 27, when the Supreme Court goes into a month-long vacation, the state was asking for an Oct 4 hearing, the day the Supreme Court returns from vacation. He said the next step in the process would depend on the Appellate Division. The hearing may start on that day if the chief justice, who is the authority to fix the date, allows, he said. Appeals of five former army officers, convicted and sentenced to death, have been pending for years. Independence architect Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were killed on Aug 15, 1975, with the still appeals pending 34 years after the killings. The Awami League government, coming to power in 1996, revoked a long-standing indemnity law to clear the way for a trial. Mujib's former personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case against 20 people that year. On Nov 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded the death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused. The High Court upheld the death sentences of 12 in 2001. Five of the 12 appealed against the sentences from behind bars, while six of those convicted remain overseas. The appeals remained pending over the years for lack of Appellate Division judges, until the Awami League government made four new appointments last month. The government is also working to bring back the six absconding convicts from abroad. b
