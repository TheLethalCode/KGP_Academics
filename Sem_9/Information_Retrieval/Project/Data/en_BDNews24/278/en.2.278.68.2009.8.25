<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi slammed the government on Tuesday for failing to check extortion and violence in the 'rags trade', a section of the garments industry renowned for its organised crime gangs. "Incidents of crime have reduced somewhat, but not nearly enough," Murshedi, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told reporters at the trade body's head office in Karwanbazar. "Goods headed for export in covered vans are also still being targeted," said Murshedi after the BGMEA presented two pick-up vans to Gazipur police. He said the police routinely failed to recover stolen goods, which had led to cancelled export orders and negatively impacted on country's reputation overseas. State minister for home affairs Shamsul Huq Tuku said he was aware of possible collision between those claiming links to the ruling party and other "power-groups." He asked members of the trade body to bring the matter up with the local administration and members of parliament. "A police force dedicated to industry might be established," said Tuku. Tuku asked why unrest among workers in the sector was necessary if they were paid their salaries and other allowances on time. "Talks should be arranged among the owners, workers and other interest groups to chalk out solutions to problems in the industry," he said. Also attending the event, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad said improved law and order was part and parcel of the country's development. There are 814 garments factories in the Gazipur Police Station area, and some 424 in Savar and Ashulia, employing around 1.2 million workers. The total number of workers in the sector is around three million, according to the BGMEA. bdnew
