 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Tuesday ordered the government, law-enforcing agencies, union parishads and municipalities to immediately act against those who slap extra-judicial penalty such as beating or caning in village courts and provide security and protection to the victims. The court also directed immediate investigation into any report of imposition of extra-judicial penalty by any person including a member or chairman of any union parishad or municipality. It ordered the local government ministry to inform all union parishads and municipality of the orders. The court issued asked the government and others concerned to explain why the failure to take effective measures to prevent the imposition and execution of extra-legal penalties should not be declared unlawful and a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution. The court also wanted to know why the government and others concerned should not be directed to frame and adopt such guidelines, directions or orders as appropriate and to disseminate them through Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddique passed the orders on a public interest writ petition filed jointly by the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, Ain o Salish Kendra, BRAC and Nijera Kori. Local government, home, women and children affairs and information ministries and the inspector general of police were made respondents in the writ petition. The writ petitioners sought urgent preventive measures and information to be issued to the public and relevant bodies regarding their duties to prevent incidents of extra-legal penalties. Barristers Sara Hossain and Rabia Bhuiyan assisted by advocate Masuda Rehana Rosy, Taufiqul Islam and Nusrat Jahan moved writ petition. Deputy attorney general Razik al Jalil appeared for the state. The counsels for the petitioners contended that the government failed to prevent the imposition of extra-judicial penalties and provide information to the public. Such penalties are unconstitutional and in violation of fundamental rights and right to be free from cruel and degrading or inhuman treatment or punishment. The counsels also said that a section of people across the country have been imposing punishments by beating and caning in the name of mediation or conciliation. They also placed some reports of women and men being subjected to extra-judicial punishments including whipping and caning in rural 'shalish', often in the presence of or with the active participation of members or chairmen of union parishads. The petition described incidents in June this year where a woman and man were lashed 101 times on orders of village elders in Nabiganj, Habiganj in a 'shalish' held in presence of a chairman and a woman in Srimongol being caned as many times for speaking to a man of a different faith. It also described incidents in June where a woman in Sirajganj was caned 100 times and fined for daring to file a complaint of rape with a court of justice and a woman being whipped in public in August after refusing a relative's sexual advances
