 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  Load-shedding is being increased during daylight hours to ensure uninterrupted power supply after sunset, the government has said, though some Dhaka residents still faced their first iftar of Ramadan in the dark on Sunday. The prime minister's energy and power adviser, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, sat in a meeting on Sunday with different utility providing agencies over the power situation in particular. After the meeting, he told reporters, "Load-shedding will increase to some extent during the day in Ramadan. But the government will ensure uninterrupted electricity through the night." "More electricity will be supplied to mosques than houses," he added. The government has taken various initiatives to ease the power crisis ahead of Ramadan, said Chowdhury. Bangladesh turned its clocks one hour ahead in July as a daylight and power saving measure. A power ministry meeting also decided to reduce gas and power supply to industries and factories during peak hours to ensure uninterrupted power supply during seheri and iftar . On the first day of Ramadan Sunday, residents in various parts of the city, including Shahbagh, Mirpur, Dhanmondi and Gulshan, reported outages just ahead of iftar , at which point power was restored at most places. But not all were happy. Nazmul Haq, of Kathalbagan, said, "All the efforts have gone in vain since heavy loadshedding occurs in the daytime." Meanwhile, Mahbub Manik of Khilgaon Goran, was one of the unlucky ones to face the first iftar in the dark. "Very frustrating  the power went off just five minutes before iftar time and stayed off for almost an hour." "There was no water either at the time as the building's water pump is electric," he said. bd
