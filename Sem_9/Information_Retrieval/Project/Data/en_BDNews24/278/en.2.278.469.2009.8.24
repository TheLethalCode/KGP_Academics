 Sylhet, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)--The British High Commission on Monday started processing passport applications in Sylhet on an experimental basis. The process started on Aug 10 but, high commissioner Stephen Evans formally inaugurated it on Monday afternoon. "This is an advanced step to improve services for British citizens living in Sylhet," Evans said at a news conference arranged at a city hotel before the inauguration.

Regional consular David Graham said the process will be evaluated after six months on the basis of needs. Previously, the application had to be submitted at Dhaka. bdn
