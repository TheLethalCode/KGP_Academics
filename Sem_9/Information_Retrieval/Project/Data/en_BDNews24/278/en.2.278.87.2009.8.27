 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)The market ended the week with a downturn on a selling spree by investors. Market observers said investors were piling up for subscribing to upcoming IPOs, especially the long-awaited Grameenphone issue. On Wednesday, GP published its prospectus where it announced that the IPO subscription would open on Oct 4 and end on Oct 8. Thursday's trading left more than 70 percent of the traded scrips down on the previous day's close. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark index shed almost 24 points, while turnover slumped to Tk 5.10 billion from the previous day's Tk 6.16 billion. "One of the reason behind sell-offs is to set aside funds for the inflow of IPOs," said economist Abu Ahmed, an adviser of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At least, six IPOs and a couple of mutual funds are expected to float within two months, he said. Meanwhile, brokers blamed recent volatility for Thursday's downturn. "Investors are quite nervous due to the fluctuating nature of the market," said an official of brokerage house Royal Securities. Trading fell into negative territory on the opening bell. It recovered losses in the midday session but fell sharply towards the end. Mutual funds lost after Wednesday's highs, although banks closed mixed with prices moving slightly. Non-banking financial institutions (NBFI) also witnessed a depressed trend after rising Wednesday on the news of regulatory moves to double its capital base. Insurers continued to fall with fuel and energy shares following. DSE's benchmark general index, or DGEN, shed 23.88 points, or 0.79 percent, to close at 2977.72.
