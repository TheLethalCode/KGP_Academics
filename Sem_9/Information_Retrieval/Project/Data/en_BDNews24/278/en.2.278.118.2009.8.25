 Tue Aug 25, 2009 6:08am BST MADRID, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy made his first appearance for the club on Monday since he was sidelined with a serious knee injury in November and underwent surgery. The Dutchman was given a loud cheer by the Bernabeu faithful when he came on with around 15 minutes left of their 4-0 win over Norwegian side Rosenborg in a pre-season friendly. The 33-year-old had surgery in the United States to repair damaged cartilage in his right knee and Spanish media have speculated he may be sold following Real's purchase of French striker Karim Benzema.
