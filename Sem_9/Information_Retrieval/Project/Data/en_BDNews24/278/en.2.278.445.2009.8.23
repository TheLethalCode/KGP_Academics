 WELLINGTON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Brendon Diamanti has been added to the New Zealand squad for this year's Champions Trophy in South Africa. New Zealand had kept one spot open when they announced their squad last month and coach Andy Moles said Diamanti was the best choice to fill the vacancy. "Brendon is a strong lower order striker and has good control as a medium pace bowler -- he will provide valuable back-up for the squad," Moles said. Diamanti, currently playing in India with the New Zealand A side, was also selected in the New Zealand one-day and Twenty20 squads to play in Sri Lanka. The only player selected for the Champions Trophy who was not also picked for Sri Lanka was paceman Daryl Tuffey, who was replaced by offspinner Nathan McCullum. Tuffey was picked for the test series in Sri Lanka but Moles said he was being rested from the one-dayers to save himself for the Champions Trophy. "With turning wickets here in Sri Lanka, we're keen to have three spinners on call," Moles said. "But conditions will be different in South Africa -- two spinners will be sufficient there, and Daryl's inclusion will give our seam attack additional depth." ICC Champions Trophy squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Shane Bond, Neil Broom, Ian Butler Brendon Diamanti, Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Gareth Hopkins, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Daryl Tuffey.
