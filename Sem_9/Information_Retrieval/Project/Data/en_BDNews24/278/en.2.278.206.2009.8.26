 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  One more child died in Dhaka Shishu Hospital on Wednesday morning after taking paracetamol syrup of Rid Pharmaceuticals. Imran Hossain Bhuiyan, brother of the victim, 3-year old Iva of Asadnagar village at Brahmanpara of Comilla, told bdnews24.com that the local physicians had prescribed his sister paracetamol after she had fever. She was taken to Comilla town as her condition deteriorated after taking the syrup. She was brought to Dhaka on Monday night, Bhuiyan added. Dhaka Shishu Hospital director A R Khan told bdnews24.com that after the intake of the syrup Iva stopped urinating. Her condition did not improve after she had been admitted to the hospital, Khan said. The government had directed Rid Pharma to stop manufacturing and marketing of its products after a number of newspapers on July 21 reported that many children died of kidney failure after the intake of paracetamol syrup and vitamin B complex manufactured by the company. The drugs were tested in the Drug Testing Laboratory in Mohakahli later and it was proved that they were adulterated. The Drug Administration Directorate General sued five officials of Rid Pharma including its director general earlier this month. Rid Pharma initially denied producing the paracetamol syrup linked to children's deaths in media reports. Officials of the drug company were quoted in the press as saying Rid Pharma "does not produce paracetamol syrup, only suspension". The health minister said on July 29 that although the product was described as a suspension on the package, it had in fact contained syrup. According to the health ministry, only five domestic companiesout of more than 250 big and small drug makers in the countryhave clearance to manufacture paracetamol syrup. DA officials say the market is flooded with substandard drugs, while lawyers of the drug court say authorities, including the DA, is failing to take proper legal action against the culprits. bd
