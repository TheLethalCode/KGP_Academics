 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court will judge on Tuesday a government petition against the High Court orders on the release of jailed former minister Shahjahan Siraj on bail. The regular bench of Appellate Division headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin on Monday heard the petition and set the date for judgement. It will also issue a ruling on the government petition seeking a stay order on the bail. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam represented the state while barrister Rafique-ul-Haque argued for the BNP leader. The Supreme Court on Sunday froze for one day the HC orders asking authorities the same day to release Siraj on bail "within an hour". The High Court bench of justices A F M Abdur Rahman and S M Imdadul Haque had issued its order at 1pm to release the former minister and produce him in the court by 2pm on a contempt petition filed by Siraj. Siraj's petition sought to have contempt of court charges pressed against the government for failing to release him despite his being awarded High Court bail in two graft cases. The government immediately sought to appeal against the High Court order. Appellate Division chamber judge, Md Mozammel Hossain, at 2.30pm, stayed the High Court order for a day on the government's petition seeking leave to appeal. It also stayed the bail orders granted to the BNP leader, convicted in the two graft cases, for a day. The High Court said there was no problem in his being granted bail afresh. Siraj, a former forests and environment minister of the BNP government, was sent to jail after he surrendered to court in connection with the two graft cases on June 30. Siraj was sentenced to eight years on Aug 29, 2007, for tax evasion, and to 13 years on April 23, 2008, in an illegal wealth case. His wife Rabeya Siraj, son Rajib Siraj and daughter-in-law Farzana Khan have also been convicted in tax evasion cases. b
