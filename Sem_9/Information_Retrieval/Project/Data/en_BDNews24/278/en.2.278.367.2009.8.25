The Naro-1 is 33 metres (108 ft) long and the two-stage rocket was built at a cost of 502.5 billion won ($400 million).

Seoul is betting that a successful launch will give it the technical prowess to catch up quickly with its rivals. South Korea's space agency has tried to play down expectations, saying that only about 30 percent of countries' first attempts to put a satellite into orbit succ
