<TITLE> Rental power plants to tackle crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)The power division is to float tenders for eight rental power plants with a total capacity of 530 megawatts by Sept 10, as part of its short-term plan to mitigate chronic power shortfalls in the country, the PDB chief said on Wednesday. The final day for tender submissions has been set for Oct 22 this year, with the winning bids to be selected by Nov 19. The final deals are slated to be inked by Nov 30. "All land acquisitions will be completed by then. And winning bidders will have to build their plants within a year of the agreements," Power Development Board chairman Alamgir Kabir said after a meeting with businessmen at Biddut Bhaban. Power would be supplied to the government for three years under the agreements, said Kabir. However, businessmen at the meeting said it would be difficult to build the plants in the one-year timeframe suggested by the government. They also recommended extending the period the government would purchase power from the plants under the deal from three years to five-or-six years. Tawfiq-e-Elahi, the prime minister's adviser on energy and power, said the government wants to solve the power crisis as soon as possible. "That's why we have drawn up a roadmap. If required we will extend the date for finalising the deals by a week," said Tawfiq-e-Elahi, who added that he would welcome suggestions from the business community over the next few days regarding the tenders. Annisul Huq, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), said the government should extend the period stipulated in the deal for it to purchase power from the plants from three to five years. The Awami Leagues president's adviser on the private sector, Salman F Rahman, said any furnace-oil driven power plants would still be operating after three years, and the government would also need power after three years. "There should therefore be no problem if the deal extends beyond three years," he said. Also attending the meeting, managing director of Summit Power Tawhidul Alam said electricity costs would be higher if the agreement was fixed for only for three years. "The cost of electricity would come down in a long-term agreement. Moreover, building furnace-oil or coal driven power plants will take longer than for gas powered plants," said Alam. Shamim Ahmed, the managing director of Khulna Power, pointed out there is no power generation policy specifically relating to rental plants. "So we should follow the existing power policy until a new policy is made," said Ahmed. A 100 MW plant will be established at Vheramara in Kushtia, another 100 MW plant will be set up at Nawapara in Jessore, and third 100 MW plant at Madangonj. The government will also establish a 50 MW plant at Thakurgaon, a 50 MW plant at Syedpur in Nilphamary, a 30 MW plant at Sharishabari in Jamalpur, a 50 MW plant in Barisal and a 50 MW plant at Katakhali in Rajshahi.
