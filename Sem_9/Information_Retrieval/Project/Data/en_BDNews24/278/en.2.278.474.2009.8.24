 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)Thousands of families were flood-hit in different districts of the country, local authorities said on Sunday, with some 65,000 people reportedly marooned by rivers breaching their banks in Kurigram and Gaibandha districts alone. The northern district of Kurigram has seen some abatement in the overall flood situation, as waters receded, Water Development Board officials told bdnews24.com on Sunday. But around 40,000 people remain stranded in some 35 unions of seven upazilas in the district, and the receding waters have led to heightened erosion of river banks over the last 24 hours, local authorities said. The local agricultural department said they feared widespread crop losses too. Around 1000 families were affected by flooding in Faridpur, as the Padma River reached 21cm above the danger mark at Goalundo point on Sunday, leaving low-lying areas inundated, officials said. At least 500 families in Aliabad union of Faridpur Sadar upazila were marooned as the floodwater submerged low-lying areas, union parishad member Md Akteruzzaman said. Charmadhabdia union chairman, Golam Mostofa, said hundreds of families were also stranded in his area. Meanwhile, a fifty metre stretch of the Padma embankment near Charhajiganj bazar in Charbadrashon upazila had collapsed , while other parts remain highly vulnerable, Faridpur WDB executive engineer Md Rafiqullah told bdnews24.com on Sunday. In Sirajganj district, local officials say the flood situation has not deteriorated significantly in the last 24 hours, although hundreds of families remained cut off in Shahjadpur, Kazipur and Chowhali upazilas. Sirajganj WDB said the Jamuna River was now flowing 14cm below the danger mark. But most houses in the flood-hit areas are still under two-to-three feet of water, while around ten schools and colleges have been partially damaged, officials said. In Gaibandha district, an eight-year-old boy drowned in floodwater at Sundarganj upazila on Saturday, as five upazilas in total were inundated in the area when the Karotoa River breached its banks. At least 25,000 people were stranded in their homes in Gobindaganj upazila alone as floods there worsened over the previous 24 hours. Road links in Dinajpur, Thakurgaon and Panchgarh districts have been severed as stretches of road were submerged by rising waters, WDB executive engineer Mir Mosharraf Hossain said. Meanwhile in Naogaon, rivers swollen by torrential rain in upstream India inundated vast areas in Shapahar upazila. Mosharraf Hossain, assistant engineer of the local WDB, said around six hundred acres of Aman and Aush crops had been submerged. In Pabna district, general secretary of the local Red Crescent, Abdul Hamid, said the NGO was distributing relief in flood-affected areas. bdnews24.com/corr/
