 Dhaka, August 23 (bdnews24.com) - Former BNP lawmaker Nadim Mostafa was freed on bail Sunday after three months in Rajshahi Jail. Nadim, joint convenor of Rajshahi BNP and a close associate of Tarique Rahman, went under cover in 2007 after the events of 1/11. Some 14 cases were filed against him during the caretaker government years 2007-08, for supporting militants, taking over polling centres during elections, extortion and swindling during the previous BNP years 2001-06. He was convicted to a total of 12 years in two cases, and was sent to jail on May 12 this year following his surrender to a Rajshahi court. Senior jail super, Tipu Sultan, told bdnews24.com on Sunday, "He was freed as he has received bail in all the cases pending against him." Nadim, on his release, claimed all the cases as fake and motivated. bdnews24
