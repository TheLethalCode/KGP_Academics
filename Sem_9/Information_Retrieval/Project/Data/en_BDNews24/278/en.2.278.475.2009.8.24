 HAVANA, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former leader Fidel Castro appeared on Sunday on Cuban television for the first time since June of last year in a video of him chatting with students from Venezuela. Castro, 83, appeared to be in good condition as he spoke with the students about the state of the world in a meeting that took place on Saturday in Havana, according to the television report. The video followed a front-page photograph of Castro meeting with Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa published on Sunday in the state-run newspaper Juventud Rebelde. Castro has not been in public since undergoing intestinal surgery in July 2006. He resigned the presidency last year and was replaced by brother Raul Castro.
