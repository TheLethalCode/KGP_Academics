 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Police recovered an unidentified dead body from Tejgaon industrial area while a suspected gangster was shot by police in Modhyo Monipur in the capital early on Thursday. The wound in the 35-40 year old man's head indicated that he might have been shot, Tejgaon police chief Omar Faruque said. The body was found at around 2am on the road in front of Dhaka Polytechnic Institute Sonali Bank branch office. The bare-bodied corpse gave an impression that the man might have been killed a day or two back and the body abandoned on the street subsequently, he said. Earlier, a few days back, Tejgaon and Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police had retrieved one dead body each in two separate events which seemed to have been caused by road crashes. Autopsies subsequently revealed the two had been shot dead and then their bodies were abandoned on the road. In another incident, 'Arif', 28, was shot by police in an a;lleged encounter . Mirpur police chief Zakir Hossain said that they had been informed that seven or eight alleged criminals had assembled in a Modhyo Monipur field early on Thursday. When the police raided the spot, the miscreants ran away firing gunshots at random. As the police retaliated, 'Arif was critically wounded. Arif, with four bullets in his body, was admitted to the National Orthopaedic (Pongu) Hospital. Police recovered a pistol, two live bullets and two empty bullet cases from the spot. Days back, a gang of alleged miscreants had stormed into a building under construction in Mirpur and in a bid to extort cash from the builders shot at the security guard posted at the site and eventually hacked him to death. Arif is one of the people wanted in the case filed after the incident, police said. bdnew
