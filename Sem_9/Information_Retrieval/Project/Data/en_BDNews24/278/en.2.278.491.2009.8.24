 KOUROU, French Guiana, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Adriane-5 rocket put into orbit satellites for Japan and Australia after being launched from French Guiana on Friday, space officials said. The rocket blasted off from the European Space Agency's (ESA) launch center in Kourou, French Guiana on the northeast coast of South America. One of the satellites, a JCSAT-12, will provide telecommunications services covering Japan, the Asia-Pacific region and Hawaii for Japan's Sky Perfect JSAT Corp.

"D3 reflects our continuing commitment and investment to delivering those services by satellite," he said
