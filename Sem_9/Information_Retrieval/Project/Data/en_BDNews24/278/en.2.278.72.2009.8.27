 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the anticipatory bail order of the High Court in the war crimes case filed against Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee. The 11-strong full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin gave the deferment order that will be effective until one week after the court reopens at the end of the autumn vacation. The court has asked the government to file a regular leave to appeal at that time. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Mozammel Hossain stayed Sayedee's bail order on Wednesday. The High Court granted the former Jamaat MP six months' anticipatory bail on Monday on an appeal filed with the court on Aug 19. Malik Pashari, son of the late freedom fighter Shoijuddin Pashari of Chitholia under Sadar upazila of Pirojpur district, filed the case against five persons including Sayeedee on charges of murder, arson and looting during the independence war. bdne
