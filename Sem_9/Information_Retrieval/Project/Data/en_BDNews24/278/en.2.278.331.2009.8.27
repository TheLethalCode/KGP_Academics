<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone's chief financial officer Arif-al Islam resigned this week, but speculation that several senior executives of the largest mobile-phone operator have been sacked are baseless, GP officials said Thursday. Media-savvy Rubaba Dowla, chief communications officer, has been at the centre of the rumour swirling since Wednesday. But, Dowla told bdnews24.com on Thursday, "I haven't resigned." Talat Kamal, deputy general manager of public relations, waved away the 'sacking' rumour. He told bdnews24.com, "We've also heard the rumour but it's not true. "She (Dowla) is doing office, I talked to her in the morning. Our chief financial officer Arif-al-Islam has resigned from the job on Aug 24 citing personal reasons." Head of corporate affairs Raihan Ahmed Shamsi is functioning as the acting CFO, Kamal added. Islam, who was in-charge of GP's listing process with the capital market, quit just four days after the corporate giant got the final go-ahead from the market regulator to float shares. Its record IPO received the final regulatory nod on Aug 20 to raise almost Tk 500 crore from the market. On Wednesday, GP announced the IPO's subscription dates through publishing prospectus in local newspapers. bdn
