 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign minister Dipu Moni Wednesday condoled the death of US Senator Edward M Kennedy. "We are deeply saddened at the death of Senator Edward M Kennedy. His ability to work across the political divide had earned respect from all across the globe," Dipu Moni said in a press statement issued Wednesday night. The minister said, "His absence will be felt not only in the United States, but far beyond". In Bangladesh, Dipu Moni said, Kennedy would be rated as a "legend and a true champion of freedom, liberty and human values". "Senator Kennedy will be particularly remembered in Bangladesh for his unqualified support to our struggle for freedom and his empathy for the distressed millions in the refugee camps in 1971. "He has remained a friend ever since," the minister said. "We convey our deepest condolences to his family and the people of the United States," Dipu Moni said.
