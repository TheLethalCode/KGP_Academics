 Narayanganj, Aug 25(bdnews24.com)Violent clashes erupted between textile workers and law enforcers at the Fatulla Industrial Zone in Narayanganj Tuesday morning, leaving at least 70 injured when long promised back-pay failed to materialise. "To bring the situation under control the police had to baton charge the crowd and detonate six rounds of teargas," said Jiban Kanti Sarkar, acting officer-in-charge of Fatulla Model Police Station. Abdul Hamid, an employee of Auto Textiles Limited told bdnews24.com around 700 workers in the Lalpur area of the industrial area had been trying to recover their back-pay and other allowances for the last two months. Hamid alleged Auto Textiles managing director Abu Sayeed had recently travelled to America without clearing their wages, while the Dhaka Bank, who has the mortgage to the factory, had failed to produce a promised Tk 56 lakh to the workers. However, Narayanganj police superintendent Biswas Afzal Hossain said the Dhaka Bank had claimed they required prior approval of their board to make any such payout. "That was why it was not possible for them to pay off the money," Hossain said. Jiban Kanti Sarkar said the workers vandalised sections of the factory, and at one stage around 500 of them organised themselves into a group and attempted to make their way to the deputy commissioner's office. According to eyewitnesses, the violence flared when the police attempted to disperse the group, and at around 1.30pm some of the workers tried to stop a train bound for Narayanganj on the Battala line. Many workers lay on the rail line as the police beat them mercilessly in an attempt to disperse them, the clash then quickly spread to the Lamapara, Ramar Bagh and Kotaler Bagh areas of the industrial zone, eyewitness said. At least 15 policemen were injured in the clashes. bdnew
