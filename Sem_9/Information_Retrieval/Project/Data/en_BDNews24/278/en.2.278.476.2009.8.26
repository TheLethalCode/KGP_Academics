 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  Former telecommunications minister Aminul Haque has secured a six-month interim bail from the High Court in six cases. The court on Wednesday also asked the government why Islam should not be granted permanent bail in the cases. The benches of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir Hossain and Mohammad Roisuddin made the orders on a bail petition filed by the ex-BNP minister. The cases include Barapukuria coal mine graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission in Feb, 2007 and a corruption case regarding the construction of two bridges in Rajshahi, also filed by the ACC in Oct the same year. The four other cases were filed on charges of abetting in terrorist activities of Siddiqul Islam, alias Bangla Bhai, the executed leader of banned Islamist outfit Jamatul Mujahedin Bangladesh. Of them, three cases were filed in Dec, 2006 and the remaining one in April, 2007. The same bench stayed the proceedings of a wealth-related case for six months against former BNP MP Fazlul Haque Milon. bdne
