 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of angry activists of various hard-line Islamic groups fought fierce battles with the police in the Baitul Mukarram Mosque area on Friday, leaving about 150 people injured, police and witnesses said. Full Story Among the injured were four photographers who were on the scene to cover the clashes that raged for a second straight day over the proposed national women development policy. Most of the wounded men were the protesters while 52 police officials were also hurt. The protesters alleged that the policy went against the principles of Islam. The latest violence came amid the government's repeated insistence that it was not doing anything that goes against the Quran. Women rights activists say a certain quarter is trying to capitalise on the issue to get popular mandate by creating confusion. They say there is nothing in the policy that challenges Islam. The government last month announced the policy, meant to give women equal rights to property. The policy is not a legal binding but will guide future legislation tied to women's development. The street battle with law enforcers started after Friday prayers as the protesters under the banner of the Anti-Quran Law Resistance Committee streamed out into the open through the northern gate of the national mosque to take out a procession. A group tied to Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh also took part in the violent protests. Around 300 police officials were deployed around the mosque as the protesters took to the streets, Mokarram Hossain, an official of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police. The protesters chanted anti-government slogans and rained down stones and brickbats on police who retaliated with batons and teargas. They used loudspeakers to gather the protesters who chanted anti-government slogans. They brought sticks and bamboo poles and mats from inside the Baitul Mukarram Mosque and set them on fire. Traffic on the bustling road from Dainik Bangla intersection to Purana Paltan intersection was off for four hours from 1.30pm. Police did not immediately say how many people were arrested during the clashes but witnesses said they saw several people being taken away by officials. Among the injured are New Age chief photographer Abu Taher Khokan, Prothom Alo photographers Hasan Raja and Monirul Alam and Focus Bangla's Mehedi Ahmed. Asked why it took the police so long to control the situation, Mokarram said that the protesters had taken position inside the mosque compound. "We were a bit tolerant but the protesters did not calm down," he said. "We can't enter the mosque to take control of the situation." At a press conference, Islami Oikya Jote chairman Fazlul Haque Amini said the police had attacked them without provocation. He claimed that more than 100 workers of the Islamist outfit had been injured in the clashes. "We called a rally to drum up support for the anti-Quran rule, but the government is not fulfilling our demand," he added. Amini threatened that the "fire ignited Friday would spread to every corner of the country". Asked about mosaic stones taken off the mosque's walls, Amini said he was not aware of it. Talking to bdnews24.com, Maulana Abdur Rab Yusufi, nayebe ameer of the Committee for Resisting anti-Quran Law and Khelafat Majlish, held police responsible for the violence. "Before we gathered for the peaceful programme police chased us from the House Building side. The devotees became agitated and clashed with police ensued." He claimed that police first launched the attack. bdnews24.com/jr/r
