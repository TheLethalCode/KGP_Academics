 Bagdad Wed Apr 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least a dozen people were killed in Baghdad's Shia slum of Sadr City despite a partial curfew to stop Wednesday's fifth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad being marked in blood. Police said six people died in clashes overnight, and an explosion in the morning whose cause was unclear hit a funeral inside Sadr City, killing six more and wounding 14 people. Qasim al-Mudalla said four bodies and 23 wounded had been brought to the Imam Ali hospital he manages in Sadr City, where U.S. and Iraqi forces have battled militia loyal to cleric Moqtada al-Sadr since Sunday. "What are they doing? The floor of the hospital is covered with the blood of children. What is the world doing? They have seen the blood of our children and are doing nothing," he told Reuters. At least 15 people were killed and 200 wounded on Tuesday, according to hospitals in the slum, home to 2 million people. This area of eastern Baghdad has been the focus this week of clashes between Sadr's Mehdi Army militia and US and Iraqi government troops after the government launched a crackdown on the Mehdi Army last month in the southern city of Basra. The Iraqi parliament's Human Rights Committee warned in a statement of a "tragic situation" in Sadr City, where food and medicine are running short after a two-week blockade. Sadr had called a mass demonstration against the United States for Wednesday's anniversary, but he postponed it saying he feared for his followers' safety. Other parts of Baghdad were quiet, with shops closed and streets clear of traffic, after a partial curfew and one-day ban was imposed on vehicles in the capital for the anniversary. Curfews -- under which people were not prevented from leaving their homes on foot -- were also imposed in Samarra and Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. "It took me five years to realize that all the promises of starting a new democratic life after the fall of Saddam was actually an April Fool's joke," said Amina Abdul-Majeed, a hospital worker walking home from a nightshift because of the ban. She passed by a vacant a square in central Baghdad where U.S. forces toppled a statue of Saddam on April 9, 2003, signaling their capture of the city after a short war. CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS The top two U.S. officials in Iraq were due to appear later on Wednesday at a second day of hearings in Congress in Washington, which have given the U.S. presidential candidates a chance to express their views on the conflict. Military commander General David Petraeus and ambassador Ryan Crocker told members of Congress that Iraq had made progress over the past year, but the improvements were fragile. Petraeus advised against committing to a timetable to withdraw troops after extra forces sent last year return home in July. His testimony suggests more than 100,000 U.S. troops will still be in Iraq when the next U.S. president succeeds George W. Bush in January. Republican Senator John McCain opposes a timetable for withdrawal. The two Democratic candidates, senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both want one to be set. Tens of thousands of Iraqis and more than 4,000 U.S. troops have died in the five-year war. Two million Iraqis have fled the country and about as many are displaced within Iraq. "For the past five years we have seen nothing but blood, bombs, curfews, in-fighting. The government is totally incapable of providing security," said retired army officer Salim Hussein. But for 10-year-old Ammar Karim, taking advantage of the vehicle ban to play soccer with other boys in the middle of central Baghdad's normally traffic-clogged Karrada Street, the anniversary had a different meaning: a chance to go play. "I like this government because we have a lot of curfews. It is the only time we can go out and play football. I wish we could have curfews all the time, because otherwise my family keeps me locked in the hous
