<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Saturday that "leaders were elected or nominated as per party constitution not through any government letter or court verdict". Delwar's remark came as he was speaking to members of the Barisal District Bar Association in the wake of the recent High Court verdict that dismissed BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's writ petition challenging the Election Commission's electoral dialogue invitation to Hafizuddin Ahmed of the party's 'reformist' faction. The Khaleda Zia-appointed secretary general urged the party's leaders and workers not to be misled by "propaganda from certain quarters". Hafizuddin Ahmed, meanwhile, requested pro-Delwar leaders Saturday to sit across the table to bring back unity in the party. Hafizuddin made the request when members of the BNP front organisation Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal, led by assistant organising secretary Ali Akkas Nadim, met him at his Banani home. "Following the High Court's verdict we will receive the EC's letter. However, we want to sit with the Election Commission for dialogue along with the party's senior leaders including Khandaker Delwar Hossain," he said. Hafizuddin, nominated by the party's standing committee as acting secretary general, repeated his call for unity in the party. "Khaleda Zia is the leader of us all in the BNP. So the party has to be united putting aside difference of opinion," he told the Jubo Dal leaders at his home. "A united BNP led by Khaleda Zia will contest the next election with its sheaf of paddy symbol," Hafizuddin said, adding that he was contacting senior party leaders including party acting chairman Saidur Rahman and Khandaker Delwar Hossain. He urged Jubo Dal to be united in strengthening their organisation. bdne
