 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has agreed to sit in the pre-dialogue talks with the government for a second time at the state guesthouse Padma Sunday. The decision came in line with the government invitation issued by a mobile-to-mobile text message, AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said at a press conference at acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. Ashraful Islam said a seven-member team led by Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury would go to the meeting. "Our acting president does not have internet or fax at his home. That is why the commerce adviser invited him through SMS," he said. Earlier in the day, commerce and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had told bdnews24.com that he had texted the acting AL president, inviting the party top-brasses for further informal talks ahead of the official dialogue. The SMS read: "Salam, meeting with your party representative set for tomorrow 13 April 5:30pm at (state guesthouse) Padma. Hossain Zillur Rahman." The AL last week said they would like to have a formal letter before considering another shot at talks. Asked about the text message, the adviser said: "I have invited them through SMS after discussing with them (AL)." The party representatives are presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. In the first-round of informal discussions on Monday, five advisers met with AL leaders Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, organising secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Hasan Mahmud, an aide to detained party chief Sheikh Hasina. The representation at the meeting caused some division within the party, however. The government on Wednesday again contacted the party for talks and the party's presidium at a meeting the same day decided that it would hold no informal meeting unless the caretaker administration made a formal invitation. Earlier on Saturday, the presidium met at the house of Zillur Rahman in Gulshan. bdnews24.com/su
