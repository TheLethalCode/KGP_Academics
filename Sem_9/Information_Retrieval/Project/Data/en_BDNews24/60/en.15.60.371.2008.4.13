<TEXT>
 Harare, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty-three constituencies in Zimbabwe's election will be recounted, an electoral official said on Sunday, raising new fears of violence over disputed results. The recounts could enable President Robert Mugabe to overturn an opposition victory in the March 29 election when his ZANU-PF party lost control of parliament for the first time in his 28-year rule. The announcement was made as regional leaders held a marathon emergency summit in Zambia to discuss a two-week delay in releasing the presidential result from the election in the southern African nation, where the economy has collapsed. Results of that vote have not been released yet despite a chorus of international condemnation and opposition allegations that Mugabe is deliberately delaying the outcome to organise a campaign of violent intimidation against political rivals. The leaders of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) were still meeting at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT), 10 hours after the scheduled end of the emergency summit. A senior Zambian official, who asked not to be named, said the final communique was being delayed by a disagreement over whether to call the Zimbabwean situation a crisis. The opposition and Western powers accuse Mugabe of wrecking the economy of his once-properous nation where many people have been reduced to misery by hyper-inflation of more than 100,000 percent, shortages of food and fuel and 80 percent unemployment. The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the presidential poll. It has rejected any recount. A Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) official, who asked not to be named, said there would be recounts of the votes for both presidential and parliamentary polls in 23 constituencies where there were allegations of poll abuse. The state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper said the recount would be carried out on Saturday after 22 complaints over the polling process by ZANU-PF and one by the MDC. The MDC has a two-seat majority in the lower house of parliament after the election but the combined opposition tally totals 12 more than ZANU-PF. MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa told Reuters: "We have already said that we will not accept any recount because for us that is accepting rigged results. They had custody of the ballot boxes for two weeks and they must have stuffed them with their votes." Zimbabwe's High Court was due to rule on Monday on a MDC application to force the electoral commission to release the presidential result. At the SADC summit in Lusaka, the Zambian official said: "Some leaders feel that including the word crisis would be inappropriate while others say the extraordinary (summit) in itself shows there is a crisis in Zimbabwe," South African President Thabo Mbeki said after meeting Mugabe en route to the summit that there was no election crisis. This conflicted with the views of several other leaders. Mugabe did not attend the meeting, but it was addressed by Tsvangirai. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa, SADC's current chairman, called the summit because of regional concern over the impasse. "SADC can no longer continue to stand by and do nothing when one of its members is experiencing political and economic difficulties," he said in an opening speech. Mbeki, who has consistently favoured a softer line with Mugabe, said the election process was proceeding normally. "I wouldn't describe that as a crisis," Mbeki told reporters after his meeting with Mugabe in Harare. "We have to wait for ZEC to release (the results)," said Mbeki, echoing Mugabe's own stance on the unusually long delay. The MDC and Western powers say Mugabe is holding back the result so he can prepare for a run-off against Tsvangirai. Mugabe dismissed a remark by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown that the world was losing patience. "If Brown is the world, sure, he will lose patience. I know Brown as a little tiny dot on this planet," said Mugabe.
