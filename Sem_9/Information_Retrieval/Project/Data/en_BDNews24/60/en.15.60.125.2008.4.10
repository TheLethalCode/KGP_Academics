<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  The South Asia Academy team responded well to hosts GP-BCB academy team with Reeza Hendricks hitting an unbeaten century at the close of the second day of the second four-dayer Thursday. The visitors were 243 for seven at stumps, still trailing by 81 runs in the first innings against the hosts at Birshreshtha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Openers Sammy-Joe Avontuur and Shadley Van Schalkwyk (36) gave South Africa a fine start putting on 67 runs before the latter was bowled by pacer Rubel Hossain, who returned two for 78. Reeza and Sammy added another 52 runs before left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo broke the second wicket stand trapping Sammy (44) in front, leaving the visitors at 119 for two. Reeza stuck to an end to make unbeaten 101, but he could hardly get any support from other batsmen as spinner Mehrab Hossain Junior, who Wednesday struck a century, removed three batsmen in a row after Raihanuddin Arafat and Rubel each dismissed one batsman . The one-down batsman faced 170 balls to hit 15 fours and will resume the play Friday along with Neil Wagner, who was on 15 not out. Mehrab claimed three for 36. Earlier, the hosts resumed the day on 295 for eight and finished their first innings at 324 all out as Suhrawardi Shuvo made an unbeaten 46 before Richard Das Neves trapped Bangladesh's last batsman Arafat lbw for nought.
