<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 09 (bdnews24.com)  To ensure food security, food stocks will be raised through imports and from the domestic market, said chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday on an inspection of BDR-run fair price shops in the city. But, he stressed, there was no alternative to boosting agricultural production and employment generation to ensure food security in the long run. The chief adviser said the government has already taken a number of positive steps in a bid to expand the social security net, including increasing the scope and efficacy of the vulnerable group programmes. Fakhruddin visited three BDR shops situated by Agargaon Government Music College, at Mirpur Section Two and near Kallyanpur bus depot. The queuing customers requested him to increase the per person rice allowance under the scheme from 5kg to 10kg. The CA, speaking to the buyers at the BDR shops, asked them to be patient: "There's no need to panic about any impending food shortage." "We're going to reap a bountiful boro harvest this season. The wheat and potato yields also have been good," he said. After his round of the BDR shops, the CA told reporters: "The media has an important role in keeping consumer prices under control. I expect you to play your crucial role effectively in this regard." "The government has also stressed the importance of bolstering food stocks, to which end food grain imports and procurement from the domestic market have been planned." However, even while the government mulls raising food stocks, the chief adviser stressed that there was no real alternative to augmenting agricultural production and employment generation to ensuring long-term food security. The forthcoming budget will incorporate necessary directives to these effects, he added. bdnews24.co
