<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government did not hike the prices of oil and power, taking into account the tough time, despite pressure from the World Bank and IMF, said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday. At a pre-budget discussion with the representatives of the Economic Reporters Forum at the finance ministry, the adviser said: "Despite pressure from the World Bank and IMF, the government has not increased the prices of oil, gas and electricity." Any decision on seeking foreign loans depends on revenue collections, he said. "It is not possible to make a budget without foreign loans. If there is a huge jump in revenue collections, the budget could be prepared without taking foreign loans." "We have not yet reached the stage of preparing a budget without foreign loans," Mirza Aziz said. "IMF advised us to follow a contractionary monetary policy, but we did not accept the suggestion. Apart from the World Bank and IMF, other donor agencies also advised us to increase the prices of oil, gas and power." "Some people make wholesale allegations that we go by the advice of the World Bank and IMF. But these two instances prove that we do not accept all advice by them." Mirza Aziz said: "The terms and conditions for a $220 million loan the government is taking from IMF are not stringent. The interest rate on the loan is 0.50 percent." Rejecting a proposal for introduction of a rationing system, the adviser said experience shows that the rationing system fuels corruption. Answering a question, the adviser said that giving people an opportunity to "whiten black money" is unethical. But the existing law has scope to legalise undeclared, yet legally earned moneyan issue he said could be brought into consideration in the next budget. On the ERF leaders' proposal to raise the limit of tax-free income to Tk 2 lakh from Tk 1.5 lakh a year, the adviser said: "The ceiling of tax-free income has been increased in the budget of the current fiscal year. If the limit is extended further, those who need it most may not benefit from it." Mirza Aziz said the new budget would put more emphasis on agriculture and power sectors. "Necessary steps will be taken to increase farm output to keep the commodity prices within the easy reach of ordinary people." He said a social safety net for the poor would be widened. bdnews24.
