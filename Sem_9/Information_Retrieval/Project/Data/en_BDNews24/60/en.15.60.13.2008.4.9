 LONDON, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea will not care if their Champions League semi-final against Liverpool later this month produces another turgid defensive standoff as long as they finish third time lucky. Goals from Michael Ballack and Frank Lampard earned the Londoners a fourth tilt in five years at the final after a scrappy 2-0 win over Fenerbahce gave them a 3-2 quarter-final aggregate victory. Chelsea manager Avram Grant admitted the result had been more important than their performance, which was nervy and disjointed. Chelsea and Liverpool met in the 2005 and 2007 semi-finals of Europe's top club competition, Liverpool triumphing each time by the narrowest of margins. Three years ago, a single Anfield goal that then manager Jose Mourinho described as a "ghost", believing it never crossed the line, made the difference after a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge. Last season the tie was decided on penalties. PULSATING FOOTBALL Given their previous encounters, few expect the semi-final to produce the sort of gloriously pulsating European night of football Liverpool enjoyed to beat Arsenal 4-2 on Tuesday in their quarter-final second leg. But there will be no shortage of motivation for Chelsea and manager Avram Grant. "I am desperate to get to a final having lost in the semi-finals three times," Lampard told reporters. "The semi-final defeats became more and more frustrating each time." The England midfielder was also a member Claudio Ranieri's Chelsea side who lost to Monaco in 2004. Grant, a shock replacement for Mourinho in September, has been told his target is to go at least one better than the Portuguese in the competition and his job could be on the line if they lose at the same stage again. Grant could also find himself being judged over whether he has fulfilled his vow to improve Chelsea's style. Some sting may be taken from the tie without the fierce and outspoken rivalry between Mourinho and Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez that characterised the last three years. By contrast the reticent Grant refused to talk about Liverpool on Tuesday, saying only that he was optimistic by nature. Chelsea lead Liverpool by 11 points in the Premier League and their two league meetings this season produced a 1-1 draw at Anfield and 0-0 at home, though Chelsea did manage victory in the League Cup in December. Given Liverpool's European pedigree that is hardly an indication of form, however, and the London side will be hoping that playing the second leg at home this time, away from Anfield's famous "furnace" of support, will be what tips the balance in their favou
