 SARAJEVO, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims will try again on Thursday to agree on police reforms in what may be the last chance to start the process of joining the European Union. "The European Union has no plan B for Bosnia if it fails to pass the police reform. If they do not pass it now, it means that politicians have voted for self-isolation," said Natasa Vodusek, the ambassador of Slovenia, the EU's present president.
