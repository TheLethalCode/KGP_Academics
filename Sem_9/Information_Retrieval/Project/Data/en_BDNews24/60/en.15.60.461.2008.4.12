<TITLE> Berlusconi`s election rival holds out for surprise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi acts as if he has already won Italy's election but centre-left rival Walter Veltroni told voters on Friday that the flamboyant media tycoon was "no statesman" and had a poor record on the economy. Voters complain there is little to choose between their platforms as both candidates promise to lower taxes to boost demand and fend off a looming recession in the euro zone's third biggest economy. Berlusconi, the 71-year-old owner of AC Milan soccer club, is confident of winning a third term as prime minister in Sunday and Monday's vote. But Veltroni attacked Berlusconi's economic record and his fondness for jokes, like making the two-fingered Latin gesture for a cuckold behind the head of a Spanish minister in 2002. "Italy is a serious country and doesn't need a premier who sticks up his fingers or tells dirty jokes at European summits," said 52-year-old Veltroni on the last day of campaigning. "He's not a statesman. That's what all the international papers say." Veltroni quoted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as saying that "in the five years from 2001-2006 (when Berlusconi was in office) Italy was at a standstill". The International Monetary Fund expects the economy to grow at just 0.3 percent this year. Ahead of a midnight deadline after which politicians are banned from campaigning, both candidates appeared on a TV chat show to deliver their final pleas for votes. In one last sweetener, Berlusconi said he would abolish car and motorbike tax, but only if the Treasury could find the cash. Veltroni stressed the theme of his campaign -- that he is the candidate of change. "This country will have for the first time in its history a great reformist Democratic Party that I'm sure will be the first party in Italy." With few differences perceived between the frontrunners, up to 30 percent of voters were undecided in the last published polls -- meaning Berlusconi's lead is by no means secure. "The two main parties have put forward more or less exactly the same program," Claudio Arbotto, a 44-year-old mechanic for Alitalia, the flagship airline struggling to find a buyer. "We are close to recession here now and that means people are scared to spend and the economy grinds to a halt," said the mechanic, who expects Berlusconi to win but intends to vote for the centrist Christian Democrats, a distant fourth in polls. Analysts at Italian bank Unicredit called both sides' tax proposals "disappointing" and said they should have paid more attention to "increasing productivity gains...and trimming the huge debt burden", the world's third highest in absolute terms. Ratings agency Moody's said their platforms pointed in the right direction, but worried that if the result was uncertain Italy would waste more time on politics instead of reforms. "WASTED" VOTES Berlusconi, who has broken with the Christian Democrats in the same way Veltroni jilted Prodi's old communist and Green allies, urged people on the centre right not to "waste" votes on small parties as it would "play into the hands of the left". Although he had a consistent 5-9 percentage point lead in the latest opinion polls, Berlusconi urged supporters to ensure him a big majority in the Senate, where Romano Prodi's two-seat lead caused his centre-left coalition to collapse in January. "We need a majority in the lower house and the Senate," the conservative People of Freedom leader said. "I know the latest polls and I am absolutely certain we will score a huge victory." Veltroni called Berlusconi's closing rally at Rome's ancient Arch of Constantine late on Thursday "a failure" for attracting only a few thousand people and said the electorate was "way ahead of politics, newspapers and polls". "You'll see that on April 13 we'll have some surprises," said the Democratic Party candidate and former mayor of Rome. Berlusconi used his final rally to criticize many leftist leaders and supporters including soccer star Francesco Totti, the AS Roma captain and Italian World Cup-winning striker. Berlusconi said Totti was "not using his head" because he backed the centre left's Francesco Rutelli for mayor of Rome. "If I asked the Milan players to support me, many would, gladly. Many of them have asked me but I forbade it. That's the difference between me, Veltroni and Rutelli," said Berlusconi
