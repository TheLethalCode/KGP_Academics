 WASHINGTON, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration still hopes to win approval of a free trade pact with Colombia, despite a vote in the House of Representatives to indefinitely delay action on the deal, a top US official said on Friday. "We remain committed to the Columbia free trade agreement, which we believe to be both in the economic and the national security interests of the United States," Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said in a speech to the US-Asia Pacific Council. "Ultimately, if that agreement does not go through, this would be a victory for the populistic and nondemocratic forces in the hemisphere," Negroponte added, in an apparent reference to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and the region's other opponents of the US policy. Negroponte also urged Congress to approve a free trade agreement with South Korea that has been held up partly because of that country's refusal to fully reopen its market to US beef more than three years after the first case of mad cow disease was found in the United States. "Hopefully there will be some developments as a consequence of the president of South Korea's visit here next week," Negroponte said, referring to an upcoming meeting between South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and U.S. President George W. Bush. RATTLED PARTNERS The House rattled US trading partners on Thursday by voting 224-195 to change long-standing legislative rules for considering trade pacts. Democratic leaders were angry with Bush's decision this week to send the Colombia trade agreement to Congress against their advice. They say Bogota needs to make more progress reducing violence against labor leaders, and Congress needs to act first on a number of domestic economic priorities. US Trade Representative Susan Schwab and other Bush administration officials said the vote effectively killed the Colombia deal because it eliminated a 90-day timetable for Congress to vote on the pact, including a 60-day deadline for action in the House. That timetable is a central element of "fast track" procedures that both Republican and Democratic presidents have relied on since 1974 to get trade deals through Congress. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said it was still possible Congress could vote on the pact this year. "This was not an attempt to kill the agreement. It still could come up," Hoyer said on Thursday after the vote. Hoyer also said the rule change applied only to the Colombia pact and was not necessarily a precedent for trade deals with South Korea and Panama that the Bush administration still hopes to get through Congress this year. Rep. Jim McCrery, the top-ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees trade, said he hoped the Colombia, South Korea and Panama pacts could still be approved. "Regardless of what has happened up to now, we have to move forward," McCrery said. "I'm certainly prepared to continue discussions" on Democratic priorities such as expanding federal unemployment and retraining programs for workers who have lost their jobs because of trade, he sa
