 ALGIERS, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Algerian coastguards recovered the corpses of 13 illegal migrants who drowned off Algeria's coast while trying to reach Europe, a local newspaper reported on Wednesday. The migrants perished near the western coastal city of Oran, and their bodies were found on Monday evening and Tuesday morning, Le Quotidien d'Oran said. Government officials were not immediately available to comment on the report. Many Algerian youths attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Spain and Italy. Algeria's government said recently it was tightening measures to cope with growing number of illegal migrants trying to cross its borders for a job and a better life in Europe. Algeria is also a transit point for migrants from African and other countries. Mosques and official media in Algeria have launched a campaign urging desperate Algerians to stay in their oil-and-gas-exporting nation.
