<TITLE> Political crisis main obstacle to investment: Akbar Ali </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said Saturday the country would not see any investment until the political crisis was over. "Political instability has turned out to be the main challenge for the country. Neither local nor overseas investment will take place unless the problem is over," the former caretaker government adviser told a seminar on 'Economic challenges and investment', at the BIAM auditorium. Akbar Ali hoped a fair and peaceful election would be held by the end of December. "I still believe that a free and peaceful election will be held by the end of December, so do many people of the country. But the reality is that there is doubt over the December polls. And the doubt has caused political uncertainty in the country," he said. The RRC chairman asked the government to remove this doubt as early as possible. Akbar Ali Khan said that economic uncertainty had also appeared in the country in the wake of spiralling commodity prices. "We should not think that these problems will be resolved as soon as an elected government takes over," he cautioned. Syed Manzur Elahi, two-time adviser to former caretaker governments, said: "We want a free and peaceful election by the end of this year even if it is held on December 31." Elahi also believed that uncertainty over the polls had stalled investment in the country. President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Annisul Huq asked the government to take effective steps to restore political stability in the country. Former FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain, former deputy governor of the Bangladesh Bank Khondker Ibrahim Khaled, BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez and BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque also spoke at the seminar organised by Daily Jugantor. bdnews2
