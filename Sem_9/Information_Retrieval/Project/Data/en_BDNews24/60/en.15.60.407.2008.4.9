<TITLE> Brazil oil soars, Mexico, Venezuela slip in region </TITLE>

 CARACAS, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil is emerging as a major player in Latin America's energy business after years of domination by oil-rich Venezuela and Mexico, where production is slipping despite prices at $100 per barrel. Cooperation between state-run Petrobras and private partners has helped Brazil become self-sufficient in oil production and make huge oil and gas discoveries. Meanwhile, Mexico's oil production is slipping due to a ban on private investment that has hamstrung state oil monopoly Pemex, and output at Venezuelan state company PDVSA is down after President Hugo Chavez's 2007 nationalization crusade. The trend suggests that business savvy is becoming as important as massive crude reserves in ensuring the growth and profitability of national oil companies. "Petrobras has a long-term strategy that lets it bring in new technology and capital through private investment," said Jorge Pinon, a research associate at the University of Miami. "Pemex and PDVSA are more extensions of the state -- which is why they're in their current position." Brazil's Petrobras last year made what could be one of the world's largest oil finds in 20 years, discovering up to 8 billion barrels in the Tupi field with the help of Britain's BG Group Plc and Portugal's GALP. Petrobras, a former state monopoly in which the government holds a 32 percent controlling stake, has been run like a multinational for nearly a decade and has worked toward a clear goal of ensuring energy for Brazil's industries. In 2006, the company made South America's largest country self-sufficient in oil and a net exporter of oil and products. It now projects domestic crude output to rise 7 percent annually through 2012 and reach 2.4 million barrels per day thanks to an investment plan of more than $112 billion. PRIVATE INVESTMENT Petrobras is internationally recognized as a world leader in deep-sea oil exploration and production and has operations in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex has eyed Petrobras with envy for years. It wishes it could follow a similar path to reverse years of underinvestment that have left PEMEX unable to compensate for declining yields at the huge but aging Canterell field, according to Pemex and energy ministry officials. Mexico's government is highly dependent on the hefty taxes it charges Pemex, which is discovering just one new barrel for every two it extracts. Output is down to about 3 million bpd of crude from a peak of almost 3.4 million bpd in 2004. While the company hopes to keep output steady, the energy minister has warned Mexico's production could more than halve by 2021 unless industry laws are changed. The conservative government is proposing reforms to allow private alliances in deep-water oil, but the barriers are unlikely to come down soon as half of Mexicans oppose the idea and left-wingers protest the effort in the streets. While PDVSA hopes to boost output, its official figures show 2007 production fell almost 5 percent to 3.1 million bpd. To support Chavez's popularity, PDVSA has over the years spent more on social programs -- such as subsidized supermarkets and health clinics that support Chavez's popularity -- than on exploration. Market observers say output is only about 2.5 million bpd. Industry sources now say few oil companies are interested in new Venezuelan projects after Chavez took over four multibillion-dollar heavy oil projects last year, sparking the ouster of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. "Petrobras has been on a huge upward trend, that should position them as a leading player in the region," said Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst with the Eurasia Group in New York. "Pemex and PDVSA are at the other side of the spectrum.
