 BOGOTA, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian guerrillas on Tuesday refused to allow a French medical mission to treat high-profile hostage Ingrid Betancourt in their jungle camps, in another setback to attempts to free scores of captives held for years. The rejection is a blow for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has made a priority out of freeing Betancourt, a former presidential candidate with dual nationality kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC in 2002. The medical mission flew into a Bogota air base on Thursday to wait to treat Betancourt who is believed to be sick after more than six years in captivity. But the mission was in doubt from the start as Paris had no prior deal with the rebels. "The French medical mission is not reasonable and even less so when it was not the result of any agreement," said the FARC in a statement dated April 4 and posted on a Web site that often carries rebel communiques. "We do not respond based on trickery or media campaigns," the rebel statement said. The French Falcon aircraft was still waiting on the tarmac on Tuesday afternoon at a Bogota military air base. Betancourt, three Americans and dozens of politicians, police and soldiers are among 40 political captives whom the FARC says it wants to exchange for jailed fighters. But the guerrillas and government are deadlocked over a hostage deal. Colombia's four-decade-old conflict has eased under President Alvaro Uribe, a Washington ally who has used billions in US aid to fight Latin America's oldest surviving insurgency and the cocaine trade that helps fuel violence. In the statement, the rebels stood by their demand that Uribe demilitarize a New York City-sized area around two rural towns, Florida and Pradera, to facilitate a prisoner swap. Uribe, a conservative who is popular at home for driving back the rebels, has rejected the condition because he says it would allow the FARC to regroup. His own father was killed by guerrillas in a botched kidnapping attempt two decades ago. "If at the start of the year, President Uribe had demilitarized Pradera and Florida for 45 days, Ingrid Betancourt and the soldiers and the jailed rebels would be free," the FARC said. SECOND FRENCH MISSION A flurry of rumors over the last few weeks fueled concern over Betancourt's health. Reports surfaced the FARC took her to be treated in rural clinics in jungle areas, where they are still a potent force. But there was no solid confirmation. Ex-hostages released this year say she is seriously ill and has been chained up after attempting to escape. A rebel video broadcast at the end of last year showed the former lawmaker pale and gaunt in the jungle. France tried a similar mission in 2003 by flying a military transport to Brazil's border with Colombia after Betancourt's family heard she could be freed. But the initiative failed with Colombia and Brazil criticizing Paris. "This rejection contributes to the contamination of the atmosphere," said Alfredo Rangel at Bogota's Security and Democracy Foundation think tank. "It shows the need again to find intermediaries who enjoy the trust of both sides." The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose neutrality helped in the release of six key hostages this year in a deal brokered by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was never contacted by rebel sources on the French initiative. Chavez's role in hostage negotiations has fueled tensions with Bogota, which was angered by his open support for more political recognition for the FARC. The rebels have also resisted attempts by the Roman Catholic Church on talks. Uribe has proposed a safe haven for a hostage swap in a rural area which will not require any troops to withdraw and would be under international observation in a model similar to one put forward by European nations three years ago. Originally a peasant army fighting inequalities in the 1960s, the FARC is now funded by extortion and cocaine trafficking. Rebels have little popular support and US and European officials label them a terrorist organization
