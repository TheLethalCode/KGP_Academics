 LONDON, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former soldier who shot dead four members of his family before walking into a police station with a bag of weapons and a homemade bomb was detained for a minimum of 15 years on Wednesday, police said. David Bradley, 41, will serve his sentence in a secure hospital after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Newcastle Crown Court. He shot his uncle, aunt and two cousins through the head at their three-bed semi-detached home in Newcastle in July 2006. Police said Bradley had developed mental health problems after serving in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and the 1991 Gulf War. He told police after the shootings that he "started to flip" because of the summer heat. "David Bradley was not in a position to understand the nature and the consequences of his actions," Northumbria Police's Superintendent Steve Ward, who led the investigation, told reporters outside court. Police arrested him after he walked into West Road police station in Newcastle carrying a pistol, shotgun and homemade bomb. Officers carried out a controlled explosion on the nail bomb in the foyer. Bradley admitted killing Peter Purcell and his wife Josephine, both 70, and their sons Keith, 44, and Glen, 41. Detectives said Bradley gave graphic details of the killings during interviews. "He was extremely calm, very detached," Ward said. "He described how many bullets he put into individual people's heads, he described the nature of smashing the flat up."
