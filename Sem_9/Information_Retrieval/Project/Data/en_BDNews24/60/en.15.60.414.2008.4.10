 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has cancelled an expulsion order against 11 leaders, including his estranged wife Raushan Ershad, according to separate statements released Thursday. The former president said he had reversed the expulsion decision in line with the party constitution. Former presidium members SMM Alam, Golam Mosih and Mashiur Rahman Ranga are among the 11 leaders who have been welcomed back to the party, said Raushan, referring to the party chairman's decision taken on Wednesday. Raushan said: "I believe the party will be united under the leadership of HM Ershad and find a new way to overcome the national crisis. The party will be more consolidated in future." Golam Mosih told bdnews24.com by phone: "Following the order, the Jatiya Party will be stronger than before. We welcome this decision." Ershad had drifted away from the JP's active leadership for some time, giving place to Barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud, now acting chairman. Later, Ershad took the reins of the party back, which Golam Mosih said was the "reflection of our demand". Ershad has also withdrawn an expulsion order against JP's front organisation Krishak Party leaders Arshad Hossain and Ishaque Bhuiyan. bdnew
