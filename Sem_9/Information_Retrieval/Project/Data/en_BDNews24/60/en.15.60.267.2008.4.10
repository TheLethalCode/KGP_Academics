 Jakarta, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union hopes to wrap up a free trade deal with Southeast Asian economies by the end of 2009, a senior European Commission official said on Thursday. A free-trade agreement between the EU and its fifth-largest trading partner, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has stumbled over issues such as reform in military-ruled Myanmar, which the EU slapped sanctions on last year. Talks over a free-trade agreement kicked off in May last year but have made little progress since then. "We are reasonably ambitious. We think that a negotiation could be completed within a year or a ear-and-a-half. Let's say by the end of 2009, we should be able to achieve some outcome," said Karl Falkenberg, deputy director general for trade at the European Commission. Falkenberg was in Jakarta for discussions on the free trade deal with Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu and will have similar talks with Brunei Darussalam and the Philippines during his trip. He has already had similar talks with the governments of Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. "I will try to understand to what extent ASEAN will want to negotiate effectively as a group. Europe is interested to move it forward rather rapidly and comprehensively," he said. The Association of Southeast Asian Nation's 10 members span a broad political and economic spectrum: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. But jointly their $1 trillion economy is slightly bigger than India's. A free trade deal with the region will help spur trading from the European Union and the ASEAN community. In 2007, the EU trade deficit with ASEAN stood at 25.5 billion euro, falling from 29.7 billion euro in 2006. "For the moment it is a deficit for the European Union. There are still tariff and non-tariff limitations on European goods and services. But we think we could do a lot better in the region," Falkenberg said.
