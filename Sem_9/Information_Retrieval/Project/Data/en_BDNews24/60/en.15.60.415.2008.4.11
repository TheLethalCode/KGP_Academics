 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is far removed from the dreams of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in 1971, said Gano Forum chief Dr Kamal Hossain Friday. "An axis of Yahiya Khan and successors of the razakars created an obstacle to making the country prosperous," Dr Kamal said at a book-launch ceremony at the Liberation War Museum. He said the martyrs dreamt of making the helpless people happy, but "nobody is saying this thing anymore". Dr Kamal said the constitution speaks of a country free from discrimination. "But we could not establish it even in 37 years since independence," he added. The senior lawyer stressed the need for the young generation to know the true history of the Liberation War. Earlier the cover of the book Swadhinata Sangrame Rangunia written by Saleh Ahmed was unveiled. bdnew
