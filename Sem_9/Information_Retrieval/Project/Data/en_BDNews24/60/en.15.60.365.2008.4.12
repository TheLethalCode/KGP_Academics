<TITLE> Mediator tries to rescue Uganda rebel talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ri-Kwangba, Sudan, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar, the chief mediator in Uganda's peace talks, stayed on the remote Congo border on Saturday to try to salvage a final deal with fugitive rebel leader Joseph Kony. Hopes of an agreement to end one of Africa's longest wars were dashed after Kony, commander of the Lord's Resistance Army, failed to appear at a planned signing ceremony, stalling nearly two years of tortuous negotiations. Machar told Reuters he would remain in the frontier hamlet of Ri-Kwangba to see if Kony would meet him. "I want to speak to him ... and see the next stage in the process," Machar said. "The protocols are signed. We just need to find out (about) his reservations." Uganda's 22-year civil war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted 2 million more and destabilised neighbouring parts of south Sudan, which is rich in oil, and eastern Congo, which has large mineral wealth. The U.N. envoy to the conflict, Joaquim Chissano, plans to arrive at the border on Sunday, Machar said, which might help. "We cannot say at this stage who Kony will listen to," he said. Kony, wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court, had been due to sign the deal on Thursday. But he first asked mediators to clarify part of the document and then fired the head of his negotiating team. A retired bishop from Kony's native northern Uganda and an elderly rebel negotiator ventured back into the dense forest on Saturday to try to meet the elusive LRA boss. SPOKESMAN "ARRESTED" The mystery surrounding David Nyekorach-Matsanga, the UK-based negotiator sacked by Kony, deepened on Saturday. Sources involved in the talks said he was arrested by south Sudanese soldiers on his return to Juba airport, where he was said to be carrying $20,000 and a still-sealed letter to the LRA leader from Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The contents of the letter -- or what charges Matsanga might face -- were not known, the sources said. Before leaving Ri-Kwangba, the negotiator denied he had been fired and said he quit in frustration after Kony failed to meet him. Matsanga's replacement as spokesman told Reuters later on Friday that Kony was ready to sign, but wanted guarantees of his safety and financial security first. International prosecutors in The Hague accuse Kony and two of his top deputies of offences including rape, murder and the abduction of thousands of children who were forced to serve as fighters, porters and sex slaves. Even if he does sign a peace agreement, the LRA says it will not disarm until the ICC indictments are scrapped. Museveni has said he will only call for the warrants to be lifted after a final deal has been reached. The Ugandan government team said it would return when the rebels are ready. But it said that unless circumstances significantly change, it had no plans to extend an earlier truce deal between the two sides that expires on Tuesday.
