 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)The High Court dismissed a writ petition Thursday, filed by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia challenging the validity of the Election Commission's invitation to talks on electoral reform. After a lengthy hearing of ten separate sessions, the HC bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman handed down the verdict Thursday in favour of the invitation to the party's 'reformist' faction led by acting chairperson M Saifur Rahman and Hafizuddin Ahmed. The EC has lagged behind in finalising the electoral reform laws after its planned dialogue with the BNP stalled due to legal wrangle over the invitation. The court said the writ petition was dismissed as BNP's internal politics had been included in the petition, on which the court could not give a verdict. On hearing news of the verdict, BNP activists gathered in front of the High Court to protest. Riot police dispersed the crowd. Dr Kamal Hossain, representing the Election Commission, and Hafizuddin's lawyer Shahdeen Malik both welcomed the verdict. However, on whether Khaleda Zia would appeal against the petition's dismissal, her counsel TK Khan said a decision would be taken after discussions among party leaders. Terming the verdict significant, Kamal Hossain said the writ petition involved BNP's internal matters. "Such matters cannot be resolved under writ jurisdiction. The court has given much consideration and dismissed the writ petition." Asked whether the EC's letter to Hafizuddin was legal Dr Kamal said: "Nothing can be said on this without examining the full verdict. In the hearing we asked that the writ petition should be dismissed." Lawyer Shahdeen Malik told journalists the EC's letter of Nov 22 inviting Hafizuddin for electoral reform talks was not illegal. "The Election Commission did not violate any law by issuing the letter. The court has dismissed Khaleda Zia's writ petition. It means the letter to Major Hafiz was legal." Khaleda's counsel TH Khan told reporters: "Khaleda Zia is a political personality. She is a former prime minister of Bangladesh. So the writ petition automatically became political issue." He claimed a process to divide BNP had started. "Attempts are on to destroy the party." The Election Commission had originally been set to publish a gazette on the electoral reforms laws in March, following dialogues with the major political parties in September, October and November, in line with the roadmap declared on July 15 last year. The EC was scheduled to hold the first round of electoral talks with BNP on Nov 22. The dialogue was stalled after Khaleda Zia filed a writ petition with the High Court on Nov 18 challenging the invitation. bdnews24.com/b
