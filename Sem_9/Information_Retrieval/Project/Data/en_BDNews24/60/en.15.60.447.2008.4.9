 LUSAKA, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambia has called an emergency meeting of the 14-member SADC regional bloc on Saturday to discuss Zimbabwe's post-election impasse, President Levy Mwanawasa said on Wednesday. Mwanasa, who chairs the Southern African Development Community, said the crisis required a concerted effort by all southern African countries to find a solution. It was the first move by Zimbabwe's neighbours to intervene after the March 29 elections. The presidential result is still not known.
