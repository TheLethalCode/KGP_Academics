<TITLE> UN investigator wants more time in Hariri probe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Canadian prosecutor heading a U.N. investigation of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri asked the UN Security Council on Tuesday for more time to pursue leads in the case. Although the investigation was making steady progress, prosecutor Daniel Bellemare told the UN Security Council that there would be no indictments issued in the immediate future. Last year the council authorized a special tribunal to try suspects in the 2005 murder of Hariri once the investigation is complete. Bellemare said the tribunal was being set up but gave no indication of when it would commence work. Bellemare asked the council to consider extending the mandate of his investigation once it expires on June 15 while the tribunal was being established. He did not specify how much more time he felt was warranted. "This would give the commission the needed time to continue its investigation," he said. He said he was aware that many people would like the investigation to move more swiftly but cautioned council members that it would take time before any indictments were issued because of the high threshold for evidence. "The filing of eventual indictments will not be immediate after the establishment of the tribunal," he said. "The admissible evidence will have to be carefully and objectively considered in light of the applicable prosecution threshold." "No one can predict or dictate how long this process will take," added Bellemare, who took over from Belgium's Serge Brammertz at the beginning of the year. SYRIAN CONNECTION? Bellemare said he had evidence that a previously existing network of individuals was responsible for Hariri's 2005 assassination and was linked to other political murders in Lebanon. Echoing a report he submitted last month to the council, he said the U.N. panel was now gathering more information about the Hariri network, the identity of all its participants, their links with others and their role in other attacks in Lebanon. The panel also was pursuing efforts to identify the suicide bomber in the Hariri case, comparing information already obtained with exit-entry records and missing-person files of various countries and conducting DNA profiling. Several earlier reports by Brammertz, the last of them in November, said investigators had identified some people thought to be involved in the Hariri killing but disclosed no names. The first head of the UN team, German Detlev Mehlis, implicated Syrian officials but Brammertz never repeated the allegation and Bellemare continued the Belgian's cautious approach. Like Brammertz, he reported that Syrian cooperation with the investigation had been "generally satisfactory." Brammertz has said, however, that a likely motive for the killing was the role of Hariri, who became a prominent critic of Syria, in support of a 2004 U.N. resolution demanding that Syrian and other foreign troops withdraw from Lebanon. The assassination of Hariri sparked a worldwide outcry that forced the withdrawal of the Syrian troops, which had been in Lebanon for nearly 30 years
