 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)- The outcome is apparently predictable when Bangladesh face Pakistan in the third ODI in Lahore on Sunday. A convincing 2-0 lead with wins in Lahore and Faisalabad put Pakistan in the commanding position to seal and confirm the series. Bangladesh as usual didn't back out of the idea of an upset win with skipper Mohammad Ashraful saying, "We need our top six to perform and not get out to rash shots at bad times. We will be better in the next three matches." The change is only in the bowling quarter though. Fast bowler Shahadat Hossain makes the eleven and Syed Rasel bows out to make room for him. The Pakistan camp may be opting for six bowlers as hinted by their captain Shoaib Malik. With Younis Khan pulling out for the remainder of the series, Bazid Khan is thought the possible replacement. The right hand middle order batsman would be making a comeback after three years.
