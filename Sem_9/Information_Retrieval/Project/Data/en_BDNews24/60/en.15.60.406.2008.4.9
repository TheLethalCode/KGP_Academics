 PARIS, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French police fired teargas and clashed with stone-throwing youths during a protest in Paris on Tuesday against plans by President Nicolas Sarkozy's government to cut teaching jobs. The protest, organised by high-school students and teachers' unions, was the third and largest rally in over a week aimed at derailing plans to axe some 8,830 teaching jobs this year. Organisers called off the demonstration near the end of its planned route after riot police clashed with teenagers throwing bottles and rocks at them. Police said 25 people were detained, and three police and one protester were slightly hurt. "Our school is losing seven teaching positions next year and we know that the number of students will only grow," said Ari Bouaniche, 27, an English teacher in Villepinte outside Paris. "While it's true the number of school students has decreased in recent years, the cuts the government wants are disproportionate," he said. Police said 8,500 protesters including 50 teachers took part in the demonstration, which was held up several times by masked youths playing a cat-and-mouse game with police. Student organisers said at least 20,000 marched through southern Paris near the touristic Saint-Germain-des-Pres area. Television station TF1 said riot police were also dispatched to quell unrest at a similar demonstration in a Paris suburb. The planned job cuts are part of a wider government initiative to replace one out of two public sector workers retiring between now and 2012 as the government tries to curb state spending and cut its public deficit. Government ministers have so far dismissed the student movement but analysts say they'll be anxious to prevent them from gaining momentum. Another protest is planned for Thursday. Two years ago a planned youth job contract was scrapped in the face of sometimes violent street protests. Just over one million people work in the French national education system, including 840,000 teachers. The government says the planned cuts will have no major impact on schools
