<TITLE> US military`s space demands seen topping supply </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US military demand for a broad range of satellite services will continue to outrun supply as the United States fleshes out its growing global information "mosaic," the Air Force's top civilian said Wednesday. "We are entering an age when warfighters want more of what space has to offer," Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne told a conference here known as the National Space Symposium. "And I think demand will continuously outstrip supply for the foreseeable future," he said, referring to such things as precision targetting, secure communications and battlefield awareness. Defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Co are vying for billions of dollars of work on advanced military communications, navigation and other satellite systems. Since 2001, funding for Air Force space programs has nearly doubled, Wynne said, for everything from monitoring weather to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Working with commercial providers, "we are extending this global information mosaic in a very new and very powerful way," he said. The United States accounted for 81 percent of global governments' space spending last year, according to The Space Report 2008 authored by the Space Foundation, a Colorado Springs, Colorado, advocacy group that sponsors the symposium. Combined US defense-related spending totaled $45 billion in 2007, or 71 percent of US government space spending, according to the report released Tuesday. Gen. Robert Kehler, head of the Air Force Space Command, said meeting US forces' ever-growing needs for "bandwidth," or communications capacity, remained a major challenge, given the growing appetite for services. "This bandwidth issue is going to be around for a long time," he told reporters, adding that the bulk of it was provided by commercial contractors. Wynne said the United States also must do more to protect space assets on which it relies for a large and growing list of commercial and civilian needs. His prepared text referred to China's January 2007 use of a ground-based ballistic missile to destroy an aging satellite in polar orbit without alerting other nations in advance, though he dropped the reference when he spoke. "While we have made considerable progress in fielding space capabilities, we have not sufficiently addressed space survivability among many of our space systems," Wynne said
