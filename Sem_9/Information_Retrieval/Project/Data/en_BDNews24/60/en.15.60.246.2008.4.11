 TEHRAN, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An influential Iranian cleric on Friday rejected US President George W Bush's accusations that Iran was arming and funding Shia militias in Iraq to kill American soldiers, state radio reported. In a speech at the White House on Thursday, Bush repeated long-standing US accusations against Iran and warned the Islamic republic to stop interfering in Iraq.

Tehran says its atomic work is solely to generate electricity. The UN Security Council has imposed three round of sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt its sensitive nuclear activities as demanded since 2006. But since the March UN sanctions resolution, Iran has refused to hold talks with the major powers to resolve the nuclear dispute, saying it would only discuss its nuclear programme with the UN nuclear watchdog. P5+1 powers want EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, to try to reopen talks on offers of incentives for Iran to halt its work.
