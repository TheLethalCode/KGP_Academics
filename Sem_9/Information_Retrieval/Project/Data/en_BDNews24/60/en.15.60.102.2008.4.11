<TITLE> India may ease rice export controls: trade </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rice prices may have peaked after doubling this year and India, which curtailed exports to strengthen domestic supply, is likely to ease some controls on overseas sales, traders and industry officials said. Concerns over rice supplies, triggered by rising demand and global stocks falling by half since their 1980s peak, have prompted exporting nations to focus on building stockpiles and boosting domestic supplies to prevent shortages and inflation. Analysts say the anxiety will subside in the coming months as stocks rise and extra crops boost supplies but the Philippines, a leading importer, remains concerned and have called for a regional meeting to discuss the issue. India raised the floor price for overseas sale of basmati rice and banned exports of other varieties as the government struggles to tame inflation which has soared to a three-year high of 7.4 percent. Traders and industry officials say India is adequately stocked, obviating strong restrictions on exports. "I would say a controlling mechanism is required, but I don't think a blanket ban is required, S. Venkatesh, general manager, exports, at India-based Pepsi Foods Pvt Ltd, told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Mumbai. ADEQUATE STOCKS He said India's rice stocks were already more than the government's prescribed level for April. "We are already in a more-than-comfortable situation on buffer stock," he said. Another trader, who did not want to be identified, said India may have a rice surplus because of the export ban. Vijay Sethia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association, said the Indian government has been in talks with trade officials to ease curbs on export of premium grades of non-basmati rice. "We are expecting a decision on this in the next 10-15 days," he said. He said the government was likely to broaden the definition of basmati rice to include the high-yielding aromatic Pusa 1121 variety, which would allow exports. A rice exporter, who did not want to be identified, said 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes of Pusa 1121 are produced a year in India out of which 90 percent was exported. Sethia said price of rice in the international market would also be influenced by the wheat market. "Rice scenario is likely to follow that of wheat. There will be a slight cooling down of prices globally because wheat influences the price of other grains," he said. R.S. Seshadri, director at Tilda Riceland, India's largest basmati exporter, said efforts by various governments to build stocks would support prices although production would match consumption. "It is the reactions and perceptions of the people that are driving prices higher," he said. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Friday the world's cereal output was forecast to rise 2.6 percent this year following expansion in planting in major producing countries. It said world rice output would rise 1.8 percent in 2008 to 441 million tonnes in milled terms
