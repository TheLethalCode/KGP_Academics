 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to increase the daily amount of rice for open market sale (OMS) through dealers by 210 tonnes in Dhaka and Narayanganj, an official said Thursday. From now, 586 tonnes of rice, up from 386 tonnes, will be sold in Dhaka district every OMS day, while 45 tonnes, up from 35 tonnes, will be allocated for Narayanganj. The chief adviser's deputy press secretary Sarwar Alam told bdnews24.com that the decision had been taken at a high-level meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The food and disaster management adviser, secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office, food and disaster management secretary and BDR officials attended the meeting. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Thursday visited several shops of OMS dealers in Narayanganj and listened to the problems of local people. The CA witnessed a long queue of people who came to buy OMS rice and learnt that many had returned home empty-handed after a long wait, said an official who accompanied Fakhruddin to Narayanganj. After hearing the complaints from buyers, the CA decided to increase the allocation of rice. The CA also directed the OMS shop owners to increase the number of outlets. The additional 210 tonnes will be sold every OMS day in the densely populated areas of the two districts on the basis of demand. The number of dealers in Dhaka and Narayanganj is 884, which might be increased.
