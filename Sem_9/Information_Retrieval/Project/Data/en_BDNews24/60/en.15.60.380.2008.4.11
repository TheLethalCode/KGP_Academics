 Chittagong, April 11 (bdnews24.com)Madrasa students Friday attacked the Hathazari Police Station and set three vehicles on fire, leaving about 50 people injured, police and witnesses said. Several policemen were among those injured in the sudden attack by the students of Darul Ulum Muinul Islam Madrasa in Hathazari upazila, the police said. About 1,000 madrasa students laid siege to the police station around 6.00pm, chanted anti-government slogans and attacked the policemen at some point of demonstration. The protesters also shouted slogans against a new women's development policy that proposes equal rights for women to property. The clashes bear the hallmarks of a fierce street battle at the Baitul Mukarram Mosque in Dhaka, which left about 150 people injured. At least 52 policemen were wounded on the second straight day of violence, the police said. Some attackers told bdnews24.com that they had launched the attack on the police station as they heard that a "madrasa student was killed" by police in Dhaka. Assistant superintendent of police for Hathazari circle Ali Ahmed Khan told bdnews24.com that the protesters had ransacked the police station and set three vehicles including a Jeep ablaze. The violence continued for an hour before the police brought the situation under control with a hail of teargas and rubber bullets. As the local police failed to face the angry students, an additional platoon of police was rushed to the scene. Hathazari sub-inspector Mizanur Rahman, constables Abdul Haque, Bahar Uddin, Mostofa Hamid and the imam of the police station mosque Abdul Kalam were among the injured. bdn
