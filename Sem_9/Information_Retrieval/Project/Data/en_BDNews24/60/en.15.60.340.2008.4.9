 Washington, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top US officials in Iraq will testify on the war for a second day to Congress on Wednesday as the Bush administration makes its case against a big troop pull-out. Gen. David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker will argue the United States risks losing ground to al Qaeda in Iraq if it withdraws too many troops out of the war zone too quickly.

Democrats, however, have already cast the progress report from Petraeus and Crocker as a sign the Bush administration has no plan to end the conflict. They say that while the "surge" of extra troops into Iraq last year helped reduce violence, it did not yield the political progress among Iraqi factions that Bush promised.
