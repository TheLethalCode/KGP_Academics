 Sofia, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgaria's government won a no-confidence vote on Friday over its response to crime and graft, but the European Union is so worried about the issues that the country could face sanctions and lose millions in aid. The Socialist-led coalition survived with 117 deputies voting against the opposition motion and 82 for it. Junior centre-right coalition partner NDSV abstained to show it was fed up with sluggish reforms. Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev told parliament on Friday he would start talks about a possible cabinet reshuffle and seek renewed support for reforms after NDSV's abstention. The government faces broader challenges from the European Union, which has called for "urgent action" following the killings of an author of books on the Bulgarian mafia and the chief of an energy company.

There have been more than 150 gangland assassinations since 2001, but Sofia has failed to convict a single suspect and has not charged any senior officials with graft. The government's image suffered further when high-ranking police officials were arrested last month and accused by prosecutors of irregular phone tapping. And a report by the parliamentary security commission said this week that police officials had passed classified information to drug traffickers linked to militant groups. To appease angry voters and restore the EU's trust, the ruling coalition has approved a plan to rid the scandal-tainted interior ministry of corrupt officials and reform police. But coalition partner NDSV of former king Simeon Saxe-Coburg, and the rightist opposition said the reform plan was not enough and Interior Minister Rumen Petkov had to
