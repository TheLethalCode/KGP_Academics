 BEIJING, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese authorities foiled plots to kidnap foreigners and carry out suicide attacks around the Beijing Olympics, police said on Thursday, in a fresh blow to the image of harmony China has sought to promote before the Games. The European Parliament, meanwhile, voted for a possible boycott by EU leaders of the Olympics opening ceremony if China fails to talk to the Dalai Lama, raising pressure on Beijing over the way it has handled a recent wave of unrest in Tibet and neighbouring areas. Authorities in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang detained 45 suspects and seized explosives and firearms in an operation a police spokesman said cracked two terrorist groups seeking to disrupt the Olympics. "We are facing a real terrorist threat. All walks of life and the public should maintain a high degree of vigilance," police spokesman Wu Heping told a news conference. China has heightened security in advance of the Games, which start on Aug. 8, following a rash of anti-Beijing unrest in Tibet and neighbouring areas. Reports have also emerged of at least one pro-independence protest in Xinjiang last month. Overseas, the torch relay was besieged by human rights protesters in London and Paris before heading to San Francisco where the determination to avoid incidents turned the run into a widely criticised game of hide-and-seek. The route for the torch relay on May 2 in Hong Kong, its first stop in China, will be cut short "to avoid embarrassing scenes", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported, quoting an unnamed government source. International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said the torch relay was facing a crisis and athletes around the world were in disarray, but he was confident the Olympics would rebound and urged competitors not to lose faith. "DISGUSTING" CONDUCT China's ambassador to the United States condemned a purported attempt to disrupt the U.S. leg of the relay, saying such "disgusting" conduct was doomed to fail. "A tiny group of people ignored the spirit of the Olympic charter and tried to disrupt and sabotage the Beijing Olympic Games," the official Xinhua news agency quoted Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong as saying. He did not elaborate on the purported plot. For its part, Tibet's government-in-exile said it was not trying to disrupt the torch relay, and the Dalai Lama said he had asked Tibetans in San Francisco not to be violent, reiterating his support of the Games in Beijing. Monk-led protests gave way to riots in Lhasa on March 14, sparking demonstrations in other Tibetan-populated areas that China's government has suppressed with a flood of riot troops. Beijing ordered monks to undergo "patriotic education" and launched a propaganda campaign blaming Tibet's spiritual leader and his associates for orchestrating the unrest as part of a campaign for independence. The Dalai Lama denies involvement. Groups unhappy about China's human rights record and its policies on Sudan's Darfur region have sought to pressure Beijing as it prepares to host the Olympics. In Beijing, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told Rogge the torch is a "shining symbol of peace, friendship and progress", the People's Daily, the voice of the Communist Party, reported. Hours before the San Francisco relay, President George W Bush urged China to open a dialogue with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader who lives in exile in India. Bush and other Western leaders face a delicate balancing act as calls mount for them to boycott the Olympics opening ceremony. Speaking in New Delhi, Samdhong Rinpoche, prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said it was open to a dialogue, and Beijing was sending many signals through "all kinds of channels". "But they are mixed signals. We are not able to understan
