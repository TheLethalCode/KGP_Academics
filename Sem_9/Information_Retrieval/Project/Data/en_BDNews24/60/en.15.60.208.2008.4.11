 LONDON, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index slipped by midday on Friday after US conglomerate General Electric posted "disappointing" first-quarter results, though oil shares offered some support. By 1108 GMT, the UK's blue-chip index was down 31.2 points, or 0.5 percent at 5,933.3, well off its day's high of 6,016.3 after the General Electric results were announced. "There is absolutely no doubt a reaction to the GE results has caused this about-face on the market," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of private client research at Charles Stanley. "Although there will be a knee-jerk disappointment to that number, investors must in the prevailing environment have at the back of their minds the perception that broadly, companies are not going to meet their earnings expectations." Oil shares were the biggest sectoral gainer as crude prices steadied above $110 a barrel. BP climbed 1 percent and rival Royal Dutch Shell put on 0.9 percent. An upgrade to "overweight" to "neutral" on BP from JPMorgan also boosted the stock. Index heavyweight Vodafone shed 2.8 percent after Morgan Stanley analysts said the stock did not appeal to them compared with KPN, TeliaSonera or France Telecom after meeting EU officials on routing costs. The broker remained "underweight" on Vodafone. General Electric, the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalisation, reported an unexpected 6 percent drop in profit, as the slumping U.S. economy and credit crunch drove down profits at its financial, industrial and healthcare units. It also lowered its earnings forecast for the year. University of Michigan consumer sentiment data at 1355 GMT will provide a further gauge of the strength of the world's largest economy, which some believe is already in recession. NO SWEET OUTLOOK Cadbury Schweppes fell 2.7 percent after traders expressed concern over its 2008 outlook, even though the confectionery group said its sweets business had a strong start to the year. Friends Provident dropped 3.6 percent after sources close to the matter said U.S. buyout group J.C. Flowers was prepared to walk away from takeover target Friends, frustrated at a lack of conctact with the insurer's management. British engineering project manager Amec advanced 3.4 percent after UBS upgraded the stock to "buy" from "neutral". Positive comment on ITV's advertising outlook from Credit Suisse helped pushed the broadcaster's shares up 2.8 percent. Also featured on the downside, Sage lost 2.8 percent after Citi downgraded its rating on the software company to "hold" from "buy" and Panmure cut its price target on the stock. BAE Systems dropped 3.7 percent, extending the previous session's 0.8 percent decline. A London court said on Thursday a corruption investigation into arms deals with Saudia Arabia should not have been halted. British Energy continued its ascendancy, up 1.4 percent as a number of suitors were knocking on the door. A source close to the matter said France's EDF may join the 11 billion pound bid battle for the UK nuclear power firm, but will not overpay. International Power rose 3.7 perce
