 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser CS Karim has put accent on the availability of logistics and training to enable the next generation to excel in digital imaging. "Today we don't require papers and pens to express our thoughts with the emergence of digital imaging. The importance of image is inevitable. The information or data on our national life can also be displayed through images beyond numbers," Karim said. He made the remarks at the inauguration of an 'Imaging Show' at Hotel Sheraton on Saturday. Event management organisation Maker organised the first-ever imaging show in the country. "Image is required for medical diagnosis. An image can provide lots of information." He said digital imaging expresses colours, joys and agonies. The adviser asked all to fully comply with copyright law. "We pirate many software copyright. Providing copyright does not mean one has to pay money, it means acknowledgement. We should be willing to spend money on good products," CS Karim said. Digital imaging refers to raster images with a finite set of digital values, called pixels. Raster images can be created by a variety of input devices and techniques, including digital cameras, scanners, coordinate-measuring machines, seismographic profiling and airborne radar. They can also be synthesised from arbitrary non-image data, such as mathematical functions or three-dimensional geometric models. Bangladesh Computer Samity president Mustafa Jabbar, who was a special guest, said: "Twenty-five percent tax and 15 percent VAT have been imposed on the import of digital camera. That's why cameras are bought in illegally." He urged the adviser to take steps to withdraw tax and duty charges on digital cameras. bdnews24.com editor-in-chief Toufique Imrose Khalidi said: "It is unreasonable to impose such high taxes on digital cameras, when mobile phones with similar inbuilt digital cameras are taxed at a much lower rate." Khalidi cited taxes as high as 40 percent on digital cameras, with a tax of only Tk 300 on mobile phones with similar standard inbuilt cameras. "I hope the government will rationalise such tax discrepancies." Strategy director of Maker Mohammad Khan told bdnews24.com: "The show has been organised in the country for the first time. Eight camera and printer manufacturing companies have participated in the show." On the purpose of the show, Khan said: "All the machines and their parts from the capture of an image to putting it to paper are available in the show." HP, Intel, Canon, Samsung, Lexmark and Flora are some of the companies that are taking part in the show.. The fair runs through to April 14 from 10am to 8pm. bdnews24.co
