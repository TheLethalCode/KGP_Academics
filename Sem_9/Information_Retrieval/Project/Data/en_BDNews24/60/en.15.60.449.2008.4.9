 Dhaka, April 09 (bdnews24.com)  British home secretary Jacqui Smith said Wednesday she was pleased to hear about the progress on counter-terrorism measures in Bangladesh. Smith, following a meeting in the morning with home adviser MA Matin, also stressed the need for restoration of the democratic process for curbing terrorism. "She prioritised the issue of countering terrorism. I told her that we are trying," Matin told reporters after the meeting with the visiting home secretary "I said that we have not been able to curb terrorism totally, but have controlled it to a great extent," said Matin. "I told the home secretary that we have already convicted and hanged a number of terrorists, and the trial of other terrorists is on". Smith, who arrived in Dhaka Tuesday night from Pakistan, told the waiting reporters: "I am very pleased to hear the adviser telling me about the progress that has been made in Bangladesh on anti-terrorism legislation, which I consider to be very important." She also said that there would be a joint working group in June on countering terrorism comprising officials of the two countries. "The best way you do tackle terrorism in the long run is by building strong and stable democracy," she said. "The Bangladeshi people and the British people suffered in the recent past from indiscriminate terrorists' violence. Its something which as the home secretary has priority for me back in the UK," said Smith, who is the first woman to hold the portfolio of home affairs in the UK. Smith is scheduled to have talks during her visit with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed, according to a statement of the British High Commission in Dhaka.
