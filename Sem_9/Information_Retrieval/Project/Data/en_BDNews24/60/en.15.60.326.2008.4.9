 WASHINGTON, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Wednesday urged China to open a dialogue with the Dalai Lama, saying Beijing would find the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader to be a "fine man." His comments came as the Olympic torch was set to make its only relay in the United States, in San Francisco where large protests were expected. The torch relays have met with demonstrations protesting China's policies from its crackdown in Tibet to its human rights record. "We both agreed that it would stand the Chinese government in good stead if they would begin a dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama," Bush said after meeting with Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong. "They'll find if they ever were to reach out to the Dalai Lama they'd find him to be a really fine man, peaceful man, a man who is anti-violence," Bush said. Bush has planned to attend the Olympics in China this summer and White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said on Wednesday there was "no change" to his schedule. But after months of saying that Bush would definitely go to Beijing for the summer games, the White House recently has been slightly more cautious. Several leading Democrats, including presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, have called on Bush to boycott the Olympics opening ceremony in protest of the Chinese actions in Tibet. "It is extremely premature for me to say what the president's schedule is going to be," Perino said. "But I would again reiterate that the president has been very clear that he believes that the right thing for him to do is to continue to press the Chinese on a range of issues, from human rights and democracy, political speech freedoms and religious tolerance, and to do that publicly and privately, before, during and after the Olympics," she said. In another development, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States was considering whether to open a consulate in Tibet. Such a move would require the approval of the Chinese government, which has severely restricted access to Tibet for foreign diplomats and journalists following the riots that broke out in the regional capital Lhasa on March 14. "We are looking at the possibility of a consulate in Tibet," Rice told lawmakers at a congressional hearing. The United States has repeatedly demanded access for its diplomats to Tibet following the unrest and urged China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama.
