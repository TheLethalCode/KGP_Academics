 LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell 0.7 percent by late morning on Thursday ahead of the Bank of England's interest rate decision and dragged by banks after Lehman Brothers said it had liquidated three of its funds. By 0955 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 38.7 points at 5,945.2, also weighed by miners on worries about economic growth. "The BoE is being overshadowed by a combination of rumours to the downside with the potential of more writedowns ... and apparently Lehman liquidating some funds," said Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at GFT Global Markets. "You've got oil higher now, back up again. Put it altogether it has been a rapid drift to the downside," he said. Miners were the biggest drag on the index after BHP Billiton said it was not aware of any plan by China to buy a stake in the company, while the Australian government said it would look closely at any moves by Chinese entities to buy shares in BHP. The world's biggest miner fell 4.4 percent. Elsewhere in the mining sector, Rio Tinto, Lonmin, Kazakhmys , Xstrata, Anglo American and Vedanta Resources were down between 1.7 and 3.3 percent. Banks were another standout loser, with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Alliance & Leicester, HBOS, HSBC and Lloyds TSB all down between 0.4 and 3 percent. Lehman Brothers has liquidated three floundering investment funds that lost value and ended up taking $1 billion of assets onto its balance sheet, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.00 percent when it announces its decision at 1100 GMT. The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.00 percent at 1145 GMT. Oil shares offered some support as crude prices edged towards $112 a barrel. Index heavyweight BP advanced 0.6 percent, while Royal Dutch Shell added 0.4 percent and Cairn Energy put on 1.9 percent. M&A SUPPORTS British Energy rose 4.5 percent after a source close to the matter said German utility RWE had made an indicative all-cash offer for British Energy, which values the UK nuclear power operator at up to 11 billion pounds. Another source said Centrica had made an indicative all-share bid for British Energy, with the offer being pitched at under 700 pence a share. British Energy, RWE and Centrica, whose shares added 0.3 percent, all declined to comment. In other related M&A news, mid-cap Enodis jumped more than 48 percent to 224.75 pence after U.S. Manitowoc Co Inc confirmed it had approached Enodis about a possible cash offer valuing the UK company at 260 pence per share. Mitchells & Butlers gained 1.7 percent after the Times said private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Blackstone had made a joint bid to buy a stake of up to 29.9 percent in the restaurant and pub firm. DSG International however, shed more than 9 percent after the pan-European electrical goods retailer issued its second profit warning in three months, saying it was increasingly having to cut prices to maintain sal
