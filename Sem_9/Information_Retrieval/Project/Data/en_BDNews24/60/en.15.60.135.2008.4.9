<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Wednesday stressed increased investment in the agriculture sector. "We have to make the farmer and farming sector the focal point of national policy," the adviser told reporters on his way out of the venue for a roundtable on "Food safety and modernisation of farm management" at the BRAC Centre Inn. "Investment in the sector has decreased since the 1980s. So investment should be increased," he said. Zillur recommended short- and long-term projects for food safety and said: "We have started discussion on how we can stock boro paddy. We have also increased the quantity of rice to be sold in the open market to one lakh tonnes." "We are considering increasing the number of distribution centres," he added. The Chittagong City Corporation had introduced OMS alongside Bangladesh Rifles' shops, the adviser said. "Other city corporations including Dhaka can follow it." Chittagong City Corporation launched an OMS programme in the metropolitan area Tuesday in a bid to sell rice at low prices to people. bdnew
