 TEHRAN, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will replace two ministers, including the economy minister, Iranian newspapers reported on Thursday, in what analysts said was an attempt to shift blame over his failed fiscal policy. Government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham was quoted as saying that Economy and Finance Minister Davoud Danesh-Jafari and Interior Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi would be replaced. He did not say when or why. "Ahmadinejad has asked the two ministers to serve the government in other posts," Elham was quoted by the Etemad-e Melli daily as saying. Iranian media had in recent days cited rumours about the replacement of some ministers, including the economy, interior and foreign ministers. Elham denied the rumours on Saturday. "When I denied the rumours, I did not know about the changes," Elham said. The conservative government of Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 pledging to share Iran's oil wealth more fairly. But critics say profligate government spending has fuelled inflation, running at around 20 percent year-on-year. Analysts say Ahmadinejad unseated the two ministers to divert the nation's attention from his economic and social failures. "It is Ahmadinejad's strategy to change ministers and then blame them for the failure of his government's economic and executive policies," political analyst Saeed Laylaz told Reuters. "These changes also show that this government lacks any clear policies." Elham did not say who would replace the two ministers, but Ahmadinejad should win parliament's approval for his appointees. Lawmakers, including some conservatives who have criticised economic policy, are likely to pressure Ahmadinejad over public discontent in the run up to a run-off vote on April 25 for the remaining seats in parliament after an election last month. Analysts say parliament will become more vocal in its criticism of Ahmadinejad's economic management ahead of presidential election in 2009. Iran has reaped windfall gains in recent years from the high oil price on world markets and says its annual economic growth is about 6 percent, despite tightening UN Security Council sanctions on Tehran over its disputed nuclear plans. Since coming to power, Ahmadinejad has changed some of his ministers, including those for oil, education and industry as well as the country's central bank govern
