 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Newsprint Owners Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) and Bangladesh Sangbadpatra Parisahd (BSP) have asked for a waiver of 15 percent VAT on newsprint import and a four-time government advertisement rate hike.. An eight-member delegation of NOAB and BSP met the chief adviser at his office Saturday afternoon and made the demand in the backdrop of abnormal rise in newsprint price. The chief adviser told them that the government would consider the matter, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told journalists at a briefing. Munaim said the delegation briefed the chief adviser that the price did not increase in last 20 years and proposed that the rate of a column inch government advertisement be fixed at Tk 832 from Tk 208. The press secretary said the delegation also discussed the mode of payment of advertisement bill with the caretaker administration head. The newspaper industry leaders proposed payment of the bill for advertisements placed by district offices from their head offices. NOAB members said last year the government brought down the duty on paper from 25 percent to zero percent and still they had to pay 23 percent additional price including 15 per cent VAT and other taxes. As a result, the price of a tonne of paper stands at Tk 10,332. The chief adviser said the information ministry would be asked to take positive steps after discussion with the finance ministry. On 15 percent VAT, he said it has to be discussed with the finance ministry. The delegation included NOAB president and The Independent editor Mahbubul Alam, vice president Motiur Rahman (Prothom Alo), treasurer Motiur Rahman Chowdhury (Manavjamin), members AMM Bahauddin (Dainik Inqilab), Reazuddin Ahmed (News Today), Altamas Kabir (Sangbad), AMM Shahidullah Khan (New Age) and BSP vice president Golam Sarwar. bdnews24
