 BARCELONA, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona should be celebrating the prospect of a Champions League semi-final with Manchester United but their performances against Schalke have done little to lift the atmosphere of gloom at the club. The Catalans had hoped a return to European competition would inspire them to raise their game, but their laboured displays against the Germans provided confirmation they are a mere shadow of the side that won the competition in 2006. Off the field tension has done little to help the side's cause, with incessant speculation surrounding the future of high-profile players and the names of possible new coaches filling the pages of the local media. Given the circumstances it was understandable that Barcelona struggled and appropriate that Wednesday's 1-0 win was decided by a bizarre goal coming from the unlikely figure of Yaya Toure.

"We have to escape from this climate of fear because it undermines the team. Enthusiasm and support are what is needed because we are still in the Champions League. "It isn't easy to get into the semi-finals and we should be united as a club and try to enjoy it. After all it is only the 10th time in our history that we have reached this stage of the competition." Although Barca will be missing their inspirational captain Carles Puyol for the first leg against United at the Nou Camp, the likely return of explosive Argentine forward Messi and Portugal midfielder Deco gave some cause for optimism. "We will improve when we've got Messi and Deco back," said striker Samuel Eto'o. "Why can't we dream about winning? "We are just as important a club as Manchester and our players are just as good
