 MILAN, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England coach Fabio Capello is confident he will be cleared of wrongdoing in Italian tax and court investigations, he said in an interview. Prosecutors in Turin said on Tuesday that a lengthy investigation into possible tax fraud by the 61-year-old had been extended to his wife and two adult sons. "If there was one thing that I've always said to my consultants, it was that I didn't want to end up on the front page because of tax problems. But it happened," Capello told Vanity Fair magazine. "I am very convinced that everything has been done in a correct way, I am calm," he said in an interview this week's edition of the magazine. "Certainly the English media concentrate a lot on the national coach, perhaps too much, and I was not expecting it. Perhaps there is pressure because for decades (England) have won nothing." Capello is also being probed on suspicion of withholding information last month at a trial involving Luciano Moggi, the former Juventus director central to Italy's match-fixing affair. A prosecutor will decide whether to charge Capello after reviewing evidence he gave to the trial of six men accused of wrongdoing in connection with Gea World sports agency which used to manage the careers of some top Italian players and coaches. "I was very surprised. I was heard by the prosecutor as a witness during the investigation and at the trial I repeated the same things that I had already said. I am convinced everything will be sorted out soon," the former Juventus boss said, adding that he was still good friends with Moggi. "We go out to dinner with our wives, you cannot cancel certain things. If someone makes a mistake, for me they are not automatically dead. The results of Juventus were obtained on the field by me and the players, suffering and battling." Capello also confirmed the England job was his last and countered suggestions he was too much of a disciplinarian. "This will be my last role, I am old," he said. "I am not severe. We (players and coach) are together for only a short time so I think we should respect the rules. Then I am open to all the games and jokes." Capello also praised David Beckham, who made his last squad. "David in reality is a lad completely different from his public image. Generous, educated, I have seen him sign hundreds of autographs for youngsters," he said
