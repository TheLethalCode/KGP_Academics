 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Wednesday invited applications from firms for licences to set up call centres, an official said. The telecoms regulator posted an advertisement and application forms on its website. A licensee will have to pay Tk 5,000 for a licence in one-time fee for an initial term of five years. Abdullah A Ferdous, a senior consultant of the BTRC, told bdnews24.com that licences would be given to those who are able to fulfil the minimum requirements. According to a guideline, licences will be given to individuals, companies and joint ventures registered or formed under "existing laws of Bangladesh". Foreign equity in ownership is limited to a maximum of 45 percent for all types of call centre. For non-resident Bangladeshis, a maximum of 70 percent ownership for any licence will be allowed. For a captive international call centrethe one set up by an overseas company to serve only its own customersthe BTRC will approve 100 percent of foreign direct investment by the company. If any telecommunication operator (mobile, PSTN, ISP, DDCSP, IGW, ICX, IIG) seeks to start call-centre business, it will have to separate the call centre location from its existing premises. For foreign investment, no fund can be raised locally from the financial institutions in Bangladesh. Foreign investors must bring in funds from overseas. The employment of foreign expatriates is limited to 10 percent after the first year of operation. There will be no revenue sharing for the first three years for Dhaka and Chittagong metropolitan areas and the first five years for the rest of the country. Major functions of the call centres are customer services of large companies, and sales and marketing. The sales and marketing include cold calling, email pitches, telephones surveys, lead generation and appointment setting. Other areas of call centres are intellectual property research and documentation, legal services, medical transcription, payroll maintenance and other transaction processing, product development, publishing, research and analysis. bdnews
