 Kathmandu, April, 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) Nepal's Maoist party has come third in the first constituency results to be declared after Thursday's elections. In Kathmandu's constituency number one, the Maoist candidate polled under 4,000 votes. The Nepali Congress candidate won, securing more than 14,000 votes. Analysts say that although this is an early first result, it offers an insight into the popularity of Maoists. Nepal held its first polls since 1999 following the Maoists' decision to quit their armed struggle in 2006. The polls are for an assembly that is expected to re-write Nepal's constitution and abolish its monarchy. Results for Kathmandu constituency one were declared quickly because it was the only constituency which used electronic voting machines. Election official Prakash Man Singh said that the Maoists trailed behind the Nepali Congress candidate and the UML, a centre-left party which polled more than 6,000 votes. Surprised The popularity of the Maoist party is being tested at the ballot for the first time in this election. Results for all the 240 constituencies are expected over the next 10 days. Officials say that polling has been postponed in 10 constituencies. Many Nepalis and international observers have been surprised that Thursday's nationwide elections, just two years after the end of the Maoist insurgency, took place considerably more peacefully than past votes of the 1990s. There were four election-related deaths in the troubled south-eastern region. The Election Commission said there was a turnout of 60%, with polling cancelled due to malpractice in just 33 polling stations out of 21,000. King Gyanendra seized absolute power in 2005 but was forced to give up his authoritarian rule the following year after weeks of pro-democracy protests. He has since lost all his powers and his command of the army. It is hoped the election will consolidate the end of the Maoist insurgency, which stopped two years ago, says the BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathman
