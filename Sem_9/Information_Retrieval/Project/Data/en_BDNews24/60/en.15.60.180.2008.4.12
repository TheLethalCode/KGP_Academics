 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)The long-delayed Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant in Pabna will be ready to operate in a few years, seminar speakers said Saturday, presenting a picture of atomic power as an unsung source of alternative energy. Speaking at a seminar at the Atomic Energy Commission, the chief adviser's special assistant in for science and technology Manik Lal Samaddar said: "It is the time for Bangladesh to think of alternative energy." "Power shortage has become a major obstacle to all our development initiatives and to normal life." "Atomic energy will open the door to new development opportunities," the special aide said. Speaking as chief guest at the seminar titled 'Atomic energy is the inevitable power source for Bangladesh', Manik said: "There is no dearth of policy and law in the country. But those need to be effective. To solve our power crisis, energy has to be generated using atomic power." "It brings hope for the country that Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant will soon be completed." Secretary of the power, energy and mineral sources ministry Sheikh Wahiduzzaman said the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant project in Iswardi, Pabna, had been kick-started again under the present caretaker government with the chief adviser at its head. "We hope that the work of setting up the plant will be completed in a few years." Rooppur Nuclear Power Project was originally conceived in 1961 in view of the growing need for electricity against inadequate energy resources. Different companies from USA, USSR, and Europe conducted a number of feasibility studies on the project. Later, a site was selected at Rooppur in Pabna and the executive committee of the National Economic Council approved the project on many occasions  but the project has stalled on as many occasions. Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr Shafiqul Islam Bhuiyan presented the key-note paper of the seminar. President of the association Dr SM Imamul Haque presided. bdnews24.
