<TITLE> Europe shares fall on bank sector fears, eye ECB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell by midday on Thursday as Britain cut rates but said it expected inflation to rise, and investors fretted about more losses in a financial sector that has been battered by the global credit crunch. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.4 percent at 1,291 points by 1107 GMT, with investors unnerved by news that Lehman Brothers had liquidated three floundering investment funds. The Bank of England cut rates as expected by 25 basis points but said it expected inflation to rise this year, and investors awaited a European Central Bank decision at 1145 GMT. The ECB is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at 4 percent. The euro hitting a record high against the dollar and oil at an all-time peak also weighed on the broader market, though heavyweight energy stocks gained. Lehman traded 4 percent lower in Frankfurt, and European banks were the worst performing sector, with the DJ Stoxx European banking index trading 2 percent lower. Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Societe Generale and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 3.3-3.8 percent. "You can expect years of deleveraging as leverage in the financial sector is very high," said Teun Draaisma, strategist at Morgan Stanley, adding that he expected markets to stay bumpy for a while. "On a 12-month view, earnings expectations are too high, but equities are quite cheap and there's no massive downside. We expect volatile markets that won't go anywhere for the next year," he said. Mining stocks slipped after BHP Billiton said it was unaware of any plans by China to buy shares in it. BHP fell 4.3 percent while Antofagasta and Rio Tinto fell more than 3 percent. British Energy was the top gainer in Europe, up 5.3 percent after sources close to the matter said Germany's RWE and Britain's Centrica had both made indicative bids for the group. All three companies declined to comment. Oil was the top-performing sector, mirroring a 2 percent rise in crude oil futures to $112 a barrel after a sharp fall in U.S. crude stocks. BP rose 0.9 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gained 0.3 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1 percent, while Germany's DAX and France's CAC lost 1.5 percent. ECB SET TO STAY PUT The ECB is expected to keep euro zone rates unchanged, citing persistent inflationary concerns, and the focus will shift quickly to an ECB news conference at 1230 GMT. The ECB has constantly reiterated its mandate to keep inflationary pressures under control, even if the risks to growth are skewed to the downside, which equity investors have taken to mean no rate cuts will be forthcoming. Analysts say it needs to be a mixture of slow growth and low inflation to force the bank to move. Morgan Stanley's Draaisma said nobody expected the ECB to cut rates now but added that the bank may move towards the end of the year. "If growth and inflation slow down as we expect, it will open the door for cuts," he said. "They may cut by Q4." ING analysts said in a note: "The ECB is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 4 percent. With inflation at 3.5 percent, we may see ECB President (Jean-Claude) Trichet adopting a tougher stance." The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost about 13 percent this year, weighed down largely by a slide in shares of financials, many of which have racked up billions of dollars in losses linked to the deteriorating U.S. housing market. Among the largest negative pulls on the market were Daimler which fell 3.1 percent, and Volvo, which fell 4.7 percent after trading ex-divide
