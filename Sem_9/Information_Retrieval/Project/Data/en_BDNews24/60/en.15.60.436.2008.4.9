 London, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new batch of concerns about huge losses in the global financial sector hit stocks on Wednesday, after warnings from a leading US savings group and the IMF's prediction of a total $1 trillion bill. The dollar was also weaker and the British pound hit an all time low against the euro ahead of an expected interest rate cut. World stock markets fell on worries about the financial sector and growing angst about future earnings. Wall Street was shaken overnight by news that Washington Mutual Inc, the largest US savings and loan, expects a large quarterly loss. The lender also slashed its dividend even as it received a $7 billion capital infusion. The International Monetary Fund also said on Tuesday that turmoil in credit markets could now spread to other mortgage and corporate debt markets with losses possibly approaching $1 trillion and with risks of spillovers to emerging economies. Separately, Group of Seven powers were set to endorse a series of recommendations from the Financial Stability Forum to improve practices by banks and financial markets in the wake of the subprime market collapse. A European G7 source confirmed a report in the Wall Street Journal listing a series of plans. European shares fell, partly led by financials, notably UK mortgage lender HBOS, which slipped on a brokerage downgrade. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.6 percent. "If you look across the whole of the equity universe, every market looks softer," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. "Many of us have been saying for some time that the earnings numbers that that are currently being priced in are way too optimistic." Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average fell 1.1 percent as fresh worries about the US economy hit exporters. "Even if you suppose the worst is over for financials, the worst time for the economy and corporate earnings is still to come," said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist of the equity management department at Daiwa SB Investments. The Nikkei shed 138.54 points to 13,111.89. The broader TOPIX index declined 1.5 percent or 19.79 points to 1,262.90. WEAK DOLLAR, STRONGER BONDS The dollar slipped on increasing evidence that the Federal Reserve is worried that problems in the financial market may trigger more weakness in the U.S. economy. Sterling, meanwhile, hit a record low against the euro, pressured lower after a fall in UK consumer morale underscored escalating troubles in the economy, and bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates on Thursday. The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.5717, pulling further away from around $1.5500 hit last week. The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 102.25 yen, reversing earlier gains that took it near a one-month high. The euro pushed up to 80 pence early in the European session, before pulling back slightly. Euro zone government bond prices generally rose, squeezing yields lower as the European and Asian shares fell. In the cash market, the 10-year Bund traded around the psychologically key 4 percent level and was last yielding 3.996 percent, around three basis points less than late Tuesday. The two-year Schatz yielded 3.487 percent, 4 basis points less than the previous session's late leve
