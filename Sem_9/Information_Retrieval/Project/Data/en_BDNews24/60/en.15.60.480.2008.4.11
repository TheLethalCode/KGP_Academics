 SOFIA, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgaria's government won a no-confidence vote on Friday over its response to corruption and crime, but the European Union is so worried about the issues that the country could face sanctions and lose millions in aid. The Socialist-led coalition government survived the opposition challenge with 117 deputies voting against the motion and 82 for it. A junior coalition partner abstained to show it was fed up with sluggish reforms. But despite the domestic victory, the government faces broader challenges from the European Union, which has called on Sofia to take "urgent action" following the killings of an author of books on the Bulgarian mafia and the chief of an energy company. Bulgaria is the poorest EU member, and reforms have stalled since it joined the bloc early last year. The EU has indicated it is running out of patience with Sofia's procrastination and approach to widespread graft and organised crime. "In Bulgaria, crime and corruption have (become) intertwined with the state. We have to see an end to that, we have to see decisive measures and people sent to jail," an EU diplomat said. Tensions within the three-party ruling coalition, exposed in Friday's vote, have exacerbated tensions. "The government has so far ignored all warnings from Brussels. It risks a very serious political crisis, plummeting popularity and snap elections," said Rumiana Bachvarova, political analyst with polling agency Market Links. Bulgaria also risks losing millions in aid from the bloc, which can recommend sanctions against it. Graft and crime cost over 1 billion euros ($1.58 billion) a year in former communist Bulgaria, according to surveys. There have been more than 150 gangland assassinations since 2001, but Sofia has failed to convict a single suspect and has not charged any senior officials with graft. The government's image suffered a severe blow when high-ranking police officials were arrested last month and accused by prosecutors of phone tapping. A report by the parliamentary security commission said this week that police officials had passed classified information to drug traffickers linked to militant groups. To appease angry voters and restore the EU's trust, the ruling coalition has approved a plan to rid the scandal-tainted interior ministry of corrupt officials and reform police. But the centre-right NDSV party of former king Simeon Saxe-Coburg, a junior partner in the government, and the rightist opposition, which submitted the no-confidence motion, said the reform plan was not enough and that Interior Minister Rumen Petkov had to go. Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev has refused to fire Petk
