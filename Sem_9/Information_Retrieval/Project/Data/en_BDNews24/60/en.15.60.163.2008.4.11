 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com) Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh Friday protested British home secretary Jacqui Smith's remark that terrorists in Bangladesh and those in the UK had links. In a statement, Jamaat assistant secretary general Muhammad Qamaruzzaman said that he was surprised at the government "nonchalance" to what he called the objectionable remark. The British home minister at a press conference Wednesday at the residence of the British high commissioner in Dhaka said: "There arepotentially or actuallylinks between the terrorist groups in Bangladesh and the UK. That's the reason why I think we have a shared interest in tackling terrorism." Qamaruzzaman said the government had accepted her 'unjust and baseless' remarks that meant it was trapped in a 'conspiracy' to prove Bangladesh to be a 'failed, dysfunctional and terrorist state'. Smith arrived in Dhaka Tuesday on a two-day visit. bdnew
