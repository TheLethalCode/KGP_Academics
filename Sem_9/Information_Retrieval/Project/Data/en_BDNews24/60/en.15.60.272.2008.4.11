<TITLE> `Irreplaceable' Berlusconi set to `save' Italy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If he is looking and sounding tired a few days before Italy's election, Silvio Berlusconi blames it on a long, gruelling campaign. At 71, the tycoon says he has lost none of the fighting spirit with which he burst into politics in the early 1990s, as he saw it, to save Italy from incompetents and communists. "They welcome me like a rock star," he said in a newspaper interview after addressing adoring fans. Sporting a new open-collar look to complement his hair implants and facelifts, Berlusconi, prime minister briefly in 1994 and then for five years from 2001, says he has nothing to fear from his centre-left rival two decades his junior. "The truth is he remains a communist," he said of Walter Veltroni, the Rome mayor who heads the new Democratic Party. This new centre-left force excludes the radical left that was part of Romano Prodi's government which imploded in January. Although he recently fell from the top of Italy's rich list to third place, Berlusconi remains extremely wealthy and manages to combine a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at $9.4 billion with a common touch. "I have too much esteem for Italians' intelligence to think they could be such assholes ("coglioni") as to vote against their own interests," he told a conference before the April 2006 election he lost by a tiny margin. This time the polls are in his favour, giving his People of Freedom party a 5-9 percentage point lead. Berlusconi's political incorrectness, which turns off some Italians and makes him a figure of fun for many people watching from abroad, is a big part of the charm which helped him win two of the four elections he has contested. IRREPLACEABLE Saluting "the menopause section" of a rally -- seats mostly occupied by older female supporters -- and urging women to cook for his party's candidates to keep their strength up, he won applause, not boos. When he told a young woman on a TV show that the best way to secure her financial future was to marry his son, the left was outraged, but the woman said she would vote for him. Much of his appeal lies in his image as a self-made man. In a country where success often depends on friends in high places, Berlusconi made a property fortune then built a media empire, creating Italy's only major private TV firm, Mediaset. In the early 1990s he created a centre-right party which rapidly filled part of the void left by the implosion of the Christian Democrats, who had dominated post-war Italy. Detractors say he used his first spell as prime minister in 1994 to protect himself from legal suits and further his business interests. He returned in 2001 to serve a full term in office, the first time that had been achieved in 50 years. Proudly allying with U.S. President George W. Bush's 'war on terror', Berlusconi was criticised by analysts who hoped to see the entrepreneur take more steps to liberalise the economy. Critics suspect he would use another term in office to protect Mediaset from moves to break the near duopoly on TV advertising it shares with state broadcaster RAI and protect his business interests, family and friends. Analysts say Berlusconi might have his sights higher than the prime ministership. His comments this week suggesting that President Giorgio Napolitano might consider stepping down were interpreted as a hint that Berlusconi would like to take his place, as the personification of the Italian nation. Berlusconi denied such ambitions and remains the only person capable of uniting the centre right, an often uneasy alliance of economic liberals, post-fascists and northern separatists. "On the centre right, unfortunately, there is still no one else but me who can hold together all the moderates, liberals, Catholics, secularists and reformists that make up the People of Freedom." he told Il Mattino daily. "I am, in a word, irreplaceabl
