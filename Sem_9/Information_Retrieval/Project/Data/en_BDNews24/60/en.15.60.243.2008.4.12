 BANGKOK, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand will take appropriate measures to ensure the Olympic Torch Relay in Bangkok goes smoothly next week, Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama said on Saturday, adding politics had no place in the games. Newspapers reported the Chinese embassy had asked the Thai government for tighter security measures to fend off possible protests by pro-Tibet activists during the relay on April 19. "A peaceful protest can be done in accordance with the constitution," Noppadon said in statement. "Thai authorities will undertake appropriate measures to ensure that the Olympic Torch Relay in Thailand can proceed smoothly." "Thailand believes that politics should not be linked with the Olympic Games," Noppadon said. About 100 activists are expected to join a protest along the relay route, each carrying a sign bearing the name of Tibetan dissidents arrested and jailed in last month's crackdown, the Nation newspaper reported. The Olympic flame, travelling under the "light the passion, share the dream" motto, will visit 21 cities internationally and every Chinese province, including Tibet, before arriving at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony on August 8. Thousands of protesters, angry about China's crackdown on Tibet and its human rights record, tried to disrupt the torch's passage through London last week. Last month, a small group of pro-Tibet activists tried to stop the Olympic flame from reaching the Athens stadium where it was due to be handed to Chinese officials but they were quickly removed by Greek police
