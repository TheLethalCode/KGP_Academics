 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks finished almost flat on the last day of the week, with investors buying and selling evenly. Turnover and the trading volume, however, witnessed a slight fall from Wednesday. Investors across Thursday's trading participated in more or less even-buying and -selling of almost all the sectors especially the market favourites like banks, pharmaceuticals and chemicals and non-bank financial institutions. Most mutual funds witnessed heavy buying while power companies saw sell-offs. "Even buying and selling dominated today's (Thursday) trading which started the previous day. For a second day, we dealt with equal buying and selling orders from clients," an official of brokerage house IDLC Securities told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, market observers cited the continued trend as harmless saying the continued balanced buying and sell offs was creating opportunities of market correction. "The trend will not pose any threat but was rather enabling the windows of price corrections, which was really essential for the market," DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com.
