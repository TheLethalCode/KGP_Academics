<TEXT>
 Nabanga, Sudan, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uganda's fugitive rebel leader Joseph Kony has arrived near the remote Sudan-Congo border to sign a peace deal on Thursday to end one of Africa's longest wars, sources involved in the negotiations said. They said the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) commander met family members on Thursday who were flown in by mediators at a forest clearing in Ri-Kwangba on the frontier. The relatives included a sister, an uncle and an ex-wife. "Kony is at Ri-Kwangba with his bodyguards. He called for his family members to go there," one of the sources said. The presence of the elusive rebel leader was a major boost for long-running talks mediated by south Sudanese Vice President Riek Machar, who arrived by helicopter in Nabanga, a Sudanese village close to Ri-Kwangba. Ugandan government negotiators also flew in. But the signing of a final agreement has been delayed before, and complicating matters further are International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants for Kony and two of his top deputies. Prosecutors in The Hague have accused them of committing multiple war crimes during their two-decade insurgency including rape, murder and the abduction of thousands of children. Fearing arrest and extradition, the three men never appeared at the discussions in south Sudan's capital Juba, instead staying hidden at camps deep in Garamba Forest in Democratic Republic of Congo's lawless northeast. ARREST WARRANTS The LRA says Kony will sign on Thursday -- but that it will never disarm until the ICC drops its indictments. Under the terms of the peace agreement, the rebels would have a month to gather at Ri-Kwangba for demobilisation. So even if he does sign, Kony is expected to vanish back into the bush. Meanwhile, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is due to ink the deal at a separate ceremony in Juba on April 15. His government has said it will only call for the ICC warrants to be lifted after a final deal is reached. It was not clear whether that meant the rebels have to disarm first too. The ICC has said its warrants for Kony and the two other commanders -- Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen -- remain active. But the UN Security Council could ask it to put them on hold if there was a real chance for peace. Kampala and the rebels have already signed agreements setting up a special division of Uganda's High Court to deal with war crimes. ICC supporters say that only a judicial process delivering stiff jail terms for grave crimes is an acceptable alternative. But the court does not want to be seen as the last barrier to peace if talks look like ending a war that killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted 2 million more in northern Uganda and ravaged neighbouring parts of south Sudan and eastern Con
