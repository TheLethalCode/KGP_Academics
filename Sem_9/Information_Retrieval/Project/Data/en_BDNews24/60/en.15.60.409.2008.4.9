<TITLE> Sultan unlikely to contest BFF election </TITLE>

 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan is unlikely to contest the upcoming BFF election scheduled for April 28. "I earlier said that I was not interested in regaining the post of the BFF, and still not interested in contesting the BFF poll," Sultan told a press conference Wednesday. Sultan, however, said he did never say that he was not going to contest the election. Sultan held the press conference to explain his successes and failures during his five-year stint including one-year extension by the Asian Football Confederation. On a query, the BFF boss said that he had requested former general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal and acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu to attend the press conference, but both declined. Sultan, however, said he was satisfied by 51 percent in terms of his activities he had carried out, and he is going in the right direction to fulfil the objectives. He claimed that he had surpassed all previous BFF presidents in terms of service. "It was my failure not to organise an international tournament. It was also failure of the government as I was part of the then government," said the former BNP lawmaker. Sultan, however, wants to leave some views for his successor so that he or the executive committee should know the kind of step needed to take football forward. The well-known organiser said his committee enjoyed much liberty and democracy and that is why a bit of misunderstanding occurred among the members some time. He also said that they could not hold some meets in time due to financial problems. Sultan thinks, to change the standard of football, it needs to generate its own finance at the club levels as the clubs run on donations from different political persons and businessmen.
