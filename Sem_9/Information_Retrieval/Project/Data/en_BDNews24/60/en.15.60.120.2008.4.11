<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)  After three seasons, Sonargaon Cricketers were relegated to the First Division Cricket League when they conceded a massive 91-run defeat to Young Pegasus in the last match of the relegation league of the Premier Division League Friday. Chasing a moderate 209 set by Pegasus, Sonargaon were bundled out for 118 in 34.1 overs in the face of superb bowling from Muktar Ali (3/20) and Jubaer Ahmed (3/50), who shared six wickets to wipe the opponent innings. Sonargaon were reduced to three for three inside three overs with top three batsmen returning to the dressing room with ducks and never recovered the damage. Earlier, opener Rabiul Islam (40) gave a fine start to Young Pegasus, who decided to bat first winning the toss at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. One-down batsman Hafiz topscored with 73 as Pegasus went beyond the 200-mark. Elias Sunny and M Azim grabbed three wickets each, giving away 33 and 40 runs respectively.
