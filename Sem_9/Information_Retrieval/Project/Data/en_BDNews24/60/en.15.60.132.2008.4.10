 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)Shahida Majumder, wife of former Awami League lawmaker Kamal Ahmed Majumder, was freed from prison Thursday, hours after a Dhaka court granted her bail in a corruption case. Judge Tanjina Ismail of the Special Judge's Court-6 passed the bail order. "Shahida Majumder was released around 6:30pm," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com by phone. Shahida surrendered to court on Tuesday after she was accused by the Anticorruption Commission of earning wealth illegally and concealing wealth information. In a bail prayer, defence counsels Sheikh Baharul Islam and Emdad Hossain told the court that Shahida is not the main accused in the case. There is a provision for granting bail to a woman in a case filed under emergency powers rules, the lawyers argued in the prayer. State counsel AFM Golam Fattah opposed the move for bail. The judge granted bail to Shahida on a Tk 2 lakh bond. ACC deputy director Morshed Alam filed the case against Kamal Majumder and his wife with Ramna Police Station on Sept 24 last year. The case alleged that Kamal Majumder had earned property worth Tk 10 crore beyond his legally recognised income. He allegedly concealed information about Tk 7.19 crore. Allegations were brought against Shahida of assisting her husband in earning the wealth. Kamal Majumder is now in jail. bdnew
