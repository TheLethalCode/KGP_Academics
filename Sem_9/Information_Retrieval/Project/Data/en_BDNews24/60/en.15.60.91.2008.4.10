 HEZUO, China, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The extent of protests by Tibetans in China's northwestern Gansu province surprised authorities despite preparations for unrest, a Chinese official said. Mao Shengwu, head of Gannan prefecture, said 432 monks and ordinary citizens were in detention there after a week of protests in which 94 people, almost all police or paramilitary, were injured. Tibetan monks and civilians clashed with security forces in the grasslands of Gansu and neighbouring Sichuan and Qinghai, after riots on March 14 in Lhasa, when Buddhist monks' protests gave way to deadly rioting. China has blamed Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and his associates for inciting the monk-led protests that and spilled into nearby provinces with large Tibetan populations. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, has denied the accusation. China sees the March 10 anniversary of the start of that revolt as a possible trigger for unrest among Tibetans. China says 19 people died in the Lhasa violence, but representatives of the Dalai Lama say some 140 people died in the unrest across Tibet and nearby areas. "Overall, we were ready, especially by March 10, we had prepared. We knew the Dalai clique might organise something and how far it could spread," Mao told journalists on a state-sponsored trip to see the aftermath of the riots. "But we were also surprised by the number of places, and the severity," Mao added. Later he said: "We need to do a better job in strengthening public security and control, especially over risky populations and monasteries," he added. In Gannan, over 2,200 people surrendered to the police, and over 1,800 were then freed for their "tiny" role, he said. In Lhasa, officials pledged leniency for those who turned themselves in. TRAINING FOR RIOTS? Mao showed a video of demonstrations from several towns. In some, crowds of Tibetans chanted slogans and waved banners in front of ranks of riot police, while others showed the destruction of police facilities, government buildings and a shopping mall. Authorities were still trying to determine who had coordinated the unrest, Mao said. Strips of cloth on some demonstrators' arms or foreheads helped prove it was coordinated within China, and with "Tibetan separatists" abroad, he said. Armbands were not clearly evident among the variously dressed crowds in the video that was shown to reporters. "The people who were arrested were coordinated and given specific targets, but we don't know if they received any professional training, whether here or abroad," Mao said, when asked about a video clip in which four men rapidly overturned a pickup truck and immediately set it on fire. He said it could not be a coincidence that protests spread so quickly from Lhasa to Gansu, a heavily Tibetan and Muslim area hard hit by famines and purges under the rule of Mao Zedong. The unrest was the worst since Deng Xiaoping's reforms of the early 1980s, Mao said, adding Gannan had also faced disturbances in 1988 and 1959 sparked by unrest in Lhasa. RETURNING TO CALM Commercial activity had returned to normal along the main street of Xiahe, in Gansu province, the site of the major Labrang Monastery, although broken windows were everywhere. There was no sign of the armed police nor the steel fence that a Reuters witness saw cordoning off the monastery last month. On Wednesday, a group of about 15 young monks staged a brief demonstration with a banned Tibetan flag in front of a group of journalists on a state-sponsored media tour of the monastery. Chinese officials said the monks were not representative of the 1,000 monks at Labrang, an important regional centre founded in 1709. It had boasted 3,000 monks in the early 1950s. In nearby Hezuo, local residents said calm quickly returned after paramilitary police cordoned off the monastery. There was no sign of tension, although journalists were trailed. Mao said there was no timetable yet for reopening the region to foreign tourists or journalists. About a tenth of Gannan's revenues last year came from tourism, both Chinese and forei
