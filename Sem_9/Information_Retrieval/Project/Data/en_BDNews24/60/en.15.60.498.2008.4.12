 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com) Awami League has picked seven senior party leaders for the next pre-dialogue session with the government, an AL leader said Saturday. The seven representatives will take part in the next round of informal talks with the government ahead of the official dialogue. "We are waiting for a signal from the government," said acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. "We will join the talks after schedule and venue is set," he told reporters after a meeting at the residence of acting AL president Zillur Rahman's in Gulshan. The eight party representatives, headed by Zillur Rahman, include presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. Ashraful hoped AL leaders would attend the final dialogue alongside party president Sheikh Hasina. The acting general secretary voiced his concern over Friday's violence at Baitul Mukarram Mosque and the attack on Hathazari Police Station by Madrasa students. He blamed Jamaat-e-Islami for the incidents, and demanded the government take active measures against those responsible. "Jamaat-e-Islami is linked with the incidents. Some eight to ten organisations that have direct connection with Jamaat-e-Islami were responsible. Two Jamaat Rokans (leaders of the highest level) were also involved with the incident," he claimed. "The fundamentalists used the mosque as a front for attacking police and journalists." "The public might suspect that the government is supporting them, as it is not taking any effective measures against them even after such a major incident amid the state of emergency," Ashraful said. The AL leader reiterated his party's demand for releasing party president Sheikh Hasina and for her proper medical treatment. "Sheikh Hasina will not escape anywhere. She will face her legal battle after completion of medical treatment in the US." Ashraful expressed his deep concern over the spiralling price of essentials. "Our presidium member Motia Chowdhury could not buy rice at an OMS even after queuing for over five hours." He blamed the government's indecisiveness for this miserable condition. "This indecisiveness might cause major repurcussions in future," Ashraful said. bdnews24.
