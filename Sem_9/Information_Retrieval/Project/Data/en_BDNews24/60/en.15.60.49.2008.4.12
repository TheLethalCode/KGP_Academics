 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak has termed the lack of action against the hardliners responsible for Friday's violence at Baitul Mukarram Mosque "a double-faced policy of the government". He told reporters Saturday that he held "anti-liberation elements" responsible for the incidents on Thursday and Friday. Speaking as he came to express solidarity with a hunger-strike programme at Bangabandhu Avenue, Razzak said: "It was anti-liberation elements that desecrated the mosque, burnt the mosque carpet, looted the thana (Hathazari Police Station) but they are not being arrested. No case is being filed." "On the other hand pro-liberation leaders and workers of Awami League have been arrested under emergency powers rules. This is the government's double-faced policy." The party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam also voiced his concern to reporters, after a meeting at the residence of acting AL president Zillur Rahman's in Gulshan, over the violence at Baitul Mukarram Mosque and the attack on Hathazari Police Station by madrasa students. He blamed Jamaat-e-Islami for the incidents, and demanded the government take active measures against those responsible. . "Jamaat-e-Islami is linked with the incidents. Some eight to ten organisations that have direct connection with Jamaat-e-Islami were responsible. Two Jamaat Rokans (leaders of the highest level) were also involved with the incident," he claimed. "The fundamentalists used the mosque as a front for attacking police and journalists." "The public might suspect that the government is supporting them, as it is not taking any effective measures against them even after such a major incident amid the state of emergency," Ashraful said. Jatiya Sramik League organised Saturday's hunger-strike programme to press home its demand for the release of party president Sheikh Hasina. bdnews24
