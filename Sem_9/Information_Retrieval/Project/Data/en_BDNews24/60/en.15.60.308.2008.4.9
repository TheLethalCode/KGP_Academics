 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government has designed tight security measures to ensure peaceful celebrations countrywide on Pahela Boishakh, the Bengali New Year, a government official said Wednesday. As many as 12,234 security personnel from the Rapid Action Battalion and Bangladesh Police will be fanning out across the country on Apr 14, with 2,500 being deployed for Dhaka city alone, home secretary Md Abdul Karim told reporters after a meeting on law and order at the home ministry. BDR, Ansar and Detective Branch personnel will also be on duty at major celebration venues on the day, he said. Home adviser MA Matin presided over the meeting attended by the inspector general of police and chiefs of the different law enforcing agencies. "We are taking security measures to ensure that the Bangla New Year be celebrated peacefully," Karim said. The government has planned ahead to avoid the problems it faced last year in maintaining law and order, he said. "Restrictions will be imposed on traffic movement in the capital city ahead of the celebration." The home secretary said all entrances of Ramna Park in the capital city would be closed for ordinary members of the public on the eve of Pahela Baishakh (Apr 13), with revellers being allowed to enter the park from 5.00am on the day (Apr 14). Eight security check posts would be set up in the park, with twenty-four close circuit televisions being installed in the park and neighbouring areas. Cinema halls of the country would also be under a security blanket, Karim added. After the meeting, RAB director general Hassan Mahmood Khandker said members of his force would cooperate with police in district towns. bdnews24.
