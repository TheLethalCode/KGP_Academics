 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and India signed the final agreement Thursday for the long-awaited Dhaka-Kolkata train service, to start running on Pahela Baishakh, a senior ministry official said. Communications secretary Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman told bdnews24.com that he and Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakraborty had penned a final agreement at the ministry Thursday to launch the new service. The representatives of the two countries termed the signing 'historic'. The passenger rail link between the two neighbouring countries resumes after 43 years. The last passenger train between India and Bangladesh ran in March of 1965. The Indian high commissioner told reporters after the signing: "The agreement was the result of sincere efforts by the two countries over a long time." "The signing of the treaty ushered in a new era in communication within the region," he said, adding development was not possible without communication. "The agreement has been signed as a result of sincere efforts by the caretaker government and overall cooperation of the concerned officials," Mahbubur Rahman said. "It has paved the way to revive the previous potentials of the two countries that will not only contribute in the development of the two countries but all countries of the region." Mahbubur said one train would leave from Dhaka Cantonment station for Chitpur in Kolkata at 8.30 am on Apr 14, while another train would depart from Kolkata for Dhaka at 7.30 am the same day. A ticket booth for the service has been set up at Kamalapur Railway Station. After the debut on Pahela Baishakh the regular service will run on Saturdays and Sundays. On visa formalities, Chakraborty said: "We are prompt in giving visas. Our people work even on Friday and Saturday. But we have some shortcomings. We are trying to overcome them." The charge for chair in an air conditioned coach is $12.00 for a one way ticket, plus Tk 300 for travel tax; value added tax will also be charged. A non-AC coach seat will cost $8.00 plus travel tax and VAT. A sleeping berth will cost $20.00 plus taxes. The agreement has fixed an exchange rate of Tk 70 to $1.00 for the first three months. The travel tax for children under five years old is set at Tk 150. Authorities have taken steps to ensure security of the passengers, with eight armed guards to be employed at all times inside the train. The Bangladesh train will carry 418 passengers, while the Indian train accommodate 360. Every passenger will have to walk through a metal detector gate prior to boarding the train, with their luggage also being examined by metal detector. Adult passengers will have a luggage allowance of 35 kg, while children will be allowed to carry 20 kg. Extra charge will apply for overweight luggage. Discussion on the train service between the two countries began in July last year. An experimental train run was carried out in August. The service was scheduled to start from October, but was stalled due to a number of disagreements including the setting up of boxed fences along the no man's land at the border area. The duration of the final agreement is three years, after which there is a provision to renew. The agreement may also be cancelled by either side on three months notice. The two governments may also amend the treaty within the three years by mutual agreement. bdnews24.com/ahd/eh
