 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful said the team missed the presence of at least another frontline paceman in the first day-night ODI of the Bank Alfalah Cup in Lahore on Tuesday. The Tigers were humbled by 152 runs after two power-cut related delays at the Gaddafi Stadium had given them a revised target of 282 in 39 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis method. Pakistan had made 322/5 on the back of a 103-ball 108 from Mohammad Yousuf and 85 by captain Shoaib Malik after opting to bat first despite struggling early on when new ball bowlers Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Farhad Reza had reduced them to 70/3 inside 20 overs. Reza (2/41) and Mortaza (2/52) were the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers on a pitch offering encouragement to seamers but the team had no pace support to fall back on with Shahadat Hossain and Syed Rasel left out. With his second scalp Mortaza playing in his 78th ODI, became the second Bangladeshi bowler to take 100 ODI wickets after Mohammad Rafique. He is also the quickest to reach the mark. "Everyone looks for two skills in a player these days, like Farhad Reza, who does both. But yes we missed one seam bowler today. Mortaza and Reza bowled well for us in the first 20 overs but after that we missed a bowler," said Ashraful, according to the tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. The captain also lamented the batting effort. "Our batsmen didn't play well today. We didn't stick to our team rules and got out to rash shots. It is difficult chasing over 300 but we just didn't bat well on a good batting wicket." Coach Jamie Siddons said going in with one specialist paceman (Mortaza) was a gamble that did not pay off. "We tried it against Ireland, but it backfired here," Ashraful expressed his disappointment at the floodlight failures during Bangladesh's innings that cost nearly 50 minutes of playing time from two stoppages. "It is unfortunate that this has happened at an international venue," said Ashraful. The Bangladesh team left Lahore for Faisalabad today morning by road. Training is optional for the day with full practice scheduled tomorrow ahead of the second ODI of the 5-match series on Frida
