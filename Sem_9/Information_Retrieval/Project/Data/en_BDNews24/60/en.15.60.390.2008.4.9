<TITLE> Chavez to nationalize Venezuela's top steelmaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CARACAS, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela will take control of the country's largest steelmaker in the second major takeover of foreign businesses in a week as President Hugo Chavez resumes his socialist drive to nationalize key industries. Just days after Chavez announced the takeover of the cement industry, his government said on Wednesday that steelmaker Ternium Sidor would fall back into state hands, sending the Argentine-controlled company's shares tumbling. Chavez increased state control of swathes of the oil-rich economy in a multibillion dollar campaign last year but had spent recent months focusing on day-to-day issues like crime and trash collection after voters rejected his push for wider powers in a December referendum. Nerio Fuentes, the leader of Ternium Sidor's union, said workers were pleased with the decision, taken after months of short strikes in a drawn out labor dispute with the company. "We are here celebrating in an assembly the decision that Sidor returns to state hands," Fuentes told Reuters by telephone. A government minister who asked not to be named confirmed the nationalization plan. Parent company Ternium's New York-listed shares fell 10.7 percent to $34.54. Ternium Sidor published a letter it had sent to Chavez after the nationalization ruling pleading with him to intervene to find a "constructive solution." Chavez made a series of threats to take over the steel producer last year, at a time when he was in the midst of a campaign that took control of oil projects and telecommunications companies. He renewed his nationalization campaign last Thursday by ordering the takeover of the country's largest cement companies, which are all foreign run. CHAVEZ'S COMPLAINTS Chavez, who typically pays compensation to nationalized companies, has complained the steel and cement industries do not put a high enough priority on supplying the domestic market. Last year's nationalizations targeted U.S. and European companies but the latest takeovers have also included companies from Latin America. Ternium is a New York-listed company which is controlled by Argentine conglomerate Techint, based in Buenos Aires. Ternium's main operations are in Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina. For the fourth quarter of 2007, it reported a net profit of $221 million, up from $158 million in the same period of 2006. Its holdings include steelmakers Siderar in Argentina and recently acquired Grupo Imsa in Mexico. The Venezuelan operation is 60 percent controlled by Ternium, with the rest belonging to the state, workers and retirees.
