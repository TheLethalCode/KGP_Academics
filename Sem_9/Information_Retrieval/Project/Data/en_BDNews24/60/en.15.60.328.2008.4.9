 KANPUR, India, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A confident South Africa will push to clinch an Asian treble against an Indian team under siege in the third and final test starting on Friday. The tourists lead the series 1-0 after an innings and 90-run victory in the second test in Ahmedabad where superior bowling was backed up by their batsmen's mastery of India's spin attack. South Africa want to continue a run of success in the region following victory last year in Pakistan and a 2-0 rout of Bangladesh last month. India, traditionally a major force at home, have big injury problems. Captain Anil Kumble and teenage fast bowler Ishant Sharma face fitness tests while premier batsman Sachin Tendulkar has been ruled out. The pendulum has swung sharply since the first test in Chennai ended in a high-scoring draw. Graeme Smith can become the most successful South Africa test captain with a win after equalling the late Hansie Cronje's record of 27 victories in Ahmedabad. SPORTING PITCH Despite Green Park having hosted 12 draws in 19 tests, a lively pitch has left the Indian batsmen braced for South Africa's pace attack with uncertainty over how their own slow bowlers will perform. On an unusually green surface in Ahmedabad, India were routed for 76 runs in the first session and fast bowlers Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini shared 14 wickets in the match. The 24-year-old Steyn's match haul of eight wickets has lifted him to number one in the test bowling rankings alongside Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. While Indian confidence since opener Virender Sehwag smashed the fastest test triple hundred in Chennai has ebbed, South Africa have gone from strength to strength since Hashim Amla and Neil McKenzie notched centuries. AB de Villiers struck his maiden test double century (217 not out) and Jacques Kallis his 30th hundred in Ahmedabad. South Africa coach Mickey Arthur adopted Australia's tactics of fighting talk before a game when he warned that an underprepared pitch in Kanpur to suit the home spinners could backfire. "The obvious conclusion to be reached is that the pitch will be dry and grassless allowing (off spinner) Harbhajan Singh and Kumble to be used as attacking options," he wrote in a newspaper column after the second test. "However, I have a word of warning for the home side. I would hate to be an Indian batsman facing two men capable of bowling at 150 kilometres per hour on an underprepared surface." India could recall batsman Yuvraj Singh or Mohammad Kaif, on his home ground, in place of an extra bowler
