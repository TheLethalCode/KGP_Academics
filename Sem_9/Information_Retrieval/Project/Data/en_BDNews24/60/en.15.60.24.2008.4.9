<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Wednesday his party would not hold any formal or informal dialogue with the government if he was not allowed to meet detained party chairperson Khaleda Zia. "I won't hold any dialogue with the government without talking to Khaleda Zia," the secretary general, nominated by the chairperson told reporters at his NAM home. He also demanded the government hold elections prior to December, not in accordance with the roadmap. Denouncing the Election Commission he said: "The commission is cheating the people. The faction of the BNP it invited for dialogue was created by the government." The commission was responsible for appointing acting chairman (M Saifur Rahman) and acting secretary general (Hafizuddin Ahmed) and invited them to dialogue, Delwar said. "The EC factory created [the opposing faction]." In the reply to reporters' questions, he said: "I will take the final decision as the secretary general of the party. Nobody else has the right to do the job." The Khaleda-appointed secretary general said he would announce the next moves after consultation with the leaders and activists of the party. Delwar asked the government to release the two detained former prime ministers to overcome the present crisis of the country. He said the nation was currently encountering a "great disaster" for which he blamed the government, adding: "The government should declare the monga struck areas as disaster areas and offer emergency food relief there." He also demanded creation of a rationing system for people throughout the country. bdnews24
