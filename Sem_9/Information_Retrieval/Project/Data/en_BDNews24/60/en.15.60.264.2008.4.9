<TITLE> Bush endangering Colombia trade deal: US senator </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush has jeopardized chances for approval of a free trade agreement with Colombia by forcing a vote in Congress on the pact, a top Democratic senator said on Tuesday. "The president's unprecedented handling of the US-Colombia trade agreement raises extraordinary questions about how we can move this agreement forward," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said. Bush formally submitted legislation to implement the controversial agreement to Congress on Tuesday, and urged lawmakers to approve it as quickly as possible. "My administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on a bipartisan path forward to secure approval of this legislation," Bush said in a statement. Leading Democrats -- including presidential hopefuls Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- oppose the agreement because they say Colombia has not done enough to reduce killings of labor leaders and bring their murderers to justice. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi repeated on Monday that Democrats must see "sustained progress on the ground" in Colombia before they can support the pact. The Bush administration says the pact will level the playing field for U.S. companies doing business with Colombia and support a strong ally in a volatile region of the world. It also argues that Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has done much to make Colombia a safer place for labor groups. Colombia currently has duty-free access to the US market for most of its goods under a one-way trade program. The free trade pact requires Colombia to eliminate tariffs on US exports and make other business-friendly reforms. 'SHATTERED' TRUST Baucus, whose committee plays a key role in passage of trade legislation, said in a speech on the Senate floor the Colombia free trade pact was "a good agreement." But Bush "shattered" long-standing procedures by submitting the agreement to Congress before reaching a deal with lawmakers on legislation to implement the pact, he said. "By forcing Congress to consider this agreement now, the administration offends the trust of Congress," Baucus said. The Colombia free trade agreement is covered by legislation known as trade promotion authority, which requires Congress to to approve or reject any trade agreement within 90 legislative days of receiving it from the White House. Administration officials feared if they waited too long to submit the Colombia pact, Congress could avoid a vote by adjourning before the 90 days elapsed. "We waited until the last possible day -- which is today -- in order to send (the) Colombia (agreement to Congress). We calculated that based on the Sept. 26 target adjournment date (for Congress this year). We counted back 90 legislative days and that gets us to April 8th," Commerce Under Secretary Chris Padilla told reporters. TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE The White House also could have improved chances for the Colombia agreement by first reaching a deal with Congress on legislation to reform and expand "trade adjustment assistance" for workers who have lost their job because of imports or factories moving overseas, Baucus said. Essential reforms include doubling funds for worker retraining, expanding the program to workers in service industries and increasing a tax credit to help displaced workers pay for health insurance, he said. In a speech to the President's Export Council, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said the Bush administration was eager to work with Congress to reform trade adjustment assistance but did not indicate which, if any, Democratic proposals the Bush administration was willing to accept. Padilla said he believed sending the Colombia trade agreement to Congress "could actually energize the discussions on trade adjustment assistance, not put an end to them.
