 MIAMI, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The noted Colorado State University hurricane research team predicted on Wednesday that 15 tropical storms would form during the coming Atlantic storm season, of which eight would strengthen into hurricanes. The team founded by forecasting pioneer Bill Gray increased its outlook by two tropical storms and one hurricane over its last outlook issued in December due to improved conditions for storm development, including warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Atlantic. The Colorado State team, now led by Gray protege Phil Klotzbach, predicted in December that the six-month season beginning on June 1 would produce 13 tropical storms, of which seven would become hurricanes and three would be major hurricanes with winds of at least 111 mph (178 kph). The average hurricane season produces about 10 tropical storms and six hurricanes, but researchers believe the Atlantic is in a period of heightened storm activity that began around 1995 and could last 25 to 40 years. Last year, 15 tropical storms storms formed and six became hurricanes. Gray said recently that La Nina cool-water conditions in the Pacific and sea surface temperature increases of 0.3 to 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.5 to 0.9 degrees F) off Iberia and northwest Africa in the past few months could enhance hurricane formation during the coming season.
