<TITLE> Boeing delays 787 Dreamliner for third time </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boeing Co announced the third major delay on its 787 Dreamliner on Wednesday, citing slow progress on assembly and continuing problems with suppliers, putting the program about 15 months behind schedule. The delay was at the low end of Wall Street's expectations, as the U.S. plane maker had already admitted to problems with late redesigns of the revolutionary carbon-composite aircraft and the amount of work at its Everett, Washington, plant that should have been done by suppliers. Boeing shares, which have plunged 30 percent since last summer on worries about the 787, rose 4.7 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Executives are set to give a detailed update on the program in a conference call at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). "A major question will be whether this is the end of the delay announcements," JPMorgan analyst Joseph Nadol said in a research note. "This is where the details will matter, such as does it seem like management has its arms around all structural and certification issues that may now be emerging." The Chicago-based company, which vies with EADS unit Airbus for dominance of the commercial airplane market, pushed its first test flight target back by at least three months, and postponed first deliveries by about six months to give it more time to sort out production problems. Boeing said its full-year financial forecasts were unchanged for this year, and will provide a forecast for 2009 when it reports quarterly earnings on April 23. It pushed its target for the first test flight of the new plane to the fourth quarter of this year, as opposed to its previous target of late June 2008. It was originally planned for last summer. The first 787 delivery, to Japan's All Nippon Airways Co, will take place in the third quarter of next year, Boeing said, as opposed to its previous target of early 2009. The first 787 delivery was originally planned for May 2008. "Our revised schedule is built upon an achievable, high-confidence plan," Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Scott Carson said in a statement. Boeing said it now expects to deliver only 25 of the new planes by the end of 2009, less than a quarter of its previous plan to deliver 109. Wall Street analysts, who lost confidence in Boeing's predictions months ago, had expected between 10 and 45 deliveries. The plane maker also said its ramp up to full-rate production would be slower than previously planned, and two variants of the plane would be rescheduled. Under the new plan, the 787-9, a larger version of the standard 787-8, will be the first variant off the production line, with first deliveries in early 2012. The 787-3, a shorter range version, which was expected to enter service in 2010, will now be the second variant, with no date set for deliveries, Boeing said. Boeing shares rose $3.21 to $78.18 on the NYSE.
