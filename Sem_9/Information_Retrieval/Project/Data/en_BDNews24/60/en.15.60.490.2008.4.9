 KARACHI, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday that its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) had interviewed three Pakistan players in Lahore at the weekend. Cricket's ruling body said in a statement that the purpose of interviewing Danish Kaneria, Younis Khan and Umar Gul was to seek specific information and that "the ACSU has confirmed that this information was provided by the players." The ICC said the interviews "were not conducted in relation to any alleged breach of ICC Code of Conduct." The statement came a day after Pakistan team sources told Reuters that ACSU officials had interviewed banned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar over comments made last week in a television interview. Shoaib told the interviewer he had been offered money on several occasions to underperform but had rejected them all for the love of his country. Under the ICC Code of Conduct, a player who fails to report an approach to fix games or underperform to his captain, team manager, board or the ACSU can be banned for one to five year
