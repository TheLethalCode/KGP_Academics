<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengupta Friday asked the caretaker government to ensure AL president Sheikh Hasina's participation in dialogue. "To make the dialogue meaningful, Sheikh Hasina's presence must be ensured, which will be possible if the High Court gets back its authority for bail," said Suranjit as he inaugurated a 'signature campaign' on demand for the release of the detained former prime minister. Suranjit opened the campaign in the DCC ward No. 48 by signing the campaign poster in the morning. The fortnight-long signature campaign being conducted by the AL also demanded curbs on soaring consumer prices, an end to the state of emergency and national elections ahead of local polls. Commenting on informal talks with the government in the build-up to dialogue, the AL leader said: "We haven't received any official invitation to join further informal meetings. Why don't the advisers send a letter?" "If the government genuinely wants the dialogue to get through, let them make formal invitations to the political parties as soon as possible." "The government can also lift the embargo on indoor politics across the country if it is sincere." He hoped that the AL would emerge victorious securing two-third votes in the parliamentary polls if the elections are held fairly. bdnews
