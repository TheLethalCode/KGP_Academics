 LONDON, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European and major Asian stocks edged lower on Thursday while the dollar fell as concerns lingered about the outlook for corporate profits and the global economy with oil holding near this week's historic highs. Sterling hit a fresh 11-year low on a trade-weighted basis and tumbled to record troughs versus the euro as this week's weak housing and consumer morale surveys cemented expectations the Bank of England would cut interest rates later in the day. Optimism that the worst of the credit crisis may be over, which pushed world stocks to one-month highs this week, is tapering off as some firms announced soft first-quarter earnings and the IMF gave a grim assessment on bank-sector losses and global economy. A shift in investor focus back to economic fundamentals also overshadowed expectations that Group of Seven rich nations would unveil a drastic plan to help stabilize banks and financial markets at their meeting this weekend. "Risk aversion picked up ahead of the G7 as concerns about U.S. growth and worries about Q1 results have seen the dollar come under pressure again," said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.2 percent while MSCI main world equity index was steady on the day. Tokyo stocks fell almost 1.3 percent while Singapore and Sydney shares also eased. The IMF cut its 2008 world growth forecast on Wednesday and said losses from the credit crisis would approach $1 trillion. The dollar was down 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies while sterling had fallen as far as 80.26 pence per euro. On the trade-weighted index, sterling is at its weakest since 1996. The BoE is set to cut interest rates by a quarter point to 5.0 percent. "A rate cut's fine, but we do need to know that we're going to do more in terms of liquidity problems because... cutting interest rates without assisting further in the liquidity crisis is pointless," said David Buik of spread better Cantor Index. The European Central Bank also meets later, but its firm focus on inflation -- at a record 3.5 percent -- is likely to prompt the bank to keep rates on hold at 4 percent. "People just want to have a feeling of whether the hard-liners in the ECB do get a touch softer," said Heino Ruland, strategist at FrankfurtFinanz in Frankfurt. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 1 basis point while emerging stocks were up half a percent. The June Bund future rose 33 ticks, garnering safe-haven flows in the face of falling stocks. U.S. light crude was down 0.15 percent at $110.71 a barrel, just below Wednesday's record high of $112.21. Gold slipped to $929.10 an ounce as investors remained nervous over how and when the IMF, the world's third largest gold holder, would sell
