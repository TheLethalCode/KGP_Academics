 BAGHDAD, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US air strikes killed 10 people in a militia stronghold in eastern Baghdad, Iraqi police said on Thursday, but street fighting eased after four days of clashes that have killed close to 90 people. The Sadr City slum has since Sunday been the focal point of battles between black-masked Mehdi Army militiamen loyal to Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and security forces. The fighting is a continuation of clashes that erupted late last month when Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki cracked down on the militia in the southern city of Basra. The upsurge in violence has coloured an election-year debate in Washington over how fast to withdraw US troops by showing that Iraq's recent security gains are fragile. Iraqi police said two separate US air strikes on Thursday morning, which the US military could not immediately confirm, had killed six people and wounded 10. Late on Wednesday, a US helicopter fired two missiles at gunmen who attacked a joint US-Iraqi security station in Sadr City, killing four, the US military said. Iraqi police and hospital officials said two of the dead were young boys. A roadside bomb also killed a US soldier in central Baghdad overnight, raising the US military death toll in Iraq to 20 for April, putting this month on track to be the deadliest for American soldiers since September. Still, residents said the streets of Sadr City, where most of the fighting this week has taken place, were calmer than in the past four days, when Sadr's militia fought pitched battles against the US and Iraqi military. 'SITUATION QUIETER' "The situation is quieter. We are hearing sporadic gunfire and US combat planes have been flying overhead, but the Iraqi military is not in the streets like past days," said Raad al-Humairi, a Sadr City resident. "Some shops have opened. People buy what they need and then the shops close again." For the first time in many days, the US embassy said the heavily fortified Green Zone in central Baghdad had not sustained any rocket or mortar attacks from Sadr's militia. On Thursday, US and Iraqi forces raided a Sadr office in the town of Numaniya, south of Baghdad, seizing weapons and imposing a curfew, police said. US President George W Bush, whose management of the war has been criticised by Democrats and Republicans, is due to make a statement on Iraq at 1530 GMT on Thursday. He is likely to endorse a recommendation by the US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, to impose a 45-day freeze on troop withdrawals from July, when additional troops sent under the so-called surge are due to come home. Bush is also expected to announce that the tour of duty for US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan will be reduced to one year from 15 months. The Iraqi military announced late on Wednesday it planned to lift a two-week-old vehicle blockade in Sadr City on Saturday. The blockade has prevented cars from entering or leaving the eastern Baghdad district of two million people, leading to piled up rubbish, food and medicine shortages, and what residents have described as a sense of claustrophobia. A Baghdad-wide vehicle ban was imposed on Wednesday to restrict unrest on the fifth anniversary of the capital's fall to US troops. Despite that, some 23 people were killed in Sadr City clashes on Wednesday, Iraqi security sources said, and the United States announced the deaths of 5 more US soldiers. US military deaths have averaged roughly one a day over the past six months, but that number has doubled in Apr
