 QUETTA, Pakistan, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new government in the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan will hold talks with nationalist rebels to put an end to a decades-old insurgency, the new provincial chief minister said on Wednesday. Nawab Mohammad Aslam Raisani, a member of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, told the assembly his government's priority was to bring "durable and long-lasting" peace to the gas-rich province. "Baluchs are not terrorists. They're fighting for their just rights and we'll initiate talks with them," he said after being voted in. An election on Feb. 18 resulted in defeat for parties allied to President Pervez Musharraf, and new governments have been formed in Islamabad and the four provinces. Raisani called for the central government to end military operations in the province bordering Afghanistan and Iran. "The central government has all power. It should take the first step and announce immediate ceasefire," he said. Musharraf, who quit as army chief late last year, ordered a military crackdown in Baluchistan in late 2005 after being targeted by a rocket attack while visiting the province. Since then, according to government officials speaking on condition of anonymity, more than 900 people have disappeared from ethnic Baluch populated areas. It is widely believed they were detained by security forces on suspicion of having links with militant groups. Rebels are fighting for greater autonomy and a larger share of the profits from the province's mineral resources. Baluch nationalists accuse Punjab, Pakistan's biggest populated province, of exploiting their natural resources. Militants target government installations, security forces, gas pipelines, railway tracks and electricity pylons.
