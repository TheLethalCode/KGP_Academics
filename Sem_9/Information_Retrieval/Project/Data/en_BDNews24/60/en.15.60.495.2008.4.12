 Kabul, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed two Indian road engineers in southwest Afghanistan on Saturday, in the second deadly attack on road builders in a week. The attack, the latest in a spell of intermittent violence in recent weeks following a traditional winter lull, happened in the remote southwestern province of Nimroz. Provincial governor Ghulam Dastagir Azad said the road crew was at work on a stretch of highway. "The bomber got out of a car and then blew himself up. Two Indian engineers were killed," Azad told Reuters. One Indian and two Afghans were wounded. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Taliban have claimed numerous similar attacks against the government, foreign forces and aid and reconstruction projects. Seventeen Afghan road workers were killed in a Taliban attack in the southern province of Zabul on Tuesday. Ousted from power in 2001, the Taliban are fighting to expel foreign forces and bring down Afghanistan's Western-backed government. Most of the violence is in the south and east, near the border with Pakistan where the Taliban have sanctuaries in remote tribal areas. In a separate incident, 24 Taliban were killed in a joint operation by Afghan and foreign troops in Zabul province on Friday night, deputy provincial governor Gulab Shah Alikheil told reporters. There were no casualties among the Afghan and foreign forces who were backed up by aircraft in the battle, he said. A Taliban spokesman could not be reached for comment.
