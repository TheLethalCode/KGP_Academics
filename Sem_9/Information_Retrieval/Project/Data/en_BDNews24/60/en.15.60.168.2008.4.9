<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 09 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and the United Kingdom Wednesday discussed ways of future cooperation on counter-terrorism, officials said. A joint working group with officials from the two nations will be formed in June to deal with counterterrorism issues. The matter came to the forefront as visiting British home secretary Jacqui Smith met with her Bangladesh counterpart MA Matin in his office. "She prioritised the issue of countering terrorism. I told her that we are trying," Matin told reporters after the meeting. "I said that we have not been able to curb terrorism totally, but have controlled it to a great extent," Matin said. "I told the home secretary that we have already convicted and hanged a number of terrorists, and the trial of other terrorists is on." Smith, meanwhile, said she thought restoration of the democratic process in Bangladesh was important to curb terrorism. She said the joint working group would be in place in June. Smith, who arrived in Dhaka Tuesday night from Pakistan, told reporters: "The best way you do tackle terrorism in the long run is by building strong and stable democracy." "I am very pleased to hear the adviser telling me about the progress that has been made in Bangladesh on anti-terrorism legislation, which I consider to be very important." "The Bangladeshi people and the British people suffered in the recent past from indiscriminate terrorists' violence. It's something which as the home secretary has priority for me back in the UK," said Smith, who is the first woman to hold the portfolio of home affairs in the UK. Also Wednesday, Smith made a courtesy call on army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed, a military statement said. The Inter-Service Public Relations Directorate in the statement said Smith discussed some bilateral issues with Moeen at the Army Headquarters. Outgoing British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Anwar Choudhury accompanied her to the meeting with the general. Smith also flew to Habiganj and laid a foundation stone to build Bahubal Model Police Station under a UNDP-managed Police Reform Programme, the UN's Dhaka office said in a statement. At a ceremony there Smith said: "The British government is pleased to join with the EU and UNDP in support of this process of reform led by the inspector general and his senior management team." "We are encouraged by the drafting of the Police Ordinance which will enable the police to better manage and control its own finances and destiny, reporting to the people through Parliament and we look forward to hearing of its promulgation. "When the police service is attuned to the needs of the people and responsive to them, justice is served in that community." Anwar Choudhury, Additional Inspector General NBK Tripura, UNDP Bangladesh deputy country director Larry Maramis and and police reform programme's project director Hubert Staberhofer were present on the occasion. She will leave Bangladesh Thursday. bdnews24.com/
