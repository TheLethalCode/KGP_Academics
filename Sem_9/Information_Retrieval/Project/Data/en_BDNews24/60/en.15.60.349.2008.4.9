<TITLE> BNP faction welcomes move for talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)  A BNP faction led by former finance minister M Saifur Rahman Wednesday welcomed the government's proposal on dialogue as a positive move. The troubled party's acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed in a press briefing at his Banani home said they were taking preparation for informal talks in the build-up to dialogue. BNP leaders will discuss the probable issues among themselves and inform the government about their preparations for talks, Hafizuddin said. He hoped the dialogue would resolve the ongoing crisis in the country and help hold a peaceful election. Hafizuddin demanded the release of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, arrested on corruption charges in 2007. "The chairperson is now in jail. The jail code does not allow a detainee to do politics. But it should not hamper all work. The BNP is a big party. There are senior leaders who will take part in dialogue," he said. The disputed acting secretary general said it would help the BNP if the chairperson gave clear guidance about the talks, adding: "Leaders of the party are having meetings to fix what will be discussed at the meeting." The issues such as commodity prices, food crisis, freedom of the chairperson, black money, peaceful elections and restoration of democracy might top the agenda. Asked about the High Court verdict on the Election Commission's invitation to the BNP, Hafizuddin said a court verdict is set to come out Thursday. "We want to go to dialogue uniting the two factions," he added. Referring to his rival faction led by BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Hafizuddin said: "I want to tell the other faction that the BNP must be united before going to dialogue to strengthen the nationalist force." "We want to sit with the government", together with Delwar and Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah, he added. Hafizuddin trashed Delwar's remark he made in the morning saying: "Saifur Rahman is one of the founding members of the party. We have 102 elected parliament members including many senior leaders with us." "Such remark is unfortunate," he said. Earlier in the day, Delwar told reporters that the Election Commission was responsible for the appointment of acting chairman (Saifur) and acting secretary general (Hafizuddin) to the BNP. Delwar compared the Election Commission to a "factory that manufactured the opposing faction". bdnew
