 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)At least 20 students were injured in a surprise attack allegedly by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists on the workers of Bangladesh Chhatra League at Fazle Rabbi Hall of Dhaka Medical College Friday over a derogatory comment. Hall provost Prof Kazi Julfikar Mamun told bdnews24.com that the clash had started over what he said was a "trifling matter". All the injured are members of the BCL, the student wing of the Awami League. The injured were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. College authorities visited them. The provost said the attack on Fazle Rabbi Hall occurred around 11am Friday in a sequel to a Thursday incident. On Thursday, first-year students of the college known as K-65 organised a function on the college premises as part of their 65-day programme. A student of the second year (K-64) went there and allegedly made a derogatory remark about the programme, leading the K-65 students to assault him. Prof Mamun said there was no political link in Thursday's incident, but all got involved along political lines Friday morning. Some injured students alleged that a group of activists led by JCD's Dhaka Medical College unit president entered the hall in the morning, with sticks and clubs in hand, and started ransacking the building. They searched for the BCL workers and ransacked some rooms of students. After the incident, police have been deployed to the hall. Tension is prevailing there. An emergency Academic Council meeting has been called to solve the problem. bdnews24.c
