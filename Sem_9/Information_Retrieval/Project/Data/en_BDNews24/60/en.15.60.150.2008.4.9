 PORT-AU-PRINCE, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Small groups of Haitian protesters enraged by soaring food prices returned to the streets of the capital on Wednesday to rebuild barricades taken down overnight and await the response of the poor country's president. Columns of thick black smoke rose from parts of sprawling Port-au-Prince as demonstrators set fire once again to piles of tires, demanding government action over the cost of rice and other foodstuffs. "You haven't seen nothing yet," Jeanti Mathieu, a 22-year-old with dreadlocks, said as he helped erect a street barricade made of wrecked cars, concrete blocks and debris. "We are waiting for the government to tell us what it is going to do. Otherwise you can expect the worst." At least five people have been killed during a week of violent demonstrations over the cost of living in the poorest country in the Americas, where 80 percent of the population makes do on less than $2 a day and few have full-time jobs. Demonstrators on Tuesday paralyzed the city and tried to storm the presidential palace. Stoked by a drought in top grains producer Australia, climbing demand from emerging markets like China and competition with plant-based biofuels, global food prices have leaped, prompting restlessness in many poor countries. Haitians say prices of rice, corn, beans, cooking oil and other staples are skyrocketing. The cost of rice and some other commodities has virtually doubled in six months, while energy costs have also soared because of record oil prices. U.N. peacekeepers, deployed to Haiti after former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted in 2004 in an armed revolt, fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators on Tuesday to prevent them from overrunning the presidential palace. HUDDLING INSIDE PALACE Inside, officials said, President Rene Preval huddled overnight with government minsters and international officials, trying to figure out what to do. Preval, whose election in 2006 raised hopes that Haiti might finally tread a path toward stability after decades of violence and turmoil, had yet to address the nation of 9 million people sharing the island of Hispaniola with the far wealthier Dominican Republic. "We are going to occupy the streets until we find a clear answer to our problems," said Jean Saint-Pyr, a young man at another barricade. The government has announced a multimillion-dollar package of economic investments in agriculture and infrastructure to create jobs and boost food production. But protesters say they want more than that. "The government should immediately lift taxes on rice, beans, on everything the people need to eat and to survive," said one of them, Joel Monard. The crowds on Wednesday morning were far smaller than on the previous day, but an air of anticipation hung over Port-au-Prince and local radio reported some looting. Authorities have accused drug dealers and smugglers of using the food protests to stir up trouble. The protests began last Wednesday in the southern city of Les Cayes. The U.N. Security Council has deplored the violence and called for emergency aid to relieve hardship, warning that Haiti's fragile stability could easily unravel. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti has nearly 9,000 Brazilian-led soldiers and civilian police providing security.
