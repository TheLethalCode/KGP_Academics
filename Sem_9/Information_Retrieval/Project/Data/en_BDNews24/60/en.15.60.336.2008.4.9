 NAIROBI, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Kenya said on Wednesday he expected the country's political rivals to agree on a power-sharing cabinet soon despite their failure to do so earlier this week. "We expect that in a matter of days, or a week or so, there will be a coalition government," Michael Ranneberger told reporters. "We remain confident that President (Mwai) Kibaki and Raila Odinga will reach agreement on the composition of the cabinet. They are very close." Ranneberger, who met the two men in the last couple of days, criticised both sides for ratcheting up tensions in statements after failing to agree on the line-up of a cabinet. "It is not however a time for other people to be making statements that create an atmosphere of crisis," he added. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also urged Kibaki and Odinga to reach a deal during a telephone call on Monday. Other partners, including Britain, the World Bank and United Nations, have said genuine power-sharing is needed to restore Kenyans' faith in the government.
