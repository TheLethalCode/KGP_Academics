<TITLE> Brazil President Lula hunting for right successor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRASILIA, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is basking in high popularity and a roaring economy but the former union leader is still searching for a strong successor to run in the 2010 elections. The lack of an obvious candidate with Lula's charisma and common touch raises the prospect that -- despite the good times his administration has presided over -- the opposition could mount a strong presidential challenge in two years' time. Lula has appeared to be on the campaign trail over the past month, inaugurating several public works projects each week and boasting of his achievements with the same fiery rhetoric of his days as a union leader in the late 1970s. "I'm at ease working to make my successor I'm working to win the election," Lula, who is constitutionally barred from a third successive term, told a local radio station last month. Lula, who began his second four-year term only in January 2007, should be in a good position to forge his successor. Two polls in the past two weeks have shown him to have more support than ever since he first took office in January 2003. The former factory worker has overseen one of the longest growth periods of an economy long prone to instability and chronic inflation. Millions of Brazilians are being lifted out of poverty, helped by booming demand for Brazil's commodities, a major expansion of credit, and Lula's social programs. Lula also bounced back from several corruption scandals since 2005 that forced several aides to resign, including his finance and energy ministers. But each of his options to find a successor for 2010 faces hurdles. The likely candidates from his ruling Workers' Party, known as PT, for instance, fared poorly in opinion polls against possible opposition candidate Jose Serra, Lula's challenger in 2002. That has made Serra, one of Brazil's best-known politicians who favors a strong state role in the economy, the early favorite for 2010. None of the candidates from the PT have Lula's folksy charisma. "Lula is campaigning to build political capital but wants to keep his options for succession open," said Jose Luciano Dias, head of CAC consulting firm in Brasilia. NO CLEAR SUCCESSOR Chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, who has received much praise from Lula and often shares the stage with him on his travels, won 4 percent support against 38 percent for Serra, a former Sao Paulo state governor and member of the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy Party, according to a Datafolha poll. Rousseff's standing could be further damaged by a police investigation into the leak from her office of secret expense accounts from former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The leak angered the opposition and Congress is also investigating. Former Sao Paulo mayor, Marta Suplicy, is the best-placed PT hopeful with 8 percent against 36 percent for Serra, the poll showed. One option is to amend the constitution so Lula could run for a third consecutive term, a possibility Vice President Jose Alencar raised last week, even though Lula has repeatedly said he is not interested. "The Brazilian people want Lula to stay in power," Alencar told a local radio station. Lula had done a lot but there was much more to do, he said. Such an amendment remains unlikely because Lula lacks the necessary three-fifths majority in the Senate. Lula, however, could sit out a term and come back under current law. In a third option, Lula could decide to back an ally from his governing coalition, such as former Ceara state governor and Lower House deputy Ciro Gomes, who is second in the Datafolha poll with 20 percent. But that would not sit well with the PT and Gomes botched his presidential candidacy in 2002 with controversial remarks. Despite the uncertainty, the good news for investors is that there are for now no maverick candidates on the horizon who could reverse Lula's market friendly policies. "Lula's charisma and 'common man touch' inhibits the rise of any populist or radical leftist candidate -- that itself guarantees certain continuity," Dias said.
