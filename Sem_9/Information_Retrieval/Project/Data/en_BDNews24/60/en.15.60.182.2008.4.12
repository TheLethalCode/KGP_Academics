 KANPUR, India, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saurav Ganguly top-scored with 87 to hand India a slender first innings lead on day two of the third and final test against South Africa on Saturday. Ganguly was ninth out before India reached 288 for nine at stumps, replying to South Africa's first innings 265 all out on a deteriorating Green Park pitch. Ganguly, who struck nine fours and a six, guided the lower order after Vangipurappu Laxman hit 50 to revive the innings after a poor start. South African fast bowler Morne Morkel took three early wickets before Dale Steyn struck telling blows with the second new ball to run through the tail, leaving the visitors hoping for victory as India will have to bat last on the dusty surface. Morkel finished with three for 57 and Steyn 3-60. Laxman and Rahul Dravid (29) added 78 runs for the third wicket before Morkel dismissed them after lunch in successive overs. Ganguly added 65 runs for the fifth wicket with Yuvraj Singh and another 60 with stand-in skipper Mahendra Dhoni, both the batsmen scoring 32 apiece. India lost the second test in Ahmedabad by an innings and 90 runs. The first test in Chennai ended in a draw
