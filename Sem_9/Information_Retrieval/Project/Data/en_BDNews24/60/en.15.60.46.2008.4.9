<TITLE> S Africa's Eskom to get extra power from Mozambique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom, struggling to contain a crippling power crisis, has reached a five-year deal with Mozambique to import extra electricity, it said on Wednesday. Eskom said it would import an extra 250 megawatts of power from the Cahora Bassa hydro-electric power station. "In terms of the agreement, Cahora Bassa will make 250 MW available to Eskom from its fifth generator, bringing the total amount Eskom can import from Cahora Bassa to 1,500 MW," Eskom said in a statement. State-owned Eskom has been struggling to cope with South Africa's power crisis which led to the country's mining industry shutting down for five days in late January. Mines are now operating at 95 percent of their usual power supply. Eskom began planned power cuts just over a week ago in a bid to conserve electricity, reigniting South Africans' anger over the power problems which have rattled investors and the industrial sector. The utility plans to spend 343 billion rand ($44 billion) in the next five years and 1.3 trillion rand until 2025 to increase generating capacity. The plan includes building nuclear power stations. Eskom said 100 MW of the additional power had already been supplied since Friday and this would be increased in the coming weeks. In a submission to South Africa's electricity regulator Nersa on Tuesday, Eskom said "the price increase for 2009/2010 will be almost 100 percent" if its proposed tariff increases were approved. Eskom said electricity prices needed to double in the next two years if it was to deal with the electricity crisis. Critics say the government ignored warnings and failed to adequately plan for future demand growth. Many people are concerned the power crisis may black out the World Cup, which South Africa hosts in 2010, despite official reassurances stadiums will have generators for the tournament. Eskom has blamed its woes on a combination of factors, including the failure of the government to invest in electricity generating plants, maintenance problems at its existing facilities and wet weather that affected its coal suppli
