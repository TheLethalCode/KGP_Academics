 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)The date April 10 stands among the memorable days of 1971 as the day on which Bangladesh officially declared its independence. On this day 37 years ago, the people's representatives officially announced the birth of the nation with a Declaration of Independence at Mujib Nagar. This was followed by the decision to form the first government of the newly independent Bangladesh, which came to be known as the 'Mujib Nagar government.' The Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra (Free Bangladesh Radio Centre) declared Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Syed Nazrul Islam and Tajuddin Ahmad as the first president, vice president and prime minister of the nascent People's Republic of Bangladesh. As Sheikh Mujib was detained in a Pakistan jail, vice president Syed Nazrul Islam took the oath as acting president of the new republic. The constitution formulated after liberation from Pakistan was founded on the Declaration of Independence, which validated Bangabandhu's March 26 declaration, and thus March 26 came to be celebrated as Independence Day. bdnews24.
