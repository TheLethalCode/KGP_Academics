 BRUSSELS, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Wednesday he was very concerned by delays in the release of results of Zimbabwe's presidential election and said people in the country wanted change. "One thing should be made very clear to Mr Mugabe and his entourage: the people of Zimbabwe want a change, they want democracy, they want freedom, they want to be able to tackle poverty and the economic chaos they are living through," Barroso told reporters. The comments represented the strongest criticism so far by Brussels of the March 29 election. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is trying to delay the result announcement, pending a recount, to give him time to prepare for a probable runoff against Morgan Tsvangirai. "We are very concerned about all these delays and the lack of transparency in the presidential election process," Barroso said when asked about Zimbabwe at a news conference on EU development aid.
