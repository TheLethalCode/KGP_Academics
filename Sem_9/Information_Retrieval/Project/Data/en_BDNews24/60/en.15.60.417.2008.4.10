 BRATISLAVA, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Slovak opposition party pledged support on Thursday for the European Union's reform treaty, clearing the way for approval by parliament with a sufficient majority later in the day. The ethnic Hungarian SMK party announced it would drop its threat to boycott the ratification, breaking ranks with other opposition parties who have said they will oppose ratification over an unrelated dispute with Prime Minister Robert Fico. The daily Hospodarske Noviny had quoted an unnamed minister from Fico's Smer party as saying the government would quit if the ratification failed. "SMK deputies unanimously agreed that the party will vote for the Lisbon treaty," SMK leader Pal Csaky told reporters. "This is a one-off decision, it is only related to the Lisbon treaty, it is only related to maintaining Slovakia's good reputation." The decision by 19 SMK members of parliament means the leftist Fico will have enough votes to approve the treaty by the necessary three-fifths majority. The deputies will vote on the document after 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Thursday. The opposition had threatened not to support the treaty, designed to revamp EU institutions, after the government pushed through a controversial media bill which the opposition, media and human rights groups said infringes freedom of speech ([ID:nL09918268]). Fico, riding on a wave of popularity supported by record strong economic growth, has been putting the mostly pro-EU opposition under increasing pressure to allow the treaty to go through. The Lisbon treaty is meant to streamline decision making in the bloc, which has grown to 27 members from 15 over the past four years. It provides for a long-term president of the European Council of EU leaders, a stronger foreign policy chief, a simpler decision-making system and more say for the national and European parliaments. A rejection of the treaty would be a major setback for the European Union, which laboriously agreed the new text after the failure of a more ambitious European constitution in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. So far Hungary, Slovenia, Malta, Romania, France, Bulgaria and Austria have ratified the treaty but it may face hurdles in other countries. Ireland is to hold a referendum. In the Czech Republic, the ruling party has said it will ask the Constitutional Court to check that the treaty is in line with Czech law. Earlier this week, a senior official in Fico's Smer party said Smer might seek a referendum on the EU treaty if it was rejected by parliame
