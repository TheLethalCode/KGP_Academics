 London/Frankfurt, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's RWE has made an indicative all-cash offer for nuclear power firm British Energy worth up to 11 billion pounds ($22 billion) including debt, a source close to the matter said. The source said on Thursday that RWE tabled the proposal of just under 700 pence a share a few weeks ago. RWE, which owns British energy supplier npower, is one of a number of companies stalking British Energy, as utilities across Europe look to take advantage of Britain's new drive to expand its nuclear power generation. RWE and British Energy, which is 35 percent owned by the British government, declined to comment. Britain, eager to reduce its exposure to energy imports and to diversify its sources of power, has committed to building a new generation of nuclear power plants. Analysts believe that the sites of British Energy's existing but ageing power stations are likely to play a key role in the expansion drive. The Financial Times said on Thursday that RWE's proposal was tabled before March 17, when British Energy confirmed that it was in talks that could lead to a takeover or partnerships. It said Electricite de France (EDF) was also looking at British Energy's books, but that it had initially planned only to buy part of British Energy. It also said that British utility Centrica had tabled an all-share proposal and that all parties were likely to revise their offers after examining British Energy's books. A source close to the matter told Reuters on Monday that EDF and RWE had approached Centrica about a possible joint bid for British Energy. Britain has said it is open to a foreign buyer, but that it wants to ensure a competitive market for developing new nuclear power stations, signalling it might prefer a joint bid. British Energy said on Thursday that its nuclear output for the year ended March 31 was 50.3 TWh (terrawatt hours), marginally ahead of analysts' expectations. Its shares closed at 701.5 pence on Wednesd
