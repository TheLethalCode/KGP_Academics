 Narayanganj, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  At least 50 people, 23 of them police officers, were injured Saturday when some 10,000 garment workers clashed with officials at Fatullah for better wages to buy food amid higher prices, police and witnesses said. The protesters from at least 20 factories joined the protests, said Fatullah Police Station official Angur Akter. Narayanganj Police Station assistant police superintendent Mir Mohammad Touhid and Fatullah Model Police Station chief Bhuiyan Mahbub Hassan were among the injured. The protest began at 9:45am after the workers of Micro Fibre Garments took to the streets to press for a pay rise, said Liton, one of the protesters. Liton said Liberty Garments and Metro Garments had raised workers' salaries by Tk 250 but Micro Fiber Garments had only given a Tk 200 pay hike. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association chief Fazlul Hoque told a press conference that an uncongenial situation was being created in the export-oriented garments industry over a trivial thing. "If there is any allegation against owners, authorities can take action," he said. Hoque said garment factory owners had already increased salaries of workers in the wake of soaring commodity price. However, advocate Mahbubur Rahman Ismail, president of the National Federation of Garments Workers, said: "The protestors took to the street in the desperate struggle to survive." Skyrocketing prices of daily essentials made their lives hard, he said, recommending that a factory-based rationing system be launched. The workers earlier blockaded Dhaka-Narayanganj highway, suspending traffic on the key road for about two hours. The protesters rampaged through the area by smashing factories and vehicles, Angur said. The nearby areas including Shibu Market, Kather Pull and Sostapur turned into a battle field. Another police official, sub-inspector Shafiqul Islam, said the protests turned violent after the workers started hurling stones and pieces of bricks at police. The police retaliated with teargas and rubber bullets, he said. Many of the protesters said they joined the protests since it had been difficult to meet higher food prices with the pay they got. District police superintendent Md Sibgatullah said the injured police officers had been admitted to hospitals in Dhaka and Narayanganj. The situation was eventually brought under control, he said. bdnews24.com/corr/qh
