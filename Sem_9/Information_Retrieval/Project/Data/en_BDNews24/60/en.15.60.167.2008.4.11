 LONDON, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell by midday after US conglomerate General Electric posted disappointing quarterly earnings and cut forecasts, while banks dropped on lingering concerns over a global credit crunch. At 1117 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares dropped 1 percent at 1,289.92 points, well off its day high of 1,313.05 hit in early trade. GE reported a 6 percent drop in profit as a slumping US economy and credit crunch drove down earnings at its financial, industrial and healthcare units. It also lowered its earnings forecasts for the year. "The earnings season is off to a bad start. You get earnings that are way below estimates and GE's a complicated story -- one side of it is financial and the other side is industrial, so it's a good benchmark for the US economy," said Philippe Gijsels, senior equity strategist at Fortis Bank. "That's why (European) equity markets are reacting negatively, but I don't think this comes as a surprise." Banks were down, with UBS off 1.5 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland 1.7 percent lower and Barclays down 2.7 percent, as investors' belief that the worst of a credit crisis was over seemed to waver. "We can hope (bad news) will end at the end of 2008 or some point in 2009 ... we'll have to see what the profitability of the banking sector after the subprime crisis will be when these 'sexy' products won't be around," Gijsels said of instruments such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). Investors had initially taken comfort from positive corporate results in the U.S. on Thursday, after the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) raised its profit forecast, injecting confidence in European equity markets. M&A TALK LIFTS TELECOMS Telecoms were also up after Italian phone group Telecom Italia gained almost 1.7 percent, after one of its main shareholders said it favoured a merger with Spanish peer Telefonica. Telecom Italia, which bought an indirect 10 percent stake in Telefonica last year, declined to comment. Shareholders meet to vote at their next assembly on Monday. French telecoms and construction group Bouygues rose by 5 percent, with traders citing a rating upgrade on the company to "overweight" by Morgan Stanley. The world's biggest confectionery group, Cadbury Schweppes, lost 1.3 percent after it reported a modest 3 percent rise in first-quarter sales and warned economic conditions in 2008 would be challenging.

Across Europe, the British leading index of companies, the FTSE 100, was up 0.8 percent, the German DAX gained 1.3 percent while France's CAC added 2 perce
