 SOUTH BEND, Ind., April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Facing job losses, rising mortgage rates and higher gasoline prices, US voters in 2008 want their next president above all to listen to their anger and fix the economy . As the US economy sinks into a possible recession, all three top White House contenders, John McCain and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, say they speak for middle class voters whose real income has stagnated for years and has recently begun to decline while the very rich get richer. In a recent CBS/New York Times poll, 81 percent of voters said the country was on the wrong track, an unprecedented figure. Seventy eight percent said things were worse than five years ago. The candidates are echoing the views of voters like Mary Magargee, a 63-year-old teacher who attended an Obama rally in Malvern, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday and said she finds it shocking to learn of big packages of oil executives at a time when Americans are paying record-high prices for fuel. "It's unconscionable that they're making all that money and people are paying almost $4 a gallon for gasoline," she said. Historically, when economic times are hard, the party holding the White House has an uphill fight to retain control. McCain, the Republican nominee, needs to find a way to respond to voter anger and anxiety without totally divorcing himself from Republican loyalists who still support President George W. Bush. Democrats Clinton and Obama have no such problem. In Malvern, Obama said the American Dream was "slipping away" while the economic system seemed stacked in favor of the rich. "That's why we have CEOs who make more in one day than their employees make in one year. That's why we've been subjected to cycles of bubble and bust," the Illinois senator said. "We can't keep embracing the idea that somehow Wall Street can thrive while Main Street crumbles." Obama, who would be the first black president, and Clinton, who would be the first woman to win the White House, are vying to be the Democratic nominee to run against McCain. Clinton was the first of the three to strike a populist note, pledging to fight for the interests of truckers, auto workers and waitresses. BOXING GLOVES At a General Motors factory in Lordstown, Ohio, Clinton held up a pair of boxing gloves to show she was tough enough to take on Wall Street and corporate America. "We'll take on the oil companies and harness their record profits to create millions of clean energy jobs, high-wage jobs you can raise a family on," the New York senator said. "We'll take on the credit card companies so that you and your families aren't drowning in debt." Both Democrats would roll back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans and are pledging tougher scrutiny of free trade agreements. They also favor a more interventionist approach to the mortgage crisis than McCain, who has said he is wary of having the government "bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly," whether they are bankers or people who took out excessively large mortgages to buy homes. Democrats believe McCain is vulnerable on the economy and have hammered him by linking him to Bush. McCain promises to rid the budget of wasteful, special project spending, which he says often serves the interests of lobbyists rather than the public. He has also vowed to get rid of the "alternative minimum tax" which was initially aimed at the rich but increasingly hits the pocketbooks of middle-class taxpayers. He supports keeping the Bush tax cuts in place. But McCain last weekend joined Clinton and Obama in expressing concern about the vast compensation earned by the executives of companies at the center of the financial crisis and housing crises such as Bear Stearns Cos Inc and Countrywide Financial Corp. "I think it is outrageous when someone who is the head of Bear Stearns cashes in millions and millions of dollars in stocks," McCain said. "I think it is unconscionable when the guy who is the head of Countrywide and his co-conspirators make huge amounts of money when Americans face the threat of losing their homes.
