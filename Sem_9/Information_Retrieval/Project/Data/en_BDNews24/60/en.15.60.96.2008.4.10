<TITLE> DSG sets profit alarm bells ringing a second time </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pan-European electrical goods company DSG International became the latest retailer to warn of tough trading on the high street with its second profit warning in three months, hitting its shares by over 8 percent. The retailer, which in January said lower demand for computers over Christmas had hit sales, said on Thursday it was having to cut prices to keep customers spending. The group, whose store chains include Currys and PC World in Britain, UniEuro in Italy and Elkjop in Nordic countries, said it now expected annual underlying profit before tax to be within a range of 200 million to 210 million pounds ($394-414 million). In a profit warning in January, DSG signalled underlying earnings would be around 250 million pounds. "The trading environment since we last reported has remained challenging across our markets, particularly in the UK, Italy and Spain," Chief Executive John Browett said in a statement. "Whilst like-for-like sales patterns are broadly in line with those we reported over the Christmas period, it is clear customers have become increasingly promotion and deal-driven, impacting gross margins." Britain's retailers are struggling as debt-laden shoppers cut back on spending following several interest rate increases and amid higher energy bills and a cooler housing market. DSG, formerly called Dixons, said like-for-like sales were down 1 percent in the 25 weeks to April 5, while like-for-like gross margins fell around 0.8 percent in the period. Browett also said he would present on May 15 the first phase of a business review he had carried out since joining the retailer last September. DSG said demand had been good in the UK and Ireland for flat-panel televisions, laptops, fridges, freezers and washing machines, particularly over Easter, thanks to promotions. "However, demand outside of these promotions has been lower than expected, with a negative impact on margins," DSG said. The retailer said that overall sales in UK computing remain disappointing. Shares in DSG, which have underperformed the UK general retailers' index by around 35 percent in the past 12 months, were down 8.9 percent at 59.25 pence at 1000 GMT, valuing the company at around 1.07 billion pounds. Rival Kesa Electricals were down 3 percent at 201.5 pence. "Consumer electricals was always going to be a tough place to be into the teeth of a consumer slowdown," Numis analyst Nick Couter said in a note. "With little product differentiation, DSG has little choice but to follow the market down by accepting lower gross margins. It is hard to see an end to this cycle in the current environment," he added. Landsbanki analyst Paul Deacon said in a note DSG would almost certainly cut its dividend. "We retain our 'reduce' rating on the shares and expect more bad news." Panmure Gordon, which cut its price target on the stock to 65 pence from 70 pence but kept its "hold" rating, said it expected DSG to cut the full-year dividend to 4p. The company paid a full-year dividend of 8.87p last year. "It is difficult to see any catalysts for outperformance in the current difficult consumer environment. There is no quick fix for DSG's problems," Panmure analysts said in a no
