<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Thursday he would contact the two factions of BNP and ask them to sit together in talks with the EC. "I hope the BNP will end the infighting. Let all sides of the party come to us together. The verdict has created scope for it," Huda told reporters in his reaction to a High Court verdict that rejected former prime minister Khaleda Zia's writ petition. "We want a free and fair election. The implementation of an election roadmap does not depend on the commission alone. Political parties, civil society and the media all will have to come forward." The CEC said: "After getting a copy of the verdict, I will contact the BNP leaders and speak to them. We will request them to come to us united. It will be good for all of us." Asked when the EC will hold dialogue with the BNP, Huda said: "I cannot say that at the moment. We will decide later whether to invite one faction or both. We will make the decision after consulting lawyers." Asked whether the EC will complete dialogue with the BNP before the government starts formal talks with political parties, Huda said: "The EC dialogue may be completed earlier." The High Court on Thursday dismissed the BNP chairperson's writ petition that challenged the EC's planned dialogue with the party's disputed acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed. bdnew
