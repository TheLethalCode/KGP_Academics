 LONDON, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - London's Central Criminal Court sentenced an Indian doctor to 18 months' jail on Friday for withholding information about planned car bomb attacks on central London and Scotland's Glasgow airport. Sabeel Ahmed, 26, will not serve his sentence because he has already spent 270 days in custody, pleaded guilty and signed a document stating that he will return to India voluntarily. He is the younger brother of Kafeel Ahmed, an engineer, who drove a jeep into the Glasgow airport terminal building on June 30 last year and set it alight. Kafeel died later in hospital from 90 percent burns. Thirty-six hours before the Glasgow airport blaze, two cars containing petrol, gas cylinders and mobile phone detonators were discovered in central London, one of them outside a packed nightclub. Sabeel Ahmed was sent an e-mail with details of the attacks before his brother drove the jeep to Glasgow airport.
