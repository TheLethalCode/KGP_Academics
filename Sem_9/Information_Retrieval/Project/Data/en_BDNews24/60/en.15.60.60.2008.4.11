<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed said Friday he hoped to join talks with the Election Commission and the government, together with the leaders of both factions. Hafizuddin expressed his hope for unity in the troubled party, a day after the High Court had rejected BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's writ appeal challenging an Election Commission letter that invited one of the factions to dialogue. In a speech to leaders and workers of BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal at his Banani home, Hafizuddin urged the party leaders not to embroil Khaleda in any controversy. "Khaleda Zia is our leader and she should not have been involved in the writ appeal which was filed to challenge the EC's invitation to us," he said. The BNP leader termed Thursday's HC verdict a "victory of the BNP and reform". Hafizuddin said: "I want to go to the Election Commission for dialogue along with all senior leaders including Khandaker Delwar Hossain, ASM Hannan Shah and Goyeshwar Chandra Roy." "Our initiative to unite the party is ongoing. I am optimistic," he said. Hafizuddin expressed the hope of holding a big rally in Dhaka on May Day with government permission. "BNP does politics, not for power and but for serving people. That's why people had opted for the BNP in the past. In future too, a united BNP will participate in the election and get people's mandate to power," he said. Hafizuddin urged JCD leaders and workers to be "imbibed with the ideals" of the late president Ziaur Rahman and acquire qualities of leadership. "What happened in the past will not repeat itself in future. Meritorious students will come to the leadership through elections," he said. bdnew
