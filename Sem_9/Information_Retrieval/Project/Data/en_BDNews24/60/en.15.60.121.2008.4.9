 LONDON, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police searching for missing children's television presenter Mark Speight said on Wednesday his family are "extremely concerned" for his welfare following his disappearance two months after his fiancee's death. Detectives released CCTV stills of the 42-year-old entering Queen's Park underground station in northwest London on Monday in the hours before he was reported missing. "Mark's friends and family are extremely concerned for his welfare and they continue to agonise over his disappearance," said Detective Inspector Declan Williams, of the Metropolitan Police. A number of people have come forward with "vital information" since the first missing person appeals were issued on Tuesday, he added. Speight, who hosted the BBC art show SMart, was questioned by police over the death of his fiancee Natasha Collins, 31, at their St John's Wood home in January. Westminster Coroner Paul Knapman recorded a verdict of death by misadventure at an inquest last week. The court heard that Collins died in a scalding hot bath after taking cocaine and sleeping pills and drinking vodka. Speight was briefly held on suspicion of her murder before detectives "cancelled" his arrest and said he was not a suspect. A statement released by his lawyers at the time of Collins' death, said Speight was "absolutely distraught". He was last seen wearing a brown suit jacket over a light hooded sweatshirt, dark blue jeans and a brown flat cap. He was carrying a dark shoulder bag. He boarded a southbound Bakerloo line train from Queen's Park station on Monday. Anyone who has seen him should ring Enfield police on 020 8807 1212.
