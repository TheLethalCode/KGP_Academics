 London, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip index edged lower early on Wednesday, with miners and financials falling as the Bank of England began its two-day interest rate meeting. At 0744 GMT, the FTSE 100 had dipped 20.8 points or 0.4 percent to 5,969.4. US stocks had fallen after Washington Mutual said it expects a large quarterly loss, raising concerns about results from the rest of the financial sector, while minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting stoked fears of a recession. "If you look across the whole of the equity universe, every market looks softer," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. "Many of us have been saying for some time that the earnings numbers that are currently being priced in are way too optimistic." "We are starting to see indications that earnings are a concern for markets globally and that's weighing on the UK." Miners fell with BHP Billiton down 1.9 percent after climbing almost 5 percent in the previous session when an Australian newspaper reported that China may be planning to buy a stake in the world's biggest miner. But a source close to top management at China's Baosteel Group said he was not aware of any move to buy a stake in BHP Billiton. Xstrata and Rio Tinto both dipped. Bucking the trend however, Eurasian Natural Resources gained 1 percent after the Kazakh group posted a 36 percent rise in annual pretax profit as commodity prices surged and said it expects a "strong year" in 2008. With little on the corporate calendar to offer investors direction, eyes turned to the Bank of England, which began its two-day rate setting meeting. Economists expect a 25 basis point rate cut to 5 percent on Thursday. "We were waiting for May, but in light of yesterday's house price data, we've opted for a rate cut -- 25 basis points," said Commerzbank's Dixon. "The Bank has to make a judgment call about how it sees the impact from the credit market on the economy." Further dampening investors' mood, a survey from the Nationwide Building Society showed that British consumer morale fell in March to its lowest levels in four years. UK financials weighed on lingering credit fears and negative broker comment. HBOS shed 3.6 percent after Credit Suisse slashed its price target on the stock to 565 pence from 890 pence with an "underperform" rating. Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HSBC lost between 0.4 and 2.1 percent. Hopes of a rate cut however, boosted housebuilder Persimmon , which tacked on 2.6 percent. Prudential, BG Group, Pearson, Hammerson and Admiral Group all traded in negative territory after going ex-dividend. Further on the upside, with US crude steady at about $108 a barrel, BP added 0.2 percent, Shell climbed 0.6 percent and Cairn Energy was up 2.5 percent. Britain's second-biggest water company, Severn Trent advanced 0.4 percent after HSBC raised its rating to "neutral" from "underweight" and trimmed its target price to 1,530 pence from 1,550 pen
