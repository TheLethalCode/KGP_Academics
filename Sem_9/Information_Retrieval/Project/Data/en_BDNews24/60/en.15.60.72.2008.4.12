 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government has invited the Awami League (AL) to another round of informal talks through a mobile-to-mobile text message in the run-up to the official dialogue, an adviser said. Commerce and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com Saturday that he had sms-ed acting AL president Zillur Rahman, inviting the party top-brasses for the next pre-dialogue session. "I sent the sms to Mr Zillur Rahman at noon," he said. The sms read, "Salam, meeting with your party representative set for tomorrow 13 April 5:30pm at (state guesthouse) Padma. Hossain Zillur Rahman." The AL last week said they would like to have a formal letter before considering another shot at talks. Asked why he had sent the sms, the adviser said, "I have invited them through sms after discussing with them (AL)." The party has picked eight senior party leaders for the next round of informal talks ahead of the official dialogue, an AL leader said earlier in the day. The eight party representatives, headed by the acting party chief, include policymaking presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. In the first-round of informal discussions on Monday, five advisers met with AL leaders Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, organising secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Hasan Mahmud, an aide to detained party chief Sheikh Hasina. The representation at the meeting caused uproar in the AL. The government on Wednesday again contacted the party for talks and the party's presidium at a meeting the same day decided that it would hold no informal meeting unless the caretaker administration made a formal invitation. Earlier on Saturday, the presidium met at the house of Zillur Rahman in Gulshan. The party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told journalists after the meeting, "We are waiting for government's signal. "If the time and the venue are finalised and the response from the government is positive we will join the pre-dialogue talks. We are continuing talks with the government. Please wait, you will hear something good by this (Saturday) evening." Ashraful hoped AL leaders would attend the final dialogue alongside Hasina. bdnews24.
