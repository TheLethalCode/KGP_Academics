 Washington, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Thursday announced a suspension of US troop withdrawals from Iraq this summer to allow the military to reassess the security situation. Bush endorsed a recommendation by his commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, to complete a limited withdrawal of combat troops by July but then impose a 45-day freeze of the total at about 140,000 troops before considering more possible cuts. "I've told him he'll have all the time he needs," Bush said.
