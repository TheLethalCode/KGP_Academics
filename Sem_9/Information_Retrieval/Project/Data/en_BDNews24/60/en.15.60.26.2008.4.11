<TITLE> Italian small business looks to election wearily </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gianmario Nitti, the burly owner of a cheery osteria in the heart of Rome, is the sort of person the frontrunners in Italy's general election have their eye on. Centre-right candidate Silvio Berlusconi wants to cut his taxes, while rival Walter Veltroni plans to cut down on the piles of paperwork that make running his restaurant a misery. But the harried restaurateur is not holding out much hope that the lot of small business owners like him -- who form the backbone of Italy's economy -- will get any better. "Nothing will happen after these elections -- there are far too many conflicting vested interests," Nitti, 52, sighed as he tallied up lunch checks at a counter stacked with wine bottles. "Change will only happen when someone with a clear project is elected a clear winner but I don't see that happening this time -- there are too many parties to allow for a clear winner." As Italians head to the polls on Sunday and Monday, businesses fear the return of an unstable government that results in little reform and more political deadlock will push them against the wall as the economy slows down sharply. Italy is close to recession, coping less well than its euro zone partners with a surging currency and record high oil prices, forcing Romano Prodi's outgoing government to cut its growth forecast for the year to just 0.6 percent. Analysts say the next government needs to push through sweeping reforms targeting business to help stimulate the economy, but a widely criticised voting system means no party is likely to have a big enough presence in parliament to do so. "There is a very big chance that neither side will have a sufficient majority to govern anyway, which is the worst outcome of all for business," said Riccardo Trezzi, analyst with REF, a Milan-based economic think-tank. IMPLEMENTATION Small businesses -- which form about 95 percent of the Italian economy and are largely clustered in the north -- traditionally have favoured Berlusconi, identifying with his business credentials and tax-cutting promises, says Trezzi. The media tycoon has not forgotten them and promises to abolish the corporate tax IRAP, though analysts like Trezzi say that may be too ambitious and expensive to pull off. But this time the centre-left's Veltroni has also taken aim at business, promising to cut down on the number of permits and applications they need to keep their doors open. Under his plan, Italians will be able to set up a new business within a day. "The centre-right probably offers more in terms of tax cuts for business in general but the centre-left seems to have more specific measures aimed to help small businesses expand and list on the stock market," said Intesa Sanpaolo analyst Paolo Mameli. "As always, implementation will be the key thing. And in Italy there is often a big gulf between promises and what is actually carried out." Roman jewellery shop owner Massimiliano Arriga, 43 knows the feeling. "I don't really believe any of the promises they've all made," he said as he stood inside his small one-room shop. "Small businesses like ours are always on the verge of shutting shop. We have so many taxes to pay and get so little in return -- it's been this way foreve
