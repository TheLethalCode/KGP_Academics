 MANCHESTER, England, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson believes his players are in the ideal frame of mind to meet Premier League title rivals Arsenal on Sunday after qualifying for the Champions League semi-finals. Leaders United will knock Arsenal out of the title race if they win at Old Trafford and leave the Gunners facing a season without silverware following their European exit at Liverpool on Tuesday. Twenty four hours later United completed a 3-0 aggregate win over AS Roma to set up a clash with Barcelona and Ferguson's side will remain on course for a double if they can beat Arsenal and maintain their three-point advantage over Chelsea. "I always viewed the Middlesbrough match as our most difficult game and I wasn't surprised with the performance of Middlesbrough," Ferguson told reporters.

Neville appeared as a late substitute against Roma after almost 13 months out with an ankle injury and other related problems and his every touch was cheered by the Old Trafford crowd. "What he learned is how much he's appreciated by the fans. It was a great reception he got," said Ferguson. "It's good to have the boy back. He's been through a hard time of it with persistent small injuries that were always de-railing him." United illustrated their strength in depth in the win over Roma as Ferguson could afford to rest Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney. Defender Nemanja Vidic will still be missing against Arsenal but should be fit to face Barcelona, while Silvestre's successful comeback following seven months out with a knee injury further increased Ferguson's options. "To have him back just gives us a little bit of extra experience at a very important time of the year for us, so it was a big bonus," the United manager adde
