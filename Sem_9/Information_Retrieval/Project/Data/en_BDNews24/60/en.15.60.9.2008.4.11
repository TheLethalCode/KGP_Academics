<TITLE> Inflation adds to G7 worries on markets crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fresh signs of budding inflation added urgency to a meeting of finance chiefs from rich nations on Friday that aims to agree on how to keep a credit crisis from dragging the global economy into recession. Ahead of an afternoon meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers, British finance minister Alistair Darling urged unity in implementing proposals from a special study group that recommends tougher scrutiny of international banks' risk management activities. "These are uncertain times," he warned. "I want to make the case for urgent action by the world's major economies to deal with what is the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression." Japan on Friday reported the steepest rise in wholesale price inflation in 27 years in March, while the United States said import and export prices surged -- with petroleum import prices up a huge 60 percent in the past year. The persistent inflation pressures are complicating the task for central bankers, who need to balance efforts to keep growth on track with their desire to keep a lid on prices. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said soaring food prices threaten to create a serious future political issue, and the topic was likely to get a lot of attention as finance officials around the globe gather for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on the weekend. The more immediate problem for the G7 is how to handle a hefty set of recommendations from the Financial Stability Forum -- set up in the wake of the 1990s Asian financial crisis -- for tightening bank scrutiny and settling a markets crisis that may cost up to $1 trillion in losses. URGENCY BUILDING There were calls to urgently implement the proposals, which aim in part to ensure banks aren't caught short of cash in future times of stress, as happened in recent months as credit markets seized up. "Today we must commit to implementing the Financial Stability Forum report fully and quickly," Darling said, a sentiment echoed by Steinbrueck. The next step will be to push bankers to match the vigor of the efforts that global central banks have shown in battling the liquidity squeeze by urging these private-sector players to quickly put their losses behind them and resume lending. A select group of bankers has been invited to a dinner on Friday night at the U.S. Treasury Department, following the formal G7 meeting and after a G7 communique has been issued at around 6:30 p.m. (2230 GMT). The G7 comprises the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson clearly stated his position on Thursday that he wants banks to be ready to play their role as a market stabilizer. "If you think you're going to need capital, don't be looking for the government to help you," Paulson said. "If you think you need capital, go raise it." On the eve of Friday's gathering, Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the G7 countries "need to show a clear determination towards stabilizing the financial system." The eight-month-old crisis, which originated in a meltdown of U.S. subprime mortgage markets, ricocheted through the global economy as securities cobbled together on Wall Street from bits and pieces of mortgage loans turned sour. It has now has cast a pall over global economic prospects. The International Monetary Fund said this week it expected the United States to topple into a "mild recession" this year and estimated a 25 percent chance the global economy will grow by 3 percent or less, which would be considered recessionary. TIGHTEN LENDING SCRUTINY The outlines of the FSF's proposals are known: fuller disclosure of risks by banks, more rigid standards for credit rating agencies, measures by central banks to ensure they can effectively pump cash into the system at times of stress. While the focus is clearly on financial-system reform, G7 ministers want to send a message that the global economy is not about to run off the rails. They were expected to give a cold shoulder to European efforts to use the communique to express concern over recent gyrations in currency markets, while repeating boilerplate language that "excess volatility and disorderly" moves were undesirable. "I deplore the excessive volatility of exchange rates," European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday after the euro hit a record peak of $1.5912. Past communiques also have encouraged China to speed up appreciation of its yuan currency, and the pace of the currency's rise has picked up. It crossed 7.00 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday for the first time in more than a decade, although it eased on Friday. The G7 could give a nod to the increased pace of appreciation, which is considered vital to help reduce global economic imbalances, but likely will also urge Beijing to keep the process goi
