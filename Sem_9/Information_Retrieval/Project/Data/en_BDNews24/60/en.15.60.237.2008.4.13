<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's hopes of wresting the league title from Real Madrid suffered another blow on Saturday when they twice surrendered the lead to draw 2-2 at relegation-threatened Recreativo Huelva. Samuel Eto'o put Barca in front at the start of each half but Recreativo's Argentine striker Marco Ruben hit back twice with headed equalisers -- the first a controversial effort that did not appear to cross the line. The draw left Barca six points behind leaders Real Madrid with six games to play but the champions could extend that to nine if they beat struggling Real Murcia at the Bernabeu on Sunday. The Catalans have won just one of their last seven league games and are only a point ahead of Villarreal, who can reclaim second place if they beat or draw with mid-table Almeria on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, surprise package Racing Santander piled the pressure on Ronald Koeman's beleaguered Valencia when a late Mohamed Tchite strike gave them a 2-1 win at the Mestalla. Valencia, who meet Getafe in the King's Cup final on Wednesday, have won just one of their last nine league games and are only six points above the relegation zone in 14th place with almost all of their closest rivals yet to play. They have won only once at the Mestalla in the last five months and have the joint worst home record in the league with basement side Levante. Racing remain in fifth place but are now level on 53 points with Atletico Madrid who visit Valladolid on Sunday. FLYING START Barca, missing the injured Ronaldinho, Bojan Krkic, Thierry Henry, Andres Iniesta and Deco, could not have got off to a better start against Recreativo. Eto'o put them in front with just over a minute on the clock when he headed in at the far post after Giovani dos Santos swept a fine cross in from the right. Recreativo fought back strongly, however, and gave the Barca back four several scares with their quick counter-attacks and had them on the ropes at the end of the half. They equalised in controversial fashion, however, just before the break when the referee awarded a goal after Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes appeared to stop Ruben's header on the line. Barca started the second half as they had begun the first, Eto'o restoring their lead after just over a minute when he sent an unstoppable swerving drive high into the net to take his tally for the season to 14 goals in 14 games. But Recre continued to create problems for the Barca defence and claimed a deserved equaliser that left them four points above the drop zone when Ruben steered an angled header in at the far post after getting behind fullback Eric Abidal. The only positive note for Barca was that Lionel Messi returned to action after over a month out when he came on as a substitute for the final 26 minute
