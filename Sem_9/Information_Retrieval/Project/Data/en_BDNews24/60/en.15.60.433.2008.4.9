 Dhaka,April 9(bdnews24.com)Boosting domestic food production is the lesson to be learnt from the present food crisis, was the unanimous opinion of speakers at a roundtable Wednesday. The discussion on 'Food security and modernisation of agriculture', held on Wednesday at the BRAC Centre Inn, raised a number of suggestions for augmenting food production including improved irrigation, high-yield seeds, modern farm technology, production and use of organic fertilisers, increased agricultural loans and a halt on selling farmlands. Agriculture adviser CS Karim, who participated in the roundtable, assured the speakers that their suggestions would be given due consideration. Professor Abdul Bayes of Jahangirnagar University said: "From this year's food crisis, we have learnt the lesson of augmenting food production." "High-yielding seeds must be preserved for increased paddy production," he said, and further suggested that food stocks in warehouses should also be set up at the union level so that food can be distributed more efficiently. Director of Centre for Policy Dialogue Uttam Kumar Dev said: "Because of bad seeds, our paddy is prone to disease." If quality of seeds can be used rice yields would see significant increases, he said. "An allocation of fifty crore taka should be set aside in the budget for providing quality seeds." Advising modernisation of the irrigation system for increased production and cut in expenditure, the CDP director suggested duty-free import of irrigation pumps on which ten per cent import duty is currently charged. Scientist MA Hamid, of the International Rice Research Institute, said: "Bangladesh could be surplus in food if different varieties of rice strains can be grown properly. Good seeds, good plants, balanced growth of crops and efficient irrigation at the right time can produce six to seven tonnes of food grains per hectare". "We have invented a variety of rice strain which does not get destroyed even after remaining under water for 17 days. This paddy can be cultivated in flood-affected areas of the country." In the case of wheat, Hamid added, the institute was working to produce a variety that is not affected in case of temperature fluctuations. Stressing the importance of organic fertiliser, research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) Asaduzzaman said: "Use of chemical fertilisers destroys soil fertility after 20 to 25 years." "So we must think how the farmers can be motivated to use organic manures like water hyacinth and cow dung." On the same subject, agriculture minister of the previous BNP-led alliance government MK Anowar said: "Use of organic manures cannot be increased without serious intervention of the government." Interest on agriculture loans has to be reduced, the procedure for availability of loans has to be simplified, and organic fertiliser factories must be set up, he said. Motia Chowdhury, a former Awami League agriculture minister, called for subsidy on fertilisers, and suggested digging and reclamation of canals to allow greater access to irrigation water for augmenting production. Assuring the speakers that their suggestions would be given due consideration, agriculture adviser CS Karim said: "From this year, targets for use of organic manures in each upazila will be fixed." He said fertiliser production would be based on the amount of gas production, gas being used in the production of fertilisers. "If gas production cannot be enhanced, it will be difficult to produce more fertiliser by procuring urea from outside." Retired major general Mainul Hossain Chowdhury called for a halt to the sale of agricultural lands. "India has enacted laws to prevent sale of agricultural lands. It has to be stopped here." BRAC executive director Mahbub Hossain moderated the roundtable, organised jointly BRAC and Saptahik 2000. It was presided over by Saptahik 2000 editor Mainul Ahsan Saber. Among the other speakers were field director of the agriculture directorate Shahidul Islam, former chairman of BCIC retired major general Imamuzzaman and professor Abdus Sattar Mandol of Bangladesh Agricultural University. bdnew
