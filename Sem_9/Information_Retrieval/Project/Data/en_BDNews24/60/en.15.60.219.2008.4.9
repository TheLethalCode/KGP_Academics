<TITLE> Paraguay presidential race gets nasty as vote nears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ASUNCION, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguay's presidential race took a nasty turn on Tuesday in the campaign's final stretch, with two leading candidates linking the front-runner to the murder of an ex-president's daughter. Former Roman Catholic bishop Fernando Lugo is leading polls ahead of the April 20 election and poses a real challenge to the ruling Colorado Party, which has held power for 60 years. His clean image as a corruption-fighter and political outsider was put to test by a banned campaign ad put out by rival candidate Lino Oviedo, a retired army general. The advertisement featured the recording of an alleged telephone conversation between Lugo and Osmar Martinez, who was convicted for leading a plot to kidnap and kill the daughter of former President Raul Cubas in 2004. The country's electoral court banned the ad for being slanderous, but it was aired at least once. Lugo has said he did not know Martinez or any of the others involved in the crime, and prosecutors have not found any evidence linking him to the Cubas killing. Several weeks ago, the Colorado Party distributed posters saying "kidnapping already has its cure," in a play on the Spanish word "cura," which means priest, in another bid to link Lugo with the assassination that shocked Paraguayans. The ruling party's candidate, Blanca Ovelar, called Lugo a mentor to several of the kidnappers when he served as bishop. "I don't know if Fernando Lugo has been directly involved in a kidnapping. But there's no doubt Fernando Lugo was a mentor to these guys, and they were his disciples at some point in their lives," Ovelar said. Lugo responded tersely, saying the accusations against him "lacked truth." His allies decried a smear campaign against the center-left candidate. "These accusations are completely devoid of proof ... and since (Lugo's rivals) don't have other arguments to use, they hope to poison the waters," said Anibal Carrillo, a member of the leftist movement Tekojoja, which is supporting Lugo. Lugo is leading a center-left coalition called the Patriotic Alliance for Change, while Oviedo is running on the ticket of the right-wing UNACE party. Ovelar is the first woman to run for president. She is backed by President Nicanor Duarte Frutos, who has repeatedly slammed Lugo in public remarks
