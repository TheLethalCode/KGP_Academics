Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) President Hadi Awang was reported to be in stable condition and could be discharged in the next few days, party secretary-general Kamarudin Jaffar said in a statement. "He is able to talk," Hadi's spokesman Roslan Shahir said.

The opposition, in an unprecedented move, also won power in five of Malaysia's 13 states. PAS, which wants to turn multi-racial Malaysia into an Islamic state, won 23 of the 222 parliamentary seats at stake and dramatically expanded its influence beyond its traditional base in the country's northeast.
