 BRUSSELS, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European business, long seen as a winner from any global trade deal, is worried it could lose out if big developing nations such as India and China refuse to open up their economies, a senior EU business leader said. "We are strong supporters of the World Trade Organisation negotiations because Europe is the most open economy in the world and we are the largest traders in the world," Philippe de Buck, secretary-general of BusinessEurope, said on Friday. "But the longer they go on, the more I hear from some areas of business that there is a little bit of a lack of trust in the process, and that is a worry," he said in an interview. Talks are accelerating before an expected push by ministers of WTO countries in May to settle the long-stalled Doha round. The global trade liberalisation talks were initially billed as a way to fight poverty and boost the world economy. But they have missed a string of deadlines since they were launched in 2001. The round could be delayed by several more years if there is no deal soon, trade officials say, eyeing the change in the U.S. presidency and a new European Commission next year. De Buck said Europe, like developing countries, had its share of problems caused by globalisation, such as jobs moving to parts of the world with cheaper labour costs and soaring trade deficits with new export powerhouses such as China. "If we cannot, at the same time, have some true benefit from globalisation, in a balanced way, then we are the losers." BusinessEurope represents 20 million companies in Europe. Negotiators have made progress recently on sensitive farm issues that are one of the big sticking points. But big differences remain over how far large developing economies will open their markets in industrial goods and services, the main areas of interest for the EU, United States and other developed economies. EU and U.S. businesses worry that a final deal could allow countries such as India, China and Brazil to shield too many sectors from tariff cuts, reducing to almost nothing the new opportunities for them in the round. And because any Doha deal is likely to govern world trade for the next decade or more, some Europeans worry they will have to cut import tariffs on goods such as cars to almost zero while developing countries already emerging as potential leaders in automobiles can fence off their booming markets to imports. As well as carmakers, Europe's textiles, chemicals, paper and non-ferrous metals producers have told EU trade chief Peter Mandelson that the negotiations are too one-sided in favour of developing countries. Mandelson usually faces such criticism from farmers who have long seen themselves as sacrificial lambs in the WTO negotiations. "People are asking themselves what will be in it for us? NAMA means non-agricultural market access, so where is the market access?" De Buck said, referring to the industrial goods pillar of the talks. "Where have we got to? I would say, not fa
