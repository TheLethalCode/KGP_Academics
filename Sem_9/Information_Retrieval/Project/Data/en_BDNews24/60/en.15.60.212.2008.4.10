 LONDON, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices fell from near record highs on Thursday after Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi said markets were well supplied, shrugging off falls in US crude and fuel stocks and bullish Chinese economic data. US crude was down 67 cents to $110.20 a barrel by 10:09 am EDT, having earlier risen to within one cent of the $112.21 record hit in the previous session. London Brent crude was down 40 cents at $108.07 a barrel, having earlier set a new record at $109.98. "The market rallied on the weak dollar and Nigerian problems overnight, but Saudi talk of a market well supplied may have capped it," said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodities Futures Inc. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters in Paris the market was still well supplied and record prices were not due to any lack of oil. "I am not going to pull back. I'm not going to dump crude on the market," Naimi said when asked whether Saudi Arabia might change its output. Despite pleas by consuming nations for OPEC to raise oil production to help cap rising oil prices, its members insist the markets remain well supplied. In Nigeria, liftings of Qua Iboe crude oil are expected to be delayed for the second month in a row, traders said on Thursday. The dollar fell to a record low against the euro on Thursday, but pared losses as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet did not drastically change his growth and inflation views for the euro zone. Inventory data from the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, pushed prices up to new records on Wednesday after it showed US crude oil inventories fell 3.2 million barrels, countering earlier expectations for a build. Gasoline and distillate stocks also fell by more than had been forecast. Adding to the bullish brew earlier on Thursday, China revised up its 2007 GDP growth by 0.5 percent points to 11.9 percent and its currency traded at its strongest level against the dollar in over a decade, underlining China's growing economic power and implying undimmed oil demand. "The crude drop yesterday was a surprise. That is real fundamentals", said Tony Nunan, risk management executive at Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp.. "The Chinese data is bullish. There has not been any clear sign yet that Chinese demand has been hit by the troubles in the US", he said when asked about the significance of the latest data. The acceleration in China's currency strength is partly due to the dollar's weakness in global markets, which has also helped propel oil prices to successive record highs this year
