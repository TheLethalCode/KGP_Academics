 Pristina, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo adopted a state constitution on Wednesday, which will come into force in mid-June when the United Nations completes a handover of powers to the newly independent country and its EU overseers.

Kosovo has been recognised by more than 30 countries, including the United States and most of the 27 EU member states.
