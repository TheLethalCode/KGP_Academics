<TITLE> Spain's Zapatero loses first vote on becoming PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's Congress voted on Wednesday against appointing Socialist Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to a second term in government although he is certain to be sworn in as prime minister again on Friday. Only the Socialist Party voted in favour of Zapatero in the first-round vote on whether to allow the formation of a new government which required an absolute majority to be successful. The Socialists, who won 169 seats in the 350 seat parliament in the March 9 election and are the largest group, are guaranteed victory in the second-round vote on Friday, when only a simple majority is required. Moderate nationalist parties from the Basque Country and Catalonia, which have been negotiating with the government on whether to support legislation over the next four years, all abstained. Zapatero, who faces a dramatically worse economic outlook and a sharp housing downturn, did not have an absolute majority in his first term either but was able to negotiate support for legislation on an ad hoc basis. He is expected to announce his new government as early as the weekend, although many top ministers including Economy Minister Pedro Solbes are likely to keep their current portfolios. The key industry ministry is expected to change hands.
