<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal Wednesday asked the government to pay more attention to overcoming the food crisis. The party said increasing the number of VGF cards, creating jobs for women workers, increasing the number of low-price rice outlets, expanding the food for work schemes and an introduction of food rationing system would help ease the crisis. "The food crisis has turned into a national crisis," JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu told a news conference at Shaheed Colonel Taher Auditorium on Bangabandhu Avenue. "The country has never encountered such a disaster. The government will have to come forward to solve it," Inu said. He advised the government to negotiate with donor agencies for unconditional donation to deal with the situation. Inu also said more allocation for food by cutting revenue expenses could be another option while spending bank savings could also be useful. About the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to allow her to travel abroad for medical treatment, Inu said the government could follow the same example that had been applied to Abdul Jalil. The JSD president said Hasina should be freed and the polls must be held immediately. bdnew
