 GENEVA, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Brazilian drugs manufacturer is supplying yellow fever vaccines to Mali to support the world's first "south-south" mass vaccination campaign, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday. Nearly half of the West African country's 12 million people will receive vaccines during the week-long campaign beginning on Saturday, the WHO said.

The WHO said the risk of yellow fever outbreaks in Mali "will be greatly reduced" after the vaccination campaign. Most of the world's vaccine manufacturers are based in developed economies such as the United States, Britain and France -- France's Sanofi Pasteur will provide the other half of the campaign's vaccinations. The Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunisations (GAVI), a Geneva-based health financing venture supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has provided $58 million to help cut the risk of yellow fever transmission in West Africa. Togo and Senegal have already carried out similar preventive vaccination campaig
