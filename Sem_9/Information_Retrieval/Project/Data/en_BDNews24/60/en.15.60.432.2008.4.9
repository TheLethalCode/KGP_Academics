<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - High food prices and shortages will continue in the near term, making some poorer countries vulnerable to food riots, Jacques Diouf, director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, said on Wednesday. "The problem is very serious around the world due to severe price rises and we have seen riots in Egypt, Cameroon, Haiti and Burkina Faso," he told reporters in New Delhi. Five people have been killed in a week of demonstrations in Haiti over high food prices in the poorest country in the Americas. "There is a risk that this unrest will spread in countries where 50 to 60 percent of income goes to food," Diouf added. He said world cereal stocks were enough to meet eight to 12 weeks demand, while grain stocks were at their lowest since the 1980s. "This is due to higher demand from countries like India, China, where GDP grows at 8-10 percent and the increase in income is going to food," Diouf said after meeting India's agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar. He said he was advising governments to invest in irrigation, storage facilities and rural infrastructure and increase productivity to meet the challenge of food scarcity
