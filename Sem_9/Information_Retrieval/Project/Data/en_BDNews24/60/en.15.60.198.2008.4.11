<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin said Friday that demand for equal rights for women was logical. He said an ideal state and educated nation cannot be built on discriminatory treatment of women. The top judge was speaking as chief guest at the inauguration of a two-day workshop for judges tilted "Justice Systems, Education Initiative on Gender Equality Issues", organised by Khan Foundation at its auditorium in the city. As many as 40 district and sessions judges from different areas of the country joined the workshop. The chief justice said the women's movement for realising their rights was logical and must be accepted. "When half the country's population are women, discriminatory behaviour towards them cannot be accepted," he said. If one is not given one's due, a state cannot maintain law and order, Justice Amin said. Addressing the judges at the workshop, the CJ said the judges have come out of an old concept that a woman victim is not enough as a witness for a case, but a complementary witness is required. "Nowhere is it said in the law that another witness apart from the victim is necessary. Nobody commits crime keeping witnesses on the scene. But there has to be circumstantial evidence," he said. The chief justice said justice cannot be ensured if the mindset is not changed. "Many things cannot be done only by making laws. However, the rule of law has to be strict. The job of a judge is to establish justice." Former minister Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan presided over the event, also attended by Supreme Court Appellate Division judge Mohammad Fazlul Karim. Khan Foundation executive director advocate Roksana Khandaker delivered the address of welcome. bdnews24.c
