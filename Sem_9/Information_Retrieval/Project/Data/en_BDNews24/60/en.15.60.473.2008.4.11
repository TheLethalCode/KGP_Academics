<TITLE> Beslan and nightclubs inspire high-tech exhibition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Artist Mat Collishaw drew inspiration from Russia's Beslan school siege and lighting effects at a nightclub to create his latest, high-tech exhibition "Deliverance". Collishaw, who rose to prominence as part of the "Young British Artists" movement of the 1990s alongside the likes of Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, has installed three moving cameras on the ceiling of a darkened exhibition space. Using powerful bulbs, he flashes images of families and children, often half-naked, dirty, bloodied and apparently fleeing disaster, on to walls covered in fluorescent paint which retains images for seconds, sometimes minutes, before they fade. The green-hue pictures are of varying sizes and are projected randomly on to the gallery walls, and call to mind some of the most haunting news photographs from Beslan, Iraq, Vietnam and other disaster areas and war zones. The pictures are at once fleeting and lingering, as Collishaw seeks to explore how we process news images of desperate people which seem to bombard us through newspapers, on the television and over the Internet. They are at once disturbing and beautiful, as with a large picture of a half-naked, crying child running towards the viewer with arms outstretched and surrounded in a haze reminiscent of old depictions of angels. "The show mimics the turnover of the image," Collishaw said at the Spring House gallery in north London where the show opens on Friday (www.springprojects.co.uk). "I'm not saying this is a bad thing. It stimulates our adrenaline. We like to see these moments of crisis, as it gets our adrenaline flowing." BESLAN TRAGEDY Collishaw, who says he is "either 42 or 43", first got the idea for "Deliverance" from news coverage of the 2004 Beslan school siege in southern Russia during which 333 hostages were killed, half them children. Because the media was on hand as the tragedy unfurled, rather than arriving afterwards as is often the case, the images were more immediate and powerful than usual, he explained. Having got the idea for what kind of images he wanted to recreate, Collishaw devised a mechanism of flashing bulbs and treated walls after seeing the effect achieved at a nightclub. "This is a new medium for me to say what I have been saying before," he said. "I have taken the image away from the documentary context and given it space where it can be emotive and where people can think about it a little more. "We can become de-sensitised by the exposure, but some images do have an aura and I try and bring this back and reintroduce the aura into the situation. Carrying a child is such a simple act but it is also epic as well." Collishaw conceded that his installation was not easily marketable, although it could go to a gallery or large collector interested in new media. But unlike some of his more famous contemporaries, now multi-millionaires on the back of skyrocketing values for their work and the contemporary art market in general, Collishaw has remained relatively obscure. "I'm not making a killing out of this business," he said. "You lose your way if you try to make something to sell." Collishaw said the media had played an important role in building some of his fellow "YBAs" into international stars of the art world. "The media gives people the profile to make money and then the media moves in to say that they are mercenary." "Deliverance" runs until May
