 HONG KONG, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong's blue chips climbed on Thursday as financial stocks gained after top Chinese bank ICBC flagged rosy earnings for the first quarter, but experts say caution will prevail in coming weeks amid persistent concerns of a global economic downturn. Analysts expect the market to remain in a holding pattern for now amid uncertainty ranging from the prospect of China's economy -- a major driver for the city and its stock market -- slowing sharply, to a US recession hammering global growth. "Let me put it this way. The market has lost its sense of direction," said Tony Tong, China Everbright's deputy head of research. "Investors are cautious about the outlook for the economy, no matter if it's the subprime issue or China's economic growth. "Now, investors ... are wondering, what's going on? What's next?" Asia's top oil refiner, Sinopec Corp, slid 1.6 percent to HK$6.90 after crude prices surged above $112 a barrel, squeezing its refining margins as domestic fuel prices are capped by the government. Second-biggest refiner PetroChina closed down 1.8 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.84 percent to 24,187.10. The China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed mainland companies, or H shares, gained 1.04 percent to 12,998.21, just shy of the 13,000 level. Mainboard turnover fell to HK$74.81 billion ($9.61 billion) from HK$83.41 billion, a trend analysts see continuing. "This is a technical rebound after the sell-off over the past two days. There is some bargain-hunting this morning, but we don't see many buying orders in the market," said Y.K. Chan, a strategist at Phillip Securities. "The Shanghai market will have some negative impact on the investment sentiment, but when you consider the fundamentals, people are not that pessimistic on the overall market." He expects the Hong Kong market to trade 100-200 points either side of 24,000 in the short term. China's main stock index ended up 1.7 percent. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the morning's most active stock, rose as much as 2.4 percent after it estimated its net profit in the first quarter rose at least 50 percent. It ended 1.5 percent higher. China Construction Bank jumped 3.7 percent as investors bet it will post rosy 2007 earnings on Friday. Shenhua Energy, the world's biggest coal producer by market value, rose 1.6 percent after Reuters reported that it planned to buy assets worth $1.6 billion from its state parent. And TPV Technology, the world's top market of computer monitors, jumped 5 percent to HK$5.04 after it posted a 19 percent jump in 2007 earnings on higher shipments and said it was targeting a sharp expansion in market share.
