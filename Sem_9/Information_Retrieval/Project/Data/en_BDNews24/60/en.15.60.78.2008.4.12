 BAGHDAD, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US and Iraqi forces killed at least 13 gunmen in battles overnight in Baghdad's Sadr City, the US military said on Saturday. A military statement described a "complex" battle in the eastern Baghdad slum, a stronghold of fighters loyal to Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, which has been blockaded by US and Iraqi forces for two weeks. US forces fired at least one Hellfire missile from drone aircraft and two rounds from the main battle gun of an M1 tank against fighters who targeted them with roadside bombs, rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, the military statement said. Sadr City has been the scene of clashes all week. A Reuters correspondent in the area said locals described the overnight battles as the heaviest since government forces launched an offensive into the slum on April 6
