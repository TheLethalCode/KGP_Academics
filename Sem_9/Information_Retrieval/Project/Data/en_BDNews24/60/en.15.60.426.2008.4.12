<TITLE> Spain`s Zapatero sworn in, names woman at Defence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Madrid, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero was sworn for a second term on Saturday before naming a new cabinet that includes Spain's first woman defence minister and a new post to boost low productivity. "I promise on my conscience and honour to comply faithfully with the obligations of Prime Minister," Zapatero said, his right hand on a copy of the constitution in front of King Juan Carlos during a ceremony at the Zarzuela palace near Madrid. Later, Zapatero named the pregnant Carme Chancon as Spain's first female defence minister, moving her from the Housing Ministry, and he installed Miguel Sebastian, his former chief economic adviser, as industry minister. Women outnumber men for the first time a Spanish cabinet -- nine to eight -- continuing the reformist bent of the Socialist government which was re-elected on March 9. One of them, Bibiana Aido, becomes Spain's first Equality Minister and at 31 years old, the youngest to sit at the cabinet table. Announcing his rejigged team, Zapatero stressed the importance of a new Science and Innovation Ministry, headed by Cristina Garmendia, which is designed to wean Spain off its dependence on construction and to nurture hi-tech industries. "It should help our economy grow more but above all, grow better," the prime minister said during a news conference. Spain has one of the eurozone's lowest productivity growth rates and the now-shrinking construction sector will drag economic growth down to just 1.8 percent in 2008 according to the International Monetary Fund -- less than half that enjoyed last year. MR ENERGY Sebastian's appointment at industry, a portfolio which includes the energy sector, is significant not only because of the role he is widely thought to have played in the two year takeover battle for power utility Endesa, but also the pivotal role he will play any further sector shakeup. Sebastian is thought to have opposed a counter-bid for Endesa from Germany's E.ON and backed eventual winners, Italian utility Enel and Spanish infrastructure group Acciona. Analysts speculate that because Sebastian is not a Catalan -- the first industry minister in over a decade not to come from the northern region -- he will not look so favourably on a rumoured tie up between Catalonia-based Gas Natural and Iberdrola, Spain's largest utility. That in turn might ease a possible bid for Iberdrola from France's state-controlled utility EDF. Speculation is rife that Zapatero has already given EDF the green light to bid for Iberdrola during a recent summit with France's Nicolas Sarkozy. The Socialists were re-elected with 169 seats in parliament -- 7 short of an absolute majority -- and will have to rely on the support of regional or left-wing parties to push through their legislative agenda. The failure to appoint a Catalan industry minister may irk moderate Catalan nationalist party CiU, which is the only single group in parliament with enough seats to help the Socialists pass legislation. The widely-respected Pedro Solbes, 65, continues as economy minister, but in contrast to conditions four years ago, this time he faces inflation at 4.5 percent, much lower growth and unemployment which will grow by 800,000 over the next two years according to Spain's largest business group.
