 Frankfurt, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell in early trade on Wednesday, led by financials such as UK mortgage lender HBOS on a brokerage downgrade, and miners which slipped after acquisition talk around BHP Billiton dissipated. By 0910 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.5 percent at 1,312.01 points, having fallen 0.8 percent on Tuesday. US and Asian stock markets also fell. "There's no driver that would take the markets up," said Steffen Neumann, analyst at German bank LBBW. "The corporate news flow from the United States is mainly negative and that is affecting sentiment here (in Europe)." Neumann pointed to US package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, which on Tuesday lowered its quarterly earnings outlook, citing deteriorating US economic conditions and high fuel costs. In Europe, UPS rivals Deutsche Post and TNT saw their shares fall 1.6 percent and 2 percent respectively. "The profit warning of UPS is short-term bad news for the European express companies, specifically Deutsche Post with their significant US operations," ING analyst Axel Funhoff said in a note, adding that TNT was less affected as it has no US operations of its own. Ericsson shares reversed losses to trade up 0.33 percent after the company denied market talk that it was going to issue a profit warning. It was due to hold a news conference at 0930 GMT in connection with its annual meeting. Shares in BHP Billiton fell 2 percent, leading miners lower after a source close to top management at China's Baosteel Group says he was not aware of any move to buy a stake in the world's biggest miner. The Australian newspaper had quoted unnamed sources in Beijing as saying China was "in the early stages of planning to snare a bigger chunk of BHP than the 9 percent stake in rival Rio Tinto it bought with U.S.-based Alcoa for $15 billion in a stock market raid in February." HBOS fell 2.7 percent after Credit Suisse cut the stock to "underperform" and slashed its price target to 565 pence from 890 pence. "In an environment of a weakening housing and mortgage market, and the many different ways that it affects HBOS, we do not see how the shares can sustain any significant recovery for now," Credit Suisse said in a note. In fresh examples of financial sector woes, US company Washington Mutual Inc said on Tuesday it expects a large quarterly loss, and German regulator BaFin suspended the operations of the small Weserbank, calling for insolvency proceedings after Weserbank was unable to cover operating costs. MATERIAL VALUE IN BANKS But JPMorgan, citing an improving mark-to-market environment based on synthetic indices, reduced its estimate for writedowns to be booked in 2008 by continental European wholesale banks to 21.4 billion euros ($33.67 billion) from 25.2 billion euros earlier. "There is material value within the banking universe and a probability of capital raising is already priced into some banks," JPMorgan said in a European equity research note. The DJ Stoxx European insurance index was down 1.3 percent and the banking index fell 1 percent. "The financials will remain volatile anyway, but more news like what Washington Mutual said won't have much effect any longer," said Giuseppe-Guido Amato, strategist at Lang & Schwarz brokerage in Duesseldorf. Shares in Banesto dropped 0.9 percent even though the Spanish retail bank reported a net profit of 217.6 million euros in the first quarter, up 16.1 percent and slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts. European companies scheduled to report earnings later in the day include British jewellery retailer Signet Group and Swiss glue and chemicals maker Sika. "The corporate earnings reports, especially for non-financials, will be very important in determining whether we'll see pressure on share prices also from that front," Amato said. Two sets of economic data released on Wednesday highlighted the resilience of European economies in contrast with the United States, which according to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting could see economic contraction over the first six months of the year. Germany's trade surplus unexpectedly widened to 16.4 billion euros in February, beating market consensus, from 16.1 billion euros in January. And British factory output grew faster than expected in February, by 0.4 percent on the month, above forecasts for a 0.1 percent gain. On the year, factory output rose 1.9 percent -- the strongest annual rate since December 20
