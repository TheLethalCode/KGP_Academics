 LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pan-European electrical goods retailer DSG International issued its second profit warning in three months on Thursday, saying it was increasingly having to cut prices to maintain sales. The group, whose store chains include Currys and PC World in Britain, UniEuro in Italy and Elkjop in Nordic countries, said it now expected annual underlying profit before tax to be within a range of 200 million to 210 million pounds ($394-414 million). At a profit warning in January, DSG signalled underlying profit would be around 250 million pounds. "The trading environment since we last reported has remained challenging across our markets, particularly in the UK, Italy and Spain," Chief Executive John Browett said in a statement. "Whilst like-for-like sales patterns are broadly in line with those we reported over the Christmas period, it is clear that customers have become increasingly promotion and deal driven, impacting gross margins," he added. Like-for-like sales were down 1 percent in the 25 weeks to April 5, while like-for-like gross margins were down around 0.8 percent in the period. Shares in DSG closed at 65 pence on Wednesday, valuing the company at around 1.17 billion pounds
