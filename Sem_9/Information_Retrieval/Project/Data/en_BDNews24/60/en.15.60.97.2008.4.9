 TBILISI, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia on Tuesday complained to the Russian ambassador in Tbilisi about friendly ties between Moscow and a rebel Georgian region. Moscow sent Abkhazia a letter asking it to repatriate 35 Russian nationals now in an Abkhazian prison. The move could damage relations between Georgia and its former colonial master Russia, which have improved this year after dropping to near an all time low after a spy row in 2006. "We'd like to draw the attention of the international community to another provocative step from Russia over Abkhazia," Georgia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "The Russian Justice Ministry's letter should be regarded as a part of Russia's destructive policy aimed at legitimisation of separatist regimes and their complete economic, legal and political integration into Russia," the Georgian Foreign Ministry said. Abkhazia lies on the western edge of Georgia. It borders Russia to the north and the Black Sea. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 Abkhazian separatists threw off Georgian rule. Russia provides aid and other support for both Abkhazia and the second rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia and has increased friendly rhetoric since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia earlier this year. Critics of Kosovo's declaration have said it gives other breakaway regions an incentive to declare independence. "There are many Russian citizens in Abkhazia and such legal actions are necessary for protection of their interests," Vyacheslav Kovalenko, Russian ambassador to Georgia, told journalists after meeting Georgian Foreign Minister David Bakradze, who handed him a note of protest. President Mikhail Saakashvili came to power in Georgia after a peaceful 2003 revolution. He won a presidential election in January and his party faces a parliamentary election next month. He has steered Georgia towards membership of the Western military pact NATO, angering Moscow. But this year ties have improved and a direct flight between Tbilisi and Moscow restarted
