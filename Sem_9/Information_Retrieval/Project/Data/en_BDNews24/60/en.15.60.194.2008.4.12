 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com) - An Islamist outfit Saturday threatened to wage a vigorous movement if the proposed national women development policy was not cancelled by April 17. Islamic Constitution Movement (Islami Shashantantra Andalan) demanded resignation of adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury by the deadline. The threat came from a rally, followed by formation of a human chain, at the north gate of Baitul Mokarram, the national mosque. Rezaul Karim, president of the ICM, warned that the government would be forced to fulfil their demands through extensive movement if it had not met those. Hundreds of workers of the outfit assembled at the mosque before Asr prayers and joined hands from Paltan intersection to Dainik Bangla intersection after the prayers. They stood along the road for 20 minutes. "We are observing our programme peacefully. Our brothers came here with preparation. They are ready to spill their blood, they will sacrifice life if needed," he said. Traffic on the road from Paltan intersection to Dainik Bangla intersection was off due to the human chain. Shops and offices along the road were kept closed on speculation of violence. Around 200 people were injured in clashes between Islamist hardliners and police Thursday and Friday near the national mosque. bdnew
