<TITLE> Colombia vote delay threatens US trade agenda: USTR </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A move by congressional Democrats to delay action on a free trade agreement with Colombia could have a "devastating effect" on U.S. ability to negotiate trade deals, the top U.S. trade official said on Wednesday. "I can't imagine the Democratic leadership would change the rules in the middle of the game," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab told reporters in response to news that U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seeking to indefinitely delay a vote on the Colombia trade pact. Changing trade promotion authority rules to eliminate the 90-day deadline for a congressional decision on the Colombia agreement would be in essence a vote against the agreement itself, Schwab said.
