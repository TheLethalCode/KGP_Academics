<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Thursday adjourned to Apr 15 the hearing of a case against Sheikh Hasina involving the awarding of "illegal contracts" for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her 1996-2001 term as prime minister. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 resumed hearing defence lawyers' pleas Thursday to clear Sheikh Hasina of charges. The former prime minister was taken to court from special jail Thursday morning to face charges implicating her in the graft case filed by the ACC last year. Defence counsel has been arguing for acquitting Hasina of all charges in the case that is being tried under emergency powers rules. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people including Hasina. The antigraft body accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews24.
