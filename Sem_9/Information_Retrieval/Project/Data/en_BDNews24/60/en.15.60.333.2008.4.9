 CHICAGO, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AMR Corp's American Airlines said on Wednesday it canceled about 850 flights to conduct safety inspections of its MD-80 aircraft. Wednesday's cancellations follow about 460 on Tuesday. An airline spokesman said there were about 30 MD-80s in service on Wednesday morning and more were expected to resume flying later in the day. "The situation is fluid though, and that is why we have gone ahead and canceled the 850," spokesman Tim Wagner said. "We do not know at this point if that number will climb, but it might." American, the largest U.S. airline, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration raised new concerns about recent wiring inspections of the narrowbody MD-80 aircraft that resulted in canceled flights two weeks ago. MD-80s make up nearly half of AMR's fleet. The inspections are part of an industrywide FAA review of airline compliance with agency safety directives. Several carriers have grounded aircraft as a result of the audit, which was triggered by inspection and maintenance lapses at Southwest Airlines Co . The American inspections relate to a 2006 FAA order to ensure that wiring in MD-80 wheel wells is properly installed and secured. AMR shares were down 2.71 percent at $10.04 on the New York Stock Exchange.
