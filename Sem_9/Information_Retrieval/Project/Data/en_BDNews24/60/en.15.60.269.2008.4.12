 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)One intriguing story flashed on a news site on a dull Saturday: a cabinet member messaged a senior Awami League leader by thumb for talks. It is the short messaging service or SMS that limits a single text to 160 characters, enough for an initiated user to write all he has to say. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman sent an SMS to acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman, inviting him to informal talks for Sunday at state guesthouse Padma in the lead-up to formal dialogue. Asked why he did so anyway, the adviser said what he had done was in discussion with the AL. And surely did the AL high-ups accept the invitation by mobile text. With the AL recognising it as formal or not, tapping out messages to peoplemostly coworkers or the loved onesis now all the rage in Bangladesh. Office workers, trapped in boring meetings with their bosses, whip out their trusty mobile phones and write their colleagues just across the table: YOU LOOK GREAT TODAY or HOW WAS YOUR DINNER LAST NIGHT? Mobile text messaging is not all about trivial and superficial things in life. At least the adviser proved so when the AL insisted on the government being formal in invitation. "Salam, meeting with your party representative set for tomorrow 13 April 5:30pm at (state guesthouse) Padma. Hossain Zillur Rahman," the adviser's SMS reads. The talks planned for Sunday are crucial as they are meant to narrow the ever-widening gap between the government and the AL, which is arguably the most powerful political party but now in deep crisis with its chief Sheikh Hasina behind bars on corruption charges. SMS can be a carrier of breaking news and a reliable tool of news gathering. Apart from the normal delivery of news on the Web, bdnews24.com runs an SMS news service. Users get news on their mobiles, even on the move or wherever they are. SMS is a cheaper method of communication as 160 characters take up as much room as a one-second voice call. Messages are delivered immediately or when the phone is turned on. The world is moving into an age when a mouse, keyboard and keypad are dearer to people than the nimble pen. It is a slow and painful death of traditional writing. But people still writewith a keypad or a keyboard. More and more people are riding on the wave of click and type. More and more people are drifting from the world of the once mighty pen into the fast-paced world of the fingers constantly working on keys. The thumb is the king of the world. bd
