<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com) Thursday's High Court verdict cancelling Khaleda Zia's writ petition has deprived BNP of a fair deal, Khandakar Delwar Hossain told reporters after the ruling. "The High Court verdict denied the mainstream BNP justice," BNP's Khaleda-nominated secretary general said. Khaleda filed the petition to challenge the validity of the Election Commission's letter to BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed inviting the party's 'reformist' faction led by acting chairman M Saifur Rahman to talks on electoral reform. "As Khaleda Zia herself had filed the writ petition, the next steps in this regard will have to be taken after consultation with lawyers," Delwar said. He called upon the party leaders and activists to forge a strong leadership network under BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. Delwar alleged: "I've said it in the past too, that conspirators have been active against BNP and the countrywhat has happened so far is only a part of those conspiratorial machinations." "But I'm sanguine that our conscientious countrymen will not identify themselves with such black designs." The press briefing was also attended by BNP acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and former lawmaker Selim Reza Habib, among others. bdnews24.
