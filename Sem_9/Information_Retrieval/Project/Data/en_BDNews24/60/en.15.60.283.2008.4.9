 BRASILIA, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil might not extradite Colombian drug lord Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia to face drug and other charges in the United States, the justice minister said on Tuesday. Abadia, who the United States says was one of the most powerful leaders of Colombia's cocaine cartels, was sentenced in Brazil last week to 30 years in prison on drug charges. The government must now decide whether to extradite him to face racketeering and other charges in the United States or whether he should serve sentence in Brazil. "We will decide what is best to combat narco-trafficking here in Brazil, and also in the Americas," Tarso Genro told Reuters in an interview. In the United States, Abadia is also accused of drug trafficking and ordering the killings of 15 people. Abadia had valuable information on other people being investigated in Brazil and there was a 50 percent chance he would not be handed over the United States, Genro said. "We need to evaluate whether his leaving would harm that type of investigation," he said. Genro who will make a recommendation for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to decide the case in coming weeks. Confiscated goods that had belonged to the 44-year-old Abadia and his wife, including vintage port and a vast shoe collection, were sold at a Sao Paulo auction on Tuesday
