 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League has decided not to sit with the government for further talks without an invitation by "formal letter", a senior AL leader said Wednesday. The decision was taken at a presidium meeting at acting AL president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home Wednesday night, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the two-hour meeting. The AL leader said education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had asked the party earlier in the day by phone for a second informal meeting, set for Thursday at state guesthouse Padma. "We said we would agree if the invitation was made through a formal letter," Ashraful said. He said the AL would decide who to join the further talks, only after receiving a formal letter from the government. Fiver caretaker government advisers held the first round of informal talks with the AL at Rail Bhaban on Wednesday. bdnews
