<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will certainly look to put up a challenge when the Tigers take on hosts Pakistan in the second one-day international at Faisalabad's Iqbal Stadium Friday. Bangladesh faced a massive 152-run defeat to Pakistan in the five-match series opener Tuesday in Lahore with the batsmen throwing away their wickets in the day-night affair. Bangladesh will hope the players have learnt fast from their mistakes in the first game, especially the rash shots played by batsmen from the word go, and will fare better this time around. The team management should also consider the inclusion of a genuine pacer in the side, especially after the spinners failed to prove themselves in the series opener to allow the hosts go beyond the 300-mark. After the match, captain Mohammad Ashraful also admitted that they missed service from a genuine pacer in the match as the Bangladesh side took only pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who proved himself taking two wickets. The Tigers had net practice in two groups Thursday at the Faisalabad Iqbal Stadium after reaching Faisalabad from Lahore on Wednesday. Thought the training was optional for all the batsmen, the players decided to practice at the Iqbal Stadium nets. The playing eleven for the match will be declared before the match with one change likely to the team that played in the first ODI, according to the tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. The game gets underway at 3pm local time (4pm Bangladesh Standard time) with satellite channel TEN Sports telecasting the match live from the venue. On the other hand, Pakistan will want to advance with winning the second match as their skipper Shoaib Malik has stated the series against Bangladesh was 'not a time-pass series.' Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan, Farhad Reza, Dhiman Ghosh (wicketkeeper), Mahmudullah Riyad, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Zunaed Siddique, Roqibul Hassan, Nazim Uddin and Shahadat Hossain. Pakistan: Shoaib Malik (captain), Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal (wicketkeeper), Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Rao Iftikhar Anjum, Sohail Khan, Wahab Riaz, Fawad Alam, Bazid Khan and Sarfraz Ahmed (wicketkeeper).
