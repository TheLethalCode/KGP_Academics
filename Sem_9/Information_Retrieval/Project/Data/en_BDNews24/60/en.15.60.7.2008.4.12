<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will have to turn to nuclear-generated power in future to get over energy shortfalls, the chief adviser's special assistant M Tamim said Saturday. "We cannot only depend on gas or coal for power production. We must go for nuclear power in future," said Tamim, special aide for energy, power and mineral resources, during an exchange of views at the Press Institute of Bangladesh at Kakrail in the city. Dependence on gas must be reduced for development, Tamim said. "We have to diversify our energy sources." The Bogra-based Bangla-language daily Korotoa organised the discussion meeting on "The energy sector in Bangladesh and development of the northern region". Tamim said some 1,000 megawatts would be added to the national grid by yearend, making available a total of 5,000 MW in supply. "We will need an additional 24 TCF (trillion cubic feet) gas by 2025 if we were to increase GDP by seven percent," he said. "We will also have to ensure the production of 18,000 MW power by that time." The special aide stressed curbing regional discrimination, saying: "We have to create equal opportunity for all regions to take the country forward." bdnews24.com
