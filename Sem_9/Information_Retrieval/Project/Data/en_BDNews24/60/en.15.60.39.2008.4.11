 TEHRAN, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran said on Friday it had installed over 490 centrifuges at its Natanz uranium enrichment complex, the official IRNA news agency reported, defying international demands that it halt the sensitive nuclear work. The West fears Iran is trying to covertly produce nuclear bombs under cover of a civilian programme, and the U.N. security Council has imposed three sets of sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt uranium enrichment work. "Three new cascades of 164 centrifuges have been installed in Natanz facility and are working," an unnamed official told IRNA. "These centrifuges are P1 type." Iran launched 3,000 centrifuges, a basis for industrial scale enrichment, in the Natanz facility last year. But they are a 1970s-vintage design prone to breakdown. Iran says it has begun testing an advanced version in Natanz's pilot wing. Tehran on Tuesday said it had begun installing 6,000 new centrifuges at Natanz. Diplomats in Vienna told Reuters last week Iran had begun installing advanced centrifuges in the central Iran facility, speeding up activities that could give Tehran means to make atom bombs in future if it chooses. Iran, the world's fourth largest oil exporter says it wants nuclear technology only to generate electricity. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel in power plants or provide material for nuclear weapons if refined much further. The deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said on Friday Iran did not face any "technical problems" in expanding its nuclear activities. "There are no technical problems regarding the development of centrifuges," Mohammad Saeedi told IRNA, denying some reports that Iran was experiencing difficulties in utilising its centrifuges to full capacity. Iran plans to have 50,000 centrifuges to help produce fuel for a planned network of power plan
