 London, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The first three men to be charged in connection with the July 7, 2005 London suicide bombings appeared at Kingston Crown Court on Thursday, accused of scouting for targets. Mohammed Shakil, 31, Sadeer Saleem, 27, and Waheed Ali, 24, all shared common beliefs with the bombers, the court heard. Prosecutors gave the following overview of the 7/7 bombings: The four suicide bombers got on a train at Luton station at about 7:25 a.m. after driving down from Leeds and Aylesbury earlier that morning. Each was carrying rucksacks containing their bombs. They arrived at 8:25 at Kings Cross where they went down into the underground. They then separated towards their respective targets. They were all caught on CCTV, which was shown to the Kingston jury. At around 8:50, Mohammed Sidique Khan detonated his bomb on a westbound Circle Line train shortly after it left Edgware Road for Paddington. That explosion killed Khan and six passengers. At the same time, Shezhad Tanweer detonated his bomb on an eastbound Circle Line train which had just left Liverpool Street station bound for Aldgate. The bomb blast killed Tanweer and seven others. Dozens more were injured. CCTV footage played to the jury, and revealed in public for the first time, showed the train leaving the platform before smoke then smoke billowed from the tunnel. Meanwhile the third bomber, Jermaine Lindsay, detonated his bomb on a westbound Piccadilly Line train deep between King Cross and Russell Square. Photographs showed to the jury showed the side of the carriage had been completely blown away. That attack killed the most people with 26 commuters losing their lives. Prosecutors said the fourth bomber, Hasib Hussain, had problems with his device. The court was shown extensive CCTV footage showing him travelling on several underground lines before buying what prosecutors said appeared to be a battery. Hussain finally detonated his bomb on a No. 30 bus in Tavistock Square, central London just before 10 a.m. He and 13 others were killed in that explosion.
