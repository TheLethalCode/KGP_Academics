 Jakarta, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's anti-graft agency began questioning a central bank deputy governor on Friday, a day after the outgoing governor was detained in a high-profile case that has hit morale at the battered bank. The agency on Thursday detained outgoing Bank Indonesia (BI) chief Burhanuddin Abdullah, who had been named as a suspect in a case where a foundation linked to the central bank illegally paid parliament members. He has denied any wrongdoing. An agency spokesman, Johan Budi, said the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) questioned Budi Mulya, BI deputy governor in charge of foreign exchange and money markets, as a witness in the case. He gave no details. Abdullah is one of the most senior officials to be detained in the fight against corruption, which deters many investors from committing money to Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Chief economics minister Boediono, who has been appointed as the next central bank governor, told legislators during a parliamentary hearing on Monday that the probes into Bank Indonesia had hurt morale and could affect its ability to carry out monetary policy. The bank has undergone a series of reforms following various probes in the past decade, particularly over its controversial role in lending billions of dollars in emergency funds to banks at the height of the 1997-98 financial crisis. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono came to power vowing to tackle rampant corruption. Officials ranging from a former religious affairs minister to a governor of Aceh province have been jailed under Yudhoyono's graft campaign and a number of top central bank officials are suspects in a high-profile case involving suspected illegal payments to members of parliament. Critics argue the government's anti-corruption campaign has shied away from taking on powerful vested interests. Separately, BI deputy governor Hartadi Sarwono, who met Boediono to discuss the graft investigation, reiterated earlier remarks from the central bank that the investigation would not affect its operations. "In the event that the governor is unable to do his job, we are ready. The procedure is there so to enable BI to continue to do its monetary and banking supervision roles," Sarwono told reporters. KPK, a special government body that was set up to investigate top government officials and business executives for graft, has legal powers to make an arrest, take over investigations and fast-track sensitive cases. Experts often rank Indonesia as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. It ranked 143rd out of 179 nations in 2007 with a corruption index of 2.3, dropping from 2.4 in 2006, according to Transparency International. A lower index signals worse corruption, with 0 being the most corrupt and 10 the cleanest.
