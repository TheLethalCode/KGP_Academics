<TEXT>
 HARARE, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambia on Wednesday called an emergency meeting of southern African leaders to discuss the impasse after Zimbabwe's elections with no sign the result of the presidential poll would be released soon. A political stalemate over the release of results has raised fears of violence as President Robert Mugabe tries to find a way out of the biggest challenge since he took power after independence from Britain in 1980. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa, who chairs the Southern African Development Community, said in Lusaka the crisis required a concerted effort by the region, intervening for the first time since the March 29 elections. The summit is scheduled for Saturday. "Because of the deepening problems in the country, I felt that this matter should be dealt with at presidential level," said Mwanawasa, explaining that he had earlier thought a regional assessment mission might have sufficed. Morgan Tsvangirai's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has accused Mugabe of trying to steal the poll and called on African states to prevent Zimbabwe from sliding into bloodshed. Zimbabwe's steep economic decline, which Mugabe's critics blame on him, has sent millions of Zimbabweans into neighbouring states. The region fears even more severe consequences if the crisis worsens further. A lawyer for Zimbabwe's electoral commission said on Wednesday it would be "dangerous" for the High Court to order the release of presidential election results, as demanded by the opposition MDC. The MDC has gone to court to try to force out the result, saying Tsvangirai has won and should be declared president, ending Mugabe's 28-year rule. QUIET DIPLOMACY The former African liberation hero is trying to delay the result announcement, pending a recount, to give him time to prepare for a probable runoff against Tsvangirai. South African President Thabo Mbeki had been asked by the regional bloc to mediate between Mugabe and the opposition. But the MDC had said Mbeki's "quiet diplomacy" failed. Critics dismiss SADC as a talkshop and analysts doubt the grouping, which has avoided strong action against Mugabe, could step in and ease the post-election tensions. But Jacob Zuma, leader of the ruling party in Zimbabwe's powerful neighbour South Africa, has joined a chorus of demands for the release of the results. Zuma, who rivals President Thabo Mbeki as the most powerful man in South Africa and is the frontrunner to succeed him in 2009, told the Star newspaper: "I think the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission should have announced results by now." A lawyer for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, told the judge: "It would be dangerous in my view to give an order because it might not be complied with ... because of outside exigencies which the party (ZEC) will be unable to control." Lawyer George Chikumbirike did not elaborate but appeared to be referring to rising tension because of the impasse. Western powers led by former colonial ruler Britain and the United States have been calling for the result since last week but South Africa has much greater influence as the regional power that has tried to mediate in the Zimbabwe crisis. In the strongest EU criticism yet of the handling of the elections, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he was "very concerned" by delays in the release of results of the presidential poll. "One thing should be made very clear to Mr Mugabe and his entourage: the people of Zimbabwe want a change, they want democracy, they want freedom, they want to be able to tackle poverty and the economic chaos they are living through," he told a news conference in Brussels on EU development aid policies. Chikumbirike declined to say how far the ZEC had gone in preparing to announce the result, saying this was privileged information which "the commission has entitlement to release when it's ready". Zimbabwe's third presidential candidate, ruling party defector Simba Makoni also urged the urgent release of the outcome.
