 MILAN, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's ailing economy will limit room to manoeuvre on policy for its next government, as shown by similarities in the main political programmes, a senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service said on Friday. Italians vote on Sunday and Monday to elect a government that will have to face the unpleasant combination of a sharp slowdown in growth and record-high inflation, in a country where wages are among the lowest in Europe. Alexander Kockerbeck said the targets set by the two main candidates in their programmes pointed in the right direction, but the problem would be the next government's ability to achieve them. "If the outcome (of the vote) is unclear, the risk is a delay in carrying out necessary reforms," Kockerbeck told Reuters in a phone interview. Plagued by stagnant productivity, Italy has underperformed its peers for at least a decade. The International Monetary Fund slashed its growth forecast for Italy this week to 0.3 percent for 2008. Conservative Silvio Berlusconi, seeking a third term as prime minister, has been consistently ahead of centre-left candidate Walter Veltroni in opinion polls. But up to a third of the 47 million eligible voters are expected to choose at the last minute. The outgoing centre-left government ruled Italy with a two seat majority in the Senate and as the electoral system remains the same, there is a risk of another uncertain outcome in the upper house of parliament. "One could imagine cooperation (between the two main parties) as their objectives are pretty close", Kockerbeck said, citing the example of Germany's Grand Coalition. Both Veltroni and Berlusconi have repeatedly denied the possibility of a joint government after the elections but newspapers have speculated that could be the outcome as both candidates have run unusually polite campaigns. Both parties pledge to cut Italy's public debt while easing tax pressure and pushing liberalisation in the services sector. "I looked at the two programmes and they seemed to confirm that margins for manoeuvre are limited," Kockerbeck added. Italy's debt is rated 'Aa2' with a stable outlook by Moody's. Kockerbeck said a stabilisation in the level of the country's public debt warranted the stable outlook, but it was still too early to say whether the trend was under control in the medium term. Italy's debt fell to 104 percent of GDP in 2007 from 106.5 percent the previous year -- still well above European targets. "The latest positive data on debt and deficit are neutral in terms of their impact on the ratings because we saw them more as cyclical than structura
