<TITLE> Democrats say Iraq diverts focus from al Qaeda </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States cannot defeat the real threat to its security posed by al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan while it remains tied down in Iraq, Democrats told the top US officials on Iraq on Wednesday. In a second day of testimony to Congress, Gen. David Petraeus, US commander in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker said an increase of combat power had reduced violence and that Iraqi factions were moving, if slowly, toward reconciliation. But Democrats said President George W. Bush, who began the war five years ago and who will leave office in January with more than 100,000 troops still there, had failed to focus on the bigger threat of al Qaeda from the Afghan-Pakistan border. "Protecting this nation from direct attack is job number one, yet our allocation of forces does not match this imperative," said Rep. Ike Skelton, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. "The effort in Iraq, however important, is putting at risk our ability to decisively defeat those most likely to attack us," the Missouri Democrat said. Petraeus, however, said al Qaeda leaders "still view Iraq as the central front in their global strategy, (and) send funding, direction and foreign fighters to Iraq." He said relentless pressure must be maintained to keep al Qaeda from regrouping in Iraq. "There are those who look at Iraq and Afghanistan as two independent battles," said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "But they cannot be separated. We must look at them in an integrated manner in the same way the radicals look at them as intertwined," the Florida Republican said. FINANCIAL BURDEN An increase in violence has driven Iraq back to the forefront of US campaigns for the November presidential elections. While Democrats used the hearings to criticize the Bush administration's war policy, Petraeus and Crocker also heard criticism from Republicans angry that Iraq had not taken on a greater share of the conflict's cost. Crocker said he understood the concern. But he said he did not know if the United States would require Iraq to take on a larger share of the cost in the formal strategic framework document being drafted to define the two states' relationship. "Let me make the suggestion that the next time we ask you the question the answer is yes," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican. "If not, there's going to be trouble on the Republican side as well as the Democratic side in getting support for an ongoing conflict." The United States has 160,000 troops in Iraq after boosting the force last year in a bid to reduce violence enough to allow Iraqi lawmakers to enact measures seen as critical to long-term stability. The Pentagon has begun to pull about 20,000 of those extra combat troops out. Once that pullout is finished in July, the US force in Iraq will stand at 140,000, officers have said. Then Petraeus plans to freeze force levels for 45 days before assessing whether the security situation will allow more reductions. On Wednesday, he said security in four or five areas might allow more troops to come home. He also said he did not expect to ask for more troops even if security deteriorated in Iraq, noting, "That would be a pretty remote thought in my mind." While last year's buildup helped reduce attacks and casualties dramatically, violence has climbed again in recent weeks and the breathing space created by the troop increase did not produce all the political gains promised by Bush. IRAQI BENCHMARKS Crocker said Iraq had met or made significant progress on about a dozen of the 18 benchmarks set by US lawmakers to measure the Iraqi government's performance. Among the unmet benchmarks, Iraq has not held provincial elections or passed laws to share oil revenues equitably among Iraqi people. Crocker said such sharing was going on anyway. The Bush administration will submit an updated progress report on benchmarks next week, Crocker said. Even if there are additional troop withdrawals later this year, the United States will likely have 130,000 troops, perhaps more, when Bush leaves office in January 2009. Bush met with members of Congress from both parties on Wednesday to discuss Iraq and was to make a speech on the situation there on Thursday morning
