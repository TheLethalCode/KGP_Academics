<TEXT>
 Beijing, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Chinese court on Friday sentenced former Shanghai Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu to 18 years in prison for corruption, media said. The No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in the northern port city of Tianjin found Chen guilty of taking bribes and abuse of power, Caijing magazine said on its Web site (www.caijing.com.cn). He has been held since 2006. He has 10 days to appeal. Chen was mired in a snowballing scandal over the misuse of social security funds in China's financial hub, which has implicated more than a dozen senior officials and businessmen. Chen, who lost his seat in the Communist Party's decision-making Politburo, is the highest-ranking Chinese official imprisoned for corruption in a decade. Chen Xitong was sacked as Beijing Party boss in 1995 and jailed for 16 years for graft in 1998. Caijing said Chen was cleared of a charge of dereliction of duty. "The court has accepted part of the defence by Chen's lawyers," Caijing said.
