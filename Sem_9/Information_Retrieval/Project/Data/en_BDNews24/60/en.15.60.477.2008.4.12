 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Salman Butt blazed a fifty to steer Pakistan home, inflecting a convincing seven-wicket defeat to Bangladesh in the rain-curtailed second match at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad Friday. The hosts, who took a 2-0 lead in five-ODI series, reached 160 for three with 10 balls to spare, chasing a revised target of 158 in 25 overs. Bangladesh ended up with 225 for eight in 48.2 overs as rain halted play with 10 balls to go and Pakistan were set to chase a revised target in line with the D/L method. Openers Butt and Nasir Jamshed gave Pakistan a blazing start to put on 46 runs for the stand before first-change bowler Shakib Al Hasan bowled Jamshed for a 22-ball 21 in 7.2 overs. Medium pacer Farhad Reza dismissed Younis Khan (13), but it was not enough to restrict the hosts as Butt and Mohammad Yousuf added 73 runs for the third wicket. Butt (76 off 72 balls) was run out by Mohammad Ashraful with a direct throw, but then Pakistan almost reached the target with needing another seven runs from 13 balls. Yousuf and Shoaib Malik (4) remained unbeaten on 32 and four to guide Pakistan to home. Earlier, opener Tamim Iqbal and middle order Mahmudullah Riad each struck a fifty as Bangladesh recovered their sluggish start to put up their second highest total against Pakistan after their highest 244 for nine came in Karachi in 2003. Tamim smashed 59, his fifth ODI half-century, while Riad smacked an unbeaten 58, his maiden fifty, to give the bowlers something to bowl at. Taimim clubbed 10 boundaries facing 77 balls before he threw his wicket away to leave the side at 104 for five in 23.5 overs, but Riad started from where Tamim left. Despite being settled, Tamim came down to play an unnecessary shot off a Shahid Afridi delivery, and saw his mistimed shot go to Umar Gul's safe hands at long-off. Riad added 37 runs for the sixth wicket along with Farhad Reza and put on a significant 75 runs for the seventh wicket with Dhiman Ghosh (27) before Afridi (3/33) dismissed Shakib Al Hasan (4), Tamim and Farhad (26) in a row to reduce the visitors to 141 for six in 33.1 overs. The 22-year old, Riad, finally remained unbeaten to have struck six fours in 74 balls along with Abdur Razzak (1) when rain intervened in the 49th over to curtail the innings at 225. After deciding to bat first, Bangladesh fell in trouble losing Shahriar Nafees (4) and Aftab Ahmed (1) before Tamim and Mohammad Ashraful produced some resistance to take the side to 70 for three in 16.2 overs. Pacer Iftikhar Anjum broke the third-wicket stand trapping Ahsraful in front for a 24-ball 22 that included five boundaries. Aftab was a bit unlucky to be adjudged leg before by Umar Gul as TV replays showed the ball hit a bit high on his pad, but Nafees threw his wicket away off a Sohail Tanvir delivery in the 4th over. Pacers Iftikhar and Sohail took two wickets each for 34 and 36 respectively. bdn
