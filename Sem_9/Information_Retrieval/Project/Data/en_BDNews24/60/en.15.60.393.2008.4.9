 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  The proceedings of a graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, involving the purchase of MiG-29 war planes, were deferred Wednesday as authorities decided not to take her to court on security grounds. The hearing on charge-framing in the case was scheduled to take place at the Special Divisional Judge's Court for Dhaka located on Johnson Road in old Dhaka. Judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder set a date of Apr 20 for the deferred hearing, to be transferred to the Special Judge's Court set up on the Sangasad Bhaban premises and near to the special jail where Hasina is detained. Special public prosecutor Md Shahidul Islam Sarder submitted a gazette to the judge signed by acting secretary to the law ministry Kazi Habibul Awal, which stated that the case proceedings would be transferred to block-1 of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban located in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder would conduct the case proceedings in the shifted court, the public prosecutor told bdnews24.com. All of the accused, except Hasina, were present in the court Wednesday. Hasina's counsels Sahara Khatun and Kamrul Islam asked the court for a two-month deferment of the charge-framing proceedings. The court rejected the plea and set Apr 20 for next hearing. The now-defunct Bureau of Anti Corruption filed the case against Sheikh Hasina and six others with Tejgaon Police Station on Nov 11, 2001. According to the case details the accused approved the controversial purchase of eight Mig 29 fighter planes during her term as prime minister, incurring state losses of Tk 700 crore. A charge-sheet was submitted on Jan 29, 2003. Others accused in the case include former army chief Mostafizur Rahman, former air chief Jamaluddin Ahmed, former defence secretary Syed Yusuf Hossain, former joint defence secretary Mohammad Hossain Serniyabat, former air force officer Mirza Akhter Maruf and Unique Group managing director Nur Ali. bdnews24
