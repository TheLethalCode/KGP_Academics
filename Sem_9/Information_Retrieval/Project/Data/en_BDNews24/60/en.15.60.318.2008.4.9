 Dhaka, April 09 (bdnews24.com)The government is discussing the fate of former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia in the lead up to formal dialogues with the political parties, an adviser said Wednesday. Asked by reporters to comment on recent demands by leading politicians for releasing the two detained fleaders before the proposed political dialogues LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal said: "We haven't yet decided about the two top leaders. Discussions, however, are ongoing." Advisers Ghulam Quader, Hossain Zillur Rahman and Anwarul Iqbal briefed reporters on the proposed dialogues, following a two-hour meeting on the subject. Informal talks with political parties will be ongoing prior to fixing the schedule for formal dialogues, the advisers said. Asked whether all the political parties will be invited to talks, housing and public works adviser Ghulam Quader said the government would like to sit with all, but who will be invited to the final round of talks has not yet been decided. Pressed on whether all the political parties would eventually be involved in the discussions, Anwarul Iqbal told reporters the informal sittings might be held with any political party as necessary, while the final dialogues may be held with the major players only. "The date and time of the dialogues hasn't been finalised yet. Once finalised, the chief adviser will announce the programme details," the local government adviser said. Education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "We discussed different preparatory aspects of the dialogues in today's meeting. The success of the dialogues will be a crucial determinant in eventually holding a free and fair election." bdnews24
