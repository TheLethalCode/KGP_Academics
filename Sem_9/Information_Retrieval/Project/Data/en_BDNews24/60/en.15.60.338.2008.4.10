<TITLE> Confusion as San Francisco Olympic torch run starts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN FRANCISCO, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Confusion surrounded the start of the relay of the troubled Olympic torch through San Francisco on Wednesday, as thousands of China supporters and protesters converged along the planned route. The first runner held the torch aloft and began the route, flanked by tall, blue-clad Chinese security officials. But the group then promptly disappeared into a large waterfront warehouse complex -- in what appeared to be a possible last-minute change of route by authorities to head off trouble. What Chinese Olympic organizers called a "Journey of Harmony," quickly became the mystery of the missing flame. The torch was a magnet for chaotic demonstrations in London and Paris in the last week over a range of China issues from China's crackdown on Tibet last month to human rights. The protests have angered Beijing as it starts to count down to host the Olympic Games in August. In San Francisco, a city with a large Chinese-American population many of whom were proudly waiting to see the torch relay, there were tense confrontations. At least one pro-Tibetan demonstrator was detained even before the starting event, which began later than the scheduled 1 p.m. (2000 GMT). In front of the city's ferry building, Christine Lias, 30, was quickly surrounded by more than 30 Chinese-Americans after she said "Free Tibet now!" "Liar, liar, shame on you," many in the group shouted. Despite the protests in Europe and the threat of more protests in San Francisco, Olympics chief Jacques Rogge said there were no plans to cut short a global relay ahead of the Olympic Games opening. HEAVY SECURITY On a beautiful spring day, San Francisco deployed hundreds of security officers, including agents from the FBI, backed by police cars with flashing lights, harbor boats, jet skis and helicopters. Police warned anyone crossing barricades would be subject to arrest; officials shortened the route at the last minute and decided that two torch bearers should run concurrently. Reflecting divided feelings in the city -- a fifth of whose population is of Chinese origin -- thousands of pro-China spectators gathered along the route, many flying the five-star Communist Chinese flag alongside U.S. and Olympic flags. "In 5,000 years of Olympic history the Chinese can finally have one time hosting the Olympics. It means that China is becoming a world power," said Don Zheng, 41, a Chinese-American computer engineer who emigrated in 1988. Many Chinese-Americans are proud that their ancestral home is hosting the global sporting event and resent the protests. "I'm loyal to the US but I love China because it's my motherland," said Alice Liu, 50, who came to the United States after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Scott Bennett, 54, a Buddhist from San Mateo, California, who was carrying a Tibetan flag, was quickly confronted by supporters of the torch relay. "They are very aggressive. They were in our face," he said. Some protesters spray painted "Free Tibet" on a bus they thought was carrying the torch to the starting point. Police said the bus was empty and they did not make arrests there. City authorities stepped up patrols on the Golden Gate Bridge after three protesters scaled its cables on Monday to hang pro-Tibet banners. The torch relays have also attracted other groups unhappy about a range of China-related issues, including its human rights record and policies on Sudan's Darfur region. Critics say China should use more of its clout with Sudan to ease the bloody conflict in Darfur. China blames Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and his associates for orchestrating monk-led protests in Tibet last month as part of a campaign for independence. The Dalai Lama denies this. Hours before the San Francisco torch relay, President George W. Bush urged China to open a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. He said he agreed at a meeting with Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong "that it would stand the Chinese government in good stead if they would begin a dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama." Olympics chief Rogge told the Wall Street Journal that reports the International Olympic Committee executive board would consider scrapping the torch relay outside China, to avoid more ugly scenes, were "based on a misunderstanding." The torch protests have stirred up patriotic resentment among many ordinary Chinese who feel they politicize a sporting event that should be a celebration of 30 years of economic development and opening to the outside world. Western leaders are facing a delicate balancing act as calls mount for them to boycott the Olympics opening ceremony. (Take a look at the Countdown to Beijing blog at http:blogs.reuters.com/china
