 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)  Mehrab Hossain Junior smashed a fine century to take the GP-BCB Academy team to 295 for eight at the close of the first day of the second four-dayer against the South Africa academy team Wednesday. After deciding to bat first, the hosts fell in trouble to be reduced to 48 for three at Birshreshtha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Openers Jahirul Islam (0), Imrul Kayes (23) and captain Nasiruddin Faruque (16) returned cheaply before Mehrab along with Nayeem Islam and Shamsur Rahman produced solid resistance. Mehrab, batting at number five, along with Nayeem defied the opponent attack to put on 93 runs for the fourth wicket before the latter was caught by Reeza Hendrick off Shadley V Schalkwyk for 32, leaving the side at 141 for four. The left-handed batsman then added another 80 runs for the fifth wicket with Shamsur (58) before giving a return catch to Richard Das Neves, leaving the side at 221 for five in 65 overs. Mehrab struck 102 off 177 balls clubbing six fours and two sixes. Suhrawardi Shuvo (27) and Rubel Hossain will resume the second day Thursday Neil Wagner led the attack with three for 64 while CJ de Villiers and Neves grabbed two wickets each for 37 and 42 respectively. bd
