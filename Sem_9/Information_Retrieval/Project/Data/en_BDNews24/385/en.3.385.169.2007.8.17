<TITLE> Russia sends out 14 long-haul bombers-Putin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHEBARKUL, Russia, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said Russia sent 14 bomber aircraft on patrols far beyond its own territory on Friday, marking the permanent return to a Soviet-era practice. Putin said the resumption of flights was a response to security threats posed by other military powers. "We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis," Putin told reporters at joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains. "Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refuelling aircraft. "In 1992, Russia unilaterally ended flights by its strategic aircraft to distant military patrol areas. Unfortunately, our example was not followed by everyone. "Flights by other countries' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation," Putin said. Earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam, where the US military has a base, forcing U.S. aircraft to scramble into the air to track them. The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react. Many observers said the sorties -- which had been stopped due to funding shortages in the Russian military -- were a sign of Russia's growing assertiveness.
