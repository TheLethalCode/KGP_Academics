<TITLE> US to chart import safety course in November </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration will recommend specific steps in November to better ensure the safety of imported foods and other products, the chairman of a government commission said on Friday. Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt, who heads a wide, senior-level panel created by President George W. Bush last month, told reporters that his commission would follow a broad-brush report due on Bush's desk on Sept. 17 with a more detailed set of recommendations in mid-November. The safety of imported food and other goods has been a growing worry for American consumers after recent discoveries of imports of dangerous or adulterated toothpaste, seafood and other goods from China and elsewhere. Just this week, US toy maker Mattel recalled millions of Chinese-made toys containing lead paint. While much of the outcry from consumers and from Congress has been directed at China, the Bush administration stresses that its probe of existing inspection, screening and recall systems is not targeted at its strategic Asian trade partner. Leavitt has toured the country in recent weeks to assess food, postal, and border facilities. He also said he plans to discuss import safety matters in visits to China at least twice before the end of this year, and to devote part of an upcoming trip to Africa to the issue. An overwhelming majority of Americans already voice concerns about buying Chinese goods. Only 30 percent of those surveyed in one recent poll professed confidence in food imported from China.
