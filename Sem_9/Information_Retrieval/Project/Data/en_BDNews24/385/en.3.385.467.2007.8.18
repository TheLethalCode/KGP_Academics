 PARIS, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy was the guest of two wealthy families at a luxury villa near Boston, he told a newspaper on Saturday, making it the second break since he was elected that was paid for by rich friends. Sarkozy caused a stir in May when he cast aside traditional French aversion to flashy displays by their leaders to take a post-election break on a 70-metre yacht owned by a media billionaire. Critics said rubbing shoulders with the rich was ironic given his promises to help poor workers. Sarkozy's stay with the two families in the lavish villa, which boasts a private beach, a boat jetty and a spa, has also raised eyebrows. Le Monde reported that it had cost 44,000 euros ($60,000) to rent the house for the two-week stay and that a banker and the head of the jeweller Tiffany-France footed the bill. Sarkozy called the daily on Friday to say the villa "was rented by our friends, the Crombacks and the Agostinellis who invited us to stay with our children". Agnes Cromback is the president of Tiffany-France. Roberto Agostinelli is a banker who worked for a time at Lazard. His wife, Mathilde, is the head of communications of Prada-France and a close friend of Sarkozy's wife Cecilia, the paper said. The house belongs to Mike Appe, a former Microsoft executive. Sarkozy's decision to head to the United States for a summer break was seen by some as symbolic of his desire to improve U.S.-French relations that were severely strained by the invasion of Iraq. He was invited to an informal lunch of burgers and hot dogs by U.S. President George W. Bush at the Bush family compound in nearby Maine. But he arrived unexpectedly alone after Cecilia said she was suffering from a sore throat and could not make the journey. She was the spotted shopping with friends the following day, prompting accusations in the French press that she had let her husband down at an important diplomatic moment and raising further questions about the first lady's ambiguous role. Sarkozy told Le Monde he wanted the reporters to leave his wife alone. "I do not want you to talk about Cecilia; you can write what you like about me," he said. Sarkozy also made headlines during his stay when he lost his temper with reporters who had tried to take photographs of him on a boating trip. "There is no mystery, I have nothing to hide," Sarkozy said. "But it's hellish to continually have boats covered in photographers opposite the house's jetty."
