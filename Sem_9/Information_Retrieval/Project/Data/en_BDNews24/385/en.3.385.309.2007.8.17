 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Housewife Mehedi Banu bought half-litre open soybean oil from New Market just two days ago for Tk 42. On Friday she paid Tk 45. She bought a one-kg packet of atta (unrefined flour) for Tk 28 last week, but it cost her Tk 31 Friday. Banu could hardly believe the price of onion has increased Tk 6 a kg over the week to Tk 30. The government has taken steps to control rising prices, but without much result, as is evident from statistics of several government agencies. From the market price lists of the Directorate of Agricultural Marketing, and the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), it was found that the prices of 16 out of 20 essential items rose over the month. Asked about the rise in market prices, Banu said: "It will become impossible to live a decent life if prices jump every day this way. "Our salary does not rise every month. If the situation is such how is corruption among civil servants expected to decrease?" In New Market both shop owners and customers brooded over the prices. Vegetables vendor Abdul Malek said, "We have to sell higher than the purchase price. The customers get angry when I charge Tk 45 for one kg of aubergine." "The market trend is unpredictable. Prices are going up every day. Customers have to pay two taka more for each kg of rice than they did last week. They get angry at this. But what can we do?" A survey of the markets revealed that the prices of all essential commodities were higher in the market than the government list. According to TCB, aubergine is Tk 24 to Tk 40 per kg. However, it was not found anywhere at Tk 24. Its price was between Tk 35 and Tk 50. Green chilli was selling at a massive Tk 80 to Tk 100 per kg. Moreover, the price of the same commodity varied among the four cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna. In the case of some commodities the difference was marked. The price of coarse rice is Tk 1 higher in Rajshahi than in Dhaka, where it sells for Tk 22 to Tk 24 per kg. Its price is Tk 1 less in Khulna. Soybean oil rose by up to Tk 9 over the month and was now selling at Tk 79 per litre in Dhaka. However, it was selling for Tk 73 in Chittagong and Rajshahi and Tk 75 in Khulna. Prices have soared over the year. The price of atta rose by about 50 percent, and rice by 20 per cent. Lentil has also risen at the same rate. The price of gram flour has registered a 15 percent rise over the last month, while further increases during the month of Ramadan are expected. bdnews24.c
