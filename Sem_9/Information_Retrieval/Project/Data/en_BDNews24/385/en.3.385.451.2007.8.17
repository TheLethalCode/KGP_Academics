 LONDON, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England coach Steve McClaren has recalled Portsmouth veterans Sol Campbell and David James for next Wednesday's friendly against Germany at Wembley. Steven Gerrard, John Terry, David Beckham, Michael Owen and Owen Hargreaves have been included in the 28-man squad despite worries over their fitness. It is the first time 32-year-old defender Campbell or 37-year-old goalkeeper James have been included in an England squad since McClaren took charge after last year's World Cup finals. "Sol is a player with vast experience at international level. He had a very strong season at Portsmouth last year," McClaren said on the FA's Web site (www.thefa.com). "I always maintained that I wasn't closing the door on Sol. I know he won't let England down and I'm very pleased to welcome him back into the squad." Commenting on James, who last played for England against Jamaica in the run-up to the World Cup, McClaren said: "David showed excellent and consistent form for Portsmouth last season, that's why he is back in the squad." With Wayne Rooney out of next month's Euro 2008 qualifiers at home to Israel and Russia, McClaren will be weighing up his striking options, especially as Owen is short of match sharpness. He missed virtually the whole of last season with a knee injury sustained at the World Cup. Tottenham Hotspur's strike duo Darren Bent and Jermain Defoe are in the squad while Everton's Andy Johnson is also included as is Owen's new Newcastle team mate Alan Smith. Another Newcastle player, defender Steven Taylor, is in the senior squad for the first time. Squad: Goalkeepers: Paul Robinson (Tottenham Hotspur), David James (Portsmouth), Scott Carson (Aston Villa) Defenders: Micah Richards (Manchester City), Wes Brown (Manchester United), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), John Terry (Chelsea), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Sol Campbell (Portsmouth), Steven Taylor (Newcastle United), Nicky Shorey (Reading) Midfielders: Phil Neville (Everton), David Beckham (LA Galaxy), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Joe Cole (Chelsea), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Chelsea), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Gareth Barry (Aston Villa), Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough), Kieron Dyer (West Ham United), Owen Hargreaves (Manchester United) Forwards: Alan Smith (Newcastle United), Michael Owen (Newcastle United), Peter Crouch (Liverpool), Darren Bent (Tottenham Hotspur), Andrew Johnson (Everton), Jermain Defoe (Tottenham Hotspu
