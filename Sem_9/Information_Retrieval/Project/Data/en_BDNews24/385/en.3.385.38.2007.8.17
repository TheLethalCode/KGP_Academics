 VILNIUS, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lithuania may investigate a man stripped of his US citizenship and ordered back to the Baltic state for suspected war crimes in Nazi-occupied Poland, a state prosecutor said on Friday. It is the fourth such case since Lithuania gained independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. The country's pre-war Jewish population of more than 200,000 was all but wiped out in the Holocaust. An immigration judge in Boston has ordered the removal of Vladas Zajanckauskas, a retired factory worker from Sutton, Massachusetts, to his native Lithuania, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday in a statement. The judge found Zajanckauskas served as a non-commissioned officer at an SS-operated base and training camp in Trawniki, Poland, and took part in the liquidation of the Warsaw Jewish ghetto in 1943. Rimvydas Valentukevicius from Lithuania's General prosecutor office told Reuters: "We may consider starting a pre-trial investigation over suspected war crimes, but only after he arrives in Lithuania and we receive documents from the US" "So far we have nothing but news reports," he added. Valentukevicius did not know when Zajanckauskas, who denies the charges of being a war criminal, was due back in Lithuania.
