 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  No businessmen were given the commercially important person status by the Khaleda administration because it felt that most businesses were inclined toward the then opposition Awami League, officials and businessmen have alleged. According to government rules though, every year product-wise CIPs will be selected on the basis of extraordinary contributions to export promotion, officials with the Export Promotion Bureau said. "We've sought applications from businessmen for selections to CIPs every year during the past BNP government," an EPB official told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. "After scrutiny, the EPB sent the files to the commerce ministry, but every time, nothing happened after that," the official said. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury, a 2001 CIP, said the government had sought applications every year from 2001. "Accordingly, we took clearance from the special branch of police," Chowdhury said. "But mysteriously the government did not finally select any CIP." Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association president Kazi Belayet Hossain, another CIP, echoed the BGMEA president. He said he had heard that most eligible businesses were of AL-leaning for which the BNP-led government did not select CIPs. Asked, commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed told bdnews24.com Saturday that he did not know why the past government had not selected CIPs in its five-year term. On the alleged political reasons for not selecting CIPs in time, Ahmed said: "I really don't know anything." "We're doing it faster this year," said Ahmed who took charge as commerce secretary, a few months before the BNP government transferred power. CIP status is given to 165 businesspeople in two categoriesexport and tradeas recognition of their contributions to the economy. In favour of the government, the EPB seeks applications every year and does the primary selection before sending it to the commerce ministry that sends the files of those selected to the cabinet for final selection. This year, the EPB will receive applications for one month until Aug 31. The primary selection committee headed by a director general of the EPB will scrutinise the papers of the applicants, including loans, tax defaults and home-ministry clearance. After finalising the list, the commerce ministry will send it to the Cabinet Division between Nov 1 and Nov 15 for final vetting by the government, EPB officials said. The final list of CIPs will be announced by Dec 15. According to CIP Guidelines 2006, some 165 businesspeople will be selected for CIPs. Of them, 40 will be selected in line with positions as presidents of different business chambers and associations. The remaining 125 people will be selected on the basis of their contributions to product exports. The products include raw jute, jute goods, leather and leather products, frozen foods, tea, woven, knitwear, agriculture products, agro-processing, light engineering, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, plastics, computer software and services and data processing. bd
