 LONDON, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British judge ruled on Friday that three Spaniards suspected of being members of the Basque separatist group ETA should be extradited to Spain to face terrorism charges, court sources said. However, the ruling was immediately appealed and the three suspects were remanded in custody until the appeal can be heard, probably not until October or November at the earliest. In a 27-page ruling, the judge, Caroline Tubbs, rejected arguments put forward by the defence counsel, Richard Gordon, that the three were being prosecuted for their political beliefs. She said they should be returned to Spain to face charges. Ana Isabel Lopez, Zigor Ruiz and Inigo Albisu are accused by Spanish authorities of planning to set off a bomb in Spain's northern city of Santander. They were arrested under a European warrant in the northern English city of Sheffield in April. The Spanish arrest warrant accuses them of being part of a "reserve" cell of ETA, a militant group that has been fighting for a separate homeland for the Basque people for more than 40 years.
