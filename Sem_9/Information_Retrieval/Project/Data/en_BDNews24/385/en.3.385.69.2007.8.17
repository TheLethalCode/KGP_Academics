<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (bdnews24.cm/Reuters) - The US Federal Reserve on Friday cut the discount rate governing direct Fed loans to banks by a half-percentage point in a surprise move aimed at keeping credit flowing and calming jittery global markets. In a statement announcing the decision, which had no impact on the benchmark federal funds rate -- the Fed's main economic policy lever -- the central bank said downside risks to growth had increased "appreciably." While it took no action to lower the fed funds rate, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it was monitoring conditions and was "prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets. "Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth," the FOMC said. The reduction took the primary discount rate to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent. The fed funds rate remains at 5.25 percent. "To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets, the Federal Reserve Board approved temporary changes to its primary credit discount window facility," the board said. The discount rate usually moves in concert with the fed funds rate, and the surprise reduction announced on Friday showed the seriousness the Fed views the current turmoil in financial markets. Markets globally have been selling off in recent days as a credit squeeze, sparked by rising defaults in the US subprime mortgages, threatened to choke off economic growth. The world's central banks have been pumping funds into the banking system to maintain liquidity, but this so far has failed to boost banks' willingness to lend. Investors took Friday's move as a signal the Fed will not let a market panic spawned by tightening credit get out of control. Many were hoping the Fed would also cut the fed funds rate, which has been on hold at 5.25 percent for more than a year. "The move this morning is a major shift in their economic viewpoint and is meant to send a message to the markets that their heads aren't in the sand and are proactive in addressing the credit crunch," said Chris Jarvis, senior analyst with Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. "However, the market might read this as things must be bad for them to turn hard on their outlook," Jarvis said. US Treasury debt prices were mixed the announcement, while the dollar fell versus the euro and rose against the yen. US stocks surged higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average up over 200 points in early trading. "The Fed is making sure liquidity is in place, but it doesn't mean they have to cut the fed funds rate. They are doing what's appropriate. They're putting liquidity into the system," said Cynthia Cole, a bond fund manager at Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland. The discount rate cut could lower the cost of capital for banks and help keep credit flowing through the economy at a time when investors have shown a greater reluctance to lend. The Fed also said it would allow its regional banks to provide term financing for as long as 30 days. The boards of directors of the 12 regional Fed banks can request changes in the discount rate, which then need to be approved by the Fed's board. The action taken on Friday came at the request the boards of the New York Fed and the San Francisco Fed banks.
