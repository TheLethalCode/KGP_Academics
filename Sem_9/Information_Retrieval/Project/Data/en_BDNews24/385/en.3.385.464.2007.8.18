 KARACHI, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan have hired a former Australian rugby trainer to help the national cricket team raise its fitness level. David Dwyer will join the team's support staff in time for next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa, Zakir Khan of Pakistan's cricket board said on Saturday. Dwyer's appointment comes two days before former Australian pacer Geoff Lawson is due to take charge as national team coach. "Dwyer is a well known rugby trainer in Australia and we have signed him on a two-year contract, just like Lawson," Khan told Reuters. "We advertised for a trainer for our team and Dwyer suited our requirements perfectly." Lawson was hired after the death of Bob Woolmer during the World Cup in the West Indies in March. Pakistan terminated the contracts of Woolmer's foreign support staff immediately after the World Cup. The squad will take part in a Twenty20 competition involving, hosts Kenya, the United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh in early September to prepare for the Twenty20 World Cup
