 MILAN, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy coach Roberto Donadoni has given a first senior call-up to AS Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci for Wednesday's friendly in Hungary. The 22-year-old, battling with Brazilian Doni for the number one jersey at Roma, has made the step up from the under-21s. Donadoni also surprisingly brought back Roma midfielder Alberto Aquilani and Sampdoria's Angelo Palombo, with the likes of Daniele De Rossi short of match fitness. The coach, without retired pair Francesco Totti and Alessandro Nesta, was forced to pick the squad without seeing a competitive game after the league ignored his pleas and decided to start Serie A next weekend. The world champions are second in Euro 2008 Group B qualifying and play leaders France in Milan on Sept. 8. Goalkeepers: Marco Amelia (Livorno), Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus), Gianluca Curci (AS Roma) Defenders: Andrea Barzagli (Palermo), Fabio Cannavaro (Real Madrid), Fabio Grosso (Olympique Lyon), Marco Materazzi (Inter Milan), Massimo Oddo (AC Milan), Cristian Zaccardo (Palermo), Gianluca Zambrotta (Barcelona) Midfielders: Massimo Ambrosini (AC Milan), Alberto Aquilani (AS Roma), Aimo Diana (Palermo), Gennaro Gattuso (AC Milan), Angelo Palombo (Sampdoria), Andrea Pirlo (AC Milan) Forwards: Alessandro Del Piero (Juventus), Antonio Di Natale (Udinese), Filippo Inzaghi (AC Milan), Fabio Quagliarella (Udinese), Luca Toni (Bayern Munich)
