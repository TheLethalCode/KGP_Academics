<TITLE> Oil jumps on Fed discount rate cut, hurricane </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday after the US Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate to "restore order in financial markets" that have been hammered by credit worries. Forecasts showing Hurricane Dean was on a course that could take it toward Gulf of Mexico oil rigs and refineries also supported oil markets that were nervous about potential damage to the region, which pumps a third of U.S. oil output. "The cut may ease the liquidity crisis in the United States," Christopher Bellew of Bache Financial said of the Federal Reserve's surprise move to cut the discount rate at which it lends to banks. But he added: "Of course, you could interpret it as an indication of how serious they think the problem is." US crude was up 87 cents at $71.87 a barrel at 1640 GMT, after trading as high as $72.54. London Brent crude was up 63 cents at $70.40. Markets have been hit by fears of financial instability after troubles with risky US mortgages and a credit squeeze that had already prompted central banks, including the Fed, to pour money into the financial system. Oil's rise was part of a broader rally that also lifted stock markets. It took a pounding on Thursday as investors sold to offset losses elsewhere or out of fear that a squeeze on credit would slow economic growth. "The Fed move is supportive for oil. It is basically suggesting that the Fed is going to take action to stem any decline or slowdown in the economy," said Eric Wittenauer, energy analyst at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. Wall Street and European stocks rose sharply on Friday after the Federal Reserve move. Gold jumped 2 percent while industrial metals also gained. Oil investors were tracking Hurricane Dean, which was expected to strike the northeast tip of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula on Tuesday before entering the Gulf of Mexico. Energy markets have been on edge since 2004 and 2005, when hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita toppled oil rigs and flooded refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Dean strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, with winds above 100 miles per hour. The storm could become a Category 4 hurricane over the next two days, forecasters said. "Hurricane Dean should not yet be discounted," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. "History has shown that a hurricane crossing across the Yucatan can quickly regain strength once it steps back into the Gulf." Oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico stepped up evacuations of workers Friday. Transocean Inc. and Murphy Oil Corp. said they had already evacuated dozens of workers from offshore sites. Other companies said they were making preparations to evacuate workers, if necessary. US crude has fallen more than 8 percent from its Aug. 1 record high of $78.77. The market is vulnerable to further losses, say analysts. "It will be some time before commodity markets decouple themselves from the tumult going on in the financial markets," said Edward Meir of MF Global. "Should we get another sharp drop in equities, energy prices will most likely be swept lower in the downdraft once again."
