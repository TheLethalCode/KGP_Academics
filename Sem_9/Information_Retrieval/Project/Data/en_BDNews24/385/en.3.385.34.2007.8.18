 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Sun Microsystems and Google have jointly developed a new arsenal to attack Microsoft. Sun said its award-winning office productivity software, StarOffice, is now freely available through the Google Pack software download service. The word processing, spreadsheets and other workplace-oriented programs of StarOffice are fully compatible with the similar applications of Microsoft Office suite. StarOffice costs $70 but Sun has decided to give it away through Google Pack's free collection of essential software that help users set up computers, find things faster and stay safe online. This means, instead of buying the Microsoft Office suite, consumers can download exactly the same products of Sun Microsystems for free from Google Pack. Starting now, users can install StarOffice from Google Pack (http://pack.google.com) installation process. Sun has also announced that it has added web search functionality to all StarOffice products, enabling online search capabilities directly from its productivity suite.
