 KABUL, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen kidnapped a German woman on Saturday in the Afghan capital, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The woman was seized as she was walking on a street in the southwestern part of Kabul, where some aid groups have offices, spokesman Zemarai Bashary said. He had no further details on the abductors or the woman. Several foreigners have been kidnapped in recent years in Kabul, mostly by criminal gangs, but have been released unharmed after a period of time apparently after ransom payments. The latest abduction comes a month after two German aid workers and five of their Afghan colleagues were kidnapped by Taliban guerrillas in Wardak province, which lies to the southwest of the city. One of the two German men was found dead with gunshot wounds while the other, along with four Afghans, are still being held by the Taliban. One of the Afghans managed to escape. The Taliban demand the withdrawal of German troops serving with NATO forces from Afghanistan but Berlin has ruled that out. A day after kidnapping the Germans, the Taliban seized 23 South Korean Christian volunteers from a bus in neighbouring Ghazni province. The Taliban have killed two men from the Korean group but freed two of the women on Monday as a gesture of goodwill during talks with Korean diplomats. But the Taliban said the talks failed on Thursday because they said diplomats refused to free fellow Taliban members jailed by Kabul. The movement's leadership council is pondering the fate of the hostages, a spokesman for the group said on Saturday.
