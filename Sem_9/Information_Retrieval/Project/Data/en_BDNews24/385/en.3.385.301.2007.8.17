 ZEIST, Netherlands, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Strikers Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robin van Persie were recalled to the Dutch squad on Friday in a 20-man squad named by coach Marco van Basten for a friendly against Switzerland on Aug. 22. Real Madrid's Van Nistelrooy was dropped after the 2006 World Cup while Arsenal's van Persie played his last international against Albania before missing the remainder of last season through a foot injury. Van Basten said he had not spoken specifically about van Nistelrooy's position in the team. "His job is to score goals and that is what he managed at Madrid and I hope he will do it for us also," he told reporters. Ajax Amsterdam striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar has been dropped. Forward Rafael van der Vaart, who missed SV Hamburg's UEFA Cup match on Thursday through a back injury, has been included in the squad. "Our doctor told me that Rafael can play this weekend so it won't be a problem for next week," said Van Basten. The Dutch are third in Euro 2008 qualifying Group G with 14 points after six matches. They host Bulgaria on Sept. 8 and play Albania away four days later.
