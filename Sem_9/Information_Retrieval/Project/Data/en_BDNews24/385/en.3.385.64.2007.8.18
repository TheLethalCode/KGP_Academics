 ASTANA/ALMATY, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan voted on Saturday in a parliamentary election that is bound to return a big majority for President Nursultan Nazarbayev's party and is seen as a test of the Central Asian state's democracy. The vast oil-producing country has never held a vote internationally recognised as free and fair but Nazarbayev, in power since Soviet times in 1989, wants recognition in the West as the leader of a state built on more than petrodollars. Key to Saturday's vote will be whether the opposition All-National Social Democratic Party (ANDSP) wins any seats and the verdict of election monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Nazarbayev wants Kazakhstan to chair the OSCE, a 56-member democracy, rights and security body, in 2009 but has faced opposition due to his poor record on democracy. He called the poll two years early after enacting constitutional changes that hand the lower house, the Mazhilis, more powers such as naming the prime minister but also removed any limit on how many terms he can serve as president. "I ... voted for the party that will continue to lead our country towards peace, accord, brotherhood and stability," Nazarbayev said after voting with a Belarus-designed electronic voting system that voters may choose over paper ballots. Later, speaking alongside visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao, he said the vote bolstered stability and, in a veiled reference to foreign critics, said reform had to be home-grown. "This is a purely Kazakh way and it does not copy anyone's recommendations," he said. By 4:00 p.m. (1000 GMT) voter turnout was 52 percent, officials said. It was lowest in Almaty, the biggest city and a redoubt for the opposition, where just 16.5 percent voted. The opposition said it had gathered photographic evidence of a range of violations including multiple voting and campaign literature for Nazarbayev's Nur Otan party in polling stations. "We need to see how the counting goes, it will be easier for us to give a firm opinion (on the vote) towards the morning," Oraz Zhandosov, an ANSDP leader, told reporters in Almaty. Nur Otan is widely expected to win a landslide. It dominated the previous chamber but that parliament also included nominally independent MPs, now banned. The opposition ANDSP was not allowed to run some of its television adverts on national television and has said one televised election debate with Nur Otan was edited to cut out some of its leaders' critical comments. Western diplomats and analysts estimate the party could command 15 to 20 percent of the vote -- far less than opposition movements in countries like Ukraine and Georgia where rigged elections led to protests that ousted presidents. One voter at a deserted polling station in Almaty gave his name as Iskander and said he cast his ballot for the ANSDP. "I'm just voting against the powers that be, they should be able to be changed," he said. But Gulzhan, an economist who works for the state railway company, said she voted for Nur Otan. "The others are just demagogues. I can't see their achievements, like building schools," she said. At a military barracks for the Republican Guard that protects the president in Astana, voting was much brisker. "Certainly I voted for Nur Otan," said Kanat Omarbekov, a serviceman in dress uniform. "I serve my state. It's my responsibility to vote for it." The OSCE is due to give an initial assessment on Sunday. An election official said preliminary results might be published as soon as 0500 GMT on Sunday, earlier than previously announced.
