 Savar, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka Export Processing Zone Saturday tightened security for fears of labour unrest after a garment factory in Savar sacked 2,602 workers. Ring Shine Textile Factory, a Taiwanese-owned company, posted a notice on the wall of the DEPZ declaring an indefinite shutdown. Police have been deployed on the spot. Garment workers Imdadul Haque Milon and Mohammad Saju said the factory ran four other sections outside the DEPZ: Anupam Sweaters, Universe-1 and Universe-2 and SA Rahman Textiles. As many as 3,500 workers had worked for the four units of the factory. The process of retrenchment took off after retired captain Shahidur Rahman had joined the company as general manager. A total of 1,002 workers were laid off on Aug 1 in the first phase, workers said. Another 1,600 workers of different sections were laid off Friday afternoon, but none of them knew then that they were out of job. The workers became angry when they found the shutdown notice hanging at the gate Saturday morning. An official on condition of anonymity said the workers were retrenched as the company ran into huge losses and the factory was declared closed in line with an instruction from the authorities. The workers will be paid arrears on Sept 7, he promised. When reporters tried to talk to the company's managing director Song Wing Ming, they were not allowed in. DEPZ security in charge Badiul Alam said none could be allowed inside without permission from Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority. BEPZA GM Shamsul Haque ducked questions on the issue of labour unrest and switched off his cellphone. Ashulia police chief Kamrul Islam said the police were deployed to avert any labour unrest. bdnews2
