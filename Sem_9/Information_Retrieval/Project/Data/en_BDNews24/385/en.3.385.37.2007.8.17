 VIENNA, Aug 17 (bdnews4.com/Reuters) - North Korea has helped UN nuclear monitors verify the shutdown of its nuclear arms programme by allowing them to take photos and examine inventory, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday. A three-page IAEA report, obtained by Reuters, was the first by the Vienna-based agency on North Korea since it readmitted monitors in July after a 4 1/2-year ban to verify the nuclear freeze agreed by Pyongyang and five powers in February. "The Agency has verified the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facility and is continuing to implement the ad hoc monitoring and verification arrangements with the cooperation of the DPRK," the report said, using the official name of the reclusive Stalinist state. The confidential report was being distributed to the 35 nations on the IAEA's policy-making board ahead of its next meeting on Sept. 11-14. Preliminary talks on how to go beyond a reversible shutdown to fully dismantling the atomic bomb programme ended on Friday with the U.S. envoy saying they had created the makings of consensus but more wrangling was needed to iron out key terms. The talks in China have focused on defining what Pyongyang -- impoverished and widely seen as loath to completely scrap its only big bargaining chip with the outside world -- must do in the second phase of the disarmament deal. The idea is to pin down definitions as to how the North should "disable" atomic facilities and declare all nuclear activities and materials, in preparation for full negotiations due around the end of this month. Yongbyon's complex, which has churned out bomb-grade plutonium, was closed in return for 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil under the first phase of the deal struck between the North, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. IAEA monitors had made photographic records at Yongbyon's nuclear fuel fabrication plant, radiochemical laboratory and 5 megawatt experimental power plant, the agency report said. "The agency has identified key processes and essential equipment involved in the conversion of (uranium) yellow cake to uranium metal," it said, adding Pyongyang had agreed to let them go anywhere in the Yongbyon complex for verification purposes. The report said the nuclear material inventory at Yongbyon's radiochemical laboratory included low-, medium- and high-level uranium wastes now subject to IAEA monitoring. Design changes made at the laboratory since IAEA inspectors were ejected in 2002 included "mechanical decladding and pulse columns" used to extract and convert plutonium oxide into plutonium metal for making potential weapons. The report said Pyongyang officials told monitors that there was no fuel in the experimental nuclear power plant except for some in its core and a small number of damaged, irradiated fuel rods in the transfer hatch and refuelling machine. IAEA personnel had installed cameras and radiation-detection devices covering these areas, the report said. It added that there had been no construction since 2002 at Yongbyon's two unfinished sites -- a 50 megawatt power plant and a 200 megawatt facility.
