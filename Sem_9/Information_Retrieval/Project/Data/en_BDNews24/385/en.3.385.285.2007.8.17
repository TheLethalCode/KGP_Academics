<TITLE> Fed discount rate cut sends Europe stocks surging </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks closed higher on Friday after a roller coaster session as a surprise discount rate cut by the US Federal Reserve eased worries over the credit market and sent recently-hammered shares of financial institutions sharply higher. Among the biggest gainers, HSBC surged 4.7 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland jumped 6 percent and ABN AMRO soared 5.4 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 2.3 percent higher, at 1,473.49 points, after rising as much as 3.5 percent after the Fed's move. The benchmark index, which closed the week 0.4 percent down, had dropped to a year low of 1,426.51 earlier in the session. In a move aimed at calming rattled global markets, the Fed cut the primary discount rate governing direct Fed loans to banks by a half point, saying the downside risks to growth had increased "appreciably". "The Fed will now do whatever it takes to re-establish financial stability. The worst is now over in financial markets," Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note. "Given the Fed's statement regarding downside risk to growth and its promise to act as needed to support economic growth, there is widespread speculation that a cut in the Fed funds rate is coming," she wrote. Concerns over the debacle in the risky U.S. subprime mortgage market and the potential damage to global financial markets have triggered waves of sell-off on bourses around the world over the past month. Despite Friday's sharp rally, the FTSEurofirst 300 is still down about 10 percent since reaching a 6-1/2-year high in mid-July. While it took no action to lower the fed funds rate, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it was monitoring conditions and was "prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets". The reduction took the primary discount rate to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent. The fed funds rate remains at 5.25 percent. The discount rate usually moves in concert with the fed funds rate, and the surprise reduction announced on Friday showed the seriousness with which the Fed views the current turmoil in financial markets and the risks it poses to economic growth. "I think this is a very clear indication of intentions and in that respect I think it's a message to the credit markets, to the banks in particular: 'Carry on lending as you were before, don't be frightened of running out of liquidity, we stand behind you full-square'," said Edward Menashy, strategist and economist at Charles Stanley. "When a central bank steps in and indicates to the money markets in absolutely clear terms as the Fed has just done, I think quite clearly that they will stand behind the credit markets until things come down. I am quite confident that the central banks will not allow the world economy to go into recession," he said. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index surged 3.5 percent, outpacing Germany's DAX index, which gained 1.5 percent, and France's CAC 40 which rose 1.9 percent. Shares of oil producers were also among the biggest gainers, getting support from a rebound in oil prices. BP added 4 percent, while Total rose 2.9 percent. Data released late in the session showing deteriorating U.S. consumer sentiment in August renewed worries over the health of the world's biggest economy and prompted European shares to reverse some of their hefty gains. The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in August was 83.3, well below a median forecast of 88.0 and a sharp fall from the previous month's final reading of 90.4. "The preliminary reading (suggests that) recent equity market volatility and ongoing housing market worries are being increasingly felt by consumers," ING analyst James Knightley writes in a note.
