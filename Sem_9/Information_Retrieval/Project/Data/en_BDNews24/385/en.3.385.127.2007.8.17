 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Friday wished to talk by telephone with her expatriate son, daughter and sister at least once a week. She also wants to use a computer in the special jail, her special assistant Hasan Mahmud told journalists outside the prison. Mahmud said Hasina's request to talk by phone with son Sajib Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul and sister Sheikh Rehana had been conveyed to the jail authorities. "But they have not taken any decision. We will make a written appeal to the government in this regard," he said. "If necessary we will pay the phone bills," added the aide. He said he had submitted applications to jail authorities for 14 persons, including the former prime minister's relatives and personal staff, to meet her next week. He also conveyed Hasina's wish to use a computer. "She must be given the opportunity to use a computer," said Mahmud. "In the jail, she can only watch BTV programmes," he added. "She has not been allowed to watch any of the satellite channels. We have talked to jail authorities but did not get a satisfactory reply," said Mahmud. "We have forwarded an application to the Special Branch for security screening, submitted by a team of 12 persons seeking permission to see Sheikh Hasina," Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general, prisons, told bdnews24.com Friday. "Sheikh Hasina has not asked us anything about communicating with her son, daughter or sister by telephone; nor has she ever mentioned using a computer," said Siddiqui. "As per the jail code, however, no person under detention is permitted to use a computer or make telephone calls," he said. bdnews24.
