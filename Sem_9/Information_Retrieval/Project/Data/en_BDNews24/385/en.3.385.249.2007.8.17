<TITLE> Hurricane Dean blows into Caribbean, targets Gulf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Dean knocked out power, triggered landslides and ripped the roof off a hospital in St. Lucia on Friday as it raced into the Caribbean on a path toward the oil and gas rigs of the Gulf of Mexico, officials said. Dean's sustained winds rose to 105 mph (170 kph) as the Category 2 storm passed the French island of Martinique, just across the narrow St. Lucia Channel where the eye of the hurricane crossed from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea. The US National Hurricane Center predicted Dean would grow to a Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, as it races through the Caribbean and probably into the Gulf, home to a third of US domestic crude oil and 15 percent of natural gas production. Energy markets have been skittish about hurricanes since powerful storms including Ivan, Katrina and Rita in 2004 and 2005 disrupted oil and gas production. Transocean Inc., the world's largest offshore oil and gas driller, stepped up plans on Friday to evacuate workers from deep-water rigs in the Gulf. Murphy Oil Corp. said it had removed some staff from a production platform. The first hurricane of the Atlantic season lifted the roof off the pediatric wing at Victoria Hospital in St. Lucia's capital, Castries. Patients had been moved from that area and there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries in the former British colony of 170,000 people, said Dawn French, the island's emergency management director. "It's very gusty and it's very rainy. We had a dead calm night and now we're getting walloped," said French, reached by telephone as she hunkered down to wait out the storm. Heraldine Rock, a former government minister, told Reuters the storm ripped roofs off several houses and badly damaged at least two banana plantations. "In one village, telephone and power lines are down, they're strewn all over the road, trees are uprooted and are blocking the roads," she said. "In another village, a landslide has been reported, cutting off any access to the airport." By 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Dean was 105 miles (170 km) west of Martinique and moving west at about 21 mph (34 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Category 3 to 5 storms, referred to collectively as "major" storms, are generally the most destructive and have included infamous hurricanes like Katrina. A Category 2 hurricane is still capable of damaging houses and sending a 6- to 8-foot (1.8 metre to 2.4 metre) storm surge ashore. Dean was expected to become an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm next week with winds of 150 mph (240 kph) on a course projected to take it near Jamaica by Sunday and aimed at Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula or straight into the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucatan Channel. If it crosses the Yucatan, it is projected to re-emerge in the southern Gulf as a Category 3 storm and could disrupt operations in the Cantarell Complex of Mexican oil fields, which is one of the world's most productive and supplies two thirds of Mexico's crude oil output. Numerous islands across the Caribbean were under storm alerts including Hispaniola, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Anguilla, Grenada, Saba, St. Eustatius, Montserrat, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Maarten. Forecasters have predicted the six-month hurricane season that officially began June 1 would be more active than average with up to 16 named storms. An average year historically has 10 to 11 storms, of which six strengthen into hurricanes.
