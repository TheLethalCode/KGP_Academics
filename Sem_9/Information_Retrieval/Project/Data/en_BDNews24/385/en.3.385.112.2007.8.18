<TITLE> More problems at Siemens </TITLE>

 Martyn Warwick London, August 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Dodgy financial dealings uncovered at the German telecoms and industrial conglomerate Siemens may be more far-reaching and involve larger sums than has previously been indicated or expected. In a major investigative article, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, the big regional newspaper serving Bavaria, quoting an as-yet unnamed but high-ranking company mole, says investigations have found that, in the company's telecoms business unit alone, a massive US$1.2 billion in "improper payments" have been made from various slush funds and hidden bank accounts as bribes to secure lucrative contracts. The paper also says a further $200 million in questionable payments have been made by other Siemens' business units. The anonymous source told the paper, "We're talking about truly enormous sums here, and there's still more to come out." Siemens has declined to comment on the latest claims but has already increased the scope of its own internal investigation to cover other parts of the sprawling company after discovering some $570 million in dubious payments at its telecoms unit. If the Suddeutsche Zeitung article is anything to go by, that figure accounts for less than half of the financial shenanigans that have now come to light, and there's even more expected. Furthermore, the long criminal investigation into graft and corruption at Siemens continues apace. Meanwhile, Klaus Kleinfeld, the former CEO of Siemens who, although not suspected of having any involvement in the alleged bribings and other financial misdealings, was forced out of his post after less than two years at the company, has landed a new job. He is to take over as COO and president at the aluminium company Alcoa and expectations are that he will be a shoo-in as CEO when the 64 year-old current incumbent, Alain Belda, retires next year. Kleinfeld is 49. He will receive a "signing-on bonus" of $6.5 million when he starts at Alcoa on Oct. 1. Details of his salary and other perks have not yet been released. It's tough work, with few rewards and little recognition, but, hell, someone has to do it. bdn
