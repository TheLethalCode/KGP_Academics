 LUSAKA, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Southern African leaders failed to press Zimbabwe to enact political reforms at a two-day regional summit, delegates said on Friday. Opposition groups and Western powers had hoped they would pressure President Robert Mugabe, who has stepped up a crackdown on the opposition as Zimbabwe sinks deeper into an economic crisis, into changing his policies. South African President Thabo Mbeki, who is mediating between the Harare government and its opponents, told the summit of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which Zimbabwe is a member, that progress had been made, delegates said as the meeting wound down. But no discussion followed the presentation. Delegates said SADC chairman Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa, who has described Zimbabwe as a "sinking Titanic", proposed discussing its political and economic crisis but other leaders were not eager to review the matter. SADC members appear reluctant to criticise one of their own, even if many Zimbabweans are fleeing across the borders of neighbouring SADC countries -- trying to escape the world's highest inflation rate, as well as severe food and fuel shortages. "There is really not much SADC can do," said a diplomat who asked not to be named. "Mugabe has been crossing one red line after another for years and he gets away with it." At the opening ceremony, Mugabe received the loudest applause from an audience which included regional ministers, diplomats and other officials. Zimbabwe said there was no point in having a discussion. "There was nothing extraordinary to warrant a discussion on Zimbabwe. SADC nations are mandated to help Zimbabwe and we will not go beyond those parameters," Zimbabwe's presidential spokesman, George Charamba, told Reuters. His justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, suggested before the summit that Zimbabwe's government could not justify engaging in a dialogue with the opposition and accused them of carrying out bombings. Chinamasa later told a news conference that there was no need for political reform because Zimbabwe was a democracy. Mugabe faces little pressure at home, where there is a weak and divided opposition. He denies that his controversial policies, such as seizing white-owned farms for redistribution to landless blacks, have brought a country once viewed as a regional breadbasket to its knees. But he acknowledged there were economic difficulties such as fuel shortages in an interview with Zambian state television. Mugabe, who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980, still portrays the struggle in Zimbabwe as one directly related to its former colonial masters as he deflects criticism from Western powers and stifles dissent. SADC, for its part, seems confident it can help stabilise other hotspots in Africa. Southern African leaders launched a peacekeeping brigade on Friday as part of a planned African standby force to be deployed on peace missions and to tackle disarmament and humanitarian crises on the continent.
