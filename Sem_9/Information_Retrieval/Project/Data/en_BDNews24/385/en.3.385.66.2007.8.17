 Dhaka, August 17 (bdnews24.com)  A housewife apparently died from bullet wounds after she was shot Friday in Tongi, Gazipur. Mahmuda Khatun, 40, a mother of five, lived at Aushpara in Tongi while the husband Mostak Ahmed works in Malaysia. Mahmuda was taken to a local hospital after sustaining injuries before transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital at 7pm where doctors declared her dead. According to the DMCH register, Mahmuda received a bullet in her abdomen. Her body remained in the DMCH emergency unit 10 pm. But her relatives and local hospital authorities denied she had been shot or injured by a bullet. Mahmuda was living on the fourth floor of a six-storied building, with her two brothers and their families residing on the first and second floors of the same building. Officer in charge of Tongi Police Station Abdus Salam said: "Relatives of Mahmuda have denied any incident of shooting." "Her sister-in-law Ferdousi Akter informed police that Mahmuda became ill Friday afternoon and was rushed to the local Seba Hospital and then to Dhaka Medical," said the OC. Salam said the incident possibly had taken place at about 4:30pm. "Neighbours informed police about a firing incident," he said. "Police rushed there and found nothing. The authorities at Seba Hospital, where she was first taken, also denied any bullet injury to Mahmuda's body," said the police officer. "We are totally confused. I'm going to Dhaka Medical. Then hopefully everything will be clear." Salam added. bdnews2
