 Dhaka, August 17 (bdnews24.com)  Forests and environment adviser CS Karim said Friday only home-grown laws and their proper enforcement could check environmental destruction. He said the country needs development but not at the cost of the environment. He made the comments at the 'Fifth All Asia Public Interest Environmental Law Conference' in Dhaka. The Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA) organised the session to share experiences on formulation of environmental law. "Environmental laws have to specifically be suited to the local needs," Karim said, adding that the green laws in Asia are mainly based on western perspective. "Laws should differ as the environments differ from region to region," he said. "Our environment is undergoing changes every day. So, the environmental laws should also be changed. "It must be consistent with our very own needs and perspectives." He said the recent mudslides in Chittagong would never have occurred if there were strong laws against hill cutting and if their enforcement could be ensured. About the development activities, the adviser said that unplanned urbanisation and absence of proper waste disposal led to environmental degradation. "We need development alright, but it has to be environment friendly." Rizwana Hasan of BELA told bdnews24.com: "Any laws including environmental laws should be formulated in a participatory manner, involving the communities." "Many countries today have made it mandatory to involve the people in formulation of law. We, unfortunately, haven't yet developed a culture of people-oriented law-making," she said. Lawyers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia, China, the Philippines and US were taking part in the conference. bdnews24
