 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  The National Committee for Protecting Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Electricity and Ports Friday asked the government to clarify its position on the deals signed with the multinational company Asia Energy. The committee made the demand at a press conference held ahead of the `Fulbari Day' on August 26. Member secretary of the committee Prof Anu Muhammad read out a statement. "We think if the government really wants to do something against corruption, it should cancel all types of deals done with Asia Energy." Three people died and more than 200 others were injured when demonstrators clashed with BDR in Fulbari, Dinajpur during protests against the open-pit mining project of Asia Energy on August 26, 2006. The incident prompted the anti-mining activists to demand the previous BNP-led government suspend Asia Energy's activities in the country. They also demanded a ban on open-pit coal mining. Speakers at the press conference regretted that no official programmes could be held on August 26 due to the state of emergency. Sheikh Muhammad Sahidullah, convener of the committee, Dr Shamsul Alam, Professor M M Akash, Ruhin Hossen Prince, Dr. Akmal Hossein, Jonaet Saki and some other members of the committee were present in the press conference. bdnew
