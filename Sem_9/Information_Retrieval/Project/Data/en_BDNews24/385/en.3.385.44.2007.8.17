 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wall Street and European stocks rose sharply on Friday after the Federal Reserve slashed its interest rate on loans to commercial banks in a bid to defuse a growing credit crisis and calm rattled financial markets. The US dollar fell against the euro and other major currencies as some dealers said the move by the Fed could be interpreted as a step toward cutting its benchmark interest rate. After global stock markets had been under pressure -- Japanese stocks had their biggest sell-off overnight in six years -- the Fed cut its primary discount rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent, saying financial market conditions had deteriorated and tighter credit threatened to restrain economic growth. "This has already led to a complete turnaround in the European stock markets, U.S, stock market futures, and carry trades," said Kathy Lien, chief strategist with Forex Capital Markets in New York. "The dollar on the other hand is being hit by the announcement as risk aversion starts to subside," she said. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 188.34 points, or 1.47 percent, at 13,034.12. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 16.34 points, or 1.16 percent, at 1,427.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 56.84 points, or 2.32 percent, at 2,507.91. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 rose to stand nearly three percent higher, Britain's FTSE 100 was up 3.8 percent. "That's the right support for the market. This is an important message. The central bank is signaling that it is standing by to lend support," said Max Holzer of Union Investment. While it took no action to lower the federal funds rate, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it was monitoring conditions and was "prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets." Earlier, stocks had all been in negative territory and Japan's Nikkei plummeted more than 5 percent to post its biggest one-day percentage loss in nearly six years. Markets have been battered by fears of financial instability following troubles with risky US mortgages and a squeeze on credit that had already prompted central banks, including the Fed, to pour money into the financial system. Many long-term investors and analysts, however, continue to maintain that economic fundamentals bode well for the future and stock losses may turn out to be a good buying opportunity. Euro zone government bond futures turned negative. The September Bund future fell to 113.28, after having risen as high as 113.90 before the Fed announcement. "The rate cut makes accessing funds easier and eases liquidity issues," said Jason Simpson, a bond analyst at ABN AMRO in London. However, US Treasuries rose slightly, apparently focusing on the Fed's negative characterization of financial market conditions, saying they have the potential to slow economic growth.
