 ANKARA, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's top business group said on Friday Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, re-nominated by the ruling AK Party for the presidency, met the requirements needed to be head of state. "We believe that Gul will fulfil the requirements of his post. We believe that showing respect to the will of parliament is indispensable in a democracy after elections," TUSIAD chairwoman Arzuhan Yalcindag told reporters after meeting Gul. Gul's first bid to become president was blocked by the powerful secularist establishment earlier this year because of his Islamist past, but he looks set to become president in an election beginning on Monday. He is expected to win on a third round of voting on Aug. 28 when he needs only a simple majority in parliament. The AK Party has 341 of the 550 seats in the assembly. Yalcindag said it was important that Gul was an impartial president and tried to preserve the balances between the state institutions, a reference to the Islamist-rooted AK Party government and the staunchly secularist military. Gul will not be the only candidate for the presidency. The far-right Nationalist Movement Party, which has 70 deputies in parliament, said on Friday it would submit former defence minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu as a candidate. The biggest opposition party, the secularist CHP, has said it would not attend parliament during the election and boycott receptions by the president if Gul is elected. The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party is yet to decide whether to support Gul or not in the election.
