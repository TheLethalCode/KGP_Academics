 WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - White House spokesman Tony Snow plans to leave his job before US President George W Bush's term ends in January 2009, citing financial reasons rather than his recurrence of colon cancer. In a radio interview this week, Snow, 52, did not reveal when he would leave. Snow earlier this year suffered a return of colon cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy. But he said his reasons for leaving would be financial. He took a pay cut to leave Fox News. "I've already made it clear I'm not going to be able to go the distance, but that's primarily for financial reasons," Snow said on conservative radio program "The Hugh Hewitt Show." "I've told people when my money runs out, then I've got to go." Snow joined the the White House last year to become the voice of the administration, which was under fire for its handling of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In March, Snow learned his cancer had returned and underwent surgery to have a small growth removed. Doctors also found a tumor attached to his liver and he has since been undergoing treatment. White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe, asked about Snow's comments, said on Friday he did not know whether Snow had formally submitted his resignation. Two years ago Snow fought through colon cancer, the same disease that killed his mother. His leaving would be yet another significant departure from the Bush camp. Chief political adviser Karl Rove this week announced his resignation from the end of August
