<TITLE> LDP to go independent: Oli </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, December 11 (bdnews24.com)  Liberal Democratic Party on Thursday declared that it would contest the upcoming polls on its own and not as a partner of any alliance. "We have decided to run the election independently, fielding only the eligible and worthy candidates, and withdrawing the remaining candidacies," LDP president retired colonel Oli Ahmed said at a media conference on Thursday. Oli called upon people to cast their votes for candidates running the polls under 'umbrella' symbol. He also encouraged voters to cast 'negative' votes to reject the corrupt, extortionist and terrorist candidates. He accused BNP of bribing LDP leaders and enticing them to run the polls under their banner in exchange for ministerial positions in the future governments. The LDP president at the media press conference held in the party office at Maghbazaar explained how their efforts of securing parliamentary seats by teaming up with the 'grand alliance' failed. "We had demanded 15-20 seats, but the 'grand alliance' has not, so far, announced any of our candidates, which prompted at least five LDP presidium members, former minister and MPs to refrain from running the polls," said Oli. The reasons LDP decided to go independent about contesting the election, he said, included AL's reluctance to discuss how it would like the president and prime minister to share authority, to punish the corrupt, the terrorists and the extortionists, and make the parliament effective. "BNP has engaged in alluring and coaxing promising people in the recent past, offering bribes and ministerial offices in the near future," said the LDP president. "By the grace of Allah, only one so far succumbed to such offers. LDP will accept any member of the parliament who wins the people's mandate." Oli alleged that the activities of the emergency government rather ended up in protecting the corrupt. Secretary general Jahanara Begum, presidium member Didar Bakht, Nazimuddin, Abul Kashem Chowdhury, Ismat Zerin and joint secretary general Shahadat Hossain Selim were present. bdnews
