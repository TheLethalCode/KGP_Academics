 Abdur Rahim Harmachi, bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  The ongoing global economic crisis has dampened the country's leather export markets dealing a blow to the hides and skins traders following the Muslim Eid ul-Azha festival. "There were hardly any orders for raw hides this time though orders for the finished leather were more or less fine," Joynal Abedin Bhuiyan Khokan, owner of Dhaka Tannery, told bdnews24.com. "This is the reason why the prices of hides this year have plummeted down to half," said Joynal, a member of Bangladesh Finished Leather Goods and Footwear Exporters Association (BFLLFEA). He said 20 sq ft of cattle hide this year sold at Tk 600-650 against Tk 1300-1400 and hides of goats were priced at Tk 100-150 against last year's Tk 250-300. A pre-Eid meeting between the government and the tannery owners fixed Tk 30 per square foot of cattle hide in Dhaka and Tk 25 for elsewhere, Joynal said, adding that a similar meeting last year fixed the price at Tk 70 for Dhaka and Tk 65 for the rest of Bangladesh. "We were forced in the light of the global economic situation to drastically adjust the prices downward," he explained. BFLLFEA president Rezaul Karim Ansary said the association had to be careful this year in price fixation, because hides and skins traders last year incurred losses due to the buyers who had backed out of promises to buy. "The government and we jointly fixed lower prices this year as there were less orders from the export markets and on the basis of the fixed prices, retailers bought the hides," Ansary said. He said 50 percent of the country's hides are bought during the Eid ul-Azha period adding some 30 lakh pieces of cattle hides would be collected this year against last year's 28 lakh pieces. "Banks did not show enough support as they did last year with credit package," Ansary complained. bdnews
