Maimed freedom fighters followed them in placing the wreaths. Common people paid their respect to the martyred intellectuals after them.

BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, before heading for Khulna, went there to pay tribute. As Khaleda was late for over half an hour to reach the graveyard, security personnel kept the entrance out of bounds to people on security ground.

Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain, Worker's Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon and BSD convenor AFM Mahbubul Alam and many others expressed discontent and left the graveyard.
