<TITLE> Australia vows 5-15 pct CO2 cut, unveils trade scheme </TITLE>

 CANBERRA, Mon Dec 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Australia pledged to cut its greenhouse emissions by 5 to 15 percent by 2020 as it unveiled on Monday the world's broadest carbon trading scheme, rebuffing business calls for a delay due to the global slowdown. While Australia is now second only to the European Union in its drive to cut emissions by establishing a cap-and-trade system that puts a price on carbon output, critics said the target was too weak and blasted the trading plan that will give free credits to some of the economy's most carbon-intensive industries. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the carbon scheme was vital for Australia, which has the fourth-highest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions in the world, and five times more per person than China, due to its reliance on coal for electricity. "Without action on climate change, Australia faces a future of parched farms, bleached reefs and empty reservoirs," Rudd told the National Press Club. But some carbon market participants said the system, details of which Canberra unveiled on Monday ahead of approval by parliament expected next year, may fall far short of what's required in the global fight against climate change. And the government said Australia would only target the full 15 percent cutback if a global deal emerges from U.N. talks in Copenhagen in late 2009, angering environmentalists who had hoped Rudd would follow through on his green electoral mandate by taking a leading role in cutting global emissions. "It's a total and utter failure. It's madness. Climate change is happening much faster than people thought. Five percent, which is what we are looking at, is an outrage," Greenpeace climate campaigner John Hepburn said. Friends of the Earth called the plan a "polluters' paradise." Scientists and green groups wanted cuts of at least 25 percent but the carbon scheme comes at a politically sensitive time for the government, with the mid-2010 start date set only months before it is due to hold elections to seek a second term. Australia's target is far shy of the 20 percent reduction that Europe has promised and the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommendation of up to 40 percent by then, and underscores the challenge world governments face in finding a successor to the Kyoto Protocol in the next 12 months. Rudd defended the targets by saying they were more aggressive on a per-capita basis than those in the European Union. The government also said the scheme would only trim about 0.1 percent off annual growth in gross national product from 2010 to 2050, with a one-off increase in inflation of around 1.1 percent. "You could say that the decision came down to a choice between the environment and the economy and at this stage it looks like the economy has won," said Gary Cox, head of environmental derivatives at global brokers Newedge.

Under the new proposal, permits to produce carbon will be auctioned by the government in the first half of 2010, raising an estimated A$11.5 billion in 2010/11 that will help compensate businesses and consumers for higher power and fuel costs. The system will cover 75 percent of Australia's carbon emissions and involve 1,000 of the nation's biggest firms, the government said, and participating firms will need to surrender a permit for every tonne of carbon emitted. But there will be exemptions of up to 90 percent for major polluters who could be penalized by the added carbon cost when facing untaxed competitors on the international market, like iron ore and aluminum producers including BHP Billiton, Alcoa and Rio Tinto. And while LNG producers Chevron and Woodside Petroleum will only get a smaller 60 percent exemption, the industry was pleased that it had been included at all. Natural gas is a much cleaner-burning hydrocarbon for power plants, but producing it releases large volumes of CO2. Overall, industry experts said the plan looked weak. "It seems a bit like the old game of one foot on the brake and one foot on the accelerator, having a bet each way and I'm not sure the numbers add up," said Brett Janissen, executive manager of the consultancy Asia-Pacific Emissions Trading Forum. "BUY THEIR WAY OUT" The carbon trade plan allows for prices to be set by the market, first under auctions to be held in the first half of 2010. It estimated an initial price of about A$25 ($16.70) a tonne, below the European emission allowances, which are trading around 15 euros (A$30) a tonne. But the government said it would also impose an interim price cap of A$40 a tonne for four years, a move that analysts said could limit the market's development initially. By allowing polluters to import unlimited carbon permits from green projects abroad, but barring potential exports from Australia, companies will have their pick of the cheapest price. "The proposed scheme is disappointing in terms of the levels of reductions required as set down by the (U.N.'s) IPCC," said Martijn Wilder, partner at Baker & McKenzie in Sydney. "By adopting a A$40 price cap, it will provide companies with certainty as to their compliance cost but it also enables companies to buy their way out of compliance, in circumstances where the carbon price breaks the $40 ceiling," he added. Australian farmers, who have suffered more than seven years of severe drought, will be spared from taking part in carbon trading for at least five years, as expected. Agriculture accounts for about 16 percent of Australian emissions. But transport and fuel will be included in the scheme. The government will introduce carbon-trading laws into parliament in 2009, where it needs the support of the Greens and two independent senators, or the conservative opposition, which want the scheme delayed due to the global economic downturn.
