 WEST POINT, NY Wed Dec 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has made clear to Pakistan it will do whatever is necessary to protect American soldiers and civilians, US President George W Bush said on Tuesday. Bush told cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point that one of the most important challenges they would face is helping allies assert control over largely ungoverned territory such as the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Tensions between Washington and Islamabad have flared over US drone strikes aimed at militants along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and some of his followers are believed to be hiding. Pakistan has protested US air attacks on its territory and in June summoned US Ambassador Anne Patterson to the foreign ministry to lodge a complaint about a strike in which Pakistani soldiers were killed. "One of the most important challenges we will face and you will face in the years ahead is helping our partners assert control over ungoverned spaces," Bush said. "The problem is most pronounced in Pakistan, where areas along the Afghanistan border are home to Taliban and to al Qaeda fighters." Pakistan understands the terrorism threat, Bush said, but added: "We have made it clear to Pakistan and to all our partners that we will do what is necessary to protect American troops and the American people." The recent attacks in Mumbai, where militants killed 171 people, including six Americans, has further complicated ties between the United States and Pakistan. India has said the attackers came from Pakistan and demanded Islamabad take immediate action. Pakistan has promised to cooperate with the investigation but denied the government was involved in the attack on its nuclear-armed rival. "They're working to enforce the law and fight terror in the border areas," Bush said of Pakistan. "And our government is providing strong support for these efforts." The United States has about 31,000 troops in neighboring Afghanistan. As Bush enters the final weeks of his presidency, he offered a laundry list of improvements his administration has made to the US military to respond to an evolving enemy. While he did not name his successor, Democrat Barack Obama, he urged him to stay on the offensive. "In the years ahead, our nation must continue developing the capabilities to take the fight to our enemies across the world," Bush said. "We must stay on the offensive. We must be determined and we must be relentless to do our duty to protect the American people from harm.
