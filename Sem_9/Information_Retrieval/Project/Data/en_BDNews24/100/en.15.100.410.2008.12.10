 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)The state of emergency will be lifted from Dec 17, the government has announced. Three cabinet-level advisers told a press conference Wednesday night that restrictions on rallies and processions would also be withdrawn from Dec 12, the day campaigning begins ahead of the Dec 29 election. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had said earlier Wednesday that the government had already decided to lift the state of emergency ahead of election, leaving no necessity for "any ultimatum". The comment was a seeming response to the BNP-led alliance's 48-hour deadline given on Monday to meet their two remaining demands, lifting emergency and suspending Section 91(E) of the RPO. "The emergency will be lifted in a timely way so that candidates face no restrictions during the campaign period," Hossain Zillur had assured Wednesday just hours before the official government announcement. BNP and its allies welcomed the government's announcement, calling it a 'four-party victory', following an alliance meeting chaired by Khaleda Zia later Wednesday night. bdne
