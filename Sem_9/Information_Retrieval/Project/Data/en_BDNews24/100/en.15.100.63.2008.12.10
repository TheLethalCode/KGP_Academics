<TITLE> Day-long drama ends in JP-AL split </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)A day-long drama, which included a two-hour meeting of Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina followed by an emergency sitting of the JP presidium, ended in a seemingly irreparable split between the two parties on Wednesday. "Even if they (AL) offer us 70 seats or 80 seats, there's no going back," an angry Ershad told reporters emerging from the meeting of the party's policy-making body. JP had formally decided to break with the AL-led electoral alliance, he said. "From the way the negotiations were going, it was clear that AL itself did not want us to stay," claimed the former general. AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, in an immediate reaction to the JP chief's announcement, blamed the other party for the split. "Jatiya Party itself created the problem. They will have to solve it," said the AL leader. "In the last dialogue with JP, a deal was made for 41 seats. AL had issued letters for withdrawal of our candidates from those seats," Selim told waiting reporters in front of Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan residence. But, JP presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed told the press after the presidium meeting broke up Wednesday: "We won't accept 41 seats, not even 101 seats if offered now. We have lost belief in them." "We wanted to be part of a government formed by the Grand Alliance." But, he alleged, JP had become victim to a "political conspiracy". "We have discussed matters with AL over a long period. There was no lack of will on our part," said JP secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader. "We had said many times that we were in the Grand Alliance. But how many times did AL say it?" "We requested them not to field their own candidates in our seats. But they ignored our request," Hawlader claimed. "That was why we were compelled to take this decision." The JP leaders became vociferous after Ershad left the scene, shouting comments such as: "AL breaks promises" and "AL did not heed us". Retired brigadier general and JP leader Mahmudul Hasan threatened his fellow party leaders. "Nobody better go near Sudha Sadan," he said. "If they do, their legs will be broken!" Presidium member, Golam Moshi, echoed his colleagues. Another presidium member, who was also present in the meeting but spoke anonymously, said: "The Awami League has betrayed us." "This is a clear-cut betrayal." Ershad had earlier in the day given rise to doubts on the state of the alliance, following a two-hour meeting with Hasina in which disputes over seat sharing appeared to remain unresolved. The JP chief, emerging from a two-hour meeting with Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home, said a "final decision" on seat-sharing had yet to be made between the two parties. "We haven't yet made any final decision on seat-sharing and we'll let you know in the evening about the final status of the alliance," Ershad said at around 3.30pm. The former president called the meeting of the party presidium just hours later. bdnew
