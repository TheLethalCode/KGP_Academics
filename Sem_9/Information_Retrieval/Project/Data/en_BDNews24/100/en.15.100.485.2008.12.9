<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The first-batch qualifiers of the 27th BCS examinations, who failed to pass in the second-round test, on Tuesday asked authorities to "appoint them on humanitarian grounds". They observed a symbolic hunger strike at the Central Shaheed Minar to press home the demand. One of the demonstrators, Nasiruddin, told bdnews24.com that the government had found five irregularities in the second-round examinations and recommended appointment of the first-batch qualifiers. But a stubborn chairman of the Public Service Commission, Dr. Sa'dat Hossain, were holding back the appointments , he said. "Today is Eid day, a day of happiness. But we do not have anything to cheer about. Everybody has gone to their villages, but we could not go. Give back our Eid joy by appointing us to our respective cadres," he said. Anwaruzzaman said, "It has not yet been known why the first-batch results were cancelled. On November 23 the government in a notification mentioned on five grounds 1137 first-batch 27th BCS qualifiers were dropped in the second-round results." Sohel Rana said, "Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman broke our fasting on Nov. 20 and assured us of a logical solution. But no step has yet been taken." Another demonstrator Babul Howlader said, "The chief advisor and the government have realized that injustice has been done to us. The government also told us that it will appoint us. But certainly there are some powerful men behind the PSC chairman who are creating obstacles." The PSC originally posted an advertisement on June 28, 2005 for the 27th BCS exams. As many as 1,36,105 people applied and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The PSC recalled 16,418 for oral exams and declared 3,567 candidates successful, asking authorities to appoint them. However, allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism had marred the transparency of the 'first batch' results. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results on May 30 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and establish transparency in the wake of allegations of irregularities. The new results were published on Sept. 23 after 16 months of dispute and legal wrangles and 10,412 examinees passed in the 'second batch' after fresh oral viva tests. However, the government's decision to recall the original results triggered outrage among the first qualified batch, who had called for the removal of the PSC chairman and have held ongoing protests, including hunger strikes. bd
