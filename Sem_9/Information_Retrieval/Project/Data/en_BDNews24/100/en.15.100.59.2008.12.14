 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com) - The Appellate Division on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to validate the nomination of Maj (retd) Monjur Kader, prospective BNP candidate for Sirajganj-5 constituency. The High Court, meanwhile, ordered the commission to validate the nomination of another BNP candidate for the same constituency Golam Moula Khan Bablu. Appellate Division chamber judge, justice Jainal Abedin ruled on Kader's nomination after the High Court's rejection earlier in the day of a petition filed by the BNP hopeful. Kader's petition challenging the EC's cancellation of his nomination was handede back by the High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Chowdhury. The same High Court bench, however, ordered the EC to validate Bablu's nomination. Senior advocates TH Khan and Faisal H Khan conducted the case for Monjur in the High Court and Appellate Division. Barrister Moinul Hossain conducted the writ on behalf of Bablu. Another High Court bench of justices Moinul Islam Chowdhury and Md Ashraqul Islam on Sunday heard a petition by former state minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, against the EC decision cancelling his nomination. The hearing will continue on Monday. bdnews
