<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jerome Taylor scored a magnificent maiden test century on Sunday as the West Indies ensured the rain-affected first test against New Zealand in Dunedin would almost certainly end in a draw. Coming to the crease with the West Indies in some trouble at 173 for six, still 189 runs behind the New Zealand first innings total of 365, Taylor bludgeoned 17 fours and three sixes on his way to 106. His partnership with veteran Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who was last man out for 76, took the West Indies to a first innings total of 340. At the close New Zealand had moved to 44 for two, with Tim McIntosh on 28 and Daniel Flynn not out four. They earlier lost opener Jamie How bowled by Daren Powell for 10 and night watchman Kyle Mills the very next ball, also bowled by Powell. NO NERVES Taylor's previous best in a test match was 31, while he had never before passed 41 in first class cricket, but he showed no signs of nerves as he took the attack to every bowler in the New Zealand line-up. He went to 50 with a four over mid-on then notched his century with another boundary, a magnificent cover drive off the bowling of James Franklin. When he eventually fell to a feathered catch to keeper Brendon McCullum off spinner Daniel Vettori (6-56), he and Chanderpaul had put on 153 for the seventh wicket. With all of the second day and much of the third washed out because of rain, the only real chance of a result was if New Zealand could bowl West Indies out cheaply on the fourth day. However, some belligerent batting from Taylor and captain Chris Gayle (74) along with stubborn resistance from Chanderpaul and debutant Brendan Nash (23) frustrated the New Zealand attack. West Indies began the day at 39 without loss and were never able to get on top of the New Zealand attack until Taylor came to the crease midway through the middle session. One hour later, any hopes New Zealand had of winning the test were gone as Chanderpaul and Taylor batted them out of the game
