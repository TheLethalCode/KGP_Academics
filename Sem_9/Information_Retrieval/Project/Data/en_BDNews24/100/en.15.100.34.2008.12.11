<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Hours after Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad announced Thursday morning that the 'grand alliance' had not split, a senior JP leader said they had reached a seat-sharing deal with Awami League that leads the combine - as the deadline for withdrawal of candidacy drew near. JP presidium member Golam Masih told bdnews24.com that the deal over candidacy had been finalised, putting apparently to rest the political soap opera played out since an angry Ershad on Wednesday said his party was parting ways with the AL-led alliance. HT Imam, co-chairman of the AL's election organising committee, confirmed the agreement. "We have already prepared withdrawal papers for our candidates," said Imam. "Now JP has to bring papers of the nominations which they are willing to withdraw." Earlier, Anisul Islam Mahmud, acting chairman of JP, said that the JP had submitted nominations for 280 seats." On Thursday morning, in a stunning reversal 15 hours after furiously announcing a break with Awami League-led alliance, Ershad had said the 'grand alliance' was very much there, at least until 5pm. "The 'grand alliance' is still intact. "And, if Jatiya Party is given the number of seats it has demanded then we are ready to go to the polls with the 'grand alliance'," said the former president at a media conference where the election manifesto of the party was unveiled. "We will wait until 5pm," Ershad said. "I have always talked about the 'grand alliance' in and outside the country and for this I was ridiculed by several leaders of Awami League. But I tolerated such humiliating remarks," the former military strongman said. "A written agreement promised us 60 seats and that came down to 50, then 47 and now we hear that Jatiya Party will be given 40 seats." "We hope that they will withdraw their candidates from our seats." "I have heard that the leader of the 'grand alliance' has already issued a letter on the matter." An angry JP chief said to reporters on Wednesday evening after a meeting of his party presidium, "Even if they (AL) offer us 70 seats or 100 seats, there's no going back," "We have taken a formal decision," he said. Later that day, after a meeting of the party's policymaking presidium, secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Howlader at a media briefing in presence of senior party members had declared that Jatiya Party was leaving the alliance. bdnews24.com
