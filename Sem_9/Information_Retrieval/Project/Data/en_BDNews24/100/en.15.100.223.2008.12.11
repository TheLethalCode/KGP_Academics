 KIEV, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dynamo Kiev claimed a place in the UEFA Cup knockout stages after Roman Eremenko's first half goal sealed a 1-0 victory over Fenerbahce in Champions League Group G on Wednesday. Artem Milevskiy, Dynamo's driving force throughout the match, sent Eremenko through with a diagonal cross-field pass on 20 minutes before the away side's onrushing goalkeeper Volkan Demirel made the midfielder's finish even easier. Fenerbahce's best chance fell to Spain striker Daniel Guiza whose angled header was saved by Stanislav Bogush and the home side's keeper also had no problems stopping a close range effort by Selcuk Sahin. "A coach needs a year or two to build up a good team and I have been at Fenerbahce for 5-6 months only," the Turkish side's under-fire European Championship winning coach Luis Aragones told reporters. "We didn't control the ball today and that's why we failed to create any scoring chances. Still, (we) should have moved better without the ball, especially at the back." Milevskiy, Eremenko, Ismael Bangoura and versatile Georgian defender Malkhaz Asatiani maintained the pressure throughout the second half to ensure their side's first Champions League win at home in nine matches. Dynamo also coped well without the injured midfield pair of Ayila Yussuf and Oleh Gusev and the suspended midfielder Olexandr Aliyev, Turkey full back Gokhan Gonul worked tirelessly up and down the right hand side but to little avail as Fenerbahce suffered their seventh Champions League game without victory to remain bottom of the group. The Turks' frustration was compounded when Claudio Maldonado was sent off for violent conduct in injury time. Dynamo join Ukrainian rivals Shakhtar Donetsk and Metalist Kharkiv in the UEFA Cup while group winners Porto and runners-up Arsenal continue to the next stage of the Champions League. "It was a tough game because we needed a positive result to qualify for the UEFA Cup and paid more attention to defence. We did have concerns while choosing the lineup before the match due to the numerous injuries," Dynamo coach Yuri Sumin said. "Luckily we managed to cope and now three Ukrainian teams will play in UEFA Cup.
