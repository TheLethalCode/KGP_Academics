 BELGRADE, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting broke out among fans in Serbia's northern city Novi Sad ahead of Partizan Belgrade's match against title rivals Vojvodina on Wednesday and riot police arrested about a dozen supporters, local media reported. The game ended in a goalless draw leaving Serbian champions Partizan top of the first division heading into the winter break with 37 points from 17 matches ahead of Vojvodina on 34 and Red Star Belgrade, who host Hajduk Kula later on Wednesday, with 30. Partizan's Serbia winger Zoran Tosic received a standing ovation when he was substituted midway through the second half in what may have been his last match for the champions. Belgrade daily Sportski Zurnal said Tosic was due to fly to England on Wednesday to agree personal terms with European champions Manchester United, who last month got a work permit to sign him for a reported eight million pounds ($11.83 million). Serbian media also said the Premier League champions were still monitoring Partizan's teenage forward Adem Ljajic, who had a 10-day trial at Old Trafford in October. Serbia's 12-team first division resumes on Feb. 21, when Partizan host former European Cup winners Red Star in the so-called 'eternal derby'
