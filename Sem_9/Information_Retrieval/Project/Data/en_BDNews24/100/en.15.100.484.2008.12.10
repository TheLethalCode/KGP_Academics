BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia began a meeting with election partners Wednesday evening, minutes after the government announced the dateDec 17for withdrawal of emergency ahead of the general election. The four-party alliance was scheduled to meet earlier in the day as there has been "no word" from authorities about lifting emergency rule by Dec. 10 in the wake of their latest 'ultimatum', they said. The alliance leaders finally walked into the meeting shortly after 9pm, just minutes after the government announcement and half an hour after Jatiya Party chairman Ershad announced he was breaking his party's alliance with BNP rival Awami League. The BNP-led four-party alliance had given the government '48 hours' on Monday to make a clear announcement on their demand for lifting emergency and suspension of Section 91(E) of the Representation of the People Order. They said the government and the Election Commission must meet the demands for the alliance to go to polls mandated for Dec. 29. "A final decision is expected at the meeting scheduled for this evening about future actions since the government has not yet made any announcement on lifting the emergency," BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com midday Wednesday. "'Tough actions' were under consideration in case the government does not meet our demands by Dec. 10," Mosharraf had warned. Abdul Latif Nezami, secretary general of Islami Oikya Jote, a four-party ally, told bdnews24.com, if the government did not heed their demands for lifting emergency, the alliance it would "slim our chances of going to polls." Several other leaders of the alliance also echoed Mosharraf and Nezami. Khaleda, meanwhile, has said she would start her election campaign after visiting the shrines of Shahjalal, Shah Paran and Borhanuddin in Sylhet on Dec 12. She will launch her election campaign at South Surma, Osmani Nagar, Dayamir, Nabiganj, Bahubal, Habiganj, Baniachang, Madhabpur, and Brahmanbaria by addressing eight public gatherings. bdnew
