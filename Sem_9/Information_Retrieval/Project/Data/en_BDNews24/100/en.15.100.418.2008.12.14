 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has ordered secretaries to all ministries and departments to cooperate fully with the Election Commission for a fair parliamentary election. "We want to be partner to an election that will set an example." "Through the elections, we will hand over power to an elected government," he said to secretaries of different departments on Sunday. This was the fifth and possibly the last meeting between the chief adviser and the secretaries. "There is no alternative to a professional bureaucracy to ensure an honest, reliable and neutral administration and the bureaucracy has to be transparent and liberal." Caretaker governments will come and go but the role of bureaucracy for the operation of the government is indispensable, he observed. Fakhruddin also asked the secretaries to continue with the reforms taken during the two-year tenure of the interim government. "You have to be a role model for the administration and society and, for that, your outlook has to be liberal, transparent and positive," observed the chief adviser. "You also need to keep abreast with the latest developments in technology and science." The chief adviser also emphasised the use of technology for the establishment of good governance and a society free of corruption. "In the last two years we tried to form an administrative system which is active, accountable and free of corruption." Referring to several reforms adopted by the government, he said, "In efforts to make the economy more active, Better Business Forum, Regulatory Reforms Commission and public-private partnership culture have already started to yield positive results." Stating that Citizen's Charter, Client's Charter and One Stop Service had started giving results, he hoped that these would be in operation in the future. "The Annual Development Programme has to be implemented in time for best results," he said. The chief adviser asked the secretaries to expedite the release of pension for government officials and the implementation of the updated Secretariat directory. Fakhruddin also praised the role of the administration during the flood and cyclone Sidr in 2007. On increasing production, he said, "Instead of becoming dependent in import, we need to stress on increasing internal production." Nine secretaries including the cabinet secretary also spoke. bdnew
