 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  An organisation of freedom fighters has said that it will publish a list of 600 people charged with war crimes following the war of independence, within days. "We will make public a list of 600 people, against whom cases were filed in 1973-74 on charges of war crimes in a week," SM Jahangir Alam of the Bangladesh Muktijoddha Sangsad told a press conference on Saturday. "If there is not time to hold a press conference we will deliver the list directly to the media," he said, adding that he had the necessary case documents in his possession. He asked his countrymen not to cast a single vote for war criminals in the upcoming general election. He also lauded Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, on behalf of freedom fighters, on the pledges of her party to try war criminals and create scope for children of freedom fighters. He said the freedom fighters would launch a campaign on Dec 16 across the country asking people not to vote into power the war criminals and "tyrants during the past four-party alliance government". bdnew
