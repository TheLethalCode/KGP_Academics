 KIRKUK, Iraq, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 30 people and wounded more than 30 on Thursday in an explosion just north of Iraq's ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk, shattering the calm during a major Muslim holiday, police said. The bomber detonated explosives inside a Kurdish restaurant about 10 km (6 miles) north of Kirkuk, said Major General Jamal Tahir, police chief of Kirkuk. Tahir said the restaurant was packed during lunch hour. Many Iraqis are on holiday during Eid al-Adha, a four-day religious holiday, and would be more likely to visit restaurants. Iraqi and American security forces sealed off the area following the bombing, a Reuters reporter said. Iraq's majority Arabs and minority Kurds have sparred over control of Kirkuk, 250 km (155 miles) north of Baghdad, which lies atop massive oil reserves. Violence has dropped sharply in Iraq over the past year, but militants still stage attacks on a routine basis. Thursday's bomb attack was the deadliest in months.
