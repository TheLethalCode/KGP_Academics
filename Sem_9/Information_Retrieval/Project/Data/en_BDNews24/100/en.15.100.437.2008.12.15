"Four tenders will be opened for around Tk 330 crore imports through Chittagong and Mongla ports. The fertilisers will cost $307-323 per tonne," he said after a meeting at the cabinet division.

The meeting also endorsed three tender proposals for land development projects under the housing and public works ministry for establishing central jails in the city's Keraniganj area to accommodate accused under trial. A proposal for a project related to small water resources development in the greater Mymensingh, Sylhet and Faridpur areas under local government division was also presented in the meeting. But the proposal was sent back without approval for further review, the adviser said. b
