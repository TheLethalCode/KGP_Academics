 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is set to unveil an election manifesto on Saturday afternoon, with the slogan 'Save the country, save the people', and likely to focus on cutting prices and employment generation. The former prime minister, seeking an unprecedented third term in office, had promised to bring prices of essentials down and create new jobs as she launched her election campaign in Sylhet on Friday. Khaleda will present her party's pledges at around 4pm at the Dhaka Sheraton, Maruf Kamal Khan, chief of the BNP chief's information cell, told bdnews24.com. She will leave the Sheraton immediately after to take part in two rallies at Mohammadpur and Banani, party leaders said. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com that his party would deliver a manifesto "suitable for the present time". "We have created an election manifesto keeping in mind the most important issues of the people," he said. "We are focusing on prices of commodities, poverty reduction and employment generation." The party prepared its last election manifesto ahead of the scheduled Jan 22, 2007 elections but did not unveil it as the election was cancelled. bdnew
