 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)An angry Hussein Muhammad Ershad has announced his Jatiya Party is breaking away from the Awami League-led alliance after a day-long drama that included a meeting with Sheikh Hasina and his top colleagues. "Even if they (AL) offer us 70 seats or 100 seats, there's no going back," the JP chief told reporters Wednesday evening after a meeting of his party presidium. "We have taken a formal decision," he said. "From the way the negotiations were going, it was clear that AL itself did not want us to stay," the former general said. Even before he made his formal remarks, at least three of his policymaking colleagues had confirmed the news to bdnews24.com, with one party leader citing "clear betrayal" by AL. "We are no longer with the Grand Alliance," presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed told bdnews24.com at 8:30pm as the party's policymaking body had just ended an emergency meeting. "We have just taken the decision," said Kazi Zafar, a former prime minister in the Ershad administration in the 1980s, refusing to give the reasons. "A press statement is being released, and we'll explain why," Kazi Zafar said. "If necessary, we'll hold a press conference tomorrow (Thursday)." There was no immediate comment from the Awami League, however, although at least two other presidium members confirmed the JP decision to break away from the AL-led polls partnership. "We are out of the (grand) alliance," Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu, a former JP minister, had told bdnews24.com while the presidium was still on. A third presidium member, Golam Moshi, also echoed his colleagues. Pressed to explain, another presidium member who was also present in the meeting but spoke anonynously, said: "The Awami League has betrayed us." "The Awami League will not ask its candidates to withdraw from the 47 seats given to us as per understanding," the presidium member said. "This is a clear-cut betrayal." Ershad had earlier given rise to doubts on the state of the alliance, following a two-hour meeting with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina in which disputes over seat sharing appeared to remain unresolved. The JP chief, emerging from a two-hour meeting with Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home, said a "final decision" on seat-sharing had yet to be made between the two parties. "We haven't yet made any final decision on seat-sharing and we'll let you know in the evening about the final status of the alliance," Ershad said at around 3.30pm. The former president called a meeting of the party presidium just hours later. bdnew
