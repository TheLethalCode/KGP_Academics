 LONDON, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona celebrated a 2-0 win over arch-rivals Real Madrid with late strikes by Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi to move eight points clear in Spain at the weekend. In Germany, newcomers Hoffenheim were crowned "winter champions" going into the mid-season winter break, while Juventus hit four past AC Milan in their 4-2 victory to move second outright in pursuit of Inter Milan in Italy. SPAIN Barcelona moved eight points clear in the Primera Liga with a 2-0 win over champions and arch-rivals Real Madrid at the Nou Camp. Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi scored late on to spoil Juande Ramos's league debut as Real coach and his side slipped down to sixth, 12 points behind Barca. Valencia are second after a 2-1 comeback win over ten-man Espanyol, and Sevilla are third on goal difference after beating Villarreal 1-0 thanks to a Renato strike. Villarreal dropped down to fourth just ahead of an improving Atletico Madrid, who beat Real Betis 2-0 with goals from Maxi Rodriguez and Sergio Aguero. ITALY Amauri scored twice as Juventus beat AC Milan 4-2 to go second outright and keep the pressure on leaders Inter Milan, who also defeated bottom side Chievo 4-2 thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic's brace. Milan, who were without the injured Kaka and had Gianluca Zambrotta sent off, are now nine points behind Inter and lie joint third with Napoli, 3-0 winners over Lecce. In a weekend packed with goals, Mirko Vucinic grabbed a last-minute winner as mid-table AS Roma beat Cagliari 3-2 and Lazio came back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at Udinese. Fiorentina are clear in fifth after a regulation 2-0 win over Catania with strike duo Adrian Mutu and Alberto Gilardino both scoring again. ENGLAND The Premier League's big four all drew with Manchester United, in third place, goalless at Tottenham Hotspur where goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, a figure of fun a few weeks ago, produced a excellent performance. Leaders Liverpool drew at home for the third successive game and needed two goals from Stephen Gerrard to claim their point after Hull City had threatened to take another notable scalp when Paul McShane and a Jamie Carragher own goal had them 2-0 up after 22 minutes. Second-placed Chelsea failed to take advantage when they were held 1-1 at home by West Ham United - Nicolas Anelka's 14th league goal of the season cancelling Craig Bellamy's opener. Arsenal managed only a 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough, former Gunner Jeremie Aliadiere getting Boro's equaliser after Emmanuel Adebayor headed Arsenal in front in the 17th minute, which let Aston Villa climb to fourth after thumping Bolton Wanderers 4-2. FRANCE Olympique Marseille held Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon to a goalless draw in a tight, tactical top-of-table clash at Gerland. The result left Lyon, chasing an eighth consecutive title, three points ahead of second-placed Marseille with one match to go before the winter break. Lyon have 35 points from 18 games, with Marseille, third-placed Girondins Bordeaux and fourth-placed Paris St Germain all on 32 points. Bordeaux won 3-1 at Le Mans and Paris St Germain, recovering after narrowly escaping relegation last season, won 2-1 at Auxerre. GERMANY Hoffenheim completed a remarkable first half to their debut season in Germany's Bundesliga, securing first place heading into the mid-season break after a 1-1 home draw against nine-man Schalke 04. Selim Teber clinched the crucial equaliser in the 72nd minute after Gerald Asamoah had put the guests ahead five minutes before the break, scoring for the second week in a row. Champions Bayern Munich were denied the honour of being "winter champions" after a 2-2 draw at Stuttgart to leave the pre-season favourites trailing Hoffenheim on goal difference. Stuttgart's Sami Khedira struck twice, including a stoppage time equaliser. Promoted Borussia Moenchengladbach have found life back in the Bundesliga a good deal harder than Hoffenheimlosing for the 12th time this season, 2-1 at Dortmund 2-1 to end the year at the foot of the table. NETHERLANDS Brazilian Ari struck early in the second half to earn league leaders AZ Alkmaar a 1-0 win at struggling Feyenoord to keep them on top with 35 points after 15 matches. Ajax Amsterdam remain second, trailing by three points, following a comfortable 3-0 victory over 10-man NAC Breda, with Dario Cvitanich, the successor of Klaas Jan Huntelaar who has joined Real Madrid, opening the scoring. Steve McClaren's Twente Enschede registered a convincing 4-1 away win against Groningen, while PSV Eindhoven dropped two points in a 1-1 draw at Vitesse Arnhem. SCOTLAND The Old Firm two both drew to leave Celtic still four points clear. Hearts were ahead at Parkhead through Andrew Driver but Celtic claimed a point when Stephen McManus equalised 15 minutes from time. Rangers led at Dundee United through Kris Boyd's 17th goal of the season but Lee Wilkie and Warren Feeney had the home side 2-1 up early in the second half. Substitute Kyle Lafferty made it 2-2 14 minutes from the end
