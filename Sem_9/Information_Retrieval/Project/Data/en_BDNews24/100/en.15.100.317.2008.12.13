 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's electoral manifesto promises to make the the Jatiya Sangsad a more effective institution by letting the opposition play a bigger and more meaningful role in parliament. "The national parliament will be the centre of all political activities," BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said as she unveiled the manifesto at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel on Saturday, ahead of the Dec. 29 general elections. BNP will take steps to make the JS meaningful and effective, she said. "Whoever is elected as speaker or deputy speaker will have to resign his/her party position and severe all kinds of ties with the party," the former premier announced. "A deputy speaker will be chosen from the opposition in the parliament." "All the elected members will have equal facilities provided by the government and there will be no disparity in government fund allocations for the electoral constituencies," the BNP chief pledged. "Every bit of cooperation and respect will be extended to the MPs to help them make fruitful contributions." "We announce through the media that we'll unanimously resolve all issues through dialogue both inside and outside the parliament, if we are elected." "Chiefs of the parliamentary committees, to be formed before the second parliamentary session ends, will also be chosen from the opposition," she said. Efforts will be made to reach accord among the MPs on a few issues to prevent parliament boycott, the manifesto says. The issues include all members abiding by the rules of procedures, refraining from speaking ill of the late leaders and absenting themselves from the sessions for over 30 days at a stretch. "An all-party parliamentary committee on the affairs of Election Commission, Anticorruption Commission, Public Service Commission and University Grants Commission will be formed so that there can be no room for debate about the executives appointed through a uniform policy," she explained. On appointment of the High Court judges, Khaleda said provisions will be made to act on the opinion of the chief justice who can also take advice of his fellow justices. The party manifesto also says the BNP-alliance government introduced a reform programme to make the judiciary independent but the present interim government "has destroyed the judicial independence by nakedly interfering into its affairs." BNP will continue with its previous reform process, change the civil and criminal procedure codes for quick disposal of cases and remove institutional flaws through which corruption in the judiciary takes place. It has promised to overhaul judicial administration and case management system by introducing high-tech database, and create a separate secretariat under the Supreme Court for separation and full independence of the judiciary. The party, which heads the four-party alliance, says it will disclose information about the assets of all elected MPs 30 days into their swearing-in. bd
