 MANCHESTER, England, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manager Alex Ferguson bemoaned Manchester United's failure to take their Champions League scoring opportunities in Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Danes AaB Aalborg. The result was enough for the holders to go through to the last 16 as Group E winners but only because Villarreal, who had also already qualified, lost their last game 2-0 at Celtic. "We are missing too many chances and if we don't start taking them we will get ourselves embarrassed," Ferguson told reporters. "It didn't matter tonight with Celtic beating Villarreal but it could have been different. "Maybe we would have needed a win and it would have been embarrassing for us. We should have been 3-0 up in the first 15 minutes and then we were 2-1 down at halftime. "It was quite a shock to us, having played so well, and it made it difficult." United, who made nine changes to their team, were rescued by a second-half equaliser from Wayne Rooney. ROONEY FRUSTRATION Earlier, Rooney clashed with Aalborg midfielder Kasper Risgard. "I don't know what happened," said Risgard. "He was jumping at my chest, I don't know why. "Maybe he was a little bit frustrated but Manchester United were playing some good football. I don't think the referee saw it. "Anywhere else but this place it would have been a red card. I don't think it looks good on television. He apologised." Aalborg coach Allan Kuhn was delighted with his players. "What can you say about a night like this," he said. "What a performance from the players. "To get a draw at Manchester United is the biggest point in the club's history. Only one thing could be better and that would be winning at Liverpool. "Manchester United had the best chances but our goalkeeper (Karim Zaza) had a marvellous match. Before the competition nobody knew of Aalborg, now everybody knows Aalborg can play against the big teams," added Kuhn. "Aalborg is a town of 200,000 people so it's a great achievement.
