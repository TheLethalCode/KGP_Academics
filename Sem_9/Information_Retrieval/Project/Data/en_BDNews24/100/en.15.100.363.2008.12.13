 CHENNAI, India, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England gained a handy first-innings lead of 75 runs after bowling out India for 241 in the first over after lunch on an intriguing third day of the first test on Saturday. Mediumpacer Andrew Flintoff broke the last-wicket resistance when he had Amit Mishra bowled for 12 with his fourth delivery at the lunch score. Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar struck two crucial blows after India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit his third successive test fifty to help India rally after resuming on a shaky 155 for six.

Andrew Strauss hit 123 and shared a century partnership with fellow opener Alastair Cook (52) on the opening day to help the tourists reach 316 in their first innings. Dhoni, 24 overnight, batted with poise to help India move closer to England's first innings total before being ninth out, caught at long-off in the deep by Kevin Pietersen. The skipper Dhoni focused on scoring in singles and twos with the gusty Harbhajan taking the chances as the hosts went on the raise 86 runs in the opening session. Harbhajan hit fast bowler Steve Harmison for two fours in one over but was eventually caught at short-leg by Ian Bell after Panesar had replaced Harmison in the attack. Andrew Flintoff dismissed Zaheer Khan leg-before for one run before Dhoni fell. The burly all-rounder then ended the last wicket partnership of 22. England resumed their aborted tour after tight security was promised for the two tests in the wake of last month's attacks in Mumbai that killed 179 peopl
