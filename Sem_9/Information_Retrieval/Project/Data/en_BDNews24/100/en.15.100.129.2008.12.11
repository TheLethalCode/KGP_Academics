<TITLE> China inflation drops, South Korea cuts rates by record </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING/SEOUL, Thu Dec 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese consumer inflation slowed sharply as vanishing demand threatened both falling prices and profits, while South Korea's central bank cut rates a record amount and pledged more drastic action to keep its economy afloat. The fate of US automakers was uncertain, weighing on global markets. The industry took a step toward securing a $14 billion rescue after a bailout bill passed the House of Representatives but faced intense Republican pressure in the Senate. "This legislation is about offering Detroit and America a chance to get back on track," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a floor speech before the vote, referring to the US car manufacturing heartland. "It gets down to a question of tough love." The financial crisis and the global recession it propagated have deepened as 2008 stumbles to an end, forcing policy makers to devise unusual and unprecedented ways to cope with the pressures. The Federal Reserve was reportedly considered issuing its own debt, while the Korean central bank said it was on the verge of an "emergency" and may have to inject cash directly into sectors desperate for money. Deflation pressures spreading through Europe and the United States now appeared to be threatening China, the world's fourth-largest economy. Persistently declining prices because of weak demand can lead to rising unemployment and prolong economic downturns. China's annual consumer price inflation fell to a near two-year low in November, a report showed on Thursday, a day after data reflected a collapse in wholesale prices and a startling drop in exports and imports. While the slowdown in inflation can be explained by the sharp decline in commodity prices, demand-sapping recessions underway in Europe, Japan and the United States point to a heavy foot on factory-gate and consumer inflation in one of Asia's top economies. "That would then raise the risk that disinflation or deflation for manufactured goods prices in China may become more entrenched," said Glenn Maguire, Asia Pacific chief economist with Societe Generale in Hong Kong. Economists at Goldman Sachs earlier cut their forecast for China's 2009 growth to 6 percent from 7.5 percent, based on downgrades of both European and US economies. Fiscal and monetary action by Beijing as well as by other policy makers around the world will be critical to shielding their respective economies from a global slowdown that has accelerated more quickly than many had anticipated and threatened to tear apart entire industries. ARE WE THERE YET? Policy makers around the world have focused their efforts so far on slashing borrowing costs and promises of massive spending to revive their economies. However, evidence that any of it is actually working is sparse. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck criticized countries for rushing through what he called crass and untested economic rescue packages and urged governments to pause before pledging to spend billions of dollars
