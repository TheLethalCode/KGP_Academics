 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has promised to "restore" the Dhaka-Chittagong highway four-lane expansion project which has been stalled owing to procedural complicacies including appointment of contractors. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia made the promise in her party's electoral manifesto announced at Dhaka Sheraton hotel in the city on Saturday. "Once re-elected, we'll gear up implementation of the long-awaited four-lane expansion of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway," she said. "We'll also take quick initiatives to implement the subway or monorail project to ease the capital's traffic block." BNP manifesto also includes construction of deep seaports on the basis of the feasibility studies, better management of Chittagong and Mongla seaports, bridging the Padma, construction of new roads and flyovers to solve traffic problems, elevating transportation facilities along roads, air and sea routes and transforming Biman into a profit concern. bdnew
