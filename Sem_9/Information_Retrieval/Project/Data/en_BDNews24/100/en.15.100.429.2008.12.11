 MUMBAI, Dec 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police will charge the lone surviving gunman of last month's Mumbai attacks on 12 counts, including waging war against the state, when he appears in court on Thursday, officials said on Wednesday. Mumbai police are charging Mohammed Ajmal Kasab so that they can hold him in custody for longer while they collect more evidence before his trial begins. They have 90 days to file a formal chargesheet. Kasab and nine other militants rampaged across the country's financial capital killing 179 people, including 26 foreigners. He was captured soon after a three-day siege began on Nov. 26 while the other militants were killed by security men. "We are booking him on 12 offences, including murder, criminal conspiracy and waging war against the state," Rakesh Maria, chief investigator into the attacks, told reporters. Maria said police would also seek custody of two other suspects now in jail in Uttar Pradesh. The two, Fahim Ansari and another person identified only as Sabauddin, were arrested in February for an attack on a police camp and were to appear in court in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. Investigators want to question them about any links to homegrown Islamist militant groups and the Mumbai attacks. Maria said Kasab named Zakiur Rehman, Abu Hamza, Hafeez Saeed and another person known as Khafa as the main trainers of the 10 gunmen. Rehman and Hamza trained them in weapons and maritime survival tactics and along with Khafa showed the attackers images of the targets in Mumbai. India has said Pakistanis were responsible for the attack, and demanded Islamabad take action for what it says is the latest anti-India attack launched from Pakistani soil
