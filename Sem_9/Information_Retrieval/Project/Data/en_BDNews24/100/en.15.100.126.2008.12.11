<TITLE> JP still in 'grand alliance': Ershad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  In a stunning reversal 15 hours after furiously announcing a break with Awami League-led alliance, Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said the 'grand alliance' is still intact, at least until 5pm on Thursday. "The 'grand alliance' is still intact. "And, if Jatiya Party is given the number of seats it has demanded then we are ready to go to the polls with the 'grand alliance'," said the former president at a media conference Thursday. "We will wait until 5pm," Ershad said. "I have always talked about the 'grand alliance' in and outside the country and for this I was ridiculed by several leaders of Awami League. But I tolerated such humiliating remarks," the former military strongman said. "A written agreement promised us 60 seats and that came down to 50, then 47 and now we hear that Jatiya Party will be given 40 seats." "We hope that they will withdraw their candidates from our seats." "I have heard that the leader of the 'grand alliance' has already issued a letter on the matter." An angry JP chief said to reporters on Wednesday evening after a meeting of his party presidium, "Even if they (AL) offer us 70 seats or 100 seats, there's no going back," "We have taken a formal decision," he said. Later that day, after a meeting of the party's policymaking presidium, secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Howlader at a media briefing in presence of senior party members had declared that Jatiya Party was leaving the alliance. "We have been neglected a lot; [acting chairman Barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud] went to the AL office and waited nine hours, but no-one met him," said Ershad on Thursday. "However, we are still with the grand alliance," added Ershad, who looked far from his angry self. "They have lodged cases against Jatiya Party candidates, given nominations in my seat," alleged the former president, adding that this was not morally right. "Even after all this, we will remain with the alliance considering the interest of the country and, if Awami League withdraws its nominations from our seats by 5pm today, then we will stay with the alliance." Talking about the post of president he said: "If we win the election then everything will come and if the alliance remains then victory is certain." Ershad, who was jailed by the Khaleda Zia-led administration, apparently did not rule out joining the BNP-led four-party alliance that he had previously said he so loathed. "A connection with the four-party-alliance is nothing abnormal," he observed. bdnew
