 Pabna, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com) Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami has said he had to go to jail twice for refusing to appear as the main witness against BNP chief Khaleda Zia in the GATCO case. "Through lawyers of the Anticorruption Commission, I was told that if I appeared as a witness against Khaleda Zia then I would not be made an accused in the GATCO case," Nizami alleged. "Refusing the proposal to be a false witness, I said that I am willing to become an accused," said Nizami during an electoral speech at the Bogram Primary School Field of Sathia Upazila. "The present caretaker government is the fruit of the movement of Awami League and it tried to break the four-party-alliance," he observed. "But their effort failed." He said during the current regime, the price of per kg of rice, fertiliser and soybean oil rose from Tk 14, Tk 7 and Tk 50 to Tk 40, Tk 70 and Tk 130, respectively. "Awami League killed a lot of people on October 28, 2006 and, on December 29 we want to give an answer to those acts of terrorism by winning through a huge margin," Nizami said. bdnews24.c
