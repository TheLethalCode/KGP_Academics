 CANBERRA, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's former cricket star Shane Warne, who likens his turbulent personal life to a soap opera, has been won over by a new musical play based on his antics on and off the field. Warne is the subject of "Shane Warne: The Musical", which opened in his home-town of Melbourne and takes a light-hearted look at his life, including notorious text messages to and from female admirers, his infidelities on tour, and the well-publicised break up of his marriage to wife Simone.
