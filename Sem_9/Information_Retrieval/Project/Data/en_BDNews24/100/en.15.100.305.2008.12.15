 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu), a component of the Awami League-led grand alliance has said it will move to form a national government if the alliance goes to power. "We have to form a national government with secular and democratic forces for meaningful reform and economic, social and political development of the country," JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu told a press conference on Monday, unveiling the party's election manifesto. Citing the example of the national government formed by Nelson Mandela in South Africa, Inu said the country had not seen any period of political stability after liberation. "The country's politics was plunged into instability for various reasons including military government and Islamic militants. It was not possible to form a national government in 1972 though it was required at that time," he said. Inu stressed the necessity of continuing with a national government for at least five years. "If necessary it can include the opposition or losing parties," he said. Control of prices, food security, state support to protect the low-income earners, more power generation, energy security and the anti-graft drive topped the list of the party's pledges, the JSD leader said. "If we can play a role in forming the next government, we will attempt to ban religion-based politics, communalism and edicts issued by religious authorities," Inu said. "We will try to form a commission to identify war criminals and investigate war crimes and the massacre of 1971," he said. He backed a special tribunal for trying war criminals in line with the international law. The party manifesto also vows to follow the four main principles of the 1972 Constitution: democracy, communism, secularism and nationalism. "A two-house parliament system should be with the upper house constituted of professionals, labourers, minorities and local representatives," said the party chief. JSD also backs a 10 percent subsidy on the price of agricultural products, 30 percent assistance in exporting agricultural products and introducing a rural bank. The manifesto also proposes a fund of Tk 5,000 crore for small and medium industries. The party further pledges to ensure fair distribution of the water of 54 rivers flowing between Bangladesh and India. JSD's other pledges include strengthening port infrastructure, national industry and the service sector, and programmes for the development of women, disabled people, poor, landless people and freedom fighters. "The nation hoped that the political leadership would emerge out of destructive practices after the 1/11 changeover. But many corrupt people, politicians and criminals are being fielded by political parties due to loopholes of law and the failure of the caretaker government," claimed Inu. BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami have nominated those identified as corrupt and convicts, he said, terming them enemies of the country and the nation. JSD is running the upcoming national election in four seats under the AL-led grand alliance. bdnew
