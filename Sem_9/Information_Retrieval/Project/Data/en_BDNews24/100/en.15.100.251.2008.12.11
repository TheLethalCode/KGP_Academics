<TEXT>
 LYON, France, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two goals by Miroslav Klose earned Bayern Munich a 3-2 victory at Olympique Lyon on Wednesday that gave the Germans top spot in Champions League Group F. Bayern struck three times before the break but Lyon made a spirited comeback in the second half of a lively game played on a soggy pitch. The visitors, who also struck through Frenchman Franck Ribery, finished the group three points ahead of Lyon. Both sides had already qualified. Lyon, missing Brazilian pair Juninho and Cris through suspension, paid the price for clumsy defending before waking up after halftime with goals by Sidney Govou and Karim Benzema. "We played extremely well in the first half but I told my team mates at halftime it would be tough because I knew Lyon would fight," Ribery told reporters. "It was a great Champions League match with a great half from each side and plenty of goals. I'm sure the fans enjoyed it." Bayern opened the scoring on 11 minutes when Klose struck from inside the area. ANGLED SHOT Ribery latched on to a pass by Luca Toni to make it 2-0 with an angled shot before Klose tapped in a Ribery cross at the far post in the 37th minute. Lyon reduced the arrears through Govou seven minutes into the second half and Benzema showed his class when he raced into the area and twisted his way past keeper Michael Rensing for their second goal on 68. The Ligue 1 champions piled on the pressure in the closing stages but Bayern hung on. "Bayern had a bit of luck in that first half but it's true we were too naive," said Govou. "Coming back when you're 3-0 down against Bayern in a Champions League match is almost impossible but we nearly did it. If only we had played the whole match the way we did the second half.
