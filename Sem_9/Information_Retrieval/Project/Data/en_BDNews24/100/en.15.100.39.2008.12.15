 Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Talking heads in the US were in a fluster after George W Bush's surprise trip to Iraq on Sunday unexpectedly turned into a public relation disaster as an Iraqi journalist took off his shoes and launched them at the outgoing US president during a press conference. Television footage showed Bush ducking from side to side as the journalist, identified as Mutadar al-Zaidi, a reporter with the Cairo-based network Al Baghdadia Television, hurled his shoes moments after the American president concluded his remarks with a "Thank you" in Arabic. The incident lent an air of chaos and farce to a trip intended to highlight improving security conditions in the war-torn country. "This is a farewell kiss! Dog!" the reporter shouted as he was quickly overpowered by security agents pinning him to the floor of the heavily guarded room. Unfazed, the reporter kept shouting "Dog, dog!" in a display of anger and revulsion toward a man who many Iraqis believe is responsible for the slaughter of thousands of men, women and children. He was later forcibly evicted from the press conference. A visibly embarrassed Bush later joked about the incident. "All I can report is they were a size 10," he said. But the Americans were not amused. Watching the incident on evening newscasts analysts and commentators were struggling to figure out what happened and why. Richard Angel, Middle East bureau chief of the NBC News, surmised the shoe-thrower represented growing frustration and anger of the Iraqi people toward a man held responsible for the enormous suffering and misery of the Iraqi people under American occupation. Describing him as a good professional, Angel said he had known the Iraqi reporter during his long stay there. "I think he just snapped." According to some news reports, al-Zaidi lost close relatives in the US-led war and he himself was kidnapped by followers of Muktada al-Sadr, a rebel Shiite leader, while reporting from Sadr City. He was released just a few months ago. Bush travelled to Iraq under a veil of secrecy for his fourth and presumably final stop as president, then went on to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, landing after dark to attend a rally with US and foreign troops deployed to that country. Both war zones will be central to defining his turbulent presidency. His last visit comes against a backdrop of declining violence across Iraq, which the Bush administration attributes to a buildup of thousands of reinforcements last year. Yet attacks have continued and many areas in Iraq remain unstable, particularly in the north. Just last week, at least 57 Iraqis were killed in a suicide attack at a popular restaurant outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. In a speech at the US Military Academy in West Point, NY, Bush vigorously defended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and argued that his administration had "laid a solid foundation" for Obama overseas. Bush also urged Obama to "stay on the offensive" against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. bd
