 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia asked the party men on Sunday to watch for attempts to rig the general elections mandated for Dec. 29. She also asked all parties to forget all differences and work together for the country. "The Dec 29 election is very significant for the country. All party men should be careful so that nobody can rig votes," Khaleda said in an election rally at Manikganj Government Debendra College on her way to Khulna. "If we remain united BNP will win the election by two-thirds majority," she claimed. The former prime minister sought vote for Harun-or-RashidKhan Monno, a candidate for Manikganj-2 and Afroza Khan Rita, his daughter and a candidate for Manikganj-3. Later, she asked the electorate to vote for BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, who is running for Manikganj-1, at another rally at Shibalaya Upazila. "No more misunderstanding now. Let's all work together irrespective of all divisions and make an effective parliament," she said. "We need to establish a democratic government to make the country self-reliant. There has not been any development in the country in the past two years. People have become unemployed." Khaleda pledged that if they went to power they would cut prices of commodities. She believed that they would go to the power this time with the people's verdict. The BNP chief would go to Rajbari and hold a rally at Rajbari Railway Ground. She started for Khulna in the morning, on a two-day visit to take her election campaign south. The former prime minister's motorcade left Dhaka for Khulna at around 8:30am from her Dhaka Cantonment home. bdnews24
