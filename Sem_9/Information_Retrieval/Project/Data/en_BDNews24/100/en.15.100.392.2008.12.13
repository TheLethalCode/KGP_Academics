 Sylhet, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party joined the Awami League-led electoral alliance for a sure victory, JP chairman Hossein Muhammed Ershad said on Saturday. "I'm disappointed that we got much less than what we wanted from the alliance, and we got only one seat in Sylhet out of six," the former president told local media in Sylhet. He also expressed disappointment that an AL candidate would also contest for the lone Sylhet constituency allotted to JP. "But the victory for the AL-led alliance is certain, which is why we have joined the alliance though there were odds," said Ershad . "People are fed up with the extremely high prices of essentials. So they are going to vote for the alliance as they want an easier life," the JP chairman said. He avoided a question about whether he would be president in case the AL-alliance wins the election. Ershad went to Sylhet on Saturday afternoon to kick off his election campaign after paying respects at the shrine of Shah Jalal. He was accompanied by JP presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed and secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader. The JP candidate for Sylhet-3 is Atikur Rahman Atik. bdnews2
