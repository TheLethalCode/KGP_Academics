 Suman Mahmud Chief political correspondent Jessore, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Conspirators are busy scheming to foil the general elections, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia alleged at a public meeting at Jessore on Monday and warned that any attempt to sabotage the polls will be catastrophic. After offering wreaths at the Martyred Intellectuals Memorial in Dhaka on Sunday, Khaleda's motorcade headed for the southwestern districts on a public relations campaign. En route, the BNP chairperson addressed meetings at Manikganj, Rajbari, Kushtia, Meherpur, Chuadanga and Magura before arriving at Jessore early Monday. Speaking to the people assembled at Jessore Town Hall ground, she said, "Conspirators jumped to action as soon as they witnessed the overwhelming popularity of BNP." "People will not tolerate any evil plotters damaging the polls." "I see that people are joining ranks with you, favouring our polls symbol 'sheaf of paddy' just like they did in 2001," said Khaleda, addressing the BNP supporters. "Simultaneously, we have to watch carefully if anybody is plotting to foil the polls." She urged the administration to act neutrally. "Though the administrative elements have been purposively laid out to favour 'a particular political party', I'll ask them to discharge their responsibilities impartially and ensure a free and fair polls." The four-party alliance chief said, "The whole country has been converted into a jail-house during the past couple of years. People now want to be free again." Alleging that the antigraft drive was launched to depoliticise the country, Khaleda said, "The corrupt are hale and hearty all right. It was the people's representatives who were arrested and persecuted and sued." "Failing to banish me, the authorities put my sons behind bars and tortured them. My healthy children left the prison hospital on stretchers, wearing oxygen masks." "We had to suffer because we love the country. Ziaur Rahman also gave his life as he loved his country and people." Claiming that extensive development was effected during the immediate past BNP rule, the former prime minister said, "Some quarters had then conspired to sabotage the BNP government that had initiated 'flow of development'." "The conflictive political situation following the end of four-party alliance rule in 2006 ushered in the emergency rule on January 11, 2007all of which came off anti-BNP plots." "The January 22, 2007 polls were cancelled because all were against the imminent BNP victory, which would ensure continued happiness for the voters." Calling upon everybody to work together, the BNP chairperson said, "Let's all work together to restore democracy and save the people and the country." Khaleda introduced the four-party alliance candidates running the polls from six seats to the people. They were BNP leader Tariqul Islam (Jessore-3), TS Ayub (Jessore-4), Abul Hossain Azad (Jessore-6), Jamaat-e-Islami leader Azizur Rahman (Jessore-1), Shahadat Hossain (Jessore-2) and Islami Oikyo Jote leader Mufti Muhammad Wakkas (Jessore-5). Asking people to cast their votes for the former minister Tariqul Islam, she said, "Tariqul Islam is a tested and selfless leader, who has suffered persecution. Please vote for him." Tariqul said, "Unfortunately, I had been jailed by the erstwhile Pakistani ruler Ayub Khan. Again, this government also put me behind bars. I've always been with the people of Jessore through thick and thin." Accompanied by BNP's vice president Sarwari Rahman, Khaleda started for Kalaroa of Satkhira after rounding off the Jessore meeting. She is scheduled to address seven public meetings in Khulna, Bagerhat and Satkhira districts. A day before announcing BNP's election manifesto on Saturday, Khaleda launched her polls campaign on Friday through addressing public meetings at Sylhet, Habiganj and Brahmanbarhia. On Saturday, after unveiling the manifesto, she addressed a number of meetings in the capital starting in the evening through late into the night. bd
