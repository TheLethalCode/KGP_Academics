<TITLE> North Korea nuclear talks limp on with no prize for Bush </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Thu Dec 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks pressing North Korea to abandon its nuclear arms ambitions limped into a fourth day on Thursday, with dim hope of progress toward disarmament that would be a prize for the outgoing Bush administration. Having coaxed North Korea to partly disable its Yongbyon nuclear complex this year in a disarmament-for-aid deal, envoys from five states have been asking the wary and impoverished state to accept a protocol for checking its nuclear declaration. Agreement on verification would open the way to dismantling North Korea's nuclear arms capacity and count as a welcome diplomatic trophy for U.S. President George W Bush before he gives way to President-elect Barack Obama in January. But the chief US negotiator, Christopher Hill, said there was no sign of agreement after three days of the latest talks. He said the impasse was due to secretive North Korea's unwillingness to put verification commitments in writing. "Obviously we would like to see progress made on this verification protocol, and so far we haven't seen that," he told reporters. "The North Koreans don't want to put into writing what they are willing to put into words." The standoff would continue at least until Obama settles into the White House, said Peter Beck, an expert on the two Koreas at American University in Washington, DC. "The headwinds were especially strong going into these talks because we have been dealing with the government change in the U.S. and the potential regime change in North Korea," said Beck, referring to reports suggesting the North's supreme leader, Kim Jong-il, has been sick, possibly after a stroke. Bush denounced North Korea as part of an "axis of evil", alongside Iran and Iraq, but later he strongly backed Hill's efforts to strike a disarmament deal with the North. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the negotiators would gather for more six-way talks on Thursday and the agency also cited an unnamed source who said North Korea suggested to China that the talks continue. But as Hill prepared to join other negotiators at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse, he said he was unsure of the format. The six-party talks, begun in 2003, bring together North and South Korea, host China, the United States, Japan and Russia. They took on fresh urgency after Pyongyang held its first nuclear test explosion in October 2006, but have made fitful progress in curtailing its atomic ambitions. NUCLEAR SAMPLES North Korea has refused proposals to allow inspectors to take nuclear samples to test its declaration, said South Korea's envoy Kim Sook, Kyodo news agency reported. But analysts do not think North Korea, starved of energy and money, plans to quit the talks, at least for now, because it craves the aid coming to it through the nuclear deal, especially after cutting ties with South Korea, once a big benefactor. Overnight in Washington, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack did not rule out putting North Korea back on a list of states accused of sponsoring terrorism. "I suppose these things are always possible," he told a news briefing. "...it's based on behaviour. And we'll see what behaviour North Korea engages in." But Beck, the Korea expert, saw little scope for the Bush administration to apply such punishment. "Even if they had effective sticks, there really isn't any time to use them," he said. "I don't think he (Bush) wants to hand over yet another crisis for Obama.
