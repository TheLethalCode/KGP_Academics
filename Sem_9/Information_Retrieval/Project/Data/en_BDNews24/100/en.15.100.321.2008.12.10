 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Wednesday ordered officials to send actor and BNP ward commissioner Monwar Hossain Dipjol to jail, his lawyer said. The court of chief metropolitan magistrate Moazzem Hossain passed the order, defence lawyer Ataur Rahman Duke said. "The chief metropolitan magistrate gave the orders showing the accused arrested in six cases and as convict in three other cases," Duke said to bdnews24.com. The court asked the authorities to follow the jail code after the defence counsel appealed to the court to grant the Dipjol first division and health care facilities in the prison. Dipjol was taken to the Court at midday. Rapid Action Battalion detained him from a house in Mirpur on Tuesday. RAB handed him over to Darus Salam Police Station at around 11:30am after interrogation. Some 300 supporters of Dipjol chanted slogans demanding his release when he was being sent to the court from the police station at 11:45am. Darus Salam police sub-inspector Mehedi Hasan told bdnews24.com that there were warrants of arrest against Dipjol in nine cases. "In some cases, court has sentenced him to over 40 years in jail." Earlier, major Mahmud Hossain of RAB-4 said at a press briefing, "Besides the cases, over 50 general diaries have been registered against Dipjol. "He has been facing numerous charges including of terrorism, extortion, illegal grabbing of government lands, tax-evasion, murder and possessing illegal arms." "Acting on an intelligence tip-off, we arrested him on Tuesday and later raided different places on the basis of the significant information he gave us," major Mahmud said. "Our investigations are going on." RAB assistant director captain Mohammad Moshiul Alam told reporters that Dipjol was arrested in flat no. D-4 of "Ena Garden" at Adabor in Mirpur. Dipjol was produced before the reporters. He said, "I'm innocent and fake cases have been filed against me by seizing my licensed arms." He said he was preparing to surrender to the court. Asked if he fled the country after 1/11, Dipjol said he was in Dhaka all the time. Major Mahmud however dismissed his claim. "He was not in the country. He is lying." Replying to a question, Dipjol said, "All the cases filed against me are fake and I can even go to the Baitul Mukarram mosque to hang myself." Dipjol has been convicted for at least 45 years in 12 cases on charges of murder, extortion, tax-dodge and illegal possession of arms. Dipjol, who played the antagonist in Bangla movies and also directed a few, had been on the run since emergency was declared in Jan. 11, 2007. His wife, Romana Monwar, has been convicted of a raft of charges and released on bail from jail. bdne
