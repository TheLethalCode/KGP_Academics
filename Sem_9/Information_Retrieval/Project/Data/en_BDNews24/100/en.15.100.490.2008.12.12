 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The businesses believe that Awami League should have made is position clear on general strike and touched on issues of economic development in its election manifesto. "The manifesto has touched on a lot of issues including the development of infrastructure, but the issue of hartal has remained untouched," said Annisul Huq, president of the Bangladesh Industries and Business Council. "We will sit on the issue of hartal separately." At a business conference organised by FBCCI on Nov. 15 last, demands were made for consensus among the political parties for the framing of a law to ban general strikes that make businesses count billions of taka in losses a year. "The manifesto emphasises a lot of things," observed Fazlul Huq, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturing and Exporters Association. "We liked the pledge to save Bangladesh from the impact of the global economic slump." He praised the long-term planning reaching up to 2021 saying, "We usually have short-term plans, but for progress, long-term plans are excellent." He also said the issue of hartal should have been cleared. "The issue of how we can save ourselves from the destruction and losses because of hartal remains untouched in the manifesto," commented Huq. "If the AL's manifesto is implemented then we will immensely benefit," said Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, president of the Bangladesh Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association. "But we need to see if the pledges made are put to action or remain confined to paper." The manifesto talks about making export multidimensional but it would have been better if more emphasis had been put on increasing production, he added. "With a bit of government assistance, export will increase by leaps and bounds." Talking about the development of infrastructure, as promised in the manifesto, Parvez said, "We have to see if this is done through loans or on [build-own-transfer] basis. "But in comparison, BOT is better." Awami League president Sheikh Hasina unveiled her party's 23-point election manifesto on Friday morning, highlighting five priority issues: economic security, anticorruption measures, energy security, eradication of poverty and good governance. b
