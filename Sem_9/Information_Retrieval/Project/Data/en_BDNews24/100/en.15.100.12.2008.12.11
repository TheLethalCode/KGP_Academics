<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Daniel Flynn and Jesse Ryder grafted half-centuries to guide New Zealand to a respectable 226 for four on the first day of the opening test against West Indies on Thursday. Flynn fell agonisingly short of a maiden test hundred when he made a career-best 95 leaving Ryder unbeaten on 54 when play ended early because of bad light at the University Oval, Dunedin. Opener Tim McIntosh chipped in with 34 on his debut while West Indies captain Chris Gayle was the pick of the bowlers, capturing three wickets. Brendon McCullum was four not out. "It's a pretty decent batting wicket, the ball wasn't doing that much and the bowlers had to work hard," Gayle told the New Zealand Press Association. "I'm not too disappointed to finish the day with them on 226 for four." Play was halted midway through the final session when the batsmen accepted an offer to go off because of fading light. Flynn departed five runs short of a deserved hundred when he was trapped leg before wicket by Gayle, ending an innings that lasted almost four hours and featured 12 boundaries. He provided the backbone of New Zealand's innings, sharing an 87-run partnership with McIntosh. "To make a contribution like I did I'm happy," said Flynn, who was promoted from his usual position at six to bat at three. "I'm obviously disappointed not to have kicked on but it's a great opportunity for me to fill that spot at number three, to make it my own." TEMPTATION The tourists made a bright start after losing the toss when they dismissed Jamie How for 10 in the sixth over of the day, caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul at point after he attempted a loose drive off the bowling of Daren Powell. They turned the heat on the inexperienced McIntosh, who took 38 balls to get off the mark, but failed to get another breakthrough until after lunch when the 29-year-old lefthander holed out to Lionel Baker off Gayle's off spin bowling. Ross Taylor also succumbed to temptation, trying to sweep slog Gayle and gifting a catch to Xavier Marshall at short midwicket. Flynn and Ryder steadied the innings with a fourth-wicket stand of 61 before Gayle deceived Flynn, who was given out after the appeal was referred to the third umpire, Rudi Koertzen. "I thought I was hit outside the line but once I looked at it again I've seen it's hit me in line. You can't really argue with it can you?," Flynn said. "I initially thought I was okay. The West Indies boys were asking me how I was feeling ... I was pretty calm to start with but once it started dragging out a bit longer, the nerves crept in." Gayle, who invoked the experimental rules by asking Indian umpire Amish Saheba to refer the decision after he initially turned down the appeal, said he sympathised with Flynn. "If I was the batsman I'd be pretty disappointed with this referral," Gayle said. "It's unfortunate he missed out on a hundred, he batted pretty well even though it was a good wicket to bat on." New Zealand were forced to reshuffle their batting order at the last minute when all-rounder Jacob Oram withdrew from the match with a calf strain he suffered in training a day earlier. West Indies awarded first caps to right-arm fast bowler Baker and middle order batsman Brendan Nash, who became the first white player to represent the region in over 35 years. Nash was born in Australia but his father swam for Jamaica at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics
