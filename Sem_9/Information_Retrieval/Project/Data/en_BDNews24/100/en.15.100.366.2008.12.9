<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka promised Tuesday that Dhaka City Corporation will clear wastes of the sacrificed animals by midnight. "Cattle markets in the city did not create any traffic jam this year. In future cattle markets will be arranged in different fields and also in the old airport, instead of roads," Khoka said to reporters as he launched Clean Dhaka Programme at Chankharpul intersection. "The space might not be enough though for the increased number of cattle markets to serve the such a population." He said that remains of slaughtered animals could not be used to produce alternative energy as those were not solid. Khoka said they knew that some people would also sacrifice animals on Wednesday. Dhaka City Corporation has cancelled leaves of its waste management department employees. "They are busy cleaning our city, Dhaka," said Khoka. bdnews
