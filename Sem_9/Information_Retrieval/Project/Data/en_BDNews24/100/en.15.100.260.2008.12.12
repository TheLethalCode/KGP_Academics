 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)Awami League president Sheikh Hasina unveiled her party's 23-point election manifesto on Friday morning, with a look back at AL's "golden period", highlighting five priority issues: economic security, anticorruption measures, energy security, poverty cut and good governance. Hasina presented the "main elements of the manifesto" through 68 bullet points. The most applauded among these were Hasina's promises to: Reduce the price of rice, pulses, edible oil and other necessities "within the purchasing power of the people". Try war criminals and suppress communal terrorism "with an iron hand". Reduce the poverty ratio from the current 45 percent to 25 by 2013, and the absolute number of poor from 6.5 crore to 4.5 crore. Adopt a comprehensive employment policy "consistent with the dignity of the citizens", and reducing unemployment from 40 percent to 15 percent by 2021. Called Din Bodoler Nirbachoni Ishtehar 2008, or Charter for Change 2008, the manifesto describes Hasina's targets for a 'Vision 2021'. Vision 2021, when Bangladesh reaches 50 years as an independent nation, will be "an instrument to end poverty", says the party. Beginning her address at 10.35am at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, the AL chief and former prime minister touched on the five priority issues covered by the manifesto: Economic security in the face of the global crisis and spiraling prices at home AL's manifesto says : Measures will be taken to reduce the unbearable burden of price hike and keep it in tune with the purchasing power of the people. After giving the highest priority to the production of domestic commodities, arrangements will be made for timely import to ensure food security. A multi-prong drive will be made to control prices along with monitoring the market. Hoarding and profiteering syndicates will be eliminated. An institution for commodity price control and consumer protection will be set up. Above all, price reduction and stability will be achieved by bringing equilibrium between demand and supply of commodities. Effective anticorruption measures The manifesto says : Multi-pronged measures to fight corruption will be put into place. Powerful people will have to submit wealth statement annually. Strict measures will be taken to eliminate bribe, extortion, rent seeking and corruption. Strong measures will be taken against those having unearned and black money, against loan defaulters, tender manipulators, and users of muscle power in every stage of state and society. Power and energy security AL's manifesto says : A comprehensive long term policy on electricity and energy will be adopted. Economic usage of oil, gas, coal, hydro power, wind power and solar energy will be ensured. Big and small power generation stations, coal extraction, and oil and gas exploration will be given priority. Under a three-year crash program quick implementation of ongoing and under consideration power generation stations, import of electricity from neighboring countries, will be undertaken. By 2011 power production will be increased to 5000 megawatt and by 2013 it will be further increased to 7000 megawatt. Eradication of poverty The manifesto says : The main strategy of poverty reduction will center on bringing vibrancy in agriculture and rural life. Social safety net will be extended for the ultra-poor. By 2013 poverty level and proportion of ultra-poor will be brought down to 25 percent and 15 percent respectively. At present, there are 65 million poor people in the country. This number will be reduced to 45 million by 2013 and will further come down to 22 million in 2021. A comprehensive employment guideline will be formulated aiming at poverty reduction, solving unemployment problem and making citizens' lives meaningful. The number of unemployed people in the country, estimated at 28 million, will be reduced to 24 million by 2013 and will be further reduced to 15 million by 2021. Good governance The manifesto says : Terrorism and religious extremism will be controlled with iron hand. Trial of war criminals will be arranged. Genuine independence and impartiality of the judiciary will be ensured. Extrajudicial killings will be stopped. Rule of law will be established, the Human Rights Commission will be strengthened and made effective, and an Ombudsman will be appointed. Human rights will be strictly enforced. The ongoing reform programme of the Election Commission and electoral system will continue. Administration will be free from politicisation and will be pro-people. Efficiency, seniority and merit will be the basis of appointment and promotion in public service. Administrative reform, right to information and e-governance will be introduced. AL's "Golden Period" "The people of the country have a deep commitment to democracy," Hasina said before describing the "golden period" achieved under her leadership during AL's 1996-2001 term in power and vowing to bring the country back on track. "During  a short period of five years only  Awami League tried its best to give democracy an institutional foundation," she said. Hasina cited AL's progress in areas of "human rights and good governance", "self-sufficiency in food production", "stability" in prices of essentials, "raising electricity generation" and "economic growth exceeding 6.2 percent" "Bangladesh achieved a transformation during these years," she said. Hasina slams past BNP-Jamaat govt "But," she went on, "the potentials were destroyed by the election engineering of 2001 and the abuse of powers by the BNP-Jamaat alliance for the five years of their government." "You recall, for sure, the political vengeance taken by the BNP-Jamaat alliance ... and rise of militant communalism with the encouragement of the government." "The main terrorist syndicate grew up with the patronage of the alliance government and Hawa Bhaban," she said, calling the latter "a parallel centre of government authority". Blaming the four-party alliance government for initiating rising prices, she said: "The people did not know how to cope with the unbridled price spiral." "Not one megawatt was added to electricity generation, but 20 thousand crore taka was looted from this sector. The power and energy crisis became unbearable. "Politicisation, unrestrained corruption, nepotism, plunder of resources of the state, and abysmal failure of governance made Bangladesh the most corrupt country during the five years of the BNP-Jamaat rule." "The alliance government was bent on making Bangladesh a failed state," she claimed. "The people demand that the country be free from terrorism and corruption; they want a just and progressive society," the AL chief stated. "Bangladesh Awami League, therefore, wants not only a mere change of power. We are determined to salvage the country from its present critical state and to transform it into a land of real democracy with rule of law, food security, rapid development and peaceful existence." Vision 2021 dedicated to the young Hasina dedicated Vision-2021 to the young generation, "who are enrolled as voters this year for the first time, with the aim of building a bright future for them". "By implementing this manifesto with the collective efforts of the entire nation, we will create a bright and successful future for the new generation." "We call upon them to participate in this great endeavour of national reconstruction and build a bright future for themselves as well as for generations to come," said the AL president. bdn
