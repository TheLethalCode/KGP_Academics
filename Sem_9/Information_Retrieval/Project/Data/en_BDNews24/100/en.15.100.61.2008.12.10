<TITLE> Rio Tinto to cut 14,000 jobs, slash spending </TITLE>

 MELBOURNE, Wed Dec 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto, saddled with nearly $40 billion in net debt, announced plans on Wednesday to cut 14,000 jobs, slash capital spending and boost asset sales but said it would hold its dividend steady. Rio has been under pressure to detail plans to cut borrowings since its share price collapsed after larger rival BHP Billiton scrapped a $66 billion takeover bid for the company last month. "What they've done has more than allayed fears in the market that they were going to come and have an equity issue," said Tim Schroeders, portfolio manager at Pengana Capital in Melbourne. "Drastic times call for drastic measures. They've addressed all parts of the equation. They've definitely gone into survival mode, which is appropriate given the market circumstances," Schroeders said. Rio said it would reduce its global headcount by 14,000 and increase the range of assets it was looking to sell, but said it was too early to be specific. "Rio Tinto has announced a detailed package of measures in response to the unprecedented rapidity and severity of the global economic downturn, which has caused sharp falls in commodity prices and a significantly weaker outlook," the company said. Rio took on huge debts to fund last year's $38 billion acquisition of Alcan, and pledged to raise $15 billion, most of it this year, from selling non-core assets. But sliding metals prices and slowing demand have made those assets worth less, and the global financial crisis has made it tougher for potential buyers to get credit. To date, Rio has raised just $3 billion from disposals. Rio's Australian shares closed up 12 percent at A$37.40 ahead of the announcement
