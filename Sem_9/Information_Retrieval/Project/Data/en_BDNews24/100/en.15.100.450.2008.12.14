 Chittagong, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury resumed office on Sunday after 21 months and being the Chittagong city Awami League president, he called on supporters to work for broader party goals burying discontents over nominations in some of the Chittagong seats. Mohiuddin made the appeal as he entered the Nagar Bhaban Sunday morning to attend office as mayor. Months back, when Mohiuddin was released on bail for treatment, he had to seek High Court's order to attend office as before. The HC allowed Mohiuddin, who had been detained for 21 months since his arrest on March 7, 2007, to resume his responsibilities. As he reached his office at around 11am, the city corporation officials and employees greeted him with flowers. The mayor exchanged greetings with the ward commissioners before attending to his everyday business. Later, speaking to reporters, the mayor said despite his qualms and disagreement over a number of AL and 'grand alliance' nominations, he would continue to work with all to maintain solidarity and integrity of his party. He said since the party president had nominated 'somebody', they all together would uphold her judgment and work for the victory of the 'boat' symbol. Mohiuddin also said the AL was now ready to make foray into BNP strongholds. The mayor said the city's development remained virtually suspended during his absence, as many of his initiated projects were abandoned. The mayor pledged to restore the city's lost pride and grandeur. bdnews
