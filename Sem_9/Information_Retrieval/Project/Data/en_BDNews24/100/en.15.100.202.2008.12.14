 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) Around 3,000 licensed arms have been deposited with 35 police stations in the capital ahead of polls, with Sunday being the deadline, said the Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief on Saturday. "They include 2,386 pistols and revolvers and 600 large arms," said Naim Ahmed. "Sunday will be the last day for depositing licensed arms and ammunition ahead of elections," he said. Questioned by reporters, he said the police had no directive regarding extension of the deadline for arms submission. To maintain law and order ahead of the national vote, the home ministry on Nov 20 directed licensed arms owners to deposit them by Dec 3. The deadline was extended to Dec 14 (Sunday) in a notification, following the deferment of the general election. Gun owners have until 6pm Sunday. Violators found possessing or bearing any arms after the deadline will be strictly dealt with under the arms act, said the police chief. bdnews24.
