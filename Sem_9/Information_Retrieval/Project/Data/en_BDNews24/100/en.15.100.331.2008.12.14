Asked how the government was proceeding about its preparations for the general elections slated for Dec. 29 , the adviser said, "We are satisfied with our preparations." "We wish all the electoral candidates luck. We hope to run healthy electoral races across the country and effect desired developmental changes." After his meeting with the communication adviser Ghulam Quader at the Roads and Highways Department in the morning, Zillur on his way out responded to the queries of the waiting reporters. Addressing the contesting political parties, Zillur Said, "Seeing everybody behave so responsibly, we are sanguine that a free and fair election will be held." Replying to another query on the election manifestos of Awami League and BNP, he said, "It's up to the voters, and not us to analyse the polls manifestos."
