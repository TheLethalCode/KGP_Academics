 CHENNAI, India, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inspired England took control of the opening test against India on Friday after debutant off spinner Graeme Swann grabbed two wickets in his first over in test cricket. The 29-year-old Swann dismissed opener Gautam Gambhir (19) with his third delivery and number three Rahul Dravid (3) with his sixth to reduce India to 37 for three. Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar and medium-pacer Andrew Flintoff then struck in quick succession to dismiss Vangipurappu Laxman (24) and Sachin Tendulkar (37) respectively after the pair had raised 61 for the fourth wicket. Fast bowler Steve Harmison had birthday boy Yuvraj Singh caught at second slip by Flintoff for 14, to leave India in tatters at 155 for six in reply to England's first-innings 316. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (24) was at the crease at stumps with Harbhajan Singh on 13. Wicketkeeper Matt Prior struck his fifth test fifty to guide the visitors past the 300-mark before England were all out 40 minutes after lunch. Andrew Strauss hit 123 and shared a century partnership with fellow opener Alastair Cook (52) on the opening day. New-ball bowler James Anderson struck the first blow when he forced opener Virender Sehwag to play on to the stumps for nine runs. Flintoff was explosive in his first spell, but it was Swann who left India in deep trouble. The in-form Gambhir, who missed last month's final test against Australia due to a one-match ban, hit Swann's first delivery for four through point, but fell leg before two balls later in the final over before tea. MAJESTIC TOUCH England tightened their grip on the match when Dravid, with his place under question following extended poor form, was trapped leg before. Panesar, replacing Swann in the attack, dismissed in-form Laxman caught and bowled. In the next over a fired-up Flintoff had Tendulkar caught and bowled with the very first ball of his second spell after the record-breaking batsman had looked in majestic touch, hitting four boundaries and a six. Prior, batting at number eight, hit an unbeaten 53 after nightwatchman James Anderson made a useful 19 to rally England before Indian spinners helped end the innings. Prior raised 42 runs for the seventh wicket with Anderson and 27 more with Steve Harmison (6) for the ninth wicket, guiding the England to 294 for eight at lunch. A cautious Prior faced 102 balls and hit off spinner Harbhajan for his only four. Anderson frustrated India for almost 90 minutes after Flintoff (18) fell without adding to the overnight score of 229. Flintoff was caught smartly by Gambhir at short leg off leg-spinner Amit Mishra, who later had Anderson caught at deep midwicket to claim his third wicket. Harbhajan dismissed Swann, caught at first slip by Dravid, who is one short of equalling Australian Mark Waugh's world record of 181 catches. Harbhajan claimed three for 96 and Mishra took three for 99 as seven wickets fell to spin bowlers on a slow pitch. England resumed their aborted tour after tight security was promised for the two tests following safety concerns in the wake of last month's attacks in Mumbai that killed 179 people. The stands were mostly empty for the second consecutive da
