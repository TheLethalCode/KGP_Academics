<TITLE> Thai ex-PM Thaksin asks military to stay out of vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra called for national reconciliation on Saturday and urged the military not to meddle in a parliamentary vote for a new leader next week. Thaksin, who was ousted by the military in a September 2006 coup and lives in exile, spoke in a 20-minute recorded speech shown on big screens for 40,000 supporters at a Bangkok stadium. "May all sides take one step back and respect the results," he said. "Please don't use any institution to intervene. Just let the country move forward. Don't make people suffer more." Parliament is voting for a new prime minister because Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin's brother-in-law, was forced to step down after a court found his Peoples Power Party guilty of fraud in the December 2007 election that brought it to power. A day after the ruling, the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy ended a blockade of Bangkok's main airports that had caused chaos for thousands of travellers. Thailand's parliament is expected to vote for a new leader on Monday, with the opposition Democrat Party the favourite to emerge at the head of a weak coalition government consisting of three partners in the previous administration. Thaksin supporters have accused the military of "launching a disguise coup" by claiming to have royal backing and pushing small parties in the previous government to form a Democrat-led government -- a charge the army has denied. The ousted leader urged his rivals to respect the 2007 poll results, which gave his now-disbanded People Power Party an election victory and the right to form a government. The court ordered the party and two others in the coalition disbanded. All three have regrouped under new names. Thaksin, the only elected prime minister to complete a full term in office, was accused of corruption and abuse of power after being re-elected to a second term. His speech was a bid to rally support for the latest incarnation of his party, now named Phuea Thai. "All the problems the country and the people have been facing have been caused by one misunderstanding, which is 'I am not loyal to the monarchy'," Thaksin said. The anti-Thaksin movement, whose campaign started in 2005 and reached its zenith in the airport siege, accuses Thaksin of trying to turn Thailand into a republic. Both the Democrats and the Thaksin camp have intensified efforts to enlist parliamentarians and Thai newspapers reported both camps were spending hundreds of millions of baht to lure them. One newspaper said the price had risen to 50 million baht ($1.4 million) per MP. The Democrats say they have picked up enough defectors from the previous government to elect their leader, Oxford-educated Abhisit Vejjajiva, as the new prime minister. The Thaksin-backed previous ruling coalition supports former national police chief Pracha Promnok, who is the leader of a small party. Thaksin, sentenced in absentia in October to two years in jail for breaching a conflict-of-interest law, remains popular in the countryside. It was not clear where the former leader, on the move since his British visa was revoked in November, recorded the speech, though a spokesman had said he might phone in from Bali
