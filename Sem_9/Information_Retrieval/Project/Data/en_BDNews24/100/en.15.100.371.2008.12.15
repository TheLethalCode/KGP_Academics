<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com) Appellate Division chamber judge Joynul Abedin Monday directed the Election Commission to validate the nomination of Shahidul Alam Talukder, a BNP candidate from Patuahkali-1. The High Court, meanwhile, summarily rejected election writ petitions of Awami League's Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir, Jatiya Party presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed, and BNP candidates from Barishal-1 Engineer Abdus Sobhan and Md. Abdul Hannan of Chandpur-4. The HC order said that Alamgir was sentenced for 10 years in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission for concealment of wealth. His writ petition was not maintainable in view of the court. The HC bench passed a similar judgment in Kazi Zafar's case. He was also convicted in an illegal wealth case. Senior Advocate Mahmudul Islam opposed the petitions. He was assisted by advocate Prabir Niogi. Prabir Niogi told bdnews24.com that after the HC rejections, the petitioners would not be able to contest the ensuing poll. "But they can file appeals in the appellate division."
