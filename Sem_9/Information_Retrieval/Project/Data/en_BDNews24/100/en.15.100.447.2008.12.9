<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Tue Dec 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top clergy began a funeral service on Tuesday, bidding farewell to Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexiy II, who revived the nation's main faith after communist atheism and healed a rift within the church. Alexiy, enthroned in 1990 a year before the demise of the Soviet Union, died of heart failure on Friday. He was 79. Clad in white-and-gold vestments, dozens of Orthodox Patriarchs and Metropolitans from Russia and abroad stood and chanted during the service, as Alexiy's coffin lay amid flowers at the centre of Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral. The Estonian-born Patriarch united the nation during the tumult of Russia's murky market reforms, widespread poverty and rampant crime of the 1990s, filling the post-Soviet moral vacuum with the values of the millenium-old faith. The deep, sonorous chants of the traditional Divine Liturgy rang out before the standing congregration of black-clad mourners and black-hooded Orthodox nuns. Tens of thousands of mourners waited in cold rain outside the magnificent gold-domed cathedral, whose reconstruction after being demolished under Soviet leader Josef Stalin was one of Alexiy's trumphs. According to his testament, Alexiy will be buried at Moscow's 18th century Epiphany Cathedral in the afternoon on Tuesday. The relics of his patron saint are stored there. Alexiy, who oversaw the construction of thousands of new churches across Russia, is widely credited with raising the prominence of Orthodoxy in Russian society. He also established close links with the Kremlin. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were expected to join the funeral service later. It was expected to last about three hours. The liturgy was conducted by Kirill, Metropolitan of Smolensk and Kaliningrad, acting as the interim head of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Holy Synod will announce on Wednesday the date for convening the Local Council, a governing body of the Russian Orthodox Church charged with electing the next Patriarch. Observers say there are four leading contenders to succeed Alexiy II, including Kirill. Key issues in choosing the new patriarch will be relations with the state and the Catholic church. Kirill is seen as a relative reformer on both points. He has been more open to the idea of building stronger ties with the Vatican, which was criticised by Alexiy for seeking converts in Russia. Kirill is also seen as a proponent of a more independent partnership with the state. During his patriarchy, Alexiy helped heal an 80-year rift with a rival faction of the church in the West which had been set up by monarchists fleeing the atheist Bolsheviks. But Alexiy's opponents say he allowed the church to become a minor partner of the Kremlin under former President Vladimir Putin. Alexiy failed to shake off allegations he had links to the Soviet KGB. The church has repeatedly denied this
