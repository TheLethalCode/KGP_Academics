 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia started a meeting with election partners Wednesday night, minutes after the government announced the dateDec 17for lifting the state of emergency. The BNP-led four-party alliance was scheduled to meet earlier in the evening as there has been "no word" from authorities about lifting emergency rule by Dec. 10. The four-party alliance leaders finally walked into the meeting shortly after 9pm, just half an hour after Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad announced he was breaking with BNP rival Awami League. The four-party alliance had given the government '48 hours' on Monday to make a clear announcement on their demand for lifting emergency and suspension of Section 91(E) of the Representation of the People Order. They said the government and the Election Commission must meet the demands for the alliance to go to the polls mandated for Dec. 29. "A final decision is expected at the meeting scheduled for this evening about future actions since the government has not yet made any announcement on lifting the emergency," BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com at midday. "'Tough actions' are under consideration in case the government does not meet our demands by Dec. 10," Mosharraf said. Abdul Latif Nezami, secretary general of Islami Oikya Jote, a four-party ally, said to bdnews24.com, "The government has not heeded our demands for lifting the emergency and suspending the section 91 (E) of the RPO." "This will slim our chances of going to the polls." Several other leaders of the alliance also echoed Mosharraf and Nezami. Khaleda is expected to reach Sylhet to visit the shrines of Shahjalal, Shah Paran and Borhanuddin on Dec 12. She will launch her election campaign at South Surma, Osmani Nagar, Dayamir, Nabiganj, Bahubal, Habiganj, Baniachang, Madhabpur, and Brahmanbaria by addressing eight public gatherings. bdnew
