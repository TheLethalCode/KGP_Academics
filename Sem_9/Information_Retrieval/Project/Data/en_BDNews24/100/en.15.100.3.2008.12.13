 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, seeking an unprecedented third term in office, rolled out the party's election manifesto on Saturday with pledges to 'save the country and the people'. She has promised to scrap the special powers act made in 1974 as she rolled out the party's election manifesto on Saturday. The act, termed 'a black law' by political and civil rights activists, is used to curb freedom of expression and suppress political opposition. Among the other election pledges are creation of a responsible and accountable political system, a focus on food security and education, and employment generation. "I promise to increase production of daily essentials and keep the prices of daily necessities affordable," she said. Development of the private sector and balance in trade, along with a national energy policy and strengthening communications networks were also among the election pledges. Khaleda also vowed, if voted to power, to ensure MPs submit wealth statements within 30 days of election. The former prime minister also mentioned anti-terrorism measures and an independent Anticorruption Commission that was "free of influence". Khaleda began her address by paying respect to the country's freedom fighters "To ensure the overall welfare and development of the nation BNP will work with the slogan - Save the country, save the people," she said. "If there is an overall progress in the economic situation of the country then employment opportunities will be created. In the past, during the reign of BNP there has been remarkable economic development in the country with an increase in job opportunities and in the future this will be a priority issue for BNP." On food security, the emphasis was on agro-subsidies, assisting farmers with purchase of seeds and fertilisers. "We will ensure that farmers are able to get the right price for commodities and that they do not have to pay excess to purchase materials," the BNP chief said. Khaleda also placed emphasis on mass education, with measures to be put in place within the first hundred days if voted in. "To make the education system functional and aimed at the people, an advisory committee will be formed within the first 100 days of being elected. Measures will be taken based on their suggestions and education for all will be ensured within 5 years." On energy security, she pledged: "To ensure the optimum usage of oil and gas by preserving the interest of the country, a national advisory committee will be formed and in accordance to its advice, a national energy policy will be made." On accountable politics, the former prime minister vowed: "To ensure good governance and to take power to the people, administration will be decentralised." Also among her party's pledges: "Malicious attempts to label Bangladesh an intolerant, extremist and radical country will be effectively prevented". The former prime minister, seeking an unprecedented third term in office, had promised to bring prices of essentials down and create new jobs the day before as she launched her election campaign in Sylhet. Khaleda began her televised manifesto address at around 4pm at the Dhaka Sheraton. She left immediately after to take part in two rallies at Mohammadpur and Banani, party leaders said. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com earlier that his party would deliver a manifesto "suitable for the present time". "We have created an election manifesto keeping in mind the most important issues of the people," he said. The party prepared its last election manifesto ahead of the scheduled Jan 22, 2007 elections but did not unveil it as the election was cancelled. bdnew
