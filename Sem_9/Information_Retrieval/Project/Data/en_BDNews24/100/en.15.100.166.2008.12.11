 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has urged the government and NGOs, women organisations and civil society to work shoulder-to-shoulder to implement programmes for promoting women's education, empowerment, security and self-reliance. The caretaker government head made the appeal while he attended Begum Rokeya Medal 2008 distribution ceremonies at Osmani Memorial Auditorium on Thursday. As Begum Rokeya Day this year fell on the Eid day, the women and children affairs ministry observed the day on Thursday and held the medal awarding ceremonies. Fakhruddin gave away the medals to Nasreen Parveen Haque (posthumous) and Dr Sultana Sarwat Ara Zaman for their contribution to women development. Nasreen Haque's daughter received the medal on her behalf. "Begum Rokeya's pioneering role in establishing and facilitating women's rights, education and future in this country a century back will continue to inspire others," the chief adviser said. "The poverty reduction strategy papers prepared based on the millennium development goals champion such crucial issues as women's education, employment, nutrition and maternal health." "The current achievements in the status of women in Bangladesh in employment, enterprise, education, administration and politics are all due to Begum Rokeya's tireless efforts in the past," continued Fakhruddin. He, however, deplored: "Yet it gives us pain when we hear about eve-teasers and molesters hunting women at their work place, educational institutions, homes and other situations." "We want to see the end of such pestering, malpractices and molestations," the CA said. bdnew
