 ATHENS, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of protestors clashed with police outside Greece's parliament on Tuesday and socialist opposition leader George Papandreou called for elections to end four days of riots. Ranks of police, forming a cordon outside parliament, stood their ground when a crowd, many throwing stones, tried to break through to march on the legislature. The protesters, mainly students, regrouped repeatedly to advance on the police line, wearing handkerchiefs against the teargas. The action began hours before the funeral of a 15-year-old youth, whose killing by a policeman on Saturday triggered Greece's worst riots in decades. Hundreds of buildings have been wrecked or burned and more than 50 people injured. "The only thing this government can offer is to resign and turn to the people for its verdict," Papandreou told a party meeting inside parliament. "We claim power." The shooting touched a raw nerve among young Greeks, many of whom have poor economic prospects. Unemployment, already over seven percent, is rising and economic growth is expected to fall below two percent next year, after averaging about four percent over the past decade. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis met political leaders including Papandreou on Tuesday to urge them to unite against the riots and warned the protesters threatening to unseat his government they could expect no leniency. "No one has the right to use this tragic incident as an excuse for acts of violence," he said. Violence resumed on Tuesday in the northern city of Thessaloniki and in Ioannina, and Greek demonstrators occupied the country's consulate in Paris. Police expected more violence in Athens later on Tuesday after the funeral of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, whose shooting ignited anger over corruption scandals, a widening gap between rich and poor, and economic problems. Protests have swept more than 10 cities across the European Union member state of 11 million people, including Thessaloniki in the north and the tourist islands of Crete and Corfu. POLICEMAN CHARGED One policeman has been charged with murder over Grigoropoulos's shooting. Police said the officer fired three warning shots after their car was attacked by 30 youths on Saturday but witnesses said he took aim. Violence at student rallies and fire bomb attacks by anarchist groups in Greece are common. Greek media criticized the handling of the riots by the government, which has a tenuous one-seat majority in parliament. "Flames Rage As The Government Looks On," the daily newspaper Kathimerini said. Youths set fire to a large Christmas tree in central Athens on Monday night. More than 130 shops have been destroyed in the capital, dashing retailers' hopes that Christmas would compensate for Greece's darkening economic outlook.
