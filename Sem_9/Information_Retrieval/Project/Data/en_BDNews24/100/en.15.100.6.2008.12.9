 MASISI, Congo, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While peace talks in Kenya try to end the war in eastern Congo, hunger and disease spawned by the conflict are killing the young and weak in a daily harvest of death. "Rukundo, parents unknown, female, 5 years old, unknown illness. Dusingamana, parents unknown, female, 9 years old, diarrhea. Uwahiszemo, parents unknown, male, 17 months old, unknown illness." The list of dead at the Kilimani refugee camp at Masisi in Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province reveals the still swelling toll from a conflict-driven humanitarian crisis thought to have killed more than 5 million people in a decade. After weeks of confused fighting that displaced more than a quarter of a million people, government envoys are meeting Congolese Tutsi rebels in Nairobi to try to end festering political and ethnic enmity in the eastern borderlands. The violent, volatile region has seen a string of failed peace initiatives, and despite a relative lull in major battles following a rebel-declared ceasefire, the humanitarian emergency shows little sign of easing. Josephine Foraha fled to Kilimani in May last year when rebels loyal to renegade Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda swept through her village. She, her husband and nine children remained in the camp after a January 2008 peace accord failed to end clashes between the rebels, army and pro-government militias. They have paid a heavy price for staying. "My husband was the first to die," Foraha said, an infant tied to her back as she squatted in a cramped shelter made from banana leaves that is home to eight family members. "His heart was broken. He wouldn't eat. The first of my children died in September, the second in October," she added. On the hillsides overlooking Masisi, three rival militias and rebel groups as well as the national army have bases. They include Rwandan Hutu rebels, some of whom participated in Rwanda's 1994 genocide of Tutsis. They patrol unchallenged. The feuding groups dispute control of the muddy mountainous track, plagued by landslides, which is the supply route into the local hospital run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres. Marauding fighters often loot local health centers and disrupt attempts to resupply them. "People here are taking a chance every time they get on the road," said Emma Zoratti, head of the MSF team in Masisi.
