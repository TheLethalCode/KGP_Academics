"Both the leaders have agreed in principle to attend the two-day conference, scheduled for any two days between Dec. 20 and 25," the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry president Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com on Friday. "We'll place a set of recommendations to the leaders to ensure the economic development of the country." One of the two leaders, Hasina, the Awami League president, and Khaleda, the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who head two main electoral alliances, will lead the incoming elected government after the general election slated for Dec. 29. Asked whether the two leaders will sit together, Huq said, "The conference will be of two days so that the two leader can come in separate days." He said, "We've already proposed to Sheikh Hasina and she agreed in principle." "Talking to a number of BNP senior leaders, we've come to know that Khaleda Zia also has agreed in principle to attend the conference. Moreover, we'll meet and request her to attend the conference."
