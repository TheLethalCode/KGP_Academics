<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has finally published a list of 1,538 valid candidates in 299 constituencies for the 9th parliamentary election slated for Dec 29. "The list may be increased by two or three candidates who appealed to the High Court against cancellation of their nominations after hearings held by EC," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Sunday. "If the court ruled for their candidacies, their names may appear in the list," the CEC told reporters, as he officially made the list public at his office. The final list has 259 candidates of Awami League, 254 of BNP, 46 of Jatiya Party (Ershad), 39 of Jamaat-e-Islami and 141 independent candidates. As many as 2,453 had filed nominations by the Nov 30 deadline, for 300 constituencies. Election in Noakhali-1 has been deferred after the death of prospective candidate Gonotantree Pary president Nurul Islam. Some 14 nominations were filed in the constituency. The total number of valid nominations had stood at 1,572 after final cancellation of 442 and withdrawal of 425 candidacies. But the final number came down to 1,538 after dual candidacies were ruled out as parties and alliances allotted electoral symbols. Questioned with regard to more than one candidate per seat under the BNP-led and AL-led alliances, the CEC said, "It is a matter for the two alliances, not the EC or Returning Officers." "We think the two alliances have reached understandings with their respective allies on the issue." "The Returning Officers have performed their duty as per laws." Asked about ballot papers, Huda said, "Printing of ballot papers has already begun." "Printing of ballot papers for 25 constituencies is expected to be complete by the end of the day (Sunday). And the rest by turns." The last election saw 1,939 candidates, while 1,087 contested in the country's first ever parliamentary election. bdnew
