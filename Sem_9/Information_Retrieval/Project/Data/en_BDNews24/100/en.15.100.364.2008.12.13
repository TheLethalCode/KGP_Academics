 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, seeking an unprecedented third term in office, rolled out the party's 36-point election manifesto on Saturday with pledges to ensure food, power and energy security, and a functioning parliament. She also promised to scrap the 1974 special powers act, termed 'a black law' by political and civil rights activists, and used to curb freedom of expression and suppress political opposition. Along with a focus on education and employment generation, development of the private sector and balance in trade, a national energy policy and strengthening communications networks were also among the election pledges. Khaleda also vowed, if voted to power, to ensure MPs submit wealth statements within 30 days of election. The former prime minister also mentioned anti-terrorism measures and an independent Anticorruption Commission that was "free of influence". Khaleda began her address by paying respect to the country's freedom fighters "To ensure the overall welfare and development of the nation BNP will work with the slogan - Save the country, save the people," she said. "If there is an overall progress in the economic situation of the country then employment opportunities will be created. In the past, during the reign of BNP there has been remarkable economic development in the country with an increase in job opportunities and in the future this will be a priority issue for BNP." On food security, the emphasis was on agro-subsidies, assisting farmers with purchase of seeds and fertilisers. "We will ensure that farmers are able to get the right price for commodities and that they do not have to pay excess to purchase materials," the BNP chief said. "I promise to increase production of daily essentials and keep the prices of daily necessities affordable," she said. On energy security, she pledged: "To ensure the optimum usage of oil and gas by preserving the interest of the country, a national advisory committee will be formed and in accordance to its advice, a national energy policy will be made." BNP has also promised that the party will be working from the very beginning to meet the deficit by implementing a transparent and effective plan for an increased power production and supply. On accountable politics, the former prime minister vowed: "To ensure good governance and to take power to the people, administration will be decentralised." She promised to make the parliament a meaningful and effective institution, through three key steps. "Whoever is elected speaker or deputy speaker will have to resign his party position and sever all kinds of relationship with the party." "A deputy speaker will be chosen from the opposition in the parliament." "All the elected members will have equal facilities given by the government and there will be no disparity in government fund allocations for the electoral constituencies," the BNP chief vowed. Khaleda also placed emphasis on mass education, with measures to be put in place within the first hundred days if voted in. "To make the education system functional and pro-people, an advisory committee will be formed within the first 100 days of being elected. Measures will be taken based on their suggestions and education for all will be ensured within 5 years." On foreign policy, BNP vows to maintain "the ideals of the Constitution and Liberation War". "Friendship to all malice to none will be obeyed in Bangladesh's foreign policy," Khaleda said. With a view to improving and developing economy, intimate relations with neighbouring countries will be kept up on the basis of mutual honour and esteem, fraternity with Muslim countries, diplomatic ties and regional cooperation, she added. And: "All evil efforts to mark non-communal, liberal, tolerant, and peaceful Bangladesh as a fundamentalist, arrogant, and violent country, will be resisted in a effective way." The former prime minister had promised to bring prices of essentials down and create new jobs the day before as she launched her election campaign in Sylhet. Khaleda began her televised manifesto address at around 4pm at the Dhaka Sheraton. She left immediately after to take part in two rallies at Mohammadpur and Banani, party leaders said. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com earlier that his party would deliver a manifesto "suitable for the present time". "We have created an election manifesto keeping in mind the most important issues of the people," he said. The party prepared its last election manifesto ahead of the scheduled Jan 22, 2007 elections but did not unveil it as the election was cancelled. bdnew
