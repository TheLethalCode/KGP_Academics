 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has said her party, if elected to office, will have no laws that go against the Quran or Sunnah. She made the declaration at an election rally of Jahangir Kabir Nanak, the grand-alliance candidate for Dhaka-13 constituency. Addressing a large section of the electorate who are non-Bengalees, she said, "Those who were born in this country are the citizens of this country and if they accept Bangladesh as their own country then they will be assured of employment and all other facilities." At the campaign rally at Karwan Bazar for Asaduzzaman Khan, the AL candidate for Dhaka-11 seat, held, Hasina pledged to turn Dhaka into a modern city if her party won the Dec. 29 election. She promised measures to check pollution, develop an improved communication system, and construct monorails, underground rails and flyovers. Education for all will be ensured and power production and water supply woes will be settled as per the manifesto, she added. "If the Awami League is elected through people's vote then corruption and terrorism will be removed from society." Introducing Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal as a freedom fighter, she said, "People like him fought in the war and gave us independence and, hopefully, he will also bring us victory in the upcoming polls." Hasina presented comparative pictures of the price of essentials between the times of the AL and BNP-led governments and asked the people to vote for boat, the party's polls logo. "Those who have robbed the people of their freedom do not have the right to come to power." It was now clear who had inserted false voters into the electoral roll to come to power, she added. "During the time of that government the people suffered a lot." She said being the daughter of the 'father of the nation' independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, "I have fought for establishing your rights and I will continue to do so." "If necessary, I will give my own blood as did my father." Introducing Mostafa Jalal Mohiduddin for Dhaka-7 seat, she said, "I am giving you an educated and courteous person who is like my own son." After Kawran Bazar, Hasina went to Hazaribagh Park field and campaigned for Fazle Noor Tapash, AL candidate for Dhaka-12 constituency. Hasina is supposed to address rallies at Mohammadpur, Mirpur, Pallabi, Kafrul and Uttara on behalf of AL candidates. bdnews24.
