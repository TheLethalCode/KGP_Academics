<TITLE> BNP's manifesto 'donor-dependent' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)BNP's donor-dependent manifesto does not spell out where money will come from if the lending agencies do not cough up the expected funds, says Dr Akbar Ali Khan, chairman of the Regulatory Reforms Commission. Comparing the economic points of the BNP and Awami League manifestos, Akbar Ali said to bdnews24.com on Saturday, "There is little difference in the election pledges of the two parties. If one goes through them, they almost look the same." "There is, however, a difference in one key area  financing. Awami League's manifesto did not mention the source of funds," the former caretaker government adviser pointed out. The BNP manifesto, on the other hand, eyes funding from World Bank, ADB, and other donor agencies. "But there is no direction in the BNP manifesto on what would happen if donor funds are not made available," said Akbar Ali. "And nothing has been mentioned about internal funds that may be realised by overcoming corruption and implementing good governance.'' AL president Sheikh Hasina unveiled her party's manifesto on Friday, with both parties focusing on the cost of essentials. Akbar Ali stressed again: "On economic issues, there is hardly any difference between the Awami League and the BNP. The big differences lie in their political stances." "They announced their political manifestos from their own points of view in the hope of votes and that is natural," said the RRC boss. "But the big question is how much of the manifestos dealing with the economy can be implemented by them in case any party goes to power?" The former adviser pointed out that previous experiences were "not comfortable at all." "These two parties have made many promises before with elections before them. But both parties utterly failed in fulfilling those promises to the people." Like most people, said Akbar Ali, he hoped for better this time. bdnews
