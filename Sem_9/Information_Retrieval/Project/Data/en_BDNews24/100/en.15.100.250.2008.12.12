<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain on Friday said neither Awami League nor the BNP has political ideology as such. "They have nominated corruption suspects only for going to power at any cost," he said at a campaign rally of Gano Forum candidate retired major Amin Ahmed in Gazipur district. He called on the people to think beyond the "two symbols", indicating the AL and the BNP's electoral logos, and elect honest candidates. "Even after 37 years of liberation, the real victory is yet to be gained. We are yet to get economic freedom though we've got an independent and sovereign state," Dr Kamal observed. bdnews24
