 HARARE, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Thursday his government had stopped a cholera outbreak that has killed nearly 800 people and prompted Western leaders to call on him to step down. Mugabe's announcement came several hours after South African officials declared the border with Zimbabwe a disaster area and warned that extraordinary measures were needed to control the rising number of cholera cases. "I am happy we are being assisted by others and we have arrested cholera," Mugabe said in a televised speech in which he also attacked what he described as Western plans to invade Zimbabwe and topple his government. "Now that there is no cholera there is no case for war." The World Health Organization reported on Wednesday that the cholera crisis in Zimbabwe had worsened. It said 774 people had died from the easily preventable disease and 15,000 were believed to be infected. The collapse of Zimbabwe's economy and health care system has left victims to fend for themselves and driven many to try to escape to South Africa. "The whole of the Vhembe district has been declared a disaster," Mogale Nchabeleng, a spokesman for South Africa's Limpopo provincial government, told Reuters. The government took the decision after an emergency meeting earlier this week. South Africa has said it has no plans to quarantine Zimbabweans crossing over to Musina or other border towns. The outbreak, coupled with an economic meltdown, has prompted calls for international humanitarian assistance as well as calls for Mugabe's resignation from Western leaders and some within Africa.
