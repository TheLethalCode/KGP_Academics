 BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO said on Tuesday militants could not seriously disrupt its supply routes to Afghanistan, despite a weekend attack on a Western supply convoy in Pakistan that destroyed close to 100 military vehicles. "They should be under no illusion that they can seriously disrupt the lines of communication for NATO because we have alternatives," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told a news briefing. Pakistani militants attacked a parked convoy of trucks carrying military vehicles for Western forces in Afghanistan near the northwestern town of Peshawar early on Sunday, destroying 96 trucks, police said. NATO and U.S. officials have been pursuing alternative supply routes that would make Western forces in Afghanistan less dependent on the overland route via Pakistan. NATO already transports supplies across Russia using an air bridge and in April signed a deal allowing it to use Russian land transit of non-lethal supplies. However talks are still going on with Afghanistan's neighbours Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for the goods to reach the Afghan border.
