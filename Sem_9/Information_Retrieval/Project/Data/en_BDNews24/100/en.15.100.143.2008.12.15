 MILAN, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti refused to rule his side out of the Serie A title race after a 4-2 defeat at Juventus on Sunday.

"From a defensive point of view, we gave them too much. We started the game really well. We've had a lot of injuries and been without some important players." Brazilian-born striker Amauri, signed for 22.8 million euros ($30.3 million) from Palermo in the close season having played for Chievo among others, grabbed two of Juve's goals. Juve coach Claudio Ranieri was thrilled with the 28-year-old, who is waiting for an Italian passport and may make himself available for Italy boss Marcello Lippi having never been called up by Brazil.
