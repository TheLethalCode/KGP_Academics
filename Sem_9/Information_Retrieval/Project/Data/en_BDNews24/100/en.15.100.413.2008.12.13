 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan launched his election campaign on Saturday with duck symbol as an independent candidate from Narshingdhi-3. He held electoral rallies at different places at Bagab union under Shibpur upazila. "I have got into the election battle to represent you. I seek your blessings," the expelled BNP leader said in his campaign address. "I am nonpartisan now and the people of Shibpur-Raipura are my party," he said. The former minister said, "The parliament is the centre of all activities and the election this time is significantly different from the previous ones." "Every single vote is valuable. We have to choose the right representative for restoring democracy and an effective parliament," Mannan said. Wooing their support he said: "I was with you throughout my life. You are the partners of all of my success. I seek your blessings so that I can continue to stay beside you and to serve you the best way I can." Mannan Bhuiyan was elected MP four times from Narshingdhi. He had been BNP secretary general for 11 years. Chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled him from the party on Sept 3 as he proposed a number of democratic reforms in the party. bdnews24.
