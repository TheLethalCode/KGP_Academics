 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com - Banks should come forward to ensure that remittance from overseas is used in productive sectors, finance adviser AM Mirza Aziz Islam said Monday as he opened the first NRB bank branch, being operated by the state-owned Janata Bank. "The money sent by expatriate communities should not be used just for excess affluence in living," said Mirza Aziz. "It should be used for productive sectors like agriculture, small and medium-scale industries." "In the last few years we have seen a dramatic increase in the flow of remittance with a positive impact on the economy," the adviser observed. Remittance has a higher contribution to economy than export earnings, he added. "The main income from export comes from the garment sector, but a lot of foreign currency goes out again as raw materials for the garment industry have to be imported." The adviser said remittance should be used to cut poverty and if just a portion was invested in agriculture, agro-based industry and the SME sector, GDP and employment would rise. "The banks should come forward to ensure that remittance from overseas is used in these productive sectors." Asking bankers to consider loans without collateral to workers going abroad, the adviser said: "Many sell their possessions to afford their passage abroad; but these people are making an impact on the economy." The banks could give legal overseas workers loans without collateral and at low rates, he suggested. "Eligibility for getting the loan will be confirmed by character, certificate and through an idea of how much money that person can earn while working abroad." Monday's programme launched the first NRB bank in the country, with an office on the third floor of Janata Bank's Motijheel office. Several such branches will be opened in future, said Janata Bank managing director S M Aminur Rahman. bdnews
