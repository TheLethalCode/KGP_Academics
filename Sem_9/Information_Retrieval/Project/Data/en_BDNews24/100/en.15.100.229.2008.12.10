 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Railway officials of Bangladesh and India will sit in New Delhi possibly on December 22 to cut the travel time and change the schedules of the Dhaka-Kolkata direct passenger trains, top railway officials have said. According to Dhaka's proposal, the trains need to reduce travel time by two hours to woo passengers. "Possibly the three-day inter-governmental railway meeting would start on December 22 in New Delhi," Qazi Asadullah, Bangladesh Railway's additional director general (operations), said to bdnews24.com. He said New Delhi provisionally has agreed to take two hours off travel time if the Kolkata-bound train could reach Kolkata's Chipur Station by 5.00pm Indian time. "If we want to reach Kolkata by 5.00pm, we will have to start the train at 6:00 am instead of the present 8:30am," said Asadullah. Md Belayet Hossain, Bangladesh Railway's director general, said the schedule of the train must be changed to make it convenient for passengers. "We will propose operating a train from Dhaka on Saturday which will return from Kolkata on Sunday," Hossain said. He said Dhaka would also propose that the train leaves for Dhaka on Tuesday and travel back to Kolkata on Wednesday. "At present, a passenger must spend seven days in Dhaka or Kolkata if they travel by train. Because, the train runs on Saturday and Sunday every week," Hossain said. As per the schedule, one train leaves for Kolkata Saturday and returns on Sunday. Similarly, one train leaves for Dhaka from Kolkata on Saturday and returns on Sunday. "If the Indian side agrees, the new time schedule would come into effect from January," said Hossain. The Maitree Express, which was hurriedly launched on April 14 this year, took at least 12 hours to travel between Dhaka and the capital of India's West Bengal state. Of the 12 hours, five hours are spent on completing the customs and immigration formalities in the bordering stations in Darshana in Bangladesh and Gede in India. Both sides, however, have agreed to cut the time for customs and immigration formalities to three hours. The time-consuming customs and immigration formalities, and inconvenient train schedules force passengers to turn to buses. According to railway figures, on average 100 passengers travel by the 517-seat Maitree Express. bd
