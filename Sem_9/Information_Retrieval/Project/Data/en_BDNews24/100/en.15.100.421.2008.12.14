<TITLE> OPEC's Khelil, a pragmatic leader in testing times </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - OPEC President Chakib Khelil is a skilled communicator and oil industry professional who will oversee efforts to bolster sagging prices and to restore the group's clout at a critical meeting on Wednesday in Algeria. During his year as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries public face, Khelil has sought to steer the group's 12 members as they tried to slow a record rally and then struggled to break a record price crash. With almost a decade of experience in OPEC policy and 19 years as a World Bank energy specialist, the 69-year-old Algerian fluent in five languages has been rarely lost for words. As oil slid from a record of nearly $150 a barrel to just above $40, he said he thought an ideal price would be between $70 and $90 -- a price range now widely accepted in the group. "Normally OPEC has no price target," Khelil said. "But people say the bottom price, the bottom cost below which we cannot step down, is between $70 and $90 a barrel." While Khelil's approach to policy has been pragmatic, his role as a politician from non-aligned Algeria has given him a degree of empathy with OPEC members such as Venezuela and Iran, who have a great need for high prices. They have said they can live for a while on their profits. But analysts have said they need oil of nearly $100 a barrel if they are to finance big popular spending plans and they have been at the forefront of calls to lower the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output ceiling. Although this year's average for benchmark US crude is still above a $100, the outlook for 2009 when many predict fuel demand will contract further looks much weaker. Given the conflicting agendas of various OPEC members, analysts said Khelil has held his nerve. "Khelil has managed the situation as well as anyone could, particularly with Iran and Venezuela as members," said John Hall of John Hall Associates, an analyst who regularly attends OPEC meetings. Equally, he has been undaunted by international criticism. In March when OPEC was condemned for keeping output steady even though oil was hitting what were then all-time highs above $100, Khelil blamed the price strength on speculators and on the United States, where he previously worked and was educated. "What's happening in the oil market is due to the mismanagement of the US economy, which is probably affecting the rest of the world," he said. OPEN FOR BUSINESS At home, Algeria's own price needs are considerable. Independent analysts estimate it could require a minimum of about $75 to $80 a barrel to fund its $80 billion 2009 budget without having to raid reserves, borrow or raise taxes. Since taking office in 1999, Khelil has raced to make up for years of under-investment in oil and gas, promoting a policy of openness and competitiveness in international investment. Algerian governments traditionally had to use oil and gas revenues to meet pressing social needs, tending to starve state energy giant Sonatrach of investment resources. But the price rally gave it more independence and provided Khelil with the scope to embark on a huge modernization and liberalization of the energy sector. "He set out to reform the sector, make the national oil company run efficiently, and basically make the hydrocarbons sector a transparently managed, competitive, open and highly performing sector," said Valerie Marcel, an energy specialist and an associate fellow of British think-tank Chatham House. Khelil studied for a doctorate in petroleum engineering in Texas and worked for foreign companies including Shell and Phillips Petroleum. He also worked at the World Bank in Washington from 1980 until he took early retirement in 1999 to return to Algeria and become an adviser to President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and energy and mines minister. Khelil's liberalization succeeded in part, but met with resistance from within the industry, from public opinion and eventually from those influencing Bouteflika, analysts said. A sustained oil price rally that began in 2002 unleashed a wave of resource nationalism, or resource-holders seeking to maximize their profits. Against that trend, Algeria back-tracked on the 2005 hydrocarbons law, spearheaded by Khelil, which had sought to establish Sonatrach as a commercial company much like any other. Amendments in 2006 diluted the reforms and introduced a windfall tax on the profits of foreign operators in Algeria. "The World Bank liberalizer has become a pragmatic Algerian politician, as well as an OPEC President whose articulate way of presenting OPEC policy is admired internationally," said Jon Marks, editor of African Energy magazine. "He has had to navigate some difficult political waters and he has done it with some aplomb." Questioned by foreign journalists, Khelil chose his words carefully, saying Algeria had decided it could be best to leave a store of its reserves in the ground for future generations. If he was disappointed his reforms had faltered, he hid it well
