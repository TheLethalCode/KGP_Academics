 Sylhet, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) Awami League president Sheikh Hasina during her visit to Sylhet Thursday called on local leaders to work together to secure wins to their 19 constituencies in the upcoming general election. As in the past, the former prime minister paid her respects to the shrines of Shah Jalal, Shah Paran and Shah Borhan Uddin in the country's 'spiritual capital', prior to launching her election campaign. She was accompanied on the trip by AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta. After visiting the shrines, she rested for a while at Sylhet Circuit House. The AL president later had a meeting with party workers and leaders at the Circuit House. General secretary of AL's Sylhet city unit Misbah Uddin Siraj said Hasina gave directions to the local AL leaders on preparing for the election. AL advisory council members Dewan Farid Gazi and Abul Maal Abdul Muhit, education affairs secretary Nurul Islam Nahid, former whip Abdus Shahid, Sylhet mayor Badar Uddin Ahmad Kamran, district unit AL president ANM Shafiqul Haq were present among a host of leaders, workers and supporters. Extensive security measures were taken in the city on the occasion of the AL leader's visit there. She reached the shrine of Shah Jalal at 12:30pm. The road leading to the shrine was kept free for smooth movement of Hasina. The townspeople stood by the roads and waved greetings at her enthusiastically. Leaving Sudha Sadan, her Dhanmandi residence at 7:50am, Hasina's motorcade had to break speed at Itakhola, Baroicha, Sarail intersection and Madhabpur Bazar, on its way to Sylhet, as enthusiasts and local AL leaders and workers greeted her. Seated in her car, Hasina was seen waving to the people thronging the flanks of Dhaka-Sylhet motorway in a continuous line, hoisting multicoloured placards and festoons.
