 Sumon Mahmud Chief Political Correspondent Sylhet, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia hit the campaign trail on Friday after offering prayers at the shrines of Shah Jalal, Shah Paran and Shah Borhan Uddin in the city. She arrived in northeastern city shortly after noon to launch her election campaign, as in the past, after the now-customary visits to the shrines. She reached the Sylhet Circuit House at around 12:15pm. Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former lawmaker M Ilias Ali, Shafi Ahmed Chowhdury, Dildar Hossain Selim and other BNP leaders welcomed Khaleda at the circuit house. Khaleda was cheered on by thousands of BNP leaders and supporters who lined the roads she took. Khaleda's motorcade started for Sylhet, the country's 'spiritual capital', from her Dhaka Cantonment residence around 8:35am, accompanied by her vice-president Sarwari Rahman and others. Khaleda had also started her campaign in the previous election years from the city. Seated in her car, Khaleda waved hands to the cheering supporters at Ittefaq intersection, Sayedabad, Jatrabari, Demra, Matuail, Kanchpur Bridge, Sonargaon, Narsingdi, Bhairab, Brahminbaria, Habiganj, Moulavibazar, Goalabazar and other places. "She will speak at eight public rallies on Friday, the first day of her campaign, after paying respects at the three shrines," said Maruf Kamal Khan, chief of Khaleda's information cell. The former prime minister is scheduled to address rallies at South Surma College, Doyamir field in Osmani Nagar, Aushkandi High School in Nabiganj, Mirpur Ali Sobhan College at Bahubal, Habiganj Municipality field, Madhabpur Pilot High School and Brahmanbaria College.
