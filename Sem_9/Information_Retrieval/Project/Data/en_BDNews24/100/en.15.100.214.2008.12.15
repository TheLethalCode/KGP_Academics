 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League and BNP, who lead the two rival electoral alliances, have hinted in the negative over pledges made by respective allies Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami to enact blasphemy laws if voted to power. "The parties under the grand alliance have announced their manifestos separately on their own political ideology," AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Sunday night. The pre-election issue has given rise to a flurry of public debate, while observers were careful to note whether the major two parties made any mention of the same in their own manifestos. Motia pointed out, however: "Not all the promises made by the respective grand alliance parties will have to be realised if voted to power." She cited an example from neighbouring India: "You've seen the alliance between Joy Lolita and the CPM in India, but the CPM did not comply with all the demands of Lolita." BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain made comments in a similar vein. "You must have seen that the issue of a blasphemy law is not in our manifesto, neither was it contained in our previous manifestos." Refusing to give any "elaborate explanation" to this end, however, Khandker Mosharraf concluded: "This is a policy-level issue. It's better if you please ask the secretary general." Jamaat's manifesto says the party will formulate blasphemy laws preventing and punishing those responsible for hurting religion sentiment through books, newspapers, magazines or electronic media. While rolling out the party's plsedges on Dec. 11, Jamaat amir Motiur Rahman Nizami was asked about the necessity of such law. He answered somewhat cryptically: "Due to the absence of such law, Daud Haider and Taslima Nasreen have been being forced to live outside the country." JP's manifesto unveiled on the same date also pledged the introduction of laws to punish those who hurt religious sentiment. bdnews24.c
