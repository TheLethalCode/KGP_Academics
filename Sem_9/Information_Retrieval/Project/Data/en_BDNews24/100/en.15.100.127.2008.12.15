<TITLE> US faces increasing challenge training Iraqi forces </TITLE>

 BAGHDAD,Mon Dec 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) -As the United States draws down in Iraq, its troops face the challenge of turning unseasoned Iraqi soldiers and police into a force capable of fending off threats to an emerging calm, a senior US official said. "Last year, we needed a basic policeman. This year, we need an investigator; we need a forensics specialist," Lieutenant General Frank Helmick, head of US military efforts to train Iraqi police and soldiers, said in an interview. As horrific sectarian violence raged in 2006 and 2007, the United States struggled to churn out Iraqi police and soldiers with minimum skills -- desperate to simply get men in uniforms out onto Iraq's bloody and chaotic streets. Now, with the Iraqi military and police force over 600,000 strong, US officials expect to shift from teaching recruits basic skills, like handling weapons or breaking down doors, to sophisticated tasks like evidence collection. They will also focus on helping the US-backed government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki draft long-term plans to clamp down on violence and excise a stubborn insurgency, they say. "Last year's stuff was easy. It's easy to crank out a guy," said Helmick, who heads the U.S. and NATO force dedicated to advising Iraqi security ministries and supervising training of Iraqi police, Army, and its nascent Navy and Air Force. "Now you've got to have a guy with technical skills. They have to understand the rule of law which is kind of foreign to them. It's much more complex," he said. The abilities of Iraqi security forces, dismantled in the aftermath of the 2003 US-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein, is a pressing question as the United States reduces its combat role in Iraq and prepares to withdraw by end-2011. A new US-Iraqi security pact taking effect on Jan. 1 will require US operations to be approved by a bilateral committee. By June 2009, US soldiers remaining in Iraqi cities are supposed to be restricted to a training and support role. Under US President-elect Barack Obama's campaign plan, US combat troops may pull out by mid-2010. Obama has, however, acknowledged the possibility of a longer presence. ONGOING VIOLENCE Since June 2007, the Iraqi military has grown by 91,000 to around 230,000, according to US figures. The police force grew by 74,000 in the same period to around 380,000. While violence in Iraq has dropped sharply, the toll of bombs, shooting and other attacks marches on. Just last week, 50 people were killed in a suicide bombing near Kirkuk. Some fear bloodshed could erupt anew ahead of provincial elections next month or if Iraq's minority Kurds cannot settle deep-rooted differences with majority Arabs. Officials in Maliki's government paint a mixed picture of the readiness of Iraqi forces. On one hand, they are quick to point out the strides local forces have made in a few years. But they also speak about the need for modern weapons and long-term support to help confront the insurgency. Defence Ministry spokesman Mohammed al-Askari said US help was needed primarily for air support and logistics. "The question to be asked is why do we need US forces? The answer is to reach first-level readiness," he said. "First-level readiness means self-reliance in everything." He said Iraqi forces proved themselves battling Shia militants in southern Iraq this spring. US officials, though, describe Iraq's logistical capacity as less robust. Both US and Iraqi officials downplay the changes that may take place on Jan. 1. Askari said Iraqi troops, for the most part, were already in a "lead" role
