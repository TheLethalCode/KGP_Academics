<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, Dec 14 (Reuters) - A stunning fifty by Virender Sehwag set up India's confident chase of 387 in the first test after twin hundreds enabled England put up a challenging target on Sunday. The aggressive opener hit 83 off just 68 balls to give India an explosive start that left England breathless after fine centuries by Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood had put the tourists in command. At stumps on day four, India were strongly placed at 131 for one with opener Gautam Gambhir on a gritty 41 along with Rahul Dravid (2). They still need 256 for victory with a full day remaining. Sehwag, who lashed 11 fours and four sixes for his 18th test fifty, raised 117 for the first wicket with Gambhir, before falling lbw to debutant off-spinner Graeme Swann shortly before the close to give England hopes of regaining ascendancy. England declared their second innings closed at 311 for nine shortly after tea. Opener Strauss, who hit 123 in the first innings, and Collingwood struck 108 each, taking their overnight fourth-wicket stand to 214 as the tourists batted themselves into a commanding position. Sehwag, one of fiercest strikers of a cricket ball in contemporary cricket, tore into fast bowler Steve Harmison and left-arm spinner Monty Panesar as he raced to 50 off just 32 balls with eight fours and two sixes. On 26, he gave a difficult chance to Alaistair Cook at gully when he slashed at Harmison. Harmison was taken off the attack after he went for 33 in four overs and only the explosive pacer Andrew Flintoff looked like making a dent. Sehwag's swashbuckling display, in which he hit two sixes off Panesar and a sensational uppercut over the third man ropes off Harmison, opened up the match for India. Left-handed Strauss became only the second England batsman to score a century in each innings of a test against India, but the tourists had dropped the scoring rate considerably in the second session. The Middlesex batsman reached his 14th test century with a single to mid-on off medium-pacer Zaheer Khan to match Graham Gooch's feat against India at Lord's in 1990. DOMINATED ATTACK Strauss also became only the 10th England batsman to score a century in each innings of a test. The overnight pair dominated the Indian attack after England resumed at 172 for three, raising another 85 runs before Strauss fell in the sixth over after lunch. The left-hander, 73 overnight, pushed tentatively at off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to lob a catch to Vangipurappu Laxman at short cover, triggering a minor collapse as Zaheer later grabbed three quick wickets. Strauss punched off-spinner Harbhajan for four past point to bring up England's 200 and Collingwood, 60 overnight, hit leg-spinner Amit Mishra to the fence with a lofted on-drive. Strauss hit eight fours in his masterful 244-ball effort spanning over six hours after a poor series against South Africa in July and August. Fast bowler Ishant Sharma forced Flintoff to edge behind for four and Zaheer then dismissed Collingwood leg before. Collingwood hit nine fours in his 250-ball effort for his seventh test hundred. Zaheer sent back Swann (7) first and Harmison (1) as the tourists lost six wickets for the addition of 54 runs. They resumed their aborted tour after tight security was promised for the two tests in the wake of last month's attacks in Mumbai that killed 179 people
