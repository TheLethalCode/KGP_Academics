 TOKYO, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico's Pachuca fought back from two goals down to stun Egyptian side Al Ahly 4-2 after extra time at the Club World Cup on Saturday. Argentine forward Christian Gimenez scored twice in a remarkable turnaround after Pachuca had trailed 2-0 at halftime as the Mexicans set up a semi-final with Ecuador's LDU. Pachuca meet South American champions LDU on Wednesday, 24 hours before tournament favourites Manchester United begin their quest to be crowned the world's best club side. "We didn't deserve to be two goals behind," Pachuca coach Enrique Meza told reporters. "We were better than Al Ahly in the first half and controlled the entire game. "We kept attacking. It's the only way we know how to play. The better team won. It's a very simple logic. Bring on LDU. They are a great team but we don't fear anyone." Meza's side, who left the pitch in tears after losing to Tunisia's Etoile Sahel last year, finished the match to a chorus of "Oles!" from the crowd of 30,000 in Tokyo. Ahly had gone ahead through a Fausto Pinto own goal in the 28th minute and Angolan striker Flavio doubled their lead with a breakaway effort on the stroke of halftime. Substitute Luis Montes pulled one back for Pachuca two minutes after the break before Gimenez curled in a sweet free kick from 20 metres to equalise in the 73rd minute. Striker Damian Alvarez gave Pachuca the lead eight minutes into extra time with a sharp finish and Gimenez smashed home his side's fourth to seal victory. "We panicked," fumed Ahly's Portuguese coach Manuel Jose. "Clearly the players couldn't handle the pressure. We were 2-0 up at halftime and lost 4-2. "No excusesit was mental weakness.
