<TITLE> Fearing backlash, industry urges nanotech safety </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHICAGO Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Fearing the emerging new field of nanotechnology will engender fears like those surrounding genetically modified foods in Europe, companies are pushing government agencies for a more coordinated effort to ensure the tiny nanomaterials are safe and environmentally friendly. "What we find is that as this technology becomes more popular there are lots of questions in the minds of consumers and consumer advocates about just how safe these materials are," Raymond David, North American manager of toxicology for German chemicals group BASF, said in a telephone interview. BASF, which already makes sunscreens, construction chemicals and polymers that incorporate nanotechnology, has joined DuPont, the American Chemical Council and other industry groups in support of a newly released National Research Council report calling for improvements in the nation's efforts to ensure the safety of nanotech research. David said it is imperative the United States works hard to ensure the safety of new materials developed through nanotechnology, which involves the manipulation of materials thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. "It puts a bit of fear in all of us that all of this effort will not be well received or may go the route of genetically modified foods in Europe. We certainly wouldn't want that." Genetically modified crops are widely grown in many parts of world and now represent the majority of global soybean production. In Europe, however, there has been significant consumer opposition and crop approvals have been stalled. "It's unfortunate that GM foods haven't been embraced as well as everyone had hoped. That, too, has tremendous promise. We want to make sure we don't make that mistake again," David said. Nanotechnology holds tremendous promise for new imaging technologies that can improve the diagnosis of disease, new ways of delivering drugs into the body and new ways of making clothing waterproof or stain resistant, David said. "There is such an open door that we want to explore all of the possibilities of nanotechnology," he said
