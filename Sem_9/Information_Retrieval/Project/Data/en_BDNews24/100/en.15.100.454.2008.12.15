 PARIS, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Marseille held Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon to a goalless draw in a tight, tactical top-of-table clash on Sunday. The result left Lyon, chasing an eighth consecutive title, three points ahead of second-placed Marseille with one game to go before the winter break. Lyon have 35 points from 18 games, with Marseille, third-placed Girondins Bordeaux and fourth-placed Paris St Germain all on 32 points. A tense affair featuring five yellow cards, the game at Lyon, played on a soggy pitch, produced few highlights. Marseille, who would have gone top with a win, wasted a great chance when midfielder Mathieu Valbuena shot straight at Lyon keeper Hugo Lloris from close range on 35 minutes. Lyon, who have now gone four league matches without a win, let Marseille dictate play and relied on counter-attacks before turning the pressure on in the closing stages but were rarely dangerous. "We had a few chances but couldn't score", Lyon coach Claude Puel told reporters. "Both teams were tired and you could see that. We did what we could." Bordeaux won 3-1 at Le Mans and Paris St Germain, recovering after narrowly escaping relegation last season, won 2-1 at Auxerre
