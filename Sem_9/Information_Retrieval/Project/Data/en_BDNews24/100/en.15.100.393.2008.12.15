 Maruf Mallick, bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Malaysian giant Petronas Trading Corporation has offered to sell over 10 lakh metric tonnes of fuel oils at less than $6 premium, a top official said on Monday. The offer includes sale to Bangladesh at the same premium from March through December next year. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation chairman Anwarul Karim told bdnews24.com on Monday, "Petco has proposed to sell 10 lakh MT of fuels at a premium below $6 from March to December next year." Energy division officials told bdnews24.com no decision on the issue was taken to date. BPC's present oil purchase agreement with Petco at $6.25 premium for diesel, $6.75 for kerosene and $6.65 for jet fuel ends in February. Ministry sources said BPC is currently buying from Kuwait Petroleum Corporation at $6.06 premium for diesel, $7 for kerosene and $7 for jet fuel. KPC however cancelled a fuel shipment of four barges recently, officials said, adding that there was a deal for exporting 20-30,000 tonnes per barge. Karim set aside any impact of the cancelled order as "BPC's current oil reserves stands at 302,000 tonnes far exceeding its reserve capacity of 272,000 MT." "The excess volume is on the barges," he said. There was no reason to apprehend a crisis during the coming irrigation period, he observed. The yearly domestic demand for petroleum products is 35-40 lakh metric tonnes. The 2007-8 fiscal year witnessed consumption of over 36 tonnes of which diesel amounted to 23 lakh MT. The demand for FY 2008-9 is estimated at nearly 38 lakh tonnes. bd
