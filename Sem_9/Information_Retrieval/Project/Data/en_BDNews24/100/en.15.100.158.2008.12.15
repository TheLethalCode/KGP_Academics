<TITLE> New South Africa party sees no reconciliation with ANC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa, Mon Dec 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A breakaway faction which poses the first serious challenge to South Africa's ruling party said on Monday there is no chance of reconciliation with the African National Congress. The Congress of the People (COPE), formed two months ago by defectors loyal to former President Thabo Mbeki, has changed the political landscape in South Africa, dominated by the ANC since the end of apartheid in 1994. COPE's first conference, due to end on Tuesday, is expected to choose a leader and set out the party's policies and strategy for the election likely in March 2009. The party's interim chairman and co-founder, Mosiuoa Lekota, is widely tipped to be chosen as party leader. He told the conference that there was no turning back to the ANC. "There is no possibility of that happening," the former defense minister told a press conference. The party was founded by pro-business centrists who became disenchanted with the ANC after it ousted Mbeki in September. It will be less influenced by trade unions and the South African Communist Party, which are strong backers of the ruling party and its leader Jacob Zuma, and accused Mbeki's government of neglecting the poor. COPE's main leaders are Lekota, defense minister under Mbeki, and Mbhazima Shilowa, former premier of Gauteng province, the business hub around Johannesburg. They say it has attracted more than 130,000 members. The party would be hard pressed to defeat the ANC, which has won about two-thirds of the vote in previous elections. But COPE can try to attract enough support to prevent the ANC from winning an absolute majority in parliament. There is also talk of COPE forming a coalition with other opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance which has heavy support from whites. In its first electoral test, COPE won over a third of 27 contested by-elections in the Western Cape. While that cannot be seen as an indication of its national support -- the ANC has never won an outright majority in the province -- it was widely seen by political analysts as a good start. Lekota quit his post as defense minister and the ruling party after Mbeki was ousting as South Africa's president earlier this year over accusations that he interfered in a corruption case against Zuma
