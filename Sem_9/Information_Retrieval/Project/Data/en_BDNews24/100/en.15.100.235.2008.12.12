<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party of Bangladesh warned of continuing crisis on Friday as it launched its electoral campaign from the Central Shaheed Minar in the city. In the inaugural rally at the Minar premises, president Monjurul Ahsan Khan urged the people to vote for CPB to save the country from the "devastating crisis". "In the last three decades the people of the country have seen spiralling prices of essentials, unbridled corruption, looting, terrorism, extortion and arrogance of war criminals," Khan. He added the people did not see any basic change in their lives. The leftists should be voted to power skirting the "alliance-grand alliance" to bring changes in society, he added. CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim and other leaders attended the rally. bdnews24.c
