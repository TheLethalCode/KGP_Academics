At the start of travel, she began her day's programme by paying tribute at the martyred intellectual's monument in the capital. Khaleda is expected to take part in 12 public rallies on the first day of her trip. BNP supporters at Gabtoli and Savar waved paddy sheafs, the BNP election symbol, and posters of nominated candidates as the former prime minister's motorcade went by. bdnew
