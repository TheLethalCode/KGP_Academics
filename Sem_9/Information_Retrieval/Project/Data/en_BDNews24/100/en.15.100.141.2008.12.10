<TITLE> Terrorism tops agenda as India's parliament reopens </TITLE>

 NEW DELHI (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting terrorism is set to top the agenda as the parliament opened on Wednesday for the first time since the Mumbai attacks and the results of five state elections, analysts said. The session opened amid heightened tensions between India and nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan, with New Delhi demanding decisive action against militants across the border whom it says where involved in strikes on the financial hub. The ruling Congress-led coalition is itself under pressure to clamp down on militancy after admitting to security lapses before a three-day rampage by Islamist gunmen that killed 179 people. "The government is going to focus on Pakistan and foreign policy, in case they are unable to come to any firm conclusion about what is to be done internally," said Swapan Dasgupta, a political analyst with links to the BJP. The Indian government is finalising a plan to set up a federal investigative agency, to which the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has agreed in principle but said wouldn't work without tougher anti-terror laws. "We want more teeth to this federal investigative agency," BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar told Reuters. "Let the government bring in this law and discuss the draft with us, only then will we be able to give a detailed response." The BJP has pounded the government as being soft on terrorism in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, and put security centre-stage in recent elections in five states. But the BJP managed only a lukewarm performance in the month-long polls, winning just two states -- Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh -- and failing to win the big prize Delhi. "The BJP has realised the terror card has gone," said political analyst Amulya Ganguli. In the next parliamentary session, analysts said both parties were also likely to trade blows on the Indian economy, which is expected to grow at 7 percent this year, compared to 9 percent or more in recent years. In the last few days, the government has cut fuel prices, slashed interest rates and announced $4 billion in extra spending to revive economic growth. But the BJP will take Congress to task over industry lay-offs and the perceived failure of interest cuts to trickle down to the consumer, Dasgupta said. That said, Congress' handling of the economy will be harder to criticise because the man who formerly headed the finance ministry -- P. Chidambaram -- took over as Home Minister in the political fallout of the Mumbai attacks, Dasgupta said. "The intensity on the attack on Chidambaram would have been greater," Dadgupta said. Members of parliament observed two minutes silence on Wednesday to pay their respects to former Prime Minister V.P. Singh who died in late November, and to the victims of the Mumbai attacks.
