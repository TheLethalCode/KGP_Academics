 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP and its allies welcomed the government's date for emergency withdrawal on Wednesday night as a "victory of the four-party alliance". "The announcement by the government on withdrawal of emergency is a victory of the people and the four-party alliance," said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain after a meeting of the allied parties. "We hope now that people will participate in the upcoming election in a joyful mood," he told waiting reporters at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. "The four-party alliance has been pressing to ensure a free, fair and credible election. That's why we had given our final deadline on Monday," Delwar said. "Today's announcement by the government was a victory." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia began an hour-long meeting with election partners Wednesday evening, minutes after the government announced the Dec 17 date for withdrawal of emergency ahead of the general election on Dec 29. The four-party alliance was initially scheduled to meet earlier in the day as there had been "no word" from authorities about lifting emergency rule following their latest 'ultimatum', they said. The alliance leaders finally walked into the meeting around 9pm, following the government announcement and the conclusion of another day-long drama Wednesday - that of Jatiya Party's announced split with BNP's rival Awami League. On the JP-AL split, announced by Jatiya Party leaders earlier in the evening, Delwar said: "It's a matter between the two parties." "I have no news that JP is joining with the four-party alliance," he added, when pressed by reporters. Asked about the four-party's final decision on seat-sharing, he repeated their previous assured stance: "There is no problem with it at all." With Dec 11 being the last day for withdrawal of candidacies, he said: "You will know all about it tomorrow." The BNP-led four-party alliance had given the government and Election Commission '48 hours' on Monday to make a clear announcement on their demand for lifting emergency and suspension of Section 91(E) of the Representation of the People Order. 'Tough actions' were under consideration in case the government did not meet their demands by the deadline, alliance leaders had warned. "A final decision is expected at the meeting scheduled for this evening about future actions since the government has not yet made any announcement on lifting the emergency," BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com midday Wednesday. Abdul Latif Nezami, secretary general of four-party ally Islami Oikya Jote, told bdnews24.com, if the government did not heed their demands for lifting emergency, it would "slim our chances of going to polls." Several other leaders of the alliance had also echoed Mosharraf and Nezami. Khaleda, meanwhile, has said she will start her election campaign after visiting the shrines of Shahjalal, Shah Paran and Borhanuddin in Sylhet on Dec 12, with a formal announcement of her party's manifesto on Dec 13. Delwar hoped the government, Election Commission and all concerned authorities would "now play their roles judiciously to fulfil the nation's hopes". "They must ensure a free, fair, neutral and acceptable vote," he said. bdnew
