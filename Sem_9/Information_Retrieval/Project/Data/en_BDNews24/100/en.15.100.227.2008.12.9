 HARARE, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush joined calls for Robert Mugabe to step down on Tuesday, but the African Union rejected tougher action against Zimbabwe's president and said only dialogue could solve its crisis. The death toll neared 600 from a cholera epidemic which Mugabe's government accuses Western powers of exploiting to try to force his departure. The World Health Organization said cholera could affect as many as 60,000 in a worst-case scenario. "It is time for Robert Mugabe to go," Bush said in a statement in Washington. "Across the continent, African voices are bravely speaking out to say now is the time for him to step down." But the African Union earlier made clear it did not back calls for much tougher action. "Only dialogue between the Zimbabwean parties, supported by the AU and other regional actors, can restore peace and stability to that country," said Salva Rweyemamu, spokesman for AU chairman and Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete. Rweyemamu said sending peacekeeping troops or removing Mugabe by force, as proposed by prominent figures including Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga and Nobel peace laureate and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, were not options. "We have a serious humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. We have cholera. Do they think that we can eradicate cholera with guns?" South Africa will oppose any move to send troops to Zimbabwe, a senior government official there said. Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai reached a power-sharing deal brokered by regional mediator Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's former president, in September. But they are deadlocked over how to implement it. The spreading cholera, coupled with chronic food shortages, has highlighted the economic collapse of the southern African country, once relatively prosperous. Basic foodstuffs are running out and prices of goods have been doubling every day. Zimbabwe ordered prices of goods and services to be cut to December 3 levels after prices surged when the central bank increased bank withdrawal limits. A loaf of bread cost 30 million Zimbabwe dollars -- worth $1 on the black market -- on Tuesday, compared to 2.5 million Zimbabwe dollars last Wednesday. A similar price freeze in June 2007 badly affected local businesses and left Zimbabwe battling shortages of basic goods. WEST ACCUSED Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba said the West was using the cholera outbreak to try to bring down the veteran leader. "The British and the Americans are dead set on bringing Zimbabwe back to the U.N. Security Council, they are also dead set on ensuring that there is an invasion of Zimbabwe but without themselves carrying it out," state-owned newspaper The Herald quoted Charamba as saying. In a sign that Mugabe's traditional ally China may be distancing itself, Beijing stressed the need for the formation of a unity government between Mugabe and the opposition.
