 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)In a partial lift of emergency rule, restrictions on rallies and processions are being withdrawn from Dec 12, as campaigning begins ahead of the Dec 29 election. The state of emergency will be fully withdrawn from Dec 17, the government finally announced Wednesday after parties had been pressing for weeks for a specific date. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had said earlier in the day that the government had already assured that emergency would be lifted ahead of the election, leaving no necessity for "any ultimatum". The comment was a seeming response to the BNP-led alliance's 48-hour deadline given on Monday to meet their demand for lifting emergency. "The emergency will be lifted in a timely way so that candidates face no restrictions during the campaign period," Hossain Zillur had also assured just hours before the official government announcement. According to the election schedule, campaign activities may begin from Dec 12, following the deadline for withdrawal of candidacies (Dec 11). bdnews24.
