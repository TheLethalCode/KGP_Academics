 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami has promised inclusion of freedom fighters in the government Hajj delegation, formulation of a blasphemy law, elimination of terrorism and administrative reforms. Jamaat amir Motiur Rahman Nizami declared the manifesto Thursday morning at the party's central office. "Due to the absence of a blasphemy law, Daud Haider and Taslima Nasreen are forced to live outside the country," said Nizami. "The declaration of the date for the withdrawal of the state of emergency has removed all concern surrounding the election," Nizami said. "There will not be any problem related to seat allocation within the four party alliance," he added. The salient features in Jamaat's manifesto are: basic education for all Muslim men and women, broadcasting of Islamic ideals through radio and television, taking efforts to stop gambling, drinking and other immoral acts, separate transportation for men and women, establishing accountable administration, freeing administration of corruption, building up the armed forces, establishing a wage board to provide farmers with the minimum wages and facilities, building flyovers and underground rails for Dhaka, rural loans and waiver of agricultural interest. "Jamaat will go to polls with the symbol of the balance," said Nizami. bdnews24.co
