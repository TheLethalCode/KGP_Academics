 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty has again stressed the "transforming" potential of the upcoming election, and cautioned against undermining the Election Commission at this crucial time. He was optimistic that the election would restore a strong democracy in Bangladesh, Moriarty told reporters on Monday after emerging from a meeting with AL president Sheikh Hasina. Earlier this month, Moriarty told a public hearing in Washington DC: "In my view, other than last month's election in the US, there'll be no more transformational election in the world this year than the parliamentary elections scheduled for Dec. 29 in Bangladesh". Addressing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a Congressionally-mandated agency, at a hearing to explore the prospects for free, fair, and peaceful elections in Bangladesh, Moriarty had stated: "Bangladesh that is on the brink of a historic democratic transition which could make it a model of governance for other moderate Muslim nations." The US envoy, after calling on Hasina on the eve of Victory Day, said that preparations for the election were almost complete and now the most important issue was the successful implementation of electoral laws. It would not be wise at the moment to undermine the Election Commission, he said. AL election co-ordination committee co-chairman HT Imam also briefed reporters after the meeting. He said the ambassador had praised AL's election manifesto. "Our leader went over various points of the manifesto with the US ambassador. She also stressed our commitment to the country's youth." Moriarty expressed concern on how the party's pledges would be financed, Imam said. "Our leader said if the party comes to power, it would manage the funds. But Hasina did seek assistance from the US in agro-based industry." "They also discussed controlling prices of commodities, the anti-graft drive, the electoral system and thwarting religious terrorism." On whether Moriarty had touched on the issue of a deep-sea port with access for all Asian countries, mentioned in both AL and BNP manifestos, Imam said that the US had always backed such an initiative and would continue to do so. bdnews
