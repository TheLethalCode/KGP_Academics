<TITLE> Rivals China, Taiwan launch direct links </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING/TAIPEI, Mon Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China and Taiwan launched daily flights, new shipping routes and postal links on Monday in a further thaw of once icy relations between the two rivals. The shipping links resumed after a six-decade hiatus when a vessel bound for Taiwan left in the morning from the Chinese port of Tianjin, and one bound for China left from Kaohsiung. The new links are aimed at facilitating two-way trade and advancing political trust between two governments that once stood at the brink of war, although they are not expected to lift Taiwan's moribund economy in the short term. China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since 1949 and vowed to bring the island under its rule, by force if necessary. Ties have improved since China-friendly President Ma Ying-jeou took office in Taipei earlier this year. Flights between Taiwan and China once had to go through a third region, usually Hong Kong or Macau, due to a ban on regular direct links. Cargo shipments also had to detour through third countries or regions, adding time and expense. Taiwan and China agreed in November to the new links, which include up to 108 direct daily flights a week, 60 new cargo flights a month and a raft of new sea cargo routes, to cut costs for the 750,000 Taiwan investors in China and tie the island closer to the faster growing Chinese economy. "We've got so many participating airports that it's hard to allocate all the flights," said an ecstatic Lee Lung-wen, director-general of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration, at Taipei's domestic airport minutes after the arrival of its maiden direct flight from Shenzhen in south China. SHORT FLIGHT Officials from the two sides also agreed to shorten air routes by no longer having to fly through Hong Kong air space on flights between Taiwan and cities in northern China. Today's daily charter flights, an increase from the Friday-through-Monday routine that began in July, will become scheduled daily flights next year, Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou told a foreign business conference last month. "It's a lot more convenient now, though ticket prices could stand to come down," said Taiwan businessman Jack Lin, 60. He said daily flights will allow him to fly home from Shenzhen weekly instead of monthly. To kick off direct postal links, which will shorten delivery time, China and Taiwan officials gathered at the main postal sorting office at Beijing airport on Monday, symbolically putting Taiwan-bound greeting cards into a transparent box. "Our family was separated on the two sides of the strait," said 81-year old Zheng Jian, after he mailed his oversized cards. "The three youngest grew up in Taiwan and had no contact with the three oldest for 30 years. So it is very moving to have this link now." The Taiwan government expects ocean shippers to save T$1.2 billion ($36 million) a year and air passengers to save at least T$3 billion annually. "We can't be really optimistic," said Liu Fong-sheng, Taipei general manager for Shenzhen Airlines, a regional carrier based in south China. "But we've got a low price. We think passengers should be able to accept it." The five Taiwan airlines and nine from China face low demand for their direct flights due to the global economic downturn, though tourism is seen growing next year when China authorises travel agents in second-tier cities to arrange Taiwan trips. "You need to wait till January to see results," said Anthony Liao, standing supervisor with the Taipei Association of Travel Agents. "I predict that after January you'll see tourist numbers up to 1,000 per day.
