<TITLE> Israel to free Palestinian prisoners after delays </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Mon Dec 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel prepared to free some 230 Palestinian prisoners on Monday, nearly a week later than planned, in a move it described as a goodwill gesture to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The prisoners being freed are a fraction of the 11,000 Palestinians held by Israel. Their release was originally due to take place last week, in the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Israeli officials said Palestinians sought a delay for logistical reasons. Abbas had been attending the haj pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Palestinian officials denied requesting any postponement, saying it stemmed from Israeli legal procedures. The release was further delayed for several hours on Monday as Israel's high court heard an appeal from Israeli rightists who customarily object to freeing Palestinian prisoners. But Yaron Zamir, a spokesman for Israel's prison services, said 227 prisoners would be freed around noon local time (1000 GMT). Israel announced last month that it would free 250 prisoners, but the final list included only 227 names and it was not immediately clear exactly how many would be freed. Most of the prisoners would be sent to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Abbas's government is based. Ten were expected to go to the Gaza Strip, which Hamas Islamists seized in June 2007 after routing secular Fatah forces loyal to Abbas. Aides to outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the prisoners came from the ranks of Fatah and other non-Islamist groups. Such releases are highly emotive for Palestinians, who regard prisoners as symbols of resistance to Israeli occupation. Israel freed nearly 200 prisoners in August. US-sponsored peace talks between Olmert and Abbas, rejected by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, have shown little sign of progress
