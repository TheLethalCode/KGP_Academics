 NEW DELHI, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's factory output fell for the first time in more than 13 years in October, the latest evidence of a rapid economic slowdown which could spark more interest rate cuts after aggressive monetary easing last weekend. Asia's third-largest economy, which was expected to escape the worst of the global crisis, is rapidly losing height with industries such as automobiles, real estate and exports reeling as recessions deepen in big economies and credit remains tight. Industrial output declined 0.4 percent in October from a year earlier, the first annual drop since data in the current series became available in April 1995, and sharply below the previous month's upwardly revised 5.5 percent. "It is a shocking figure and only underlines the fact that the Indian economy is in a very bad situation," said TK Bhaumik, economist at JK Industries Group. "This is a wake up call for the government." The number was below a forecast for growth of 2.2 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. Manufacturing production fell 1.2 percent from a year earlier, data showed. Most economists expect a further contraction in industrial output in November. Bhaumik called on the government to consider additional stimulus to that announced at the weekend and to use fiscal measures to lift consumer demand. Lending banks should move fast to pass on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recent rate cuts. "Since the RBI has already done its job, now commercial banks should be fast to ease the credit line," he said, referring to the Reserve Bank of India. Central Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has said India faces a period of painful adjustment after the global financial crisis froze credit markets in October, further weakening an economy struggling with high borrowing costs. SHARP SLOWDOWN Subbarao said the bank's growth forecast for 2008/09 was likely to be cut from 7.5-8.0 percent. Many private economists expect it to dip below 7 percent. A Reuters poll has showed economists expect India's economy to grow 6.8 percent in 2008/09, its slowest in six year, and 6.2 percent the following year. The central bank cut its main rates by 1 percentage point on Saturday -- lowering its key lending rate for the third time since October -- and indicated it was ready to act again to bolster an economy slowing much faster than expected. The benchmark 10-year bond yield plunged to its lowest in more than four years after the data was published on increased expectations of further central bank action. Industrial output rose 8.1 percent in the 2007/08 (April-March) fiscal year, compared with 11.6 percent in 2006/07. The economy has grown at or above 9 percent for the past three fiscal years, but signs of a sharp slowdown are consistently emerging and the near-term appears bleak. Figures on Wednesday showed car sales dropped by nearly a fifth in November, the worst fall in eight years and adding to woes of global car makers who had seen India as a bright spot, as high borrowing costs and tight credit dragged down demand. Sales of trucks and buses, closely linked to industrial activity, slumped by nearly a half from a year earlier. A key indicator showed manufacturing output shrank for the first time in 3- years in November as credit conditions tightened and the global crisis hurt sentiment. India has followed other countries in cutting rates, but a large fiscal deficit has constrained its ability to deliver a fiscal stimulus, with the government announcing just $4 billion in additional spending. "We think that the policy has been very aggressive and will continue to be so, and we expect significant interest rate cuts from the RBI," said Atsi Sheth, economist at Reliance Capital
