 WASHINGTON, Thu Dec 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top US military officer on Wednesday said the world financial crisis threatened to create new dangers to global security and warned about potential new militant safe havens in Somalia and Yemen. "A significant objective in Afghanistan and Pakistan is to not have a safe haven. And I am concerned about the potential for a safe haven in Somalia, as I am in Yemen," said Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We need to do all we can to impede the arrival of more safe havens out of which we can be threatened, he told reporters at the Pentagon. In Somalia, US officials fear a planned Ethiopian troops withdrawal by the end of the year would leave the country controlled by Islamists sympathetic to al Qaeda. Mullen said attacks in Yemen, including a September suicide bombing at the US embassy that killed 17 people, highlighted the risk it could become a militant haven. "There is potential there that I worry about a great deal," he said. Yemen's government has cooperated with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts since 2001. Two weeks ago, Yemeni authorities took custody of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's former driver, Salim Hamdan, after his transfer from the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mullen said poor countries in Africa and elsewhere faced new instability because of the world financial crisis. "The possibilities for increased instability as opposed to increased stability are there," he said. "The pressure that would be brought on continents like Africa will be enormous." Mullen said the attacks that killed 179 people in Mumbai, India, showed that a handful of militants could bring nuclear-armed India and Pakistan closer to war. He said the sophistication of the attack demonstrated the danger of militant safe havens, including those in Pakistan's tribal areas where Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group accused by India in the Mumbai attacks, are believed to train. "It is that ability to operate and train over an extended period of time in very sophisticated tactics that to me is very powerful," Mullen added. "We, the international community, I think, have to go to great lengths to make sure those opportunities are not presented to them.
