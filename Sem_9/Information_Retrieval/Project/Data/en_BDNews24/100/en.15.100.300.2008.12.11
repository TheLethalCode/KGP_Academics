 KARACHI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt was given government clearance on Thursday to visit India in what is seen as a desperate bid to salvage the test series between the countries scheduled to start on Jan. 4. Butt left for Chennai on Thursday afternoon to attend a meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), on the sidelines of which he is due to have discussions with Indian cricket officials, a PCB official said. "India's tour to Pakistan is not on the ACC agenda. But it is a good opportunity for us to have one to one talks and try to ensure the series is played on schedule," Saleem Altaf, chief operating officer of the PCB, told Reuters. Altaf said the Indian board (BCCI) had made it clear they would only tour Pakistan if given clearance from their government, which hangs in the balance because of the strained relations between the two countries after the militant attacks in Mumbai last month. "We are hoping we can convince them to play the series even if neutral venues are considered as options," Altaf said. India is due to play three tests, five one-day internationals and a twenty20 game in Pakistan. The PCB's director-general Javed Miandad said that after the resumption of England's tour of India, he was hopeful of some positive news on the India tour in the coming days. "I completely support England's decision to return to India to play the tests. It is a good thing for cricket which should not be affected by these...attacks," Miandad told Reuters. England have returned to India for two tests after they decided to abandon their one-day series in the wake of the Mumbai attacks which killed at least 171 people
