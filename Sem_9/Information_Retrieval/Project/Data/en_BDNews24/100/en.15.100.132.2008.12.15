 BANGKOK, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's opposition Democrat Party leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva, won a thin majority in a parliamentary vote on Monday to become the country's third prime minister in as many months, as the economy teeters on the brink of recession. According to a Reuters tally of votes, the Oxford-educated economist won the support of 234 MPs from a range of parties, including a breakaway faction of the Puea Thai party that had supported ousted and exiled leader Thaksin Shinawatra. Abhisit needed 219 to become prime minister. Immediately after the vote, a crowd of 200 Thaksin supporters tried to block MPs from leaving the compound. They shouted "Abhisit, the army nominee" and denounced him as a frontman for the military, which ousted Thaksin in a 2006 coup. The vote came two weeks after the courts sacked PM Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin's brother-in-law, as his People Power Party (PPP) was found guilty of fraud in the December 2007 election that brought it to power. A day after the court verdict, the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) ended blockades of Bangkok's airports that had caused chaos for travellers and did huge damage to the tourism and export-driven economy. After months of political strife and a global slowdown, the economy was expected to shrink 0.5-1.0 percent in the first quarter of 2009 from a year earlier and post no growth in the second quarter, putting it on the brink of recession, Acting Finance Minister Suchart Thada-Thamrongvech has said. The 44-year-old Abhisit has said reviving the export and tourism-reliant economy would be his top priority. Thaksin had called for national reconciliation on Saturday and urged the military not to meddle in the parliamentary vote. "May all sides take one step back and respect the results," he said in 20-minute recorded address to 40,000 supporters at a Bangkok sports stadium. "Please don't use any institution to intervene. Just let the country move forward. Don't make people suffer more," he said. His supporters have accused the military of launching a "silent coup" by claiming to have royal backing and pushing small parties in the previous government to form a Democrat-led government -- a charge the army has denied. Analysts see little respite in Thailand's three-year political crisis, with Bangkok's royal and military elites pitted against Thaksin and his allies
