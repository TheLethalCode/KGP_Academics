<TITLE> Red Cross to help probe Nepal civil war's missing people </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU,Sat Dec 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Red Cross said on Saturday it would help Nepal enhance its forensic skills to examine human remains in a probe into hundreds missing during a civil war which ended two years ago. Human rights groups accuse both government troops and the Maoist rebels of abuses such as killings, kidnappings and torture during the decade-long conflict which caused more than 13,000 deaths. The Maoist-led coalition is yet to set up a panel to conduct the probe, even though this was agreed to as part of a 2006 peace deal. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said two forensic experts would teach Nepali officials, police and rights activists about exhumation procedures, analysis of human remains and the identification of mortal remains. "Under international humanitarian law, the authorities bear primary responsibility for determining what happened to people who went missing in connection with armed conflict," said Mary Werntz, head of the ICRC in Nepal. "To provide accurate information they need to be able to draw on considerable forensic expertise." Though estimates on the number of missing vary, the ICRC says it has received complaints about 1,250 people who have not been found. The former Maoist rebels are now heading a coalition government after winning the election for a special constituent assembly in April
