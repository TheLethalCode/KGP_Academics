 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  The advisory council on Sunday approved the Judicial Service Secretariat Ordinance-2008, allowing "full freedom to the judiciary", said the chief adviser's press secretary. The ordinance was okayed in a cabinet meeting at the chief adviser's office, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said. The law ministry has been tasked with secretarial work for the judiciary to date. The advisory council observed that the Supreme Court registrar's office under direct supervision of the chief justice takes pains to do a broad spectrum of jobs from lower court affairs to the apex court's administrative affairs. The SC registrar's office also does an arduous job of manning the lower court judges and ensuring the quality of their services  all adding to the work of managing SC affairs. In the light of this, the cabinet approved the ordinance keeping the organogram of the SC registrar's office intact, said Munaim. "This will help the Supreme Court to effectively control and supervise the lower court and tribunal affairs," he added. The new secretariat will work independently and the chief justice will take over powers from the government to depute a senior judge as secretary to the new secretariat, said the press aide. It will also attend to all other affairs related to the judiciary's appointments, terminations, promotions, postings, transfers, leave, matters of discipline, retirements and pensions, he said. bdnews24.
