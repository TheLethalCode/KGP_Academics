 MILAN, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Napoli moved up to joint-second in Serie A on Saturday after easily overcoming Lecce 3-0 despite a boggy San Paolo pitch. Their seventh win from eight home games put Napoli level on 30 points with Juventus and AC Milan, who meet in Turin in Sunday's late game. Leaders Inter Milan, six points clear, host bottom side Chievo at 1400 GMT on Sunday. Well-supported Napoli, who won the Italian title with Diego Maradona in 1987 and 1990, are fast becoming a Serie A force again in their second season back in the top flight. Slovakia midfielder Marek Hamsik slotted in an 11th-minute penalty after Ezequiel Lavezzi was tripped by goalkeeper Francesco Benussi as the striker moved wide of the goal. Hamsik later went off with a knock but his replacement Michele Pazienza doubled the lead just before the break with a cool finish and German Denis slammed home a third in the 65th. Argentina's Lavezzi who, like Hamsik, is attracting the attention of Europe's top clubs, showed his class throughout against a Lecce side now just a place above the relegation zone. In Saturday's early game, a Marco Di Vaio hat-trick helped Bologna to a 5-2 win over Walter Novellino's Torino in his first game back in charge since replacing Gianni De Biasi. The hosts, who came from behind twice to end a run of five straight draws under their new coach Sinisa Mihajlovic, jumped out of the drop zone and sent Torino down to third-from-bottom. Torino's Francesco Pratali was sent off for a foul in the box after 78 minutes allowing Di Vaio to complete his hat-trick from the spot with the last goal of an extraordinary game
