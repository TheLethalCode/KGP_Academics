 Chittagong, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP and Awami League-led alliances have drummed up their electoral campaigns in the port city on the second day after the removal of a campaign ban. From Saturday morning, the city's thoroughfares resounded with rallies, loudspeakers, and supporters. The candidates wooed voters with promises for development of their localities. City Awami League joint secretary Afsarul Amin kicked off his campaign with boat symbol on Saturday for the Chittagong-9 (Double Mooring) seat, though he failed to manage an AL-led alliance ticket. Alliance candidate Jatiya Party leader Murshed Murad Ibrahim is contesting from the constituency with plough logo. Amin has started his electoral campaign after paying respects at the shrine of Shah Garibullah in the morning. He told reporters that he stayed in the race as the party chief did not ask him to withdraw his nomination. Chittagong city AL president mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury inaugurated the AL election campaign office at Lalkhan Bazar in the city. He urged upon the people to vote for boat for further development of the city. BNP joint secretary general and former minister Abdullah Al Noman, who runs for the seat, has started a mass communication campaign at Halishahar, Follyatoli Bazar, Hajipara and Ful Chowdhurypara in the same constituency.
