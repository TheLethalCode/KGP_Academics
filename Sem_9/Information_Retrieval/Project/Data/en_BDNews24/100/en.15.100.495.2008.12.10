<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Wed Dec 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The fiscal stimulus package announced by the government is unlikely to revive growth in the manufacturing sector soon, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said on Tuesday. The Indian government has planned $4 billion of extra spending this fiscal year to revive fading economic growth hit by global slowdown and boost investors' confidence following militants attacks on Mumbai. The government's stimulus package came a day after the Reserve Bank of India cut its key interest rates by 1 percentage point to shore up growth. The FICCI survey said sectors like textiles, metal and metal products and leather are looking to cut production by 10-50 percent between November 2008 and March 2009, which could translate into job losses by 10-30 percent. Indian textile exporters have already expressed their disappointment with the stimulus package. The FICCI survey said the government needs to raise the duty drawback rates for the textile industry and lift interest rate subsidy on bank loans to the sector to 4 percent. The survey expects the textiles, leather and metal sector to decline 3.9 percent, 13 percent and 30 percent respectively in October 2008. Textile exports are seen falling about 10 percent during the month. JPMorgan on Monday expressed scepticism over the government's ability to boost spending in the remaining months of the 2008/09 fiscal year, given its preoccupation with general elections in the first half of 2009. The FICCI survey said there was a need for further interest rate cuts, sought an immediate reduction in the corporate tax rate and restoration of income tax exemption for exports
