<TITLE> Japan, EU poised to prop up economies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Fri Dec 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan and Europe sought on Friday to prop up their faltering economies after a $14-billion rescue package for America's top auto makers collapsed, deepening the worst financial crisis in 80 years. The US bailout's failure in late-night Senate talks will raise fears of an industry collapse that would jeopardize many jobs. The companies say one in 10 US jobs are tied to the auto sector, which adds up to several million. Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso scheduled a news conference for 4 a.m. EST. The Yomiuri newspaper reported he would expand economic stimulus measures to $437 billion to combat a deepening recession. "We are working at a very high speed. The size of the economic measures will be worked out until the last minute," Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa told a news conference. European Union leaders are set to back an already-floated 200-billion-euro ($264-billion) economic stimulus pact, a draft text from their Brussels summit showed, despite German misgivings. Skeptics say the plan rests largely on national stimulus packages already announced by individual governments but leaders will be relieved nonetheless, after an unusually public spat between Berlin and London over Britain's value-added tax cut. In wording which appeared to reflect the reluctance of Germany, the text noted the possibility of reducing VAT on labor-intensive services only in those states that wished to. A crisis which has spiraled from a U.S. housing collapse through frozen money markets to bank failures has now pushed much of the world into a recession which many experts say will be long and painful. US PLAN STALLED, STOCKS DIVE The US Senate's refusal overnight to back a rescue plan for the auto sector prompted stocks to dive. General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC had sought billions of dollars in immediate aid to avert collapse, while Ford Motor Co wanted a hefty line of credit. "It's going to be a very, very bad Christmas for a lot of people based on what takes place here tonight," said US Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat who favored the bailout. "I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow. It's not going to be a pretty sight." Tokyo's Nikkei average and stocks elsewhere in Asia fell 5 percent and more after talks failed. Auto stocks went into freefall, with Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and others extending earlier falls to more than 10 percent. European shares shed 3.5 percent with BMW, Daimler, Renault, Fiat, Peugeot and Porsche down 1.7-6.9 percent
