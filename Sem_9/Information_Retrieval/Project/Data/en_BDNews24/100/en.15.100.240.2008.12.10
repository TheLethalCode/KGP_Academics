<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)The government has already decided to lift the state of emergency ahead of election, leaving no necessity for "any ultimatum", said adviser and government spokesperson Hossain Zillur Rahman on Wednesday. "The emergency will be lifted in a timely way so that candidates face no restrictions during the campaign period," said the adviser. The adviser's comments came as BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia decided to sit with allies on Wednesday to decide on the four-party's next steps, as there had been no response from authorities on their "ultimatum", they said. The BNP-led alliance gave the government a 48-hour deadline on Monday to meet their two remaining demands, lifting emergency and suspending Section 91(E) of the RPO. Hossain Zillur was speaking to reporters in Chittagong Wednesday after viewing road expansion works in the port city. Asked about recent criticism aired in the press over diplomatic 'intervention' into internal affairs, Hossain Zillur said: "Diplomatic intervention is never welcome in matters of election." "But we have not yet seen any problem with diplomats paying 'courtesy calls' to political leaders," said the adviser. "The government and political parties are not opponents," he added. bdnews2
