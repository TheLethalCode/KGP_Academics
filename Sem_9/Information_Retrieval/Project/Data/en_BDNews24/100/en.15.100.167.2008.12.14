 ISLAMABAD, Sun Dec 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -British police may wish to question the only surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks, a British government source said on Sunday. Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave this message to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in talks in New Delhi on Sunday, the source said. One British national and two people with dual British-Indian nationality were among the 179 people killed in last month's assault on Mumbai by Islamist militants. The lone surviving gunman from the attacks, identified as Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, is being questioned by Indian investigators. India blames the outlawed Pakistani Islamist militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba for the attacks. Nine other gunmen were killed during the 60-hour siege. Brown will also tell Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in Islamabad that British detectives may also wish to interview militants being held in Pakistan. Pakistani authorities began raiding and shutting offices and schools of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity, which is linked to the banned Lashkar, on Thursday. Scores of activists have been detained. "We want to get more information on how Lashkar is working," the British source said. Brown earlier blamed Lashkar for the attacks. India and Pakistan have fought three wars and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 following an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001 that New Delhi blamed on militants based in Pakistan
