 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Fifteen political parties are being given the chance to deliver electoral speeches on state-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar. "The speeches will be broadcast from December 17 but the draft texts have to be submitted beforehand (by Dec. 15)," information secretary Jamil Osman said on Sunday. The information ministry has sent letters to the 15 parties, Osman added. Awami League has expressed unwillingness to submit their speech beforehand on grounds that it was a restriction on freedom and that the speeches faced the possibility of being leaked, said the secretary. He said the time limit of Dec. 15 for the submission of the speeches may be relaxed. "This is interference in our freedom. If the draft is submitted then our opponents may get hold of it and we don't want that," explained Syed Ashraful Islam, the AL spokesperson, on Sunday. "We've received the letter but don't agree that a draft has to be submitted by Dec. 15," he added. Until afternoon, ministry officials said, AL, BNP, Jatiya Party (Ershad), Jamaat-e- Islami, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Gono Forum, Krishak Sramik Janata League, Kalyan Party, Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal, Islami Andolon, Ccommunist Party of Bangladesh, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Zaker Party have been sent letters. The letters specified the date and time for the recording of speeches but the date for the broadcast will be released later, said a ministry official seeking anonymity. The ministry has directed the state-run media to carry the news of political parties ahead of the general elections. According to the directive, the time slot is related to the number of seats in which a party will contest: 10 minutes for 30-50 seats:, 15 minutes for 51-70 seats, 20 minutes for 71-100 seats, and 40 minutes for 101-300 seats. AL, BNP and Islami Andolon will get the most time as all three gave nominations for more than 100 seats. The ministry at a meeting on Saturday took 10 decisions to make the national election free and faor. "In that light, letters were issued to the parties," commented an official of the ministry. A committee has been formed to oversee the news and broadcast operations of the state-run media with the joint secretary (broadcast) of the ministry as the convenor. The committee also includes chief information officer of the Department of Information, managing editor and chief editor of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, directors general of Bangladesh Betar and Bangladesh Television and directors general of the Department of Mass Communication and Department of Film and Publication. To increase public awareness about polls, debates and talk shows participated by political figures will also be shown. bdnews24.com/e
