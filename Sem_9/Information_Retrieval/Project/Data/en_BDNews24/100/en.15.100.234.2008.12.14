<TEXT>
 PARIS, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Girondins Bordeaux produced a second-half goal flurry to win 3-1 at Le Mans to climb to second in Ligue 1 on Saturday. Argentine forward Fernando Cavenaghi put Bordeaux in front from close range after 59 minutes before the hosts levelled through Norway striker Thorstein Helstad. Defender Matthieu Chalme made it 2-1 in the 76th minute, surprising Le Mans keeper Yohann Pele with an angled, long-range drive and Brazilian forward Jussie wrapped up the win in added time. Last season's runners-up Bordeaux have 32 points from 18 games, two points behind seven-times champions Olympique Lyon who host fourth-placed Olympique Marseille on Sunday. "We showed more initiative and it was a deserved victory," Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc told reporters. "We hadn't scored three goals in a long time and that's nice." Paris St Germain rose to third, level on points with Bordeaux, courtesy of a 2-1 win at Auxerre featuring two Stephane Sessegnon goals. CLOSE RANGE Benin midfielder Sessegnon was left unmarked at the far post to tap the ball in from close range from a fifth-minute corner. The elegant 24-year-old was on target again on 22 minutes, squeezing his way through two defenders to double the advantage. Auxerre reduced the arrears with a late penalty by defender Cedric Hengbart. "The team are playing with more confidence and our situation is a lot more comfortable now," said PSG coach Paul Le Guen, whose side narrowly escaped relegation last season. "We're now among the teams chasing Lyon but we must not be happy with that, we must go for more." Stade Rennes dropped two places to fifth after a 0-0 home draw with strugglers Nantes. Marseille can go top by beating Lyon on Sunday
