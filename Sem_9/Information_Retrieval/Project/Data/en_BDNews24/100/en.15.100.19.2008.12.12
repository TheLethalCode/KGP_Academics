 NEW DELHI, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte on Friday discussed with Indian officials investigations into last month's attack on Mumbai and urged Pakistan and other countries to help. The attack, which India blames on militant groups in Pakistan, has jeopardised improving relations between the two neighbours and threatened to divert Pakistan's military from a U.S.-led anti-militant campaign its Afghan border. Negroponte met Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee and the National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan to discuss security and what India says is evidence of Pakistan's complicity in the Mumbai raids that killed 179 people. "The effort at the moment is concentrated on investigating these attacks and bringing those responsible to account," Negroponte said in a statement in New Delhi. He had been in Pakistan on Thursday. "We're cooperating in this effort, obviously the Government of India is in the lead, but all of our diplomatic partners have a responsibility to contribute to this effort." Negroponte's visit came days after his boss Condoleezza Rice told Indian leaders she saw evidence of involvement from Pakistani soil, possibly of non-state actors, in the three-day rampage in India's financial capital by 10 heavily armed gunmen. The United States has pressured Pakistan to bring in those responsible and dismantle militant networks it has used in the past to fight India. Indian officials had said they expected to benefit from Negroponte's experience as former U.S. Director of National Intelligence in helping tackle militant groups in Pakistan that New Delhi views as a threat to regional and global security. "We have provided ample evidence to the U.S. and other countries and we will continue to share whatever new evidence emerges," an Indian government official with knowledge of the intelligence sharing said on condition of anonymity. Analysts say Washington wants to defuse tensions as quickly as possible so Pakistan does not find an excuse to pull its troops from its western borders and slacken its military campaign against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. India blames Pakistan-based outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group for the attack on Mumbai and earlier ones, including a raid by gunmen on the Indian parliament in 2001. That almost thrust the two countries into their fourth war since winning independence from Britain in 1947. Reacting to global pressure, Pakistan has detained several Islamist militant leaders India wants extradited and cracked down on LeT and a charity regarded as its front after was sanctioned by the United Nations this week.
