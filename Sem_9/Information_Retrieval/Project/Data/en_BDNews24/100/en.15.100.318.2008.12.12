<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Dec 12(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said on Thursday Pakistan would comply with a UN Security Council decision to put on a terrorist list the founder of a militant group blamed for the attacks on Mumbai, as well as the Islamic charity he now heads. A Security Council committee on Wednesday added Hafiz Saeed, founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, and his Jamaat-ud-Dawa to a list of people and organisations linked to al Qaeda or the Taliban. Three of Saeed's associates were also listed, and will be subject to sanctions freezing assets and restricting travel. "Pakistan has taken note of the designation of certain individuals and entities by the U.N. ... and would fulfil its international obligations," a statement from Gilani's office quoted him as telling visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. An Interior Ministry statement issued later said the charity, widely regarded as a front for Lashkar, would be put under monitoring and its offices sealed if necessary. Jamaat-ud-Dawa was already on a Pakistani watch-list, and it is unclear how monitoring represented any extra oversight on the group's activities. Saeed, helped by Saudi money, founded Lashkar in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir. The group injected jihadi fervour into a separatist struggle there, and it developed strong ties with the Pakistani military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, according to analysts. Analysts say Indian doubts about the sincerity of Pakistan's actions are inevitable given the ISI connections, and the Pakistani military's reluctance to relinquish old assets. QUESTIONABLE IMPACT Whether India and the United States, which has previously put Lashkar and Jamaat-ud-Dawa on its own terrorist list, will be impressed by anything less than shutting down the charity and arresting all Lashkar JuD leaders is questionable. The United States has engaged in intensive diplomacy to stop tensions mounting between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan and keep Islamabad focused on fighting the Taliban and al Qaeda on its border with Afghanistan. Indian accusations of Lashkar's involvement in the slaughter of 179 people in Mumbai were partly based on interrogation reports from the one gunman caught alive. U.S. officials have also said Lashkar was involved. Pakistan has said anyone arrested in Pakistan in connection with the Mumbai attack would be tried in the country. Pakistan has banned Lashkar and organisations like it in the past, frozen their assets and arrested their leaders. But they were later freed and the groups allowed to operate under new names. Saeed quit Lashkar in December 2001 days before it was banned by Pakistan, but remained head of the charity that raised funds and attracted recruits. The JuD is one of the most successful Islamic charities in Pakistan. It operates from a sprawling complex at Muridke, a town close to the eastern city of Lahore. Bridling at the UN actions against him and his charity, Saeed addressed a news conference in the eastern city of Lahore. "We will not accept any decision taken under Indian pressure," Saeed said. "This decision was taken to defame Pakistan." Pakistani security forces have arrested around 20 militants in raids on their camps and Jamaat-ud-Dawa offices, an intelligence official told Reuters on Thursday. Those arrested included two Lashkar operations chiefs India says planned the attacks carried out by 10 gunmen. There was uncertainty over the whereabouts of Maulana Masood Azhar, the head of Jaish-e-Mohammad. Jaish and Lashkar were banned by Pakistan after being blamed for the December 2001 raid on the Indian parliament, which almost sparked a fourth war. An intelligence official told Reuters that Azhar had been detained, but there was no other corroboration, and his status remains unclear.
