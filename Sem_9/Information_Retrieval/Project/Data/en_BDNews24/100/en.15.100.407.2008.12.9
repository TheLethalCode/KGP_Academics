<TITLE> Nepal's Maoist PM threatens to quit government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Tue Dec 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda has threatened to walk out of a coalition government, less than four months after his election amid a deadlock with the main opposition party over the future of ex-fighters. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who still goes by his nom de guerre that means "fierce", told a meeting in west Nepal this week that his party would take to the streets if the centrist opposition Nepali Congress party did not cooperate with him. The government formed a multi-party panel in October to oversee the integration and rehabilitation of more than 19,000 former Maoist fighters housed in UN-supervised camps, part of a peace deal that ended their decade-long civil war. But the opposition Nepali Congress party refused to join the panel and opposes the integration of the ex-guerrillas into the national army as the Maoists want. "The Nepali Congress is not helping the government in the integration of the fighters," Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara told Reuters. Analysts said the Maoists were unlikely to pull out from the government and the threat could have also been aimed at party hardliners who are criticising him for going slow on the "revolutionary" agenda. "It is the highest degree of irresponsibility on Prachanda's part to say so," said Lok Raj Baral, chief of the Nepal Centre for Strategic Studies, an independent think-tank. "If he quits it will show his incompetence. I don't think the Maoists will quit the government." The Maoists regularly threatened to launch street protests during months of peace negotiations with the main political parties in 2006 and 2007. The Maoists, who waged a bloody civil war which caused more than 13,000 deaths since 1996, came to government after winning the election in April under the landmark deal. The government's main task is to help a special constituent assembly prepare a new constitution and cap a 2006 peace deal
