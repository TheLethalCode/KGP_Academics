<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party has decided to break its electoral alliance with Awami League, three JP presidium members told bdnews24.com Wednesday evening, in the midst of a policy level meeting chaired by HM Ershad. "We are no longer with the Grand Alliance," presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed told bdnews24.com at 8:30pm as the party's policymaking body had just ended an emergency meeting. "We have just taken the decision," said Kazi Zafar, a former prime minister in the Ershad administration in the 1980s, refusing to give the reasons. "A press statement is being released, and we'll explain why," Kazi Zafar said. "If necessary, we'll hold a press conference tomorrow (Thursday)." There was no immediate comment from the Awami League, however, although at least two other JP presidium members confirmed the decision to break away from the AL-led polls partnership. "We are out of the (grand) alliance," Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu, a former JP minister, had told bdnews24.com while the presidium was still on. A third presidium member, Golam Moshi, also echoed his colleagues. bdnews
