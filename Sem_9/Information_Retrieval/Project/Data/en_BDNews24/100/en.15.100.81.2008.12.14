 by Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) Barack Obama and his family, looking to move to Washington a little earlier than previous presidents-elect, have been refused permission by the Bush administration to use the presidential guesthouse more than 5 days ahead of the Jan 20 inauguration. Malia and Sasha, Obama's two daughters, are expected to start their new school at Sidwell Friends from Jan 5. Accordingly, the Obama transition in Chicago called the White House to check if the president-elect and his family could move a little early into Blair House, the presidential guesthouse close to the White House. According to tradition, the presidents-elect move into Blair House on Jan 15, five days before Inauguration Day. But for some inexplicable reason, the Obamas were told that it was booked in early January and could not be made available for the incoming president, a spokesperson to the Obama transition told the New York Times. "We explored the idea so that the girls could start school on schedule,' the spokesperson said. "But, there were previously scheduled events and guests that couldn't be displaced." It remained unclear who could have been invited by President Bush and his wife Laura to stay in Blair House with precedence over the Obamas. "It's not a public schedule," said Sally McDonough, spokeswoman for First Lady Laura Bush said, refusing to disclose who was staying at Blair House. "It's not a question of outranking the Obamas. Blair House will be available to them on January 15." "[T]here's nothing more to say other than that it's not available and won't be available until January 15," McDonough said. A State Department official told the Times he didn't know of any foreign dignitaries staying at Blair House in early January. A White House official said President Bush does not have family or friends from Texas staying at Blair House during the period, which the Obamas requested. But Blair House, the official said, has been booked for "receptions and gatherings" by members of the outgoing Bush administration. Those receptions, the official said, "don't make it suitable for full-time occupancy by the Obamas yet." Obama transition team says that the family is considering other housing options and are hopeful the girls will not miss the start of school. "The White House has been extremely accommodating to the Obama family needs  and the entire process has been smooth and friendly," said an Obama aide.
