 NEW DELHI, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - This year's edition of the Champions League Twenty20 tournament has been cancelled over security concerns following last month's Mumbai attacks, organisers said on Friday. The inaugural edition of the $6 million event, involving eight teams from five countries, will now be staged in October 2009, an official told Reuters. However, league chairman Lalit Modi said various issues, including scheduling, were considered before taking the decision. "The inaugural edition of the Champions League Twenty20 will now be held in India in October 2009," Modi, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) vice-president, said in a statement. "The governing council, comprising the founder board members, took this collective decision after taking into account all aspects." The governing council, comprising the Indian, Australian and South African cricket boards, also took into consideration the busy international calendar and domestic schedules of the participating teams, it added. Teams from Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa and India were due to have played in the event originally scheduled from Dec. 3 to 10 in Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai. At least 179 people were killed in the three-day siege in Mumbai from Nov. 26, triggering player safety fears ahead of the initial postponement. England's national squad suspended their tour of India and flew home but returned on Monday following security assurances to play in a two-test series which began on Thursday. League officials confirmed two teams each from India, Australia and South Africa for next year's Champions League and that other participants would be finalised by the end of next month
