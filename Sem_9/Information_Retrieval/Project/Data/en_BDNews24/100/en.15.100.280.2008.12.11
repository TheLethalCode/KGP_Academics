 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  HM Ershad's Jatiya Party has returned to the Awami League-led 'grand alliance', riding a deal that gives the former president's party 46 seats and leaves three "open candidacies" for the general elections, setting to rest a political soap opera played out since Wednesday over seat-sharing. "Awami League and Jatiya Party have reached a consensus over the seat-sharing," AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said at a joint press conference at AL president's office in the city on Thursday. "Awami League candidacies from those constituencies marked for Jatiya Party have been withdrawn and vice versa," he added. Acting JP chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud said, "We've reached a peaceful solution. There were some misunderstandings but now all those have ended." A list of the JP candidacies under the alliance, made available at the joint media conference, showed 46 candidacies for the party and three open candidacies in Nilfamari-4, Khulna-3 and Sylhet-3. AL leaders said the open candidacies meant the AL and the JP candidates will fight it out in those three constituencies on their own, but they will be considered an AL-led alliance candidate if any of them wins. However, in a press release sent in the afternoon, JP said 48 of the party's nominees will contest in the polls as alliance candidates. "Both the parties are determined to form unity government if the alliance is voted to power," Ashraful said at the news conference. Ashraful said the other partners of the 14-party alliance have been given nine seats, including four for the JSD (Inu) and three for the Worker's Party of Bangladesh. Ershad's has joined the 14-party alliance for the election, but not an ally of the 14-party. AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, JP secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Hawladar and its presidium member Jiauddin Bablu attended the press conference. JP chairman HM Ershad on Wednesday said his party was parting ways with the AL-led alliance, by saying, "Even if they (AL) offer us 70 seats or 100 seats, there's no going back". However, on Thursday morning he announced that the 'grand alliance' had not split. Earlier on Nov. 30, Ershad once again had threatened to quit the AL-led alliance over misunderstandings regarding seat-sharing, but later in the day they jointly announced of "an end to misunderstandings". bd
