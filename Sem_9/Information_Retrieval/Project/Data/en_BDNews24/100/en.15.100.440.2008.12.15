<TITLE> COMMENT: Change? Sounds contagious </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COMMENT Towheed Feroze Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Politics is contagious, at least in many cases political mottos refuse to end with a campaign. As the US election goes into the history books and the Obama euphoria gives way to a more practical approach to the immediate problems in the US, the buzzword for the US election has found a place in Bangladesh and everyone is using it, with gusto. What is it? Well, if you have followed the manifestos and the avalanche of promises then it should not have eluded you, but if, for some reason, you did not notice then the term that is going around is 'change'. Everyone is talking of a change in Bangladesh and all the parties are doggedly using it in their campaigns. With the inclusion of change in their manifestos it seems that a better term of a democratically elected government lies ahead. At least, that is what most people want to believe. BNP, AL, Jamaat, Workers Party, JP and all the other key players have many things in common and, of them, the one which no one forgot to mention is the promise to hold reins of the impetuous horse of price. But, as we look at the manifestos that are, without doubt, impeccable in their approaches to a nearly perfect country and government, one is left to wonder how the prices will be brought down. Naturally, one cannot bring down the price just like that through an order or an edict. In fact, if we just look back into the democratically elected governments of the past, we come across very few occasions when prices of essentials came down because they went beyond the affordability of the common people. The common trend had been that prices go up every year at certain points of time, especially during Ramadan, and after that they rarely go down and in that manner the price tags are where they are today. It's true that price of essentials went into compete disarray last year but the question to ask  what would a democratically elected government do in such a scenario to bring down the rates? Today, we hear all parties going into a vocal overdrive saying that they will make everything affordable, but our question is, how can a government do that when external circumstances, beyond our control, have a direct impact on how rice or oil are priced in Bangladesh? Well, at this juncture the masses can only hope that the parties have some sort of strategy through which they can give a material form to the promise of controlling market prices. Call me cynical, but, somehow, the more I read this pledge the less I am inclined to believe it. Oh well, only time will tell if the pledge was backed by some plan or it was only a card to get to power. "A multi-prong drive" really sounds nice and fills the mouth but let's see if there is any power behind it. Surprisingly, with so many promises of change nowhere did we see any mention of banning the culture of hartal, a deadly political weapon that cripples the country and the economy. A nuisance more than an effective political tool! Now, juxtapose the convenient sidetracking of the banning of hartal with the pledges of economic development and progress and we are faced with a contradiction. On one side, there are vociferous lines of development but on the other hand we want to stick to hartal. This writer is no political expert but the two never go together; I mean, even in politics, this combination is an obnoxious mismatch. The manifesto of yet another party promises a pro-investment environment and asks expatriates to invest in Bangladesh. But on what guarantee will an expatriate invest in Bangladesh when s/he knows that hartals and strikes may seriously jeopardise their interests? One of the points of the 'Charter of Change' of a political party states that once they are elected, strong measures will be taken against corruption, people with black money, loan defaulters are so on. But, since 1990, we have never seen any government getting tough on people who fall in these categories. On the contrary, people with the word corrupt plastered on them got nomination and eventually found themselves in power. The masses, during voting, were told to forget the past and give them a second chance and that is exactly what they did and the corrupt only became more audacious in their deeds. Today, we also see a similar pledge, and among the educated there is a sense of scepticism. But, this writer feels that once more people will give them a chance because the two year tenure of the present caretaker government has taught the whole political arena a lesson. There isn't a single party that will find one positive side of the caretaker government but maybe this government was necessary to give a positive jolt to our politics that was going the wrong way. Today, this writer feels that whoever comes to power will be stern in dealing with corruption, loan defaulters and accumulators of black money. The reason for that is simple  no one will want another 1/11 and no politicians will want to be seen frog-marched into a prison van. So, it's for their own existence that the next government has to be strict in curbing social and political irregularities. Naturally, bad thoughts want to creep in but the nation is willing to give the politicians one more chance. Perhaps the party that comes to power will keep that in mind. For long, members of the civil society have called for a ban on politics from the educational institutes and one such promise has been made in one of the manifestos though it's hard to believe if any such move will be taken. Politics has become a mainstay in the educational institutes and unless teachers are dissuaded from becoming politically vocal, students will never be out of political influence. But this is also true that as long as students are used as political pawns, education will continue to suffer, question papers will keep on leaking and all the wrong people will end up being successful in the BCS examination. Now, there is opinion in favour of student politics on the premise that from the language movement to the liberation war, universities and college campuses played a major role and we do accept that. But, we cannot endorse the reckless culture of weapons and politics of 'tender baji' that had become a main feature of student politics. We love it that a political party had the guts to say that campuses will be free of political influence but only time will say if it will be put to action or not. A party has claimed that a vested group is relentlessly trying to portray Bangladesh as a country with rising problems of radicalism and this needs to be countered. This writer also believes that the projection of the problem with fundamentalism is much more hyped than it actually is. In fact, if we look at India where villages after villages of Christians were tortured and churches burnt just a few months ago by extreme right wing factions, and women raped and killed, then, we must say that Bangladesh is an excellent example of social harmony. Of course, the government that comes to power has to ensure that Bangladesh stays a secular country; but at the same time, efforts need to be taken to fight false propaganda that harms the image of the country abroad. As this writer stated earlier, 'change' is the word of choice for all parties and it would not be wrong to assume that the party which manages to market itself best with the promises of something new will become victorious. But there is a catch. Whoever comes this time will have to work and there is no other way. Because unless they do, there is no guarantee that we won't have another 1/11. So, even if we take all the foibles of the present caretaker government into consideration we must admit that it did manage to infuse a sense of responsibility within the political parties. Like they say, you must always give the devil his due. The views expressed are the author's own
