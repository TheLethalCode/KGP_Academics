<TITLE> England to make donation to Mumbai victims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will donate half of their match fees from the first test against India starting on Thursday to the victims of last month's attacks in Mumbai, batsman Alastair Cook said on Tuesday. Reading out a team statement, Cook said the past week had been very difficult for the team and that their return to India was a "public statement in support for the Indian people following the tragic event in Mumbai." The militant attacks in India's financial capital killed at least 171 people, prompting England to cut short their one-day series and return home. "As a cricketer, first and foremost, (we are here) to win a test match series in India. The England players will pay half their match fees from the first test match to the families of the victims of the Mumbai attacks," he said. England arrived in India on Monday after security experts were satisfied of the measures put in place for the two test matches which were switched to Chennai from Ahmedabad and to Mohali (Dec. 19-23) from Mumbai. "It's probably not the ideal preparation," the left-hander said of the uncertainly surrounding the tour. "We have made a massive pact as a side this morning in our meeting when we came out with a statement, that this is it and nothing else can distract us from playing cricket individually and as a side." Cook said the situation has made the team determined to improve on the 5-0 one-day series deficit they trailed by when the final two matches were called off. "We are here now, we have a great chance to play against a very good side in India. That's the exciting challenge of playing cricket, and the one we are looking forward to. "It's all about tuning in our minds now. If you are mentally switched on you can achieve things, that's what we need to do as a side now." England team for the first test: Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen (captain), Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Matt Prior, Graeme Swann, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Monty Panesa
