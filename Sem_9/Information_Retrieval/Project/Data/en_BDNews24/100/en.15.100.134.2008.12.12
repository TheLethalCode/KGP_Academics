 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League sought to woo young and first-time voters in the manifesto party chief Sheikh Hasina rolled out on Friday morning as it promised to build a bright future for the new generation. "We dedicate our Vision-2021 to the young generation, who are enrolled as voters this year for the first time, with the aim of building a bright future for them," Hasina said in the Charter for Change 2008, that describes her targets for a 'Vision 2021'. By Election Commission estimates, the voter roll includes some 17 percent new voters this year. Hasina said her party wanted "to utilise the immense potentials of our new generation of voters" to prepare the nation to face the challenges of globalisation in this 21st century. "We have tailored our election manifesto and work programme for them," she pointed out in her address at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. "We believe the successful implementation of this work programme and Vision 2021 depends on the active participation and involvement of our young generations in the process." "By implementing this manifesto with the collective efforts of the entire nation, we will create a bright and successful future for the new generation. "We call upon them to participate in this great endeavour of national reconstruction and build a bright future for themselves as well as for generations to come," the former prime minister said. The AL chief touched on the five priority issues covered by the manifesto: economic security, anticorruption measures, energy security, eradication of poverty and good governance. Vision 2021, when Bangladesh reaches 50 years as an independent nation, will be "an instrument to end poverty", says the party. According to the 2008 voter list, there are eight crore and 10 lakh voters in the country. EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed said, according to the new voter list, some 17 percent voters will vote for the first time in the ninth parliamentary election. Citing recent census report figures, he said every year 17 to 18 lakh people reach 18 years of age, making them eligible to vote. "Under this consideration, around one crore and 35 lakh people, which is some 17 percent of total voters, have become newly eligible to vote in the last eight years," Mihir said. He added: "There are records that 95 percent of young voters go to voting centres. And it is the young voters, who are most eager to vote." bdn
