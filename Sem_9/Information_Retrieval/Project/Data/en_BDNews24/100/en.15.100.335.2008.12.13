 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) - After a nine-day Eid-ul-Azha vacation, the penultimate round four-dayer of the National Cricket League begins Sunday with national cricketers taking part for the first time in the 10th edition of first-class cricket. The national stars were outside the league due to their engagements with New Zealand and South Africa since the league got underway in October, and they will play only this round before being engaged in the home series against Sri Lanka this month and Zimbabwe in January next. Except Syed Rasel and Abdur Razzak, all cricketers will represent their respective divisional teams with third-placed Dhaka getting the highest five cricketers: Mohammad Ashraful, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Mahbubul Alam Robin, Shahadat Hossain and Nazmul Hossain in the match against hosts Khulna. Reigning champions Khulna, now at number four on the six-team points table, will also be strengthened with the inclusion of Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shakib Al Hasan and Imrul Kayes as they will miss the services of injured pacer Rasel and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, suspended by ICC for illegal bowling action. Coach Jamie Siddions and chief selector Rafiqul Alam are scheduled to visit Khulna as the highest number of national cricketers will be featured in the game. However, the main focus of the penultimate round is on Rajshahi and Chittagong venues as leaders Rajahshi host bottom-placed Sylhet while Barisal, just two points behind the leaders, face Chittagong in the port city. Selector Akram Khan is expected to remain present in Rajshahi stadium where Junaed Siddique and Naeem Islam will be in action against Musfiqur Rahim's Sylhet. Rajshahi's left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo will remain under the watchful eyes of Akram as a potential replacement for Razzak. Naimur Rahman, another selector, will visit Chittagong where Tamim Iqbal and Roqibul Hassan will play for their respective divisions  Chittagong and Barisal. Left-arm pacer Sajidul Islam, who already played five matches this season before traveling to South Africa as a replacement for Rasel, will be back in action for Barisal. bd
