<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paul Ince said Blackburn Rovers let their fans down on Saturday when another defeat left his side deep in relegation trouble. Rovers were hammered 3-0 at Wigan Athletic, their sixth consecutive defeat in all competitions making Ince one of the favourites to become the next top-flight managerial casualty. "I'm very disappointed with the players. We are hurting at this moment in time," the former England and Manchester United midfielder told Sky Sports television. "We let our fans down. Obviously they are going to voice their frustration as anyone would, and rightly so because we let them down today." Ince took over from former United team mate Mark Hughes, who is also struggling at Manchester City, in the close season after beginning his coaching career in the lower leagues. "There is no point feeling sorry for yourself, there is no point in the players feeling sorry for themselves, they have just got to keep believing," Ince said as his team remained second from bottom in the Premier League. "It is easier said than done when you are not winning games and you perform like we did in the first 45 minutes, which was very disappointing. "Everyone was buzzing in the changing room and then with 12 minutes gone we are 2-0 down and the game was gone. What can you do?"
