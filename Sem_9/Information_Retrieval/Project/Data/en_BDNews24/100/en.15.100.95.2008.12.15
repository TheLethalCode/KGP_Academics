 MILAN, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil striker Adriano will be allowed to leave Inter Milan, coach Jose Mourinho hinted on Sunday. The 26-year-old, who has gone back to Brazil to try to overcome a niggle, has upset Mourinho with his commitment at times this season and has been left out of several match squads. Italian newspapers have also continued to carry reports about his private life rather than his football. "In his place, I would consider whether it's better to stay here with this image or change scenery," Mourinho told Sky after Serie A leaders Inter beat Chievo 4-2 without the striker. Adriano, who spent part of last season on loan at Sao Paulo, would however be welcomed back if he wanted to return. "Adriano is going to Brazil because he can cure himself better in 40 degrees than in four degrees in Milan. This way he is far away from everything that's been said recently," Mourinho added. "He is happy there and will return (from the winter break) on Jan. 2 like all the others." Media reports have speculated that Inter could seek a swap deal with Mourinho's former club Chelsea for Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba
