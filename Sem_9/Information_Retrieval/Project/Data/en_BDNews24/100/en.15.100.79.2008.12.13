 TBILISI, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian troops returned on Saturday to a disputed Georgian village they vacated a day earlier near breakaway South Ossetia, pushing back Georgian security forces. Georgian police said between 500 and 600 Russian soldiers were in the village of Perevi, close to the de facto border with South Ossetia. Russian forces pulled back in October from a buffer zone adjacent to South Ossetia after a five-day war in August, but kept soldiers in Perevi, which sits on the Georgian side of the de facto border. The troops pulled out of the village on Friday. Georgian police moved in behind them, but the Russians were back by nightfall. Television pictures showed Russian soldiers unloading sandbags from a truck. Georgia has condemned the Russian presence in Perevi as a violation of the ceasefire brokered by the European Union after the war, when Russia intervened in its former Soviet neighbor to halt a Georgian assault on pro-Russian South Ossetia. EU ceasefire monitors, who took credit on Friday for the Russian withdrawal, confirmed Russian forces were in the village on Saturday, but could not say how many. Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said police had withdrawn. "The Russians kicked the police out of Perevi this morning," he said. South Ossetia accused Georgia of violating the ceasefire by deploying special forces to the boundary. "About 60 special forces soldiers were deployed to the village of Perevi directly on the border with South Ossetia," Interfax news agency quoted a South Ossetian defense ministry official as saying. "EU monitors are turning a blind eye." Pro-Western Georgia welcomed news that the Russian troops had moved 3 km (1.8 miles) east across the boundary on Friday. The village sits on a small mountain road entering South Ossetia from the west. Some of its 1,100 residents had left. South Ossetia claims the village as its own. But the EU monitors say it clearly lies outside South Ossetia's de facto borders. The monitors said Friday's pullback followed discussions with the Russian foreign ministry and military. Utiashvili said a delegation of European diplomats visiting the area on Saturday was barred from entering the village. Russia has recognized South Ossetia and another breakaway region, Abkhazia, as independent states backed by Russian military protection. The two regions threw off Tbilisi's rule in the early 1990s. Russia said it intervened in Georgia to save civilians from a Georgian military bid to retake South Ossetia after months of skirmishes and Georgian allegations of Russian provocation. The West condemned Moscow's response as disproportionate.
