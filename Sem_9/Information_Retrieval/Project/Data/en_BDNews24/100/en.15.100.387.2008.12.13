 Chittagong, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) - Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury will resume his mayoral duties in Nagar Bhaban on Sunday, after a 21 month hiatus during which he was re-elected while behind bars. "I have been carrying out my mayoral duties since the High Court stayed the order that had barred me from taking charge," the mayor told bdnews24.com. "I will attend Nagar Bhaban on Sunday." After declaration of emergency, Mohiuddin was arrested on March 7, 2007 from his residence at Chashama Hill in the city. Despite his release from detention on bail on Oct 8 this year, the ministry of local government barred him retruning to his mayoral post, issuing a notification. The High Court stayed the order upon Mohiuddin's appeal on Dec 4. But he did not attend Nagar Bhaban although he held meetings with ward councillors and other senior officials of the city corporation. Mohiuddin returned to Chittagong from Dhaka by a GMG airlines flight Saturday afternoon, landing there after performing Hajj in Saudi Arabia. On reaching the city, he inaugurated the election office of Afsarul Amin, AL's candidate for Chittagong-8 (Doublemooring), at Lalkhan Bazar. bdnew
