 BERLIN, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten-men Bayern Munich moved to the top of the Bundesliga for at least 24 hours after a battling 2-2 draw at Stuttgart on Saturday. With surprise league leaders Hoffenheim not playing until Sunday, Juergen Klinsmann's men had looked set to take full advantage after fighting from a goal down at halftime to lead 2-1. A red card for Massimo Oddo, following a lunging tackle on Stuttgart's Christian Traesch with five minutes to go, proved costly however with Sami Khedira going on to equalise for the home side one minute into stoppage time. Stuttgart's late leveller means Hoffenheim can now regain top spot going into the German winter break with a draw at home to Schalke 04 on Sunday
