 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia have promised to keep prices of essentials within people's easy reach in their manifestos, while Awami League's 'Top Five' priorities were also seen to be high on BNP's agenda. The BNP chairperson unveiled her party's electoral manifesto at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel in the city on Saturday, just a day after the AL chief rolled out hers in the same hotel. The five issues that top the AL-manifesto are economic security in the face of the global crisis and spiralling prices at home, effective anticorruption measures, power and energy security, poverty cut and good governance. The BNP manifesto has also placed these five issues high on their list. On taming prices, the AL manifesto says: Measures will be taken to reduce the unbearable burden of price hike and keep it in tune with the purchasing power of the people. After giving the highest priority to the production of domestic commodities, arrangements will be made for timely import to ensure food security. A multi-pronged drive will be made to control prices along with monitoring the market. Hoarding and profiteering syndicates will be eliminated. An institution for commodity price control and consumer protection will be set up. Above all, price reduction and stability will be achieved by bringing equilibrium between demand and supply of commodities. The BNP manifesto also putting the issue on top of their priority list says: BNP, if voted to power, would increase food production and decrease agricultural production costs through subsidies (if necessary) to get the prices of rice, flour, pulse, edible oil and other daily essentials down quickly. About the second top issue the AL manifesto says: Multi-pronged measures to fight corruption will be put into place. Powerful people will have to submit wealth statement annually. Strict measures will be taken to eliminate bribe, extortion, rent seeking and corruption. Strong measures will be taken against those having unearned and black money, against loan defaulters, tender manipulators, and users of muscle power in every stage of state and society. This issue has been placed third on the BNP agenda. The party says it will get to the sources of corruption and act tough against the corrupt. The Anticorruption Commission set up during the BNP rule will be assisted to function freely, neutrally and effectively. BNP will disclose information about the assets of all the elected MPs 30 days after swearing-in. AL manifesto has placed power and energy security at the third place while BNP has identified the issue as a fifth priority. AL's manifesto says: A comprehensive long-term policy on power and energy will be adopted. Economic usage of oil, gas, coal, hydro power, wind power and solar energy will be ensured. Big and small power generation stations, coal extraction, and oil and gas exploration will be given priority. Under a three-year crash program quick implementation of ongoing and under consideration power generation stations, import of electricity from neighbouring countries, will be undertaken. By 2011 power production will be increased to 5000 megawatt and by 2013 it will be further increased to 7000 megawatt. BNP, putting power and energy fifth, has promised that the party will be working from the very beginning to meet the deficit by implementing a transparent and effective plan for an increased power production and supply. It said it will take measures to implement the power plants aided by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japan, and also other relevant projects in the pipeline. The BNP government will also complete in the first 100 days the re-tender of the two 450 MW power plants at Sirajganj and Bibiyana. The BNP agenda include formation of a committee comprising experts within a hundred days after assuming power to best utilise oil, gas and coal for the interest of the country. The committee will suggest fuel policy and the government will act accordingly. The issue of good governance that has been placed fifth in AL manifesto has found seventeenth position on BNP's list. Both the parties have also promised to keep law and order and alleviate poverty. b
