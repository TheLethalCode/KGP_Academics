<TITLE> Pakistani umpire Rauf gets visa for England-India test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani umpire Asad Rauf will be able to supervise in next week's second test between England and India in Mohali after he was granted a visa to travel to India. "Yes I have got the visa and I will be travelling to India on Monday to supervise the test match," Rauf told Reuters on Friday. The ICC elite panel umpire could not travel to India to take charge of this week's first test in Chennai because of visa issues with the Indian consulate in Islamabad after last month's militant attacks on Mumbai which killed at least 179 people. Pakistan nationals require city-specific visas when travelling to India and Rauf was issued visas for the original test venues. The first test was moved to Chennai from Ahmedabad and the final test to Mohali (Dec. 19-23) from Mumbai. Rauf said he would travel to India without any pressure despite the ongoing tension between the two neighbouring countries. "I work for the ICC and I am paid to do my job professionally. I will not allow the current scenario between both countries to affect my work," he said. "I was looking forward to supervising this series and I will try to do my job to my best ability.
