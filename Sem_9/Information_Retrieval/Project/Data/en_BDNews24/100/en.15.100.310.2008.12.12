 Sylhet, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, seeking an unprecedented third term in office, promised to bring prices of essentials down and create new jobs in her first election rally at Lalabazar in Sylhet on Friday. Khaleda hit the campaign trail after offering prayers at the shrines of Shah Jalal, Shah Paran and Shah Borhan Uddin in the city earlier in the day. She called upon the people to vote for her party to established a government based on nationalist and Islamic values. The former prime minister pledged to make education up to degree level free and to introduce heath insurance. She termed the events of Jan. 11, 2007 a conspiracy against her party and family. "My sons were tortured. They have not recovered yet," she complained. A visibly emotional Khaleda sought people's blessings for quick recovery of her sons. She handed her party's election symbol sheaf of paddy to four-party candidate for Sylhet-3 Shafi Ahmed Chowdhury and asked people to vote for him. Her entourage includes former minister Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, Amanullah Aman, ASM Hannan Shah and Sarwari Rahman. Highlighting the developments during the previous BNP-led four-party alliance government's rule, she urged her audience, "Give the four-party alliance an opportunity to go to power for the sake of country's development and welfare of the people." "We will bring happiness to the people if the four-party alliance is voted to power," the former prime minister added. Khelafat Majlish chairman Moulana Mohammad Ishak, BNP standing committee member Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, former state minister Amanullah Aman also spoke. Earlier, she reached the Sylhet Circuit House around 12:15pm. Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former lawmaker M Ilias Ali, Shafi Ahmed Chowhdury, Dildar Hossain Selim and other BNP leaders welcomed Khaleda at the circuit house. Khaleda was cheered on by thousands of BNP leaders and supporters who lined the roads she took. Khaleda's motorcade started for Sylhet, the country's 'spiritual capital', from her Dhaka Cantonment residence around 8:35am, accompanied by her vice-president Sarwari Rahman and others. Khaleda had also started her campaign in the previous election years from the city. Seated in her car, Khaleda waved hands to the cheering supporters at Ittefaq intersection, Sayedabad, Jatrabari, Demra, Matuail, Kanchpur Bridge, Sonargaon, Narsingdi, Bhairab, Brahminbaria, Habiganj, Moulavibazar, Goalabazar and other places. "She will speak at eight public rallies on Friday, the first day of her campaign, after paying respects at the three shrines," said Maruf Kamal Khan, chief of Khaleda's information cell. The former prime minister is scheduled to address rallies at South Surma College, Doyamir field in Osmani Nagar, Aushkandi High School in Nabiganj, Mirpur Ali Sobhan College at Bahubal, Habiganj Municipality field, Madhabpur Pilot High School and Brahmanbaria College. She is scheduled to announce that party's election manifesto on Saturday at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel at 4pm. Awami League president Sheikh Hasina paid her respects at the three shrines on Thursday. Addressing a second rally at the Doyamir Math under Osmani Nagar, Khaleda asked the people to vote for the BNP-led four-party alliance candidate, M Ilias Ali, for Sylhet-2. She termed the polls symbol of the sheaf of paddy the sign of development, independence and sovereignty. "The caretaker government has taken the country backwards by 20 years," she said. "[During its tenure], unemployment has risen and no development work has been carried out." The country is now steeped in corruption, hawkers have been forced off from the streets and slums evicted in the last two years, she said. "Rice and oil are now selling for Tk 40 and Tk 130 respectively," said the former prime minister and promised that if BNP went to power, the price of essentials would be brought down. Khaleda also expressed her respect for MAG Ataul Gani Osmani, the commander-in-chief of Bangladesh in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Terming the people behind 1/11 conspirators, she said, "If we are united then all conspiracy will be destroyed. "On Nov 7 soldiers and the people saved this country and today, by ensuring the victory of the nationalist and the Islamic powers, the conspirators need to be defeated." She also said during the famine in 1974, there was no democracy in Bangladesh. "It was [late] president Ziaur Rahman who made the country self reliant in the food sector," she observed. She addressed a third rally at the Ali Sobhan College field under Bahubal upazila in Habiganj and ranted against the caretaker government. She sought votes for four-party alliance candidate Sujat Mian for the Habiganj-1 constituency. In the evening, the BNP chief addressed rallies at Shaestaganj, Madhabpur, Baniachang and Habiganj. She introduced Abul H Mohammad Mubin Chowdhury for Habiganj-3, Dr. AM Shakhawat Hossain for Habigang-2 and SM Faisal for Habiganj-4 to the electorate and asked them to vote for them. "To counter the ongoing conspiracy in the country, people must vote for the BNP-led four-party alliance." She said if BNP went to power the price of fertiliser would be reduced and subsidy given to agricultural products and insecticide. If the election was free and fair, she hoped, the four-party alliance would be back in power. Of the four seats in Habiganj, Khaleda addressed two rallies in Habiganj-2 and Habiganj-3. The seat of former finance minister SAMS Kibria is among them. The four-party candidate for the seat is Abul H Mohammad Mubin Chowdhury. In the 2001 election, Awami League swept all four seats at stake in Habiganj. bdnews24.com/s
