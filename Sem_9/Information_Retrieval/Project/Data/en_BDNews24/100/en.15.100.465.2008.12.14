 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  The nation commemorated its martyred intellectuals on Sunday, as calls to stop war criminals from seeking and being voted to power grow louder ahead of the general election just weeks away. The day is observed in remembrance of the prominent academics, writers, journalists and doctors among those intellectuals systematically killed on this day in 1971. Pakistani forces and their collaborators eliminated the brightest of the nation foreseeing their own defeat towards the end of the independence struggle. The state observes the day as Martyred Intellectuals Day. Different political, cultural and social organisations commemorated the day by paying tributes at the Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard at Mirpur and the Rayerbazar killing field where many of the intellectuals were taken prior to their 'disappearance'. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed offered wreaths at the graveyard at 7:15am. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Advocate Akhter Hamid Siddiqui also laid wreaths. Disabled freedom fighters followed them. The public also paid their respects to the martyred intellectuals. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, before heading for Khulna, went to the graveyard to pay tribute. Awami League president Sheikh Hasina could not visit the place this year due to illness. As Khaleda was over half an hour late in reaching the graveyard, security personnel kept the entrance off-limits to public on security grounds barring many people from paying their respects until her arrival and departure. Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain, Worker's Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon and BSD convenor AFM Mahbubul Alam and many others expressed discontent with the incident. "We came here to pay tribute to martyred intellectuals, not to see any VIP," said Dr Kamal. "The distress of so many people are not expected for one, this is wrong," he said. Rayerbazar killing field was also crowded with people paying their respects on the day. Many intellectuals were led away from home, shot dead and their bodies left at Rayerbazar. bdnews24
