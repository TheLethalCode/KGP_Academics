 Faridpur, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Sunday reiterated his call for a social movement against what he said was "pervasive corruption" in the country. "This is the time to speak up against corruption. Corruption won't be stopped if we remain tightlipped. Corruption won't be gone in a day because of a human chain," Chowdhury told a discussion meeting on resisting corruption, in Faridpur town. The ACC boss asked people to wage a social movement against "pervasive corruption". He stressed the need to work together to stop corruption. "We have to be non-violent and respectful to laws and rules," he said. Chowdhury said the ACC planned to carry out an intensive anticorruption programme through the next six months. bdnews2
