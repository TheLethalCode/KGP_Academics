 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Under-19 team Monday clinched the one-dayer series title when they handed a three-wicket defeat to the Nepal Under-19 in the third and final match at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground. It was a build-up series for both sides ahead of next month's ICC U/19 World Cup in Malaysia. The hosts beat the visitors in the first match before the second one was abandoned due to inclement weather. Nepal, who decided to bat first winning the toss, managed 109 all out in 38.1 overs after the final match was reduced to a 39-over-a-side affair due to wet outfield. Pushpa (25) and Parash (17) were remarkable scorers for the visitors. Suhrawardi Shuvo (3/9) and Rubel Hossain (3/19) shared six wickets while Shakil Haider took two wickets for 14 to wreck the opponents innings. In reply, the hosts also faced hiccup and lost seven wickets before reaching 113 in 36 overs with Rubel remaining unbeaten on 14. Mithun Ali topscored with 30 while Mahmudul Hasan chipped in with 19.
