 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com) The Akheri Munajat of the Biswa Ijtema, scheduled for Sunday, has been brought forward and is to be held at 8 pm Friday, according to Tongi municipality chairman. Advocate Azmat Ullah told bdnews24.com that inclement weather had compelled the organisers to call an early end to the gathering. Considering the devotees' sufferings, the elders of the managing committee decided to hold the Akheri Munajat Friday night. The three-day Bishwa Ijtema is to end early, due to cold weather, said Tongi municipality chairman Ajmatullah Friday. The akheri monajaat to be held at 8pm will wrap up the congregation after less than a day of devotions. Bishwa Iztema, the second largest Muslim congregation in the world, began Friday after Jummah prayers at Tongi near the capital. The annual three-day iztema has been drawing the largest number of Muslims, after the hajj, from all over the world since 1967. The organisers of the 2008 Bishwa Iztema expected that about 2.2 million devotees will be gathering at the Tongi iztema grounds during the three-day religious event.
