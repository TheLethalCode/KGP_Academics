<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Housing and public works adviser Ghulam Quader said Monday that dialogue with political parties should address the post-election as well as the pre-election situation. "If the country goes back to pre-1/11, it will not be a good sign," the adviser told reporters at his office. "This issue should be resolved in the dialogue between the government and the political parties," he said. Asked whether such dialogue with the political parties would be a part of the government's 'exit plan', Quader said: "I don't think so." "The political parties wanted to have dialogues. The chief adviser will solve various problems having talks with them. Dialogues will be arranged on that basis." Asked about the previous day's High Court ruling requiring the EC to explain why the delay in holding elections should not be declared illegal, the adviser said: "The Election Commission will reply to this." "We have nothing to do with it as the commission is responsible for holding elections," Ghulam added. "We hope that the EC will hold elections within a 'reasonable time'," the adviser said, adding however: "That doesn't mean that it will hold the election without completing the voter listing." Earlier in the day, a special taskforce appointed to investigate Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha had handed the adviser an investigation report on irregularities within Rajuk. The adviser said a sub-committee would be formed to take necessary actions after examining the report. On corruption within Rajuk, Quader said: "The taskforce has been formed to take actions against any irregularities." "It will do its job in line with law," he added. bdnews24
