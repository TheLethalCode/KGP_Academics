 PARIS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday that Societe Generale, hit by $7 billion in losses from rogue trades, was not under any pressure to merge with another bank. "Societe Generale is under no constraint to merge with another financial company," Lagarde told France 2 television. The trader blamed for the scandal, 31-year-old Jerome Kerviel, remained in custody, helping an investigation into how he kept his supervisors in the dark while losses piled up, prosecutors said. Kerviel handed himself in on Saturday. Lagarde's statement is the latest sign that France's establishment is rallying round to SocGen's defence in an attempt to stave off talk that a foreign rival might launch a takeover bid for the company as its market value sinks. A top adviser to President Nicolas Sarkozy warned on Sunday the government would probably intervene if raiders made a move. "I don't think the state would remain with its arms crossed if someone, whoever the predator, tried to take advantage of the situation,"Henri Guaino told French television. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has openly expressed his frustration with SocGen's managers for not giving him more warning that problems were brewing at the bank. SocGen's shares opened 4 percent lower on Monday after Citigroup said the French bank's franchise was "severely impaired." The bank's chairman, Daniel Bouton, who last week offered to leave but was asked to stay on by the board, said on Monday his resignation remained on the table, suggesting he may feel he has to go as criticism mounts of his handling of the crisis. LAWYER SAYS KERVIEL SET FOR "LYNCHING" Kerviel's new lawyer said he had been doing a trader's job by taking on risk, and accused the bank of setting him up for a public "lynching" by letting him carry all the blame. "He has not embezzled anyone, he hasn't taken a cent for himself and he was just doing his job as best he could," Christian Charriere-Bournazel told Reuters. Four days after stunning world finance with news that a lone, lowly trader had punched a hole in its compliance systems and forced the bank to seek a lifeline of new capital, SocGen set out in detail how it says he took dizzying risks undetected. Like rogue trader Nick Leeson who sank Britain's Barings bank in 1995, the picture that emerged from Kerviel's employer on Sunday was of a young man trained by his own bank to detect fraud and then using these skills to work around controls. Both tried to cover up for bad trading decisions by doubling their bets and waiting for the market to turn in their favour. The similarities do not end there. Both were involved in arbitrage -- taking advantage of price differences between markets -- on stock index futures and covered their tracks by juggling real deals against fake ones with fictitious people, according to the results of a forensic data search at SocGen. BAFFLED The bank says it remains baffled as to why one of its more junior trading staff put his career and the bank at risk. "We don't know, we don't understand and it will be for the legal inquiry to find out," corporate and investment banking chief Jean-Pierre Mustier said. Kerviel was paid to exploit tiny and momentary discrepancies in prices of very similar stock market instruments. To make money on this, the bank has to wager big volumes but the risk is usually small because each transaction is balanced with an equal and opposite one, locking in a tiny layer of profit. The bank alleges its staffer created fictitious accounts to make it look as though his aggressive and ill-fated bets that European shares would rise had been covered. The bank remained unwittingly open to the risk prices would fall, and they did. Although SocGen prides itself on state-of-the-art finance using mathematical models, its rogue trader was using "very simple instruments" as a vehicle for his deals, which he then hid using high-tech smoke and mirrors, according to Mustier. He was able to get away with it partly because SocGen's risk systems do not check up on unregulated over-the-counter contracts straight away if no deposit is required, the bank said. The bank also defended itself from accusations that its move to unwind the trade distorted the market and might have inadvertently triggered a cut in US interest rat
