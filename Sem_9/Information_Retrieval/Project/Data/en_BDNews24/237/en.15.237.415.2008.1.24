 HYDERABAD, Pakistan, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Nasir Jamshed smashed a fluent 74 to help Pakistan pull off an unconvincing five-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the second one-day international on Thursday. Chasing 239 for victory, flamboyant all-rounder Shahid Afridi came to Pakistan's rescue with a powerful 43 not out from 27 balls after Zimbabwe had reduced the hosts to 178 for five in the 38th over. Afridi, who struck four boundaries and two sixes, and Mohammad Yousuf (38 not out) added 61 from 52 balls in an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership to guide Pakistan home with 22 balls to spare at the Niaz stadium. Several dropped catches also contributed towards Zimbabwe's second defeat in the five-match series. Afridi was let off on 32 and 36, Yousuf on 29 and Jamshed was dropped on six and 72 on a flat batting pitch. Zimbabwe removed opener Salman Butt early on when he was caught behind by Tatenda Taibu for 17 off Elton Chigumbura. Jamshed produced some explosive shots as he and Younis Khan (35) put on a free flowing 95 from 80 balls. The left hander, who scored a half-century on his debut one-day outing in Karachi on Monday, continued his hot streak as he smashed 14 fours in his 64-ball knock. When Jamshed and Younis were both run out within a space of four balls in the 21st over, Zimbabwe raised hopes of an upset victory. Jamshed was beaten by a return throw from bowler Ray Price, while a direct throw from Vusi Sibanda from square leg sent Younis back to the pavilion. Pakistan also lost skipper Shoaib Malik (4) when he was stumped off Price, who bowled an excellent spell to concede 21 runs in his 10 overs. Misbah-ul-Haq struggled for his 20 before he was caught in the deep by Brendan Taylor off Hamilton Masakadza to leave Pakistan requiring 61 from 75 balls. Earlier, left arm pacer Sohail Tanvir produced his best bowling figures of 4-34 to restrict Zimbabwe despite half centuries from Masakadza (87) and Taibu (81). Following the match, Pakistan made two changes for the third one dayer in Multan. Uncapped players -- opener Khalid Latif and fast bowler Sohail Khan -- were brought into the squad in place of fast bowler Samiullah Niazi and wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed
