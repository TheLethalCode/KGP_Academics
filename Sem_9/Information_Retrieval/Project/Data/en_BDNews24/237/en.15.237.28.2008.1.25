 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has quashed the case against businessman and former MP Nazim Kamran Choudhury  husband of former industries adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury  and eight others on charges of forcible occupation of their landlords' property. The court quashed the case on Jan 13 on the basis of the report of the investigating officer as the allegations were not proved. bdnews24.com obtained the details of the court order on Friday. One of the defendants Abu Rushd Tarek told bdnews24.com on Friday: "An impartial investigation found no truth to the allegations made in the case." Tarek is Geeteara's younger brother and a director of the advertising firm Adcomm. The other accused included top executives and employees of Signage, Megavision as well as Adcomm. Farhana Islam, wife of Mahbub Ul Islam, filed the case on Nov 14, 2007. The complainant said tenant Nazim Kamran Choudhury and others had been occupying the Islams' property at Road No 41, Gulshan-2, after the expiry of the five-year rental agreement. She also alleged that from 5 pm to 5.30 pm on Oct 22, the accused persons forcibly brought a generator onto the premises, against the house owners' objections. While doing so, she alleged, the accused persons manhandled her and assaulted her with a sharp weapon. The court directed the officer-in-charge of Gulshan Police Station to investigate the case. Gulshan police sub-inspector Md Sharif Uddin Bhuiyan submitted his investigation report on Dec 3 last year. The report said the people in the neighbourhood had witnessed the altercation over the generator. Two persons had been made witnesses in the case, but neither of them showed up. The report said the complainant failed to prove the charges. Dr Mahbub ul Islam had rented the house for a five year period to three firms owned by Geeteara Safiya and Nazim Kamran, a former BNP MP elected in 1979. Just days before the expiry of the rental deal, the landlords on June 27 last year issued a notice to the tenants to leave the house. But after a verbal agreement about renewal of the deal with Adcomm director Abu Rushd Tarek, the accused did not leave the property, the investigation report said. The other defendants in the case were: Shamsunnahar Tarek, Mukim Choudhury, Shahadat Hossain Shahadat, Adit Bhagat, Ripon, Bipul and Yar Ali. bdne
