 Nairobi, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition leader Raila Odinga called on Friday for the African Union (AU) to avoid endorsing President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election at its upcoming summit in Ethiopia. "We don't think that AU should recognise a government that is illegitimate. It would be setting a very bad precedent, that the AU is condoning rigging of elections in Africa," Odinga told reporters at a news conference with a Libyan special envoy. The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader said Kibaki should not be allowed to send a delegation to the Jan. 31-Feb. 2 meeting given the controversy over his re-election. The pan-African body has not pronounced on the legitimacy of Kibaki's position, although it has expressed concern over the violence. Analysts think the AU will avoid a controversial stance, and will not object to the presence of Kibaki or a delegation on his behalf. "The fact of the matter is that Mr Mwai Kibaki lost the election and is enforcing himself against the wishes of the people of Kenya," Odinga added. "We don't recognise him as the president of this country.
