 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  The first invitational match between Sonali Otit Club and Kalkata Veterans Sports Club Thursday ended in a goalless draw at Bangabandhu National Stadium. It was more of a get-together for former football stars from both sides of the Bengal than a competitive match where the players hardly moved amid chilly conditions on a rain-soaked pitch. The home side that included retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed, Salam Murshidi, Josy, Satyajit Das Rupu, Sabbir, Kaiser Hamid, Bablu, Khurshid Babul and Roxy enjoyed superior ball possession in the 60-minute match. There was no trademark run of Josy down the left, but the veteran winger produced a couple of scoring opportunities only to be denied by Indian goalkeeper Shanti Majumder. A bulky Kaiser Hamid along with Montu and Bablu marshalled the defence with the Indians comprising former players from Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, Mohammedan Sporting Club and Bengal hardly troubling them. Hafizuddin played in the first five minutes while lanky medio Manik ran throughout the game. The Kolkata veterans will be up against Chittagong Sonali Otit Club in the second match on Saturday at MA Aziz Stadium in the port city. b
