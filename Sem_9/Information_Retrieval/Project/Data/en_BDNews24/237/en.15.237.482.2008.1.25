 Boca Raton, Florida, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican Mitt Romney questioned on Thursday whether rival John McCain understood the US economy as the candidates sought advantage in Florida in the race for the US presidential nomination. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts who needs a victory in Florida on Tuesday, said during a high-stakes debate that Arizona Sen. McCain was wrong to vote against tax cuts during President George W Bush's first term. Romney and McCain are in a tight race in Florida. The winner could gain important momentum going into the campaign for 22 state contests on Feb. 5. Romney, who won Michigan's vote by questioning McCain's judgment on the economy, said McCain should not have voted against the tax cuts. McCain now supports making those tax cuts permanent. "I think he should have voted for them the first time around," Romney said at the NBC debate. "And that's just a difference of viewpoint." He added: "As we face tough times, we need to have somebody who understands, if you will, has the private sector, has the business world, has the economy in their DNA. I do. I spent my life in the private sector. I know how jobs come and I know how they go." McCain responded that he had opposed the tax cuts because he wanted to cut federal spending simultaneously and that if that had been done, "we would be talking about more tax cuts today." "I'm very proud of my record," McCain said, calling it "a consistent record of being a fiscal conservative." Most of the candidates backed a $150 billion fiscal stimulus plan agreed on by Bush and leaders of the US House of Representatives on Thursday but said it should be only the beginning, that more tax cuts are needed to help re-energize the ailing US economy. "I hope this will be the beginning of a dialogue," said former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has staked his candidacy on winning Florida and according to the most recent polls, is tied with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for third place. Huckabee, who has barely enough funds to campaign in Florida, raised some questions about the stimulus. "One of the concerns that I have is that we'll probably end up borrowing $150 billion from the Chinese," he said. "And when we get those rebate checks most people are going to go out and buy stuff that's been imported from China. I have to wonder whose economy will be stimulated the most by the package.
