 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com) - Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan has said he will go public with recommendations if the government fails to implement them. Khan has said people's responses to the need for reforms to the country's ancient rules and regulations are far from adequate. "Responses are lukewarm," he said, as he opened a new office of the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) at Karwan Bazar Saturday. "It has been quite some time since the commission started working. I sought proposals for reforms or changes to the old rules and regulations from different quarters, including businessmen and professionals." Khan said he took the reins of the commission at the request of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. "I have long been toying with the idea of reforming the old and outdated rules and regulations. I took up the job thinking that the country will benefit from the effort." Khan said: "Time is short and resources are limited. I may not be able to do all the work. But I'll make my best effort." "Good proposals are not enough. The most important thing is to implement them." "On behalf of the commission, I will keep sending recommendations to the government. If the government does not implement them, I will make them public." The former bureaucrat said the country has huge potential to tap into information technology to create more jobs. "Unemployment is our biggest problem. Creating jobs must be at the centre of attention." "More jobs will help ensure good democracy too. Unemployment cuts could contribute to poverty alleviation and protecting human rights," Khan said. BASIS president Rafiqul Islam Rowly and senior vice-president M Shoeb Chowdhury also spoke. bdnews24.
