<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division Thursday halted a previous stay by the High Court on proceedings of the charges of extortion against Sheikh Hasina, filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. It means the trial will go on in the court of metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque. A bench of the Appellate Division chaired by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim made the rule. Attorney general Fida M Kamal told bdnews24.com: "The Appellate Division has stayed the HC order. Now the trial will continue." Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-Ul Huq also said so. "The Appellate Division has stayed the HC order. Now the case proceedings in the trial court will continue alongside the hearing in the High Court," he said. The HC Wednesday began hearing the writ petition that has challenged the trial of the charges under emergency powers rules. Azam Chowdhury filed the case on June 13, 2007. During the hearing in front of the HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam, Hasina's counsel argued that it was in no way appropriate to try the case under EPR. Barrister Shafique Ahmed pointed out that the alleged extortion was dated before a state of emergency was imposed in the country. The lawyer added that applying the Emergency Powers Ordinance to an incident that took place a long time ago contradicted the ordinance itself. On Jan 17, the HC had stayed the proceedings of the case until the legitimacy of trying the case under EPR was settled. On Jan 21, the government appealed against the HC order, and the Appellate Division set a new date for proceedings to continue. Hasina was arrested and detained on July 16, 2007. bdnews24.com
