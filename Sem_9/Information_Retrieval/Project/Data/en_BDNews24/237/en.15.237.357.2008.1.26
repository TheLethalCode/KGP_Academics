 GEORGETOWN, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen shot and killed 11 people in village in Guyana early on Saturday, prompting residents angry over gang violence to block roads with burning debris. President Bharrat Jagdeo said the leaders of the massacre in the village of Lusignan, 11 miles (18 km) east of the capital Georgetown, were linked to gunmen who attacked police headquarters in Georgetown on Friday night. The small South American country suffers from rampant violence by roving gangs often linked to drug trafficking. "These are animals and we have to hunt them down," Jagdeo said in a news conference broadcast on state television. He said the gang members were seeking to "spread terror" on Guyana's eastern coast and the killings were an attempt to inflame ethnic tensions between Guyanese of African and Indian descent. The Lusignan victims included women and children, some of them still in bed. Jagdeo said police and troops had been sent to the area to capture the gunmen and restore public order after angry residents protested by blocking roads. He urged people to remain calm and not take retaliatory actions. Police and the army urged people to avoid roads in the area of Lusignan while they restored order.
