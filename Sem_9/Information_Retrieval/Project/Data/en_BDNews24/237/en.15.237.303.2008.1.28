 PARIS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell on Monday as recession fears once again hit equity markets worldwide and as shares in Societe Generale, downgraded by Citigroup, tumbled further. Energy shares were among the biggest laggards, falling along with crude oil prices. Royal Dutch Shell was down 2.4 percent, Total down 2.6 percent and Repsol down 2.3 percent. Mining shares also dropped alongside base metal prices. BHP Billiton shed 3 percent, and Rio Tinto fell 2.8 percent. Xstrata moved into the opposite direction, up 3.3 percent after the company raised its estimate of the amount of copper at one of its mines and on news of a possible takeover bid from Brazilian mining group Vale. By 0952 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.6 percent at 1,309.65 points and the outlook for Wall Street was bleak with US stock index futures down between 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent. The index has fallen 13 percent so far in 2008 and is down nearly 20 percent since reaching a multi-year high last summer. Banking shares also took a beating, with the DJ Stoxx bank index losing 1.8 percent. Citigroup cut Societe Generale to "sell" from "buy" in the wake of the bank's massive trader fraud news, sending the stock down 7.4 percent. "Fraud losses of 4.9 billion euros and fixed income risk provisions of 2 billion euros have severely impaired SG's franchise. The 5.5 billion-euro rights issue is set to come at a deep discount, diluting earnings," Citigroup analyst Kimon Kalamboussis wrote in a note. SocGen's stock is down 58 percent from its 52-week high reached last April. Shares in Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis bucked the trend, jumping 7 percent after saying on Sunday its 2007 profit could take a 1 billion euros ($1.47 billion) hit, depending on the valuation models it will choose to assess the value of its subprime portfolio. The stock had dropped sharply on Friday on market talk of a profit warning. The fall on European bourses followed a drop in shares in Asia with Japan losing around 4 percent and Hong Kong down more than 6 percent. "The sharp decline on Asian stock markets overnight really set the tone," said Jean Claude Petit, head of equities at Barclays Wealth Managers France. "Comments from Goldman Sachs that Japan may already be in recession is worrisome, because together the Japanese and the US economies are a big chunk of the world's economy," he said. Goldman Sachs said in a research report that the chances of the Japanese economy entering a recession in the first half of this year have risen to nearly 60 percent. "We can't deny that the market has now tipped into bear territory. The question is now to see if aggressive measures by the Fed and the US administration will be enough to shield the US economy from a downturn." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 1.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 1.1 percent and France's CAC 40 down 1.3 perce
