<TITLE> Indonesia`s Suharto in `very critical` state: doctors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The health of Indonesia's former president Suharto, who ruled for more than three decades, has deteriorated sharply again and he is in very critical condition, his doctors told a news conference on Sunday. Suharto, 86, was rushed to hospital on Jan. 4 suffering from various heart, lung and kidney problems. He has been in critical condition for much of that time although his health has fluctuated daily. However, on Sunday, his doctors said Suharto had suffered from multiple organ failure. "His condition this morning is very critical. He is 100 percent breathing with a respiratory machine," said Mardjo Soebiandono, the head of the medical team. "This is worse than before," he said, when asked how Suharto's condition compared to earlier declines. Suharto's long rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability, but the country also suffered massacres, human rights abuses and endemic corruption. Suharto's illness has fuelled a debate over whether to push ahead with legal action against him for graft. After Suharto quit office in 1998 amid mass protests, he was charged with embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars of state funds. Authorities later dropped the criminal case because of his poor health, although he faces a civil case related to the use of state funds by his charities. Suharto and his family deny any wrongdoing.
