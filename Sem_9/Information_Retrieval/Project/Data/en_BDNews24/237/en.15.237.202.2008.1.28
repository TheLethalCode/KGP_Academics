 BEIJING, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China is taking the right steps to crack down on intellectual copyright infringement, though progress will take time, a senior European Union official said on Monday. China is the main source of counterfeit goods found in the bloc, which has caused political tension between the two enormous trading partners. In November, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson angered Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi by mentioning the high proportion of fakes from China being found in the EU in a speech in Beijing at which Wu was present.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the trade in pirated consumer goods has reached $200 billion a year, equivalent to 2 percent of world trade, with many fakes coming from China. Washington has also expressed its displeasure with Beijing numerous times over the problem. Still, Kovacs said China and the EU were in agreement in another area over which Brussels differs from Washington -- a US law requiring foreign ports to scan every container headed to the United States. Kovacs has said previously that the law would be costly to implement, generate a false sense of security and cause huge trade problems if it takes effect as planned in 2012. The United States imports about 12 million containers filled with goods every year. Many older European ports would have to make big investments in infrastructure to accommodate scanning equipment for 20- or 40-foot steel containers. "It is good to know that China, which is one of the major players in international trade, has the same concerns, the same position," Kovacs said, without elaborati
