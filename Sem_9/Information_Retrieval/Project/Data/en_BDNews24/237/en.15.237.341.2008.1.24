 MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com Reuters) - Unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga pulled off a stunning upset to beat second seed Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-3 6-2 in the Australian Open semi-finals on Thursday. The world number 38 simply blew the Spaniard off court in just under two hours to reach his first grand slam final. Tsonga came out with all guns blazing, peppering Nadal with a barrage of booming serves and groundstrokes to take the opening set in 32 minutes. Nadal was rattled but the second set went with serve until the Spaniard cracked again in the eighth game, Tsonga mixing up his shots cleverly to frustrate the three-times French Open champion. Tsonga broke Nadal's serve in the third game of the third set and again in the seventh to surge into Sunday's final in which he will play top seed Roger Federer or third seed Novak Djokovic, who meet in the second semi-final on Friday
