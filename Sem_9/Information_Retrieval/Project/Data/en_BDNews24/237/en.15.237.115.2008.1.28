<TEXT>
 Solo, Indonesia, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Indonesia's royal city of Solo on Monday as the body of autocratic former president Suharto arrived for a state funeral. Ousted in 1998 in a student-led protest amid social and economic chaos, Suharto died in hospital on Sunday aged 86 after suffering multiple organ failure. He leaves a controversial legacy to his 32 years in power. Praised my many as a visionary who helped modernise his country, he was also heavily criticised for the corruption and human rights abuses that flourished under his rule His body arrived at Solo, in central Java, on Monday morning to be buried at the Suharto family mausoleum at Giribangun, 35 km (21 miles) northeast of the city. Tens of thousands of people, many with handycams and cellphone cameras in their hands, lined the streets of Solo leading to the airport and the cemetery waiting to see the former president's funeral procession. Some waved as the hearse went by. Others threw flowers. The Solo airport was closed to civilians, but Hadi Wiyanto, 48, from Yogyakarta sneaked in from the rear gate, to see Suharto's coffin arrive. "I would love to see him for the last time. I can't go to Giribangun, so I'd rather catch him here," Wiyanto said. "He was a very good president. He cared for his people." Security was tight at the family mausoleum where dozens of soldiers and police stood guard near blue and white tents erected for the stream of officials and dignitaries who had started arriving for the funeral. Antara reported two tonnes of jasmine flowers and 100 kg of red roses have been prepared for the funeral ceremony. Earlier in Jakarta, about 400 soldiers and police stood guard in the streets around Suharto's house as his coffin, draped in the national flag, was carried out to be flown to Solo for the funeral. DEBATE OVER LEGACY Figures from around the region, including Malaysia's former leader Mahathir Mohammad, as well as Australia's former prime minister Paul Keating and Attorney-General Robert McClelland, were due to attend the funeral. Suharto's admission to hospital in critical condition earlier this month sparked a national debate over his legacy. Some Indonesians argued his errors should be forgiven, others urged the state to press ahead with a civil suit against him for graft, and to consider legal proceedings for human rights abuses. Despite his humiliating overthrow in 1998, many of the region's leaders and Indonesia's elite had rushed to his bedside to pay their respects as he lay dying. Singapore's former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew flew to Jakarta to see him, paying tribute to Suharto's role in bringing stability to the region, particularly during the Cold War period. At the family mausoleum, police and soldiers lined the streets, and flags flew at half-mast. "We will miss Pak Harto," said Sugito, a taxi driver, referring to Suharto by his common title and nickname. "He was a good president. He understood little people like us. Under Pak Harto, basic commodities were cheap. But the present government wants to lift all subsidies. Pak Harto built roads but now they don't even fix broken roads." Suharto rose to power after he led the military in 1965 against what was officially called an attempted communist coup. Up to 500,000 people were killed in an anti-communist purge in the months that followed. Over the next three decades, Suharto's armed forces committed numerous human rights abuses, killing student activists, criminals, and opponents to the regime in the rebellious provinces of Aceh and Papua, as well as in East Timor, which Indonesia invaded in 1975.
