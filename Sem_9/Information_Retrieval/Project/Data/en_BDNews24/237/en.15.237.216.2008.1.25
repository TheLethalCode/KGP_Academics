 Davos, Switzerland, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni appealed to international businesses on Thursday to cut links with Iran in response to the threat she said the Islamic Republic posed to the Middle East. "Iran is a central threat which undermines moderate regimes. Iran supports terrorism, denies the Holocaust and calls for Israel to be wiped off the map and will do everything to undermine our efforts for peace," Livni said. "So Iran is a global threat. Iran can be stopped by you," Livni told business leaders and politicians in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. "You can make the change. Tremendous power is gathered in this room," Livni said. "Decide to divest from Iran. That can stop Iran." Iran is locked in a dispute with world powers over its nuclear programme. The West accuses Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons but Iran insists its development is for peaceful power generation only. Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, also attending the meeting, declined to comment on Livni's appeal. The two ministers passed within a few yards of each other after Livni spoke but neither acknowledged the other's presence. Israel is widely believed to be the only state in the Middle East with an atomic arsenal. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said he would consider all options to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons, a message his government stressed to George W Bush when the US president visited Jerusalem a week ago. Foreign ministers of major powers agreed in Berlin on Tuesday for a third sanctions resolution against Iran because of its continued programme of uranium enrichment. But diplomats said the draft did not contain the tough punitive economic measures that Washington had been pushing for and Iranian leaders vowed to press on with the nuclear work. In a conciliatory note after weeks of anti-Iranian rhetoric by the Bush administration, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States had no desire for Iran to be a permanent enemy. Rice told delegates in Davos on Wednesday she believed the nuclear standoff could be resolved diplomatically and offered the prospect of normal ties with Tehran if it gave up sensitive nuclear work
