<TITLE> China lets first US warship into HK since row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has allowed a U.S. warship to dock in Hong Kong waters for the first time since a diplomatic tiff flared when Beijing denied a request for another ship, the USS Kitty Hawk, to stop in the territory in November. A source at the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said the USS Blue Ridge was allowed to enter Hong Kong waters on Monday morning. "We granted permission in line with our usual practices," said the source, who declined to be named. The Blue Ridge, the flagship of the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, was expected to dock in Hong Kong for several days to allow rest and recreation for hundreds of its sailors. The port visit is the first by a U.S. navy ship since the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier and its strike group were refused permission by Beijing to dock in Hong Kong for a long-planned Thanksgiving holiday visit in November. Beijing later said the ships could dock, but by then the Kitty Hawk and its strike group were heading back to Japan. Earlier that month, two U.S. minesweepers, low on fuel and facing bad weather, were also denied permission to visit -- in a move criticised by the head of the U.S. forces in the Pacific, Admiral Timothy Keating. Last week, he said the Kitty Hawk had not obtained final permission from China before setting off from its base in Japan. Beijing said the whole affair had been a misunderstanding. But some analysts say China's actions may have been prompted by irritation over U.S. plans to help Taiwan upgrade its missile system and a meeting between President George W. Bush and exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
