<TITLE> Stocks rise on relief over US outlook, bonds fall </TITLE>

 Singapore, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks in Asia extended gains to more than 4 percent on Friday as a US tax stimulus package, reassuring jobs data and the prospect of another Federal Reserve rate cut eased fears the world's top economy will slide into recession. Banking shares shrugged off an astounding $7 billion rogue trader scandal at French bank Societe Generale and energy stocks also jumped as oil prices recovered on waning recession fears. Japanese government bond futures had their sharpest fall in a year and a half as a third straight day of gains in the Nikkei while gold and platinum both hit record highs. Europe's stock markets were tipped rise with financial bookmakers predicting Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 to open 1-1.3 percent higher. US stock index futures pointed to modest gains on Wall Street later. Global stock markets tumbled earlier this week as fears mounted that the US economy was heading towards recession, before recovering on hopes policy makers were acting to blunt the worst effects of a slowdown. Analysts said SocGen's unwinding of its position may have contributed to the slide. "It looks like the trading loss at Societe Generale indeed played a role in the steep fall in European markets on Monday," said Kim Jeong-hwan, a strategist at Woori Investment & Securities in Seoul. "Unlike previous mortgage-related writedowns by big banks, this one is not a structural loss, so investors are taking a relief. What investors are most fearful is uncertainty, rather than an accidental loss the size of which has been already identified, albeit huge." Stocks in Tokyo, Sydney and Seoul extended gains to 1.5 to 3.5 percent to claw back all or much of this week's losses. MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan rose 4.5 percent by 0613 GMT, paring year-to-date losses to around 10 percent. President George W Bush and congressional leaders agreed on Thursday on a $150 billion package of tax rebates and business incentives meant to ward off a recession in the world's largest economy. Although the idea did little to revive Wall Street when it was touted last week, the fact that an swift agreement was met gave investors confidence, as did weekly US jobless claims, which fell to a four-month low. SOCGEN SHOCKER Among banks, Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Australia's Macquarie Group rose nearly 8 percent, shrugging off news that a trader at Societe Generale was accused of racking up a $7 billion loss in bad bets on stocks in the biggest trading scandal in investment banking history. France's prime minister reassured investors that SocGen's troubles were isolated from the malaise sweeping global financial market after a meltdown in U.S. sub-prime credit markets. The financial sector also drew support from news that troubled U.S. bond insurer Ambac may be in talks with a buyer. Tokyo's Nikkei ended up 4.1 percent -- its biggest daily percentage gain since March 2002. The benchmark is down 1.7 percent on the week and 11 percent so far this year. In Hong Kong, gains in global bank HSBC helped the Hang Seng notch up a 5.3 percent gain, while Australian shares climbed 5 percent -- their biggest daily gain in a decade -- to add 2 percent this week. "The panic's gone out of the market," said Angus Gluskie, portfolio manager with White Funds Management. Expectations of a further interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next week has helped to stabilise market sentiment and put focus on fundamental company valuations following the market rout earlier this week, he said. "On most people's fundamentals, a lot of stocks in the market appear to be undervalued," said Gluskie. BONDS SLIDE Japanese government bonds suffered their biggest single-day drop in a year and a half, hurt by a wave of selling as surging Tokyo stocks prompted investors to dump safe-haven debt. March 10-year futures slid 0.90 of a point and the benchmark 10-year bond yield jumped 9.5 basis points to 1.480 percent. Treasuries were steady in Asia after a sell off in New York, with two-year notes yielding of 2.318 percent The dollar edged up to 107.41 yen as the broad recovery in global stock markets from a frantic sell-off encouraged appetite for higher yielding currencies. US crude rose 58 cents to $89.99 a barrel after jumping nearly 3 percent in the previous session to $89.41 a barrel. Spot gold hit a record $914.50 an ounce on dollar weakness, supply concerns, firm oil and expectations of more US interest rate cuts. Platinum hit another record high of $1,618.50
