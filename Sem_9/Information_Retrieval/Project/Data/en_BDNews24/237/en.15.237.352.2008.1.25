 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  A sudden cold spell sharpened by rainfall in the late winter month of Magh has been sweeping the country. The capital experienced intermittent rain and drizzle Thursday and Friday, coupled with a seasonal northern wind. As a result, the cold appeared to intensify. The Met Office said different areas of the country have experienced rainfall as prevailing easterlies met a western low pressure front. Much of the country was under cloud cover Friday. The cold spell is expected to continue Saturday, with moderate rain or drizzle in different areas, though the weather may improve from Sunday. Weatherman Sadekul Alam told bdnews24.com Friday: "As the western low was crossing over Bangladesh it met with an easterly wind from the Bay associated with cloud mass, causing the rainfall." "In most areas of the country, the difference between maximum and minimum temperature (over 24 hours) has actually become narrower," he said. "This is why the cold is being felt," he added. The lowest temperature Friday, 12 degrees Celsius, was recorded at Dinajpur. In Dhaka the lowest temperature was 15.3 degrees Celsius. The Met Office said Khulna, Jessore, Dhaka, Barisal and Patuakhali and some other areas of the country experienced rainfall. bdnews24.c
