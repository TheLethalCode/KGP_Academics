<TEXT>
 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair said he believes both Israelis and Palestinians want peace and a deal can be brokered by the end of this year. "I think it's doable this year if people want to do it," Blair, the former British prime minister, told Reuters. Blair is peace envoy to the Quartet of Middle East mediators, which includes the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. "You could get a peace deal.

"There's two things that are happening in the Middle East at one and the same time," Blair said. "One is a very very difficult situation in Gaza, with all the difficulties we know and can see, but the other is a real attempt by the Palestinian and Israeli leadership to find an accommodation," he said. Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad's authority does not extend to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which Israel has blockaded in a move it says aims to counter cross-border rocket fire. In the West Bank, Israeli settlements and checkpoints make travel difficult for Palestinians. "On the West Bank, the Palestinian economy (is) beginning to grow and if of course we could lift the restrictions on movement and access as the security situation improves, (it would be) able to grow rapidly," Blair sa
