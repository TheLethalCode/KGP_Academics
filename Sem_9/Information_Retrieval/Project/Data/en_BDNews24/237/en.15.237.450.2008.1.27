<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)The government has moved to strip MPs of their influence over upazila parishads by altering a legal provision. The government is also going to transfer power to the Election Commission to announce schedules for upazila elections. Now the local government ministry is authorised to announce schedules for upazila elections. The government Sunday agreed in principle to amend some provisions of the Upazila Parishad Act 1998, according to a decision taken at a cabinet meeting. In a post-meeting briefing, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said the law would be sent to the law ministry for scrutiny. According to the Upazila Parishad Act 1998, local MPs are advisers to the upazila parishads, but the amended law will end the provision. The latest move is meant to curtail the interference of lawmakers with the upazila parishad affairs. It comes in line with recommendations by a committee formed by the interim government. The committee headed by adviser and former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali has been tasked with making suggestions to strengthen and modernise local government bodies. It recommended that the lawmakers should be stripped of the powers of being automatic advisers to the upazila parishads in their constituencies. The previous political governments led by the Awami League and the BNP had also taken decisions to empower the Election Commission for dealing with the polls schedule of the upazila parishads. But the decisions could not get through since they failed to amend the relevant laws. In the present day law, there is a provision to keep a third of the elected posts reserved for women in union parishads and pourashavas. The provisions would remain intact until the next elections to the upazila parishads to avoid any legal complexity. Munaim said the advisory council's first meeting for February would be held in Rangpur. bdnews24.
