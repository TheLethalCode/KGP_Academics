<TITLE> Serbia to sign big energy deal with Russia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian leaders were to sign a big energy deal with Russia on Friday, giving Moscow control of the Serbian oil monopoly and the right to route a major European gas pipeline through Serbian territory. The deal, which has sparked fears in the West that Serbia is mortgaging its energy future to the Kremlin, was to be inked nine days ahead of a runoff presidential contest in Serbia between a pro-Western and a pro-Moscow candidate. Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered Belgrade strong support in its campaign to oppose independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo, a factor which analysts say has influenced Serbia's decision to tie its energy future to Russia. "Serbia respects Russia's position on Kosovo. Without this, Serbia would find it far more difficult to defend its position on Kosovo," Serbian president Boris Tadic told reporters as he started talks with Putin at the Kremlin. Friday's agreements will give Russian gas monopoly Gazprom a 51 percent stake in NIS, the Serbian oil and gas company, for an undisclosed price. Gazprom's initial offer of 400 million euros ($586.1 million) last month was described by analysts as well below market value but it was not immediately clear whether this had been raised. NIS, the only state-owned oil firm in the Balkans to have escaped major restructuring or sale, dominates Serbia's market with a monopoly on refining and a network of almost 500 petrol stations all over the country. Estimates of its value vary between 1.0 billion euros ($1.47 billion) and 2.0 billion euros ($2.94 billion). Tadic and Serbia's Russophile Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica were also expected to sign an agreement in Moscow for Gazprom to route its South Stream gas pipeline through Serbia. South Stream is a major gas transit project bringing Siberian gas to southern Europe. The European Union, worried about its heavy dependence on Russian gas, has been promoting a rival scheme which would take gas from Central Asia through Turkey to Europe but has been having trouble finding enough gas supply to justify the project
