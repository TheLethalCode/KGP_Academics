 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  The three-day Biswa Ijtema that began Friday morning came to an abrupt close at 8:15pm with a rushed akheri munajaat because of bad weather that claimed lives of two devotees. Maulana Zubairul Hasan, imam of Delhi Mosque, led the concluding prayers, scheduled for Sunday, that started at 7:55pm at the Tongi Ijtema ground by the river Turag. Earlier, Tongi municipality chairman Azmat Ullah told bdnews24.com at 7:40pm that inclement weather had compelled the organisers to call an early end to the second largest annual Muslim gathering after hajj. Some devotees had been suffering discomfort due to the cold spell and foggy weather. "It has been raining heavily. People are taking shelter wherever they can. The road from the Ijtema ground to Tongi bridge is blocked," Nazmul Karim Russell, a student who took part in the final prayers, said. Many arrived prepared to cope with the January cold, but the rains and chilly winds had been unexpected, they said. The sufferings of the devotees at the Ijtema site peaked with drizzles and biting cold from Thursday night. Movement on the Ijtema ground became difficult. As water dripped through the gunny bag coverings of the Ijtema ground many devotees left the Ijtema ground and took shelter in different educational institutions, factories, mosques, madrasas and on the floor of Tongi railway junction. bdnews24.com Gazipur correspondent said on being confirmed that weather would not improve in next two days high officials of the government and the elders of Tablig Jamaat at a meeting decided to hold the akheri munajat in the evening. Two persons died on the Ijtema ground on Thursday and Friday. Ashraf Uddin, 52, whose address could not be known, died of old age complications aggravated by cold at 1:30pm Thursday. Md Giasuddin Master, 80, of Ataikula in Pabna district, died of cold-related complexities Friday morning. The annual Biswa Ijtema or global gathering has been drawing the largest number of Muslims, after the hajj, from all over the world since 1967. The organisers earlier said they had expected about 2.2 million devotees at the Ijtema grounds this year. This is the first time in the history of Ijtema that the event has been cut short. The akheri munajaat or final prayers was to be held Sunday. Many from home and abroad were still on their way to join the Ijtema. Additional director general (operations) of Bangladesh Railway Qazi Asad Ullah told bdnews24.com they had directed all trains to halt at Tongi and Uttara stations to allow the Ijtema devotees to return home. As the Ijtema was shortened suddenly no special train could be arranged unlike in previous years, he added. Earlier in the morning, bayan or discourse started at the Ijtema ground after morning prayers. Ahmed Batla of Pakistan started the discourse. After juma prayers, Maulana Jamirudin, after asr prayers Maulana Jubair and after Magreb prayers Maulana Abdul Wahab delivered discourses. They discussed religious issues in detail apart from extending invitation to brace Islam. The discourses delivered in Arabic and Urdu were simultaneously translated into 16 languages including Bangla to the devotees. About 4,500 delegates from 62 countries had reached the Ijtema site until Friday noon. The delegates came from India, Pakistan, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Mongolia, Jordan, Afghanistan, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Yemen, Germany and Zimbabwe. Organised by the Tablig Jama'at, the very first Ijtema was organised at Kakrail in Dhaka in 1946; it became a regular annual event from 1967. Tablig Jamaat was established by Muhammad Akhter Ilias in Bombay, India in 1953. On earlier occasions Biswa Ijtema was held in Kakrail of Dhaka, Chittagong and Siddhirganj in Narayanganj. Earlier, president Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed issued separate messages marking the event. The president's message called upon all assembled to help build the nation as a strong entity and devote their lives and resources to raising a capable nation. Fakhruddin expressed hope that the Ijtema will play a significant role in strengthening the bonds of Muslim brotherhood across the globe. bdnews24.com/corr/sm
