 Boca Raton, Florida, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican Mitt Romney and rival John McCain squabbled over the US economy but pounded Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday as they jockeyed for votes in Florida in the wide-open US presidential race. In a high-stakes debate among the five Republican contenders, Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, tried to raise doubts about the 71-year-old McCain's understanding of the US economy by saying he should not have voted against tax cuts during President George W Bush's first term. Romney had defeated Arizona Sen. McCain in Michigan earlier this month by questioning his judgment on the economy. "As we face tough times, we need to have somebody who understands, if you will, has the private sector, has the business world, has the economy in their DNA. I do. I spent my life in the private sector. I know how jobs come and I know how they go," Romney said. McCain defended himself and sought to assure conservatives who will render judgment on him in Florida. He said he had opposed the tax cuts because he wanted to cut federal spending simultaneously and that if that had been done, "we would be talking about more tax cuts today." "I'm very proud of my record," McCain said, calling it "a consistent record of being a fiscal conservative." The debate among Republicans seeking to face the Democrats' candidate for the November election was a largely subdued, gentlemanly affair -- until it came to archrival Clinton, who is battling Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination. In fact it was so civilized that McCain found himself giving heavy praise to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has finished way back in the pack in the earlier state contests and has staked his candidacy on winning Florida. He is currently tied for third place with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in the state. "I happen to know Rudy Giuliani," McCain said. "I happen to know he's an American hero." Giuliani predicted he would ultimately win Florida. Of his weak performance so far, he quipped: "We have them all lulled into a very false sense of security now." The Florida winner could gain important momentum going into the campaign for 22 state contests on Feb. 5. Only registered Republicans can vote in Florida, giving Romney a potential edge over McCain, whose victories in New Hampshire and South Carolina have been aided by independent voters. NEW YORK TIMES ENDORSEMENTS The leading candidates played to Florida Republicans by taking some shots at New York Sen. Clinton on a day when The New York Times endorsed her over Illinois Sen. Obama for the Democratic nomination. The Times endorsed McCain for the Republican nomination. Romney, speaking during a week in which Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, heavily criticized Obama in South Carolina, said, "The idea of Bill Clinton back in the White House is something I just can't imagine." Then he turned his fire on both Clintons. "She is exactly what is wrong with Washington. She is Washington to the core. She has been there too long. Bill Clinton has been there too long. The last thing America needs is sending the Clintons back to Washington," he said. McCain said Hillary Clinton's plan to begin withdrawing US troops from Iraq within 60 days of taking office would be tantamount to surrender. "If we do what Sen. Clinton said that she wanted to do the night before last, and that's wave the white flag of surrender and set a date for withdrawal, then we will have expenses my friends in American blood," said McCain. "Al Qaeda will then have won." Huckabee, who has barely enough funds to campaign in Florida, tweaked Romney for the millions of his own money he is spending in Florida and in other contests. He held back from attacking McCain and said he did not think McCain's age would be a factor in his presidency. McCain would be the oldest person ever elected to a first presidential term. Most of the Republicans backed a $150 billion fiscal stimulus plan agreed on by Bush and leaders of the US House of Representatives on Thursday but said it should be only the beginning, that more tax cuts are needed to help re-energize the ailing US economy. Huckabee tried to raise some questions about the stimulus. "One of the concerns that I have is that we'll probably end up borrowing $150 billion from the Chinese," he said. "And when we get those rebate checks most people are going to go out and buy stuff that's been imported from China. I have to wonder whose economy will be stimulated the most by the package.
