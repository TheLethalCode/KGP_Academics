 Davos, Switzerland, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said countries around the world needed to bring down barriers to trade and investment and to make progress with long-delayed negotiations for a global trade deal. "We have to be less protectionist," Brown told an audience at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. "The challenge is to show we can make the world trade talks move forward," he said, adding countries also needed to ensure they had the right fiscal and regulatory policies in place amid concerns about a slowdown in the global economy.
