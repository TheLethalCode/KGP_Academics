<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - It was to be the Glam Slam, the squealer versus the squeaker. Instead, Saturday's Australian Open women's final was a battle of brinkmanship and jangling nerves. Ana Ivanovic blinked first and Maria Sharapova was the champion. Russia's tennis Tsarina beat Ivanovic 7-5 6-3 to make amends for last year's final defeat by Serena Williams and win her third grand slam title. For her fellow 20-year-old Ivanovic, it was a second grand slam final defeat and one which left her in tears. After 91 minutes on a sweltering centre court, Sharapova sank to her knees as her opponent's forehand sailed wide on matchpoint, looking skywards as tears filled her green eyes. "I love you everyone, thanks so much for everything," the Russian beamed as she held aloft the trophy. "This is just incredible. If someone had told me in the middle of last year I would be standing here in front of you with the big one I would never have believed you. "This morning I got a text from Billie Jean King saying champions take chances and pressure is a privilege. I am just glad I could take my chances today." Brilliant in a white fringed dress, her blonde pony-tail pulled behind a white visor, Sharapova fairly shimmered on Rod Laver Arena. LOUDEST SHRIEK Ivanovic's shoes still squeaked when she returned -- though not so much as under the roof -- and Sharapova certainly shrieked as play got underway.

Powerful and well-directed, she dominated on her own delivery. She got the breakthrough in the fifth game when she slammed a backhand winner to move 3-2 ahead. That winner was accompanied by the loudest shriek of the match -- so loud a baby in the stands started crying. It was not until the eighth game of the match that Sharapova lost even a point on her serve, but having achieved that mini breakthrough Ivanovic's confidence grew and she broke serve thanks to two double faults from the Russian. Back on serve, the Serb celebrated with a strange clenched fist pump that started with her arm extended before she snatched it into her body. The Pavlovian yell of "C'mon" followed. Three games later Sharapova nosed ahead again, though, which heralded more yelling and fist-pumping and she duly served out to love to clinch the set 7-5. SERB POPULATION Melbourne's Serb population was in fine voice but could do little to raise their favorite. One persistent fan repeatedly offered advice. "Come on Ana, hit through your forehand," he yelled, but it would take more than that to derail Sharapova. She grabbed a break in the seventh game of the second set and smelt blood. Not even a piece of advertiser's music accidentally blaring from an on-court speaker could put her off as she comfortably held serve for a 5-3 lead. Ivanovic's head dropped and she quickly fell behind 0-40 to hand the Russian three championship points. Ivanovic saved the first two but victory was Sharapova's when the Serb's forehand flew wid
