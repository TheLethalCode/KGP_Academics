 BERLIN, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's ruling parties faced tough talks on Monday on who will rule the western state of Hesse after an election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) suffered heavy losses. Sunday's election in Hesse, which is home to the financial capital of Frankfurt, tested the CDU's popularity before the next federal election in Sept. 2009. Hesse premier Roland Koch, a Merkel ally, finished a whisker ahead of the Social Democrats (SPD) on 36.8 percent. But he was seen as the big loser as support for him fell by 12 percentage points compared to the last state election in Hesse in 2003. Several leading newspapers described the result as a debacle for Koch, who ran a campaign on crime and immigration that was backed by Merkel but denounced by critics as xenophobic. "For Angela Merkel, the Hesse election must be a shock which will have a long-term effect," wrote top-selling Bild newspaper. Finely-balanced results for three smaller parties mean it is unclear whether the CDU or SPD will be able to lead a coalition in Hesse, and the haggling is likely to poison the atmosphere further in their fractious federal coalition government. Senior figures from both regional and national parties meet on Monday to thrash out what to do. Neither party is willing to concede defeat and negotiations could last weeks. "Building a coalition in Hesse is going to be incredibly difficult with these results," said pollster Richard Hilmar, head of Infratest dimap on German radio. Although Merkel is still one of Germany's most popular chancellors two years into office, her hands are tied by her left-right "grand coalition" and few political analysts expect much in the way of new reforms until after the next election. The two parties disagree on most policy areas and business and industry groups warn of policy gridlock. "We fear any zeal for reform which remains in Berlin's grand coalition will now be very much weakened," Anton Boerner, head of the BGA exporters' association told Handelsblatt newspaper. A complicating factor in the coalition-forming process is the success of the Left party, a far-left grouping of ex-communists and disaffected SPD members, which won enough votes to enter parliament in Hesse. In another election in the northwestern state of Lower Saxony, CDU premier Christian Wulff retained power in a coalition with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) although he also saw his support drop. The Left will also enter that parliame
