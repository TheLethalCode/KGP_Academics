 New York, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil jumped nearly 3 percent to top $89 a barrel on Thursday as a tentative agreement by US lawmakers on an economic stimulus package helped ease concerns of a recession in the world's biggest economy. US crude settled $2.42 higher at $89.41 a barrel, after closing at a 13-week low of $86.99 in the previous session. London Brent crude settled up $2.45 at $89.07 a barrel. The White House and the US Congress reached a tentative deal on a package of tax rebates for families and incentives for business investment with a cost that may exceed $150 billion, aimed at bolstering the battered economy. "I think (crude's gains are) primarily reflective of the stimulus package," said Eric Wittenauer, analyst at AG Edwards. "I think that the market generally speaking is showing signs of putting in a near-term bottom around the $87 a barrel level and that report added to momentum that had pushed prices higher earlier today." Worries the growing subprime mortgage crisis could cause a US recession and damp oil demand growth have sent prices tumbling from peaks above $100 a barrel in early January. Gains in global stock markets helped push crude higher and offset mildly bearish US inventory data, which showed domestic crude supplies rose 2.3 million barrels last week, slightly above analyst expectations. "The oil markets are moving up with other financial markets. The EIA data was bearish in some parts but in generally within the range of expectations," said Tom Knight, trader with Truman Arnold. US gasoline stocks swelled by 5 million barrels, well above forecasts, while distillates slipped 1.3 million barrels, the EIA said. "The big bearish number was the huge build in gasoline," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron trading. "We are seeing some softness in demand, pressuring the market." Analysts said funds and speculators had been closing out their positions in oil and commodities to cover margin calls and to finance losses in equity markets, contributing to losses earlier in the week. The International Energy Agency's executive director expressed concern about the strength of the world economy and said oil producers could help the situation by pumping more. On Wednesday, Qatar's oil minister said OPEC did not need to boost output when it meets on Feb. 1 to determine production policy, and expressed concerns that demand could take a blow if a recession hit. nN2351445 Iraq's oil minister on Thursday said oil markets were well-supplied, adding he did not think the cartel will need to adjust production levels
