 Washington, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican presidential contender Rudy Giuliani defended his plans to curb illegal immigration to the United States during a high-stakes debate on Thursday in Florida. Illegal immigration is a hot button issue in the state-by-state battle to choose candidates for the November 2008 presidential election. Here are some facts on illegal immigration in the United States: An estimated 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants live and work in the United States, roughly one in every 20 workers, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center based on government figures. Some 880,000 people were arrested crossing the US-Mexico border illegally in 2007, most of them from Mexico and Central America, down from 1.1 million a year earlier. The US government had built 284 miles of pedestrian and vehicular fencing along the 2,000 mile (3,200-km) US-Mexico border by the close of 2007, and aims to construct roughly 670 miles of fencing by the end of 2008. In 2006, President George W Bush proposed an overhaul of US immigration laws, offering a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, together with a guest worker program, and tougher border and workplace enforcement. The legislation was opposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives who backed a tougher security program but were against any effort to grant citizenship rights to illegal immigrants. By late 2007, state legislatures across the United States had proposed more than 1,560 immigration-related measures. Of these, more than 240 have become law in 46 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
