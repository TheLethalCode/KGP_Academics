 NAIROBI, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's finance minister said on Monday he was certain the country could reach a political settlement after recent unrest and that most sectors of the economy should be able to bounce back once a solution was found. The east African economy has suffered violence since the re-election of President Mwai Kibaki last month that has killed hundreds and slowed economic activity in the worst-affected parts of the country. "I am very confident we will get a political settlement for this crisis which means things can start flowing," Finance Minister Amos Kimunya told a press conference. "If we are able to sort out this mess, all the fundamentals (are unchanged). Apart from tourism, most of the other sectors will continue performing as they should and we should be able to recover." The Kenyan shilling has taken a beating, sliding to an 18-month low versus the dollar on the uncertainty that has wracked the country's markets. At 1000 GMT banks quoted the shilling at 72.95/73.15 per dollar. Tourism, the country's leading foreign exchange earner, has been worst hit with visitors cancelling their holidays on advice from their governments. "I don't see a recession, I see a slowdown in economic activities within the first six months and then it would very well pick up again," he said. "We have not gone that far down, we can still spring up." The country's growth has averaged 5 percent in the last five years and was forecast to expand by between 6.9-7.0 percent in 2007. Kimunya said he would ask for more funding from parliament to cover extra government spending on security. Kenya had planned to spend 693.6 billion kenya shillings ($9.45 billion) in 2007/08. "Nobody expected this crisis. Obviously it is costing much more in security and all that, it means we have to go for more money," he said. The government would be able to cover any revenue collection shortfall arising from the month of turmoil, Kimunya said. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) targets revenue of 406.9 billion shillings in 2007/08 from 360.2 billion in the previous year. Kimunya said KRA has surpassed its target for December by 8 billion shillings, which would cushion January and February. "We might not have that huge a shortfall in revenue come end of the year...otherwise, we will have to defer some programmes," he said. The minister repeated remarks made to Reuters on Friday that the country had enough dollar reserves to cover five months of imports and there was no need for panic buyi
