<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former president Suharto, hailed as the father of development by some Indonesians during his 32 years in power and accused of corruption and rights abuses by others, died on Sunday after suffering multiple organ failure. He was 86. He died in hospital after lapsing into a coma. "On behalf of the nation, the people and the government, and in my personal capacity, I extend condolences," President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said in a statement. "I invite all the people of Indonesia to pray that may the deceased's good deeds and dedication to the nation be accepted by Allah the almighty. And to the family who are left behind, may Allah give them strength to face this trial. Mr Suharto has done a great service to the nation." Members of Suharto's family had gathered late last night at the Pertamina hospital in Jakarta where he was being treated after his health suddenly deteriorated. "We, the whole family, thank everyone who has prayed for our father," said Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hadijanti Rukmana, also known as Tutut, sobbing as she addressed a news conference at the hospital. Mardjo Soebiandono, the head of the medical team who had treated Suharto, told the news conference that Suharto had "peacefully passed away" at 13.10 (0610 GMT). Officials said Suharto's body would be taken to Java's royal city of Solo on Monday for the funeral. The Suharto family mausoleum is about 35 km (21 miles) northeast of Solo. "WE SHOULD FORGIVE HIM" Suharto had been in critical condition in hospital since Jan. 4, suffering from heart, lung and kidney problems. As he lay dying, Indonesians across the archipelago debated his legacy and whether the government should push ahead with a civil suit or other legal proceedings against him for graft. "The civil suit must be suspended because we are in no position to represent Mr Suharto because he has passed away. And now the prosecutors must deal with the family to sort it out," said Mohammad Assegaf, one of Suharto's lawyers. Suharto's body was taken by ambulance from the hospital to his house in Jakarta's leafy Menteng district, where a crowd of journalists and well-wishers had gathered in the sweltering sun. Several women burst into tears when the ambulance arrived. Some clung to the fence or tried to touch the ambulance as it passed through the gate to the house. "I always remember him and all the great things he did for this nation. I remember back in the Suharto days things were much better," sobbed Helmi, a 53-year-old housewife, who said she had rushed to the house the minute she heard of Suharto's death. President Yudhoyono and his wife, as well as former ministers and religious leaders also arrived at the house to pay their respects. "For humanity's sake, we should forgive him. Based on religion, his crimes and his deeds on earth will be subject to God's judgment only. The living can't do anything," Amidan, a member of the Indonesian Ulema Council, a grouping of Islamic clerics, told reporters at the house. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL CHAOS Suharto came to power after an abortive coup on Sept. 30, 1965, that was officially blamed on the communist party. Up to 500,000 people were killed in an anti-communist purge in the months that followed. Over the next three decades, Suharto's armed forces committed numerous human rights abuses, killing student activists, criminals, and opponents to the regime in the rebellious provinces of Aceh and Papua. He was forced to step down in 1998 as the Asian financial crisis sparked economic and social chaos, leading to calls for greater democracy. By the time Suharto was forced to resign, he and his family and associates had permeated nearly every sector of Indonesia's economy. They owned airlines, hotels, toll roads, TV and radio stations, and provided the gateway for any foreigner who wanted to do business there. Critics say Suharto and his family amassed as much as $45 billion in kickbacks or deals where political influence was key to who won a contract. Transparency International put Suharto's assets at $15-$35 billion, or as much as 1.3 percent of gross domestic product. His family have denied any wrongdoing and Suharto had always maintained his innocence. After he quit office, Suharto was charged with embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars of state funds, but the government later dropped the case because of his poor health. Last year, state prosecutors filed a civil suit seeking $440 million of state funds and a further $1 billion in damages for the alleged misuse of money held by one of Suharto's charitable foundations. While some Indonesians look back on the Suharto era with nostalgia, others have called for the former general and his family to be brought to justice. "I suggest Suharto's family to openly apologise to all the people of Indonesia via a press conference for all the wrongdoings committed by Suharto," said Soehardjo, a letter-writer to the newspaper Komp
