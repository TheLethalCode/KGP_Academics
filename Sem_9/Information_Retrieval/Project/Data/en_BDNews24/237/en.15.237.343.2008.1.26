 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya is in danger of falling into an irreversible spiral of violence while politicians attempt to settle their differences, the top UN aid official said on Saturday. UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes called on politicians in the East African country to avoid hate campaigns that would spark more violence against civilians.
