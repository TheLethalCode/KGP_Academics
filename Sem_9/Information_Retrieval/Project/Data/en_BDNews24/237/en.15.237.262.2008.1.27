<TITLE> Australian PM vows to tackle homelessness </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sydney, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's prime minister launched a campaign on Sunday against homelessness, saying it was unacceptable an estimated 100,000 Australians were homeless each night in a country where the economy is booming. Kevin Rudd announced his Labor government would spend A$150 million (US$132 million) to construct crisis housing and ordered a review of homelessness so that a policy could be implemented to "systematically reduce homelessness over the next decade". "After 16 years of economic growth, it is unacceptable that on any one night 100,000 Australians are homeless -- 10,000 of those Australians are children under the age of 12," Rudd said. Rudd, elected in November ending 11 years of conservative rule, said Australia needed a new approach to tackling homelessness, adding Britain and parts of the United States had achieved major reductions in homelessness. "We need a new approach that prevents homelessness, improves crisis services, helps people to get long-term, secure housing and stops the cycle of homelessness," he said in a statement. "One of our first priorities must be to dramatically reduce the number of Australians sleeping rough each night. I do not want to live in a country where we simply discard people." Rudd said the homeless must not only be given housing but brought into the mainstream of society where they can gain work and long-term security. The A$150 million will build 600 new homes and the review on homelessness is due to be completed by August 2008. "It's something which you can either push to one side and sweep under the carpet or you can say...this is just dead wrong, we need to do something about it," Rudd told reporters. "We have a situation where as the country gets wealthier, homelessness gets worse. We don't believe it is something which a country as wealthy as ours in the 21st century can just ignore."
