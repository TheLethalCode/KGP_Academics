 Beijing, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wild winter weather across China stranded hundreds of thousands of people on Monday and crippled energy supplies and transport, stoking worries about damage to the economy as well as to lives and property. Heavy snow and sleet have hit central, eastern and southern China, regions used to milder winters. Dozens of people have died and many highways, railways and airports have been paralysed, especially in the east. The harsh weather has struck as tens of millions of Chinese crowd home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, starting on Feb. 7, straining trains and planes even in normal conditions. At the main rail station in Guangzhou in the commercial far south, 170,000 people crammed together waiting for trains that could not leave, Xinhua news agency reported. By the end of Monday, a backlog of up to 600,000 waiting for trains from the city was expected. In Beijing, where the temperature was below freezing, migrant workers wondered when they could return home for their rare holiday rest. "I've been waiting for four days to get a ticket but there's nothing available," said one migrant worker waiting at a packed station to go to snow-struck Anqing in eastern China. The China Metereological Administration said the cold snap showed no signs of lifting in the coming days. It issued a "red alert" for snow storms across central and eastern provinces, including around Shanghai, the nation's commercial hub, where the temperature hovered around freezing. PRICE OF WILD WEATHER Already the country is guessing the cost of the destruction and disruption. China's main stock index sagged in early trade as traders worried about the price-tag of the wild weather. "This year's snow is really very extraordinary, and investors are now beginning to worry about the possible impact on the overall economy," said an analyst at Shanghai Securities. Premier Wen Jiabao said on Sunday the weather was threatening lives and disrupting supplies of fresh food, coal, oil and electricity ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. He promised action to ensure public safety and power. But the sight of swathes of China struggling with brownouts, food price hikes and business shutdowns has also led some to blame government shortcomings as well as the cold. "This crisis coming with the Spring Festival mass movement comes shrouded in bureaucratic details as well in nature's storms and snow," said a commentator in the Beijing News. The Ministry of Railways has sent about 100 diesel locomotives to move the electric trains and ordered 63 trains to bypass the paralysed section of the Beijing-Guangzhou line. Road traffic between Guangdong and neighbouring Hunan had also ground to a halt. Hunan's Huanghua airport has been closed since Friday in the worst cold snap in a decade. Snow hit Shanghai for a third day on Monday, bringing traffic to a crawl and many flights had been delayed. At least 10 container ships were stuck in Shanghai's Baoshan port, unable to unload, because of the snow and several were back up at sea. China on Sunday ordered urgent steps to fight the transport chaos. Provinces were ordered not to hoard their own coal and electricity, and officials said they would waive some transport charges for farm goods and monitor price hikes.
