<TITLE> Divorce rate jumps for China`s `me' generation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's divorce rate jumped nearly 20 percent last year, blamed largely on rapidly changing social mores as the fast-developing Communist-ruled country embraces market reforms. About 1.4 million couples divorced last year, 18.2 percent up from 2006, the Civil Affairs Department said. Around 9.5 million couples tied the knot, an increase of 11.8 percent. Since the launch of the opening-up policy 30 years ago, the divorce rate has soared. In 1980, there were just 341,000 divorces nationwide, the Shanghai Daily said. Xu Anqi, an expert from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times of Beijing that increasing migration as well as longer working hours were factors. No reason was given for the increase in marriages. China's phenomenal economic growth has created a generation of "emperors" and "empresses", the now-adult children of China's one-child policy, who often put their needs first. Experts say many of this generation are unable to sustain relationships, a result of being only children, doted on by parents and grandparents. It is a lifestyle that contrasts sharply to that of their parents who viewed marriage as a duty and divorce a shame. A law that took effect in 2003 allows couples to divorce in a day. Before then, couples needed permission from either their employers or community committees to divorce.
