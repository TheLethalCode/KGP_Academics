 GENEVA, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A World Trade Organisation (WTO) accession committee approved Ukraine's membership bid on Friday, clearing the way for the former Soviet republic to join the body, diplomats said. Kiev struck a deal with the European Union last week, removing the last obstacle to its long-sought entry. The WTO's General Council would need to rubber-stamp the application at its Feb 5-6 meeting to make Ukraine's entry official. WTO membership will provide Ukraine, the third-biggest economy still outside the WTO, with access to export markets on more favourable terms than it now enjoys, as well as the right to help shape world trade rules. Brussels, which had insisted that Ukraine give a binding commitment to reduce its duties on exports before joining the WTO, offered its congratulations following the end of the negotiations on Friday. "We are now in a position to have a consensus in the WTO on Ukrainian accession at the next General Council," the European Union said in a statement. European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said earlier on Friday that he hoped Russia would take its place in the WTO this year, more than a decade after Moscow started its accession bid.
