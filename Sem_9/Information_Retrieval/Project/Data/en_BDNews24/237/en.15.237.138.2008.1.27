<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)A recent study has placed Bangladesh at the top of a group of South-Asian countries in terms of the trust the public places in their political parties. The study, which was conducted by a professor of international relations at Dhaka University, found 55 percent of people in Bangladesh trusted their political parties. Pakistan registered the lowest confidence rating, with 24 percent having trust in political parties. Dr Imtiaz Hossain coordinated the research and presented his findings at the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute in Gulshan Sunday. The findings also suggest that 90 percent of South Asians rate democracy as the most dependable system of governance. Imtiaz said the formation of a national security council with more civilian members than military personnel should be formed under the framework of the constitution. "We unduly favour political parties in South Asia. Even in India, 39 percent of people have trust in their political parties," said economist Dr Rehman Sobhan. Dr Imtiaz said: "The military intervenes when political parties fail to reach a consensus. Military intervention is not good for the country." "If political parties fail to reach a consensus, the ruling and opposition parties can hold talks at the national security council to resolve any crisis," said Imtiaz. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "One of the successes of the caretaker government is to prove wrong the previous idea of impunity." bdn
