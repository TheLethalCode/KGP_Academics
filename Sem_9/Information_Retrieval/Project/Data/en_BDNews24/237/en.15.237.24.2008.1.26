 BEIRUT, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's police chief vowed to confront those who "terrorise this nation" on Saturday, at a memorial service for a police intelligence officer killed in a car bomb attack the previous day. Captain Wisam Eid, who helped investigate assassinations in the country, and his companion were killed when a car bomb ripped through a Christian suburb of Beirut on Friday. Police said on Saturday the death toll in the attack rose to five from four and put the wounded at 42. Eid's assassination was the latest in a wave of bombings and political killings that have shaken Lebanon over the past three years and whose turmoil has fuelled the country's worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. "They thought that with their crime, they can affect our commitment and will, but they are really delusional," said police chief Brigadier General Ashraf Rifi at a memorial service at the internal security forces' headquarters in Beirut. "We pledge to you that the internal security forces will continue to confront those who wanted to terrorise this nation with their crimes ... our decision is to ... confront the empire of death and terrorism," Rifi said. Eid, 31, who was posthumously promoted to major, worked for an intelligence unit which was seen as close to anti-Syrian ruling majority leader Saad al-Hariri and which was frequently criticised by the Syrian-backed opposition. He was a communications engineer who security sources said was responsible for tracking mobile phone communications made by attackers in previous killings and of Islamist militant cells. The unit had also been closely involved in the U.N.-led investigation into the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, and in a crackdown on al Qaeda-inspired militants whom the army fought last year. MOURNERS GATHER Prime Minister Fouad Siniora declared Saturday a national day of mourning for Eid and the other victims. Thousands of mourners, some waving Lebanese and black flags, greeted the convoy with shots fired in the air, as it inched its way from Tripoli to Eid's Deir Ammar hometown. Mourners cheered as Eid's coffin was carried to the main municipality building in Deir Ammar where he will later be buried. Others mourners cried silently as Koranic verses blared from louspeakers. "This is the third time that they tried to kill him. He was very kind, he had an important position, but to me he will always be a child," said Eid's mother who gave her name only as Um Wisam, at her home in Deir Ammar. In the northern city of Tripoli, crowds of mourners gathered in the mosque's courtyard to offer their prayers for Eid, who had been targeted before, and his companion. Earlier at police headquarters in the affluent Christian suburb of Ashrafiyeh, Eid and his companion's coffins were draped in the red and white Lebanese flag. Last month, a car bomb killed the army's chief of operations, Francois Hajj, in east Beirut. The ruling majority says Syria is behind Hariri's slaying and many of the more than 30 bombings that have hit Lebanon in the past three years, often targeting anti-Syrian figures. Damascus has denied involvement in any of the killings. Eid's killing comes at a time of a deepening political crisis in which the Western-backed ruling coalition and Hezbollah-led opposition have been at odds for over a year. The crisis has paralysed government and its institutions and has left Lebanon with no head of state for the first time since the 1975-1990 civil w
