 New York, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A ship carrying orange juice collided with a dredging vessel in Newark Bay on Thursday, closing the bay to all ship traffic, the US Coast Guard said.

Newark Bay includes Port Newark/Elizabeth in New Jersey, the main port of entry for goods brought to the greater New York City area. Port Newark has two orange juice concentrate storage and blending facilities, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Web site. A New York Harbor based oil trader said the closure of the bay to shipping would not affect fuel deliveries.

"We don't see it being an issue in the short-term," said Bill Graham, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, which operates the large, 238,000 barrel-per-day Bayway oil refinery, located just south of the bay. A ship broker said the owner of the Orange Sun, built in 2007, was listed as Altanship
