 TOKYO, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An obscure Japanese company has created a stir by making the very unlikely claim that it spent about $190 billion to take controlling stakes in Sony Corp and five other major companies. Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, said on Friday it was investigating the veracity of the filing by Teramento Corporation given the "extraordinary transaction size" of stocks it claims to have purchased.

Those individuals or companies can then make filings public with virtually no intermediary check from the regulator. Teramento submitted the reports at about 4:12 p.m. on Friday after the Tokyo stock market had closed through the system, which is called EDINET (Electronic Disclosure for Investors' Network) and can be accessed through the Internet. The FSA said it would "rigorously take action, including a correction order, if the reports are found to be materially misstated". According to the filing, Teramento is based in Kawasaki City near Tokyo, was established in November last year, and is involved in several industries including information technology, automobile, aerospace, nuclear energy and broadcasting. Business registration papers filed in November showed that the company was capitalised at 1,000 yen ($9.36), the Nikkei business daily said.
