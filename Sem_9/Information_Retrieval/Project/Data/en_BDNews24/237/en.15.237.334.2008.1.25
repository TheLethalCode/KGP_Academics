 Chittagong, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff has said political parties need to pledge that they will not allow the country to slip back to the situation of pre-Jan 11, 2007 days. Speaking to reporters Friday after inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Chittagong Medical College, he said the lifting of the state of emergency depended on a collective decision. Ariff said the short-term government had been working against the influence of black money, muscle and corruption and helping the Election Commission to hold a peaceful, credible election. The adviser said the caretaker government had had limited time and the process of reform is a long one, which the present government has only initiated. He called on the physicians to give it their best to take healthcare services to the remote areas. Dr MA Wahab Chowdhury, principal of Chittagong Medical College, presided over the session. Acting Chittagong mayor M Manjur Alam, additional health secretary Abul Kalam Azad, divisional commissioner Hossain Jamil, director of Chittagong Medical College Hospital Brigadier General Abedur Rahman also spoke at the ceremony. There was a demand in the inaugural ceremony that the Chittagong Medical College, established in 1957, be elevated to an independent medical university. bdnews24.
