 PARIS, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks surged in early trade on Thursday, tracking a Wall Street recovery on hopes that a rescue for troubled bond insurers could prevent more writedowns, while investors digested the announcement of a huge fraud at Societe Generale. Shares were suspended in in the French bank, which unveiled the fraud by one of its traders with a 4.9-billion-euro ($7.16 billion) negative impact on the group. At 0858 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 4 percent at 1,313.14 points, after losing 3.2 percent on Wednesday. Tech shares were among the biggest gainers, with Nokia, the world's top cellphone maker, up 8.7 percent. Banks and insurers were also among the leaders, with Banco Santander up 6.3 percent, AXA up 8.3 percent and UBS up 5.3 percent. SocGen rival BNP Paribas, which said it saw no exceptional loss or item in its 2007 accounts which would justify a warning, gained 6.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.5 percent on Wednesday as news of a meeting between New York regulators, bond insurers and their customers lifted the market out of negative territory in late afternoon. "The key story here is the bond insurers story," said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas in Paris. "It would be logical that U.S. and European banks would coordinate with regulators in the United States to help bail out these insurers, because if these guys would fail, it would be much more catastrophic for banks' balance sheets and we would see another round of write-downs." Shares in European financial institutions started to fall sharply last Friday after U.S. bond insurer Ambac lost its vital triple-A credit rating from Fitch Ratings, putting at risk billions of dollars of corporate and municipal bonds covered by the company. "Right now, we're obsessed by this (monoline insurers). We've been through it already with other markets, ABCP, CDOs, the interbank markets, this is the next one," said Calyon rate strategist David Keeble. New York's insurance regulator pressed major banks on Wednesday to put up billions of dollars to support ailing bond insurers and prevent investors from being forced to sell billions of dollars of bonds the insurers had covered. The two largest U.S. bond insurers, Ambac Financial Group Inc and MBIA Inc, guarantee more than $1 trillion of securities, while the industry as a whole guarantees more than $2 trillion. If the insurers lose their top ratings, investors that can only hold bonds with top ratings may be forced to sell their holdings, dumping billions of dollars of municipal bonds and repackaged loans into the market. STARTING TROUBLE Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 is still down 13 percent so far in January, hit by worries over the prospect of a US recession and fears that financial institutions have not yet revealed the full impact of the problems sparked by the US subprime mortgage market on their books. The index is down 19.6 percent from its 52-week high. Many analysts consider a fall of 20 percent from a peak as signalling a bear market. Among standout gainers, Pernod Ricard soared 9 percent after the French wines and spirits group reported a 9.1 percent rise in second-quarter like-for-like sales that beat expectations and raised its guidance for full year operating profit. But brewer Scottish & Newcastle slipped 3.4 percent on market concern that a consortium of Heineken and Carlsberg would not make a formal bid by the midday deadline. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 4.9 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 3.4 percent and France's CAC 40 up 4.9 perce
