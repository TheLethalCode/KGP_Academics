<TITLE> Siemens to begin talks with SEC on settlement soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUNICH, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's Siemens AG, which posted strong first-quarter results on Thursday, is due to meet US authorities soon in an effort to put an end to what may be the world's biggest bribery scandal. Siemens Chairman Gerhard Cromme told shareholders at the company's annual meeting agreement had been reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Department of Justice to begin talks aimed at reaching a settlement. "These discussions -- this is my hope -- could begin as early as February," Cromme said. The SEC is investigating whether employees of Siemens, one of the world's largest electrical and industrial engineering companies, paid hundreds of millions of euros in bribes for telecoms and other contracts. Shares in Siemens gained 4.8 percent to 86.57 euros, underperforming the DJ Stoxx technology index, which was up 8.4 percent at 1136 GMT. Munich-based Siemens is being investigated worldwide on corruption allegations and may face high fines in the United States or even be banned from public contracts there. The scandal has already cost the 160-year-old company 1.6 billion euros ($2.34 billion), Chief Executive Peter Loescher told Thursday's meeting. It also led to the resignation of Loescher's predecessor, Klaus Kleinfeld, and its chairman, Heinrich von Pierer, last year. Neither has been accused of wrongdoing. Cromme asked investors to postpone a vote on ratifying management's performance, excluding Loescher but including von Pierer and Kleinfeld, until investigations had been terminated. The vote has more symbolic than actual effect, but its postponement leaves von Pierer and Kleinfeld dangling. Loescher, who moved from U.S. drug company Merck & Co last year to be the first outsider to head Siemens, has promised to root out corruption as he reshapes the unwieldy company. The scandal, Austrian-born Loescher said, was "the most serious crisis of the past decades ... and it will take years for us to completely overcome." He said the company had made a clean break, however, and was now committed to "clean business everywhere". STRONG RESULTS Loescher pleased investors with first-quarter results that came in stronger than expected thanks to growth in most of its units and the sale of a subsidiary. Operating profit in the quarter ended Dec. 31 was 1.72 billion euros, up 16 percent from a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected operating profit of 1.55 billion euros on sales of 18.76 billion euros. Siemens said revenue in the first quarter rose 8 percent to 18.40 billion euros and orders increased 9 percent to 24.24 billion. Net income rose to 6.48 billion euros, mostly thanks to a 5.4 billion gain from selling auto electronics maker VDO. Loescher, who has vowed to close the performance gap between Siemens and rivals such as General Electric Co and Philips, has reshaped the company into three major sectors aligned with global growth trends -- energy, industry and healthcare. By October 2010, the operating margin for energy operations is expected to rise to 11-15 percent from 9-13 percent, he said, and that for the industry sector is seen at 9-13 percent, compared with 9-11 percent before. Siemens announced a target range for operating margin in its healthcare operations of 14-17 percent in November. Loescher reiterated sales this fiscal year should increase at twice the rate of global GDP growth while operating profit should grow at least twice as fast as sales. He remained silent, however, when asked whether those targets still applied to the next fiscal year too. The trains-to-lightbulbs conglomerate also said its planned buyback programme will begin on Monday. It plans to repurchase some 2 billion euros of shares up to the end of April 20
