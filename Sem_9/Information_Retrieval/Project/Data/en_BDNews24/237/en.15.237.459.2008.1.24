 MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga described his astonishing straight-sets demolition of second seed Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open semi-finals on Thursday as "ridiculous". The muscular Tsonga blasted the Spaniard off court 6-2 6-3 6-2 with a dazzling array of shots on Rod Laver Arena to secure the biggest victory of his career. "It was ridiculous," Tsonga told reporters. "For me it's a big dream. It's just amazing. I played unbelievable tonight." The 22-year-old Tsonga, playing only his fifth grand slam tournament, has been plagued by a succession of back and shoulder injuries during his career and has never won a tour title. He knocked out seeds Andy Murray, Richard Gasquet and Mikhail Youzhny on the way to the last four but he raised his game another notch to overwhelm in-form Nadal. "Rafael plays the same tennis all the time," Tsonga said. "His level is very high and it's very difficult to play against him. But I was just concentrating on my own game. I was moving on the court like never I move, so everything was perfect." Tsonga will play world number one Roger Federer or third seed Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final. "I will do my best on the court, so I know it's going to be difficult to beat me," he said
