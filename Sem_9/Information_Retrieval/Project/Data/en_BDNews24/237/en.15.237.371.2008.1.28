 Tokyo, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A teacher at a Tokyo school was arrested on Monday for making a group of boys undress at knifepoint and stealing their underpants, Kyodo news agency reported. A group of eight boys aged 12 to 13 were playing in school grounds earlier this month when the 26-year-old man, who teaches at a different school, approached them, Kyodo said. Two of the boys ran away but he made the other six take off their trousers and underpants, it quoted local police as saying. The knife touched one boy, causing minor injuries, it said. The teacher is also suspected of taking a mobile phone from one of the boys and making nuisance calls to his home afterwards, Kyodo said. The principal of the school where he taught was shown on TV saying he was a dedicated teacher. Tokyo police declined to comment on the case.
