<TITLE> SAfrica has national emergency due power cuts, gold up </TITLE>

 JOHANNESBURG/PRETORIA, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa said it had a national emergency on Friday due to power cuts that brought gold and platinum mining to a near standstill and sent precious metals to record highs. "This is a disaster in terms of production and economic growth," Fidelis Madavo, analyst at the Public Investment Corporation fund, said. "The government has to find an emergency solution to this problem." The country's main gold and the world's top platinum miner stopped production at all their South African mines. Anglo Coal South Africa evacuated miners at all of its operations on fears they might be trapped due to the sweeping power outages. Spot gold hit a record high of $923.40 an ounce and platinum hit a historic high at $1,697 an ounce after news of the closures. The rand currency dipped more than two percent against the dollar and local stocks tumbled. There were calls for a shake-up of President Thabo Mbeki's government after two weeks of outages that darkened houses and brought businesses to a standstill. "It is the view of cabinet that the unprecedented, unplanned power outages must now be treated as a national electricity emergency that has to be addressed with the urgent, vigorous and coordinated actions commensurate with such an emergency situation," Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin said. The shutdowns rocked the mining sector, a cornerstone of Africa's biggest economy, and shares in mining firms dived. The country's top-three gold miners, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, and Harmony said they had stopped all gold mining after state-owned power utility Eskom told them on Thursday night it could not guarantee power supply to their operations. Eskom, under fire for failing to boost capacity amid clear signs of rising demand, informed the miners that electricity to key industrial customers would be reduced to "survival levels" or switched off totally for the next two-to-four weeks. Gold Fields said it would lose 7,000 ounces of gold a day, while rival Harmony said it would lose about 300 kg of gold output, or 60 million rand, a day. AngloGold said it could not estimate its daily losses yet. Xstrata cut ferrochrome and vanadium output to reduce power usage. "This will have a serious effect on the South African operations and will negatively affect our gold production," Ian Cockerill, chief executive officer of Gold Fields, said. The world's No. 1 platinum producer, Anglo Platinum (Angloplat), also said it had shut down production at all its South African mines to reduce electricity consumption. ECONOMIC CONCERN Analysts expressed concerns that South Africa's booming economy, which grew near a three-decade high at 5.4 percent in 2006, could struggle to maintain its recent growth rates, which are key to reducing chronic high unemployment and poverty. Government officials assured investors and the public that healthy economic growth could continue with some changes in energy consumption and that the power crisis would not threaten the country's ability to host the 2010 soccer World Cup. Eskom Chief Executive Jacob Maroga told a briefing in Pretoria that high demand for coal was one of the biggest headaches facing the utility. Maroga briefed Mbeki's cabinet on the crisis earlier this week. "There has been a surge of demand for coal, and as a result of that, some companies who used to be the reliable suppliers of coal to Eskom are beginning to see greener pastures elsewhere to the detriment of the South African society," Maroga said. The government also has said that routine maintenance of power stations, breakdowns at other plants and unexpectedly faster economic growth contributed to the shortfall in supply. Critics say the government has failed to invest in new power generation and see the shortage as a self-inflicted energy wound that could have been averted when warnings from industry and others first surfaced more than a decade ago. South Africa, the world's lowest-cost electricity producer, relies on coal for most of its electricity. Eskom plans to spend 300 billion rand ($42.55 billion) on new power generation and on improving its infrastructure in the next five years. Shares in AngloGold and Harmony fell as much as 7 percent, while Gold Fields lost 9 percent. Angloplat's stock fell 2 percent, while rival Implats shed 3 percent.
