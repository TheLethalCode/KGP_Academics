<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo is ready to declare independence in coming days, the breakaway Serb province's Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said on Thursday without giving a more precise timetable after talks in Brussels. "There are some procedures we need to respect and some consultations we needed to respect ... It is an issue of days," Thaci told reporters after meeting EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. Solana said he and Thaci had not discussed any possible dates for a declaration. One EU source said he understood there was no agreement yet on a precise date for such a move, which the United States and many European capitals are seen backing.
