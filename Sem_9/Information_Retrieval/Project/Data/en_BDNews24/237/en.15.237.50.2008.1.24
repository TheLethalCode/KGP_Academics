 MOSCOW, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian prosecutors asked a court on Thursday to jail an ex-Atomic Energy Minister for nine years on charges of corruption and undermining nuclear safety in a case that extends to the United States and Switzerland. Charges are also outstanding in the United States against the former Russian minister, Yevgeny Adamov, who is accused by US prosecutors of misusing $9 million in aid intended to upgrade safety at Soviet-era nuclear reactors in the late 1990s. Speaking at Adamov's trial, Prosecutor Viktor Antipov accused the ex-minister, along with the director of a thermonuclear research institute and a third man, of fraud and abuse of office. "The actions of the accused led to Russia losing control over the proliferation of nuclear materials, as it relates to low-enriched uranium," the prosecutor told the Moscow court. Adamov's lawyer, Genry Reznik, told reporters outside the court his client faced a "a tome of accusations....But there was no proof of their guilt." He said the defence would take the floor in court on Jan. 28. On Jan. 11, a Swiss court dropped its own investigation into Adamov's daughter, citing lack of evidence and unfroze funds connected to the case, although the amount was not revealed. Adamov became the subject of an international extradition wrangle between Russia and the United States after he was arrested while visiting his daughter Irina Adamova in Switzerland in May 2005. A Swiss ruling to extradite him back to Russia irked the United States, which wanted to try Adamov on its own soil. The United States indictment against Adamov is still outstanding, a US Embassy official in Moscow said on Thursday. Adamov, who served under former President Boris Yeltsin, did not deny that he put US money into his private accounts. But he said this was normal practice in Russia to shield money from hyperinflation, an unstable banking system and corruption that was rife after the collapse of Communism.
