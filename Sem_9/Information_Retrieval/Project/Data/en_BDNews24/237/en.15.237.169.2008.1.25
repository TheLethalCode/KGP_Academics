 SALVO, North Carolina, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disgraced Olympic 100 metres champion Justin Gatlin still has a dream. "I'm just like a little boy. All I want to do is run," the 25-year-old told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Pensacola, Florida. The American sprinter refuses to give up on his dream of competing in this year's Beijing Games even if he knows the chance to chase Olympic gold may have gone forever as a result of a four-year doping ban. A three-member American Arbitration Association (AAA) panel has banned Gatlin through May 2010 for a 2006 positive test for the banned male sex hormone testosterone and its precursors, ruling it was Gatlin's second positive. Gatlin and his attorney, Maurice Suh, have appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and are seeking the removal of his first positive in 2001. In that case, Gatlin tested positive for an amphetamine contained in a medication he took for 10 years for Attention Deficit Disorder. If the appeal is successful it could clear the way for Gatlin to receive a two-year ban for the 2006 test and become eligible to compete in May, a month ahead of the U.S. Olympic trials for the Beijing Games. "To hear those words 'I can run" would awaken the beast," Gatlin said in the interview on Wednesday. "I think I would be better than ever because I would have a mission. I would have a purpose, I would have something to live for," he added. "I don't have shadow of a doubt that I could make the (2008 U.S. Olympic) team. I hope I get the opportunity." IN LIMBO Gatlin works daily, both on the track and in the weight room, to keep his body in sprinter's shape but life is very different now for the 2005 world 100 and 200 metres champion. "There are nights where I cry myself to sleep. There are nights where I can't sleep at all," he said. "It is like I have been attacked with this bad omen...there are some days when I think this is such a bad dream, I just want to wake up." Even in Pensacola, where many still know him as the hometown hero, there is criticism. "I woke up one morning at my parents house, and written on the side of my vehicle there was 'Just Say No to Steroids,'" Gatlin said. "That really hurt. "I wiped it off and went in the house and broke down. It was painful." Being called a cheat also hurts. "People called me a cheat in 2001, but am I a cheat because I have to take (a medication) to concentrate? "People need to step back and realize what is going on in the situation," he said. How and why he tested positive in 2006 still baffles him. "I really don't know," he said, again denying he had ever knowingly taken performance-enhancing drugs. "If I rule out the different things that could have happened, I only come up with one thing that makes sense. I was sabotaged, and the only person that touches my body is the masseur," he said. The masseur has denied using a performance-enhancing cream on Gatlin. "If I could change anything, I would change going to Kansas," Gatlin added. "I didn't test positive anywhere else. Why would I test positive at Kansas Relays where I just ran a relay.....This is something odd. Why? "I don't think anybody wanted to consider that it was odd, maybe because I was coached by Trevor Graham." Graham is scheduled for trial later this year on federal charges of lying to federal investigators. More than a half-dozen athletes he coached or previously coached have been banned for steroid use, including disgraced former world record holder Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones. Asked if he should have left Graham following the 2004 Olympics, Gatlin replied," In 20-20 hindsight now, yes." How CAS will look at his case, Gatlin said he was unsure. "I know when I had the (U.S.) arbitration for the '06 case in Atlanta, it was the worst three days of my life," he said. "I stressed so much I made myself sick.
