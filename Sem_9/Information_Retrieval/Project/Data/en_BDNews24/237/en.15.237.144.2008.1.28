<TITLE> South Korea, EU try to revive momentum for trade deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean and EU trade envoys began fresh trade talks on Monday with plans to steer clear of sensitive topics such as cars in order to move discussions forward. South Korea's chief negotiator said he hopes to strike a deal by May with the country's second largest trade partner after China. A South Korea-EU pact could increase their annual $80 billion in trade by about 25 percent, studies have said. "There is an understanding that separate negotiations will not take place this time on automobiles because additional time is needed to work on the differences in views," the South Korean trade ministry said in a statement. The two sides launched talks in May 2007, shortly after South Korea struck a free trade agreement with the United States, but they failed to meet an end of year deadline to finalise an agreement. This round of talks is slated to end on Friday. The EU has said South Korea's proposed measures on technical standards would hurt European car exporters and warned it could scupper the talks. South Korea has said it would see if more concessions on standards such as vehicle emissions were possible. South Korea has some of the lowest import auto penetration levels in the developed world due to tariffs and technical barriers that favour domestic cars, foreign automakers have said.
