<TITLE> LabAid says sorry for news conference fiasco, alleges conspiracy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  LabAid Hospital authorities Saturday denied any direct involvement but apologised for obstructing a scheduled news conference by the father of a child who died allegedly from negligence by the hospital. "I am very sorry for the incident," the hospital's managing director Dr Abu Mohammad Shamim said at a press conference in the city. He said that not the hospital authorities but "one or two people" of the hospital were involved in obstructing the news briefing. Shafiqul Islam, father of Afiya who died due to alleged negligence of duty by doctors and mismanagement, had planned to speak to reporters at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Jan 1. But he could not do so. Later Shafiqul alleged that LabAid Hospital authorities had foiled his press conference at the DRU. DRU president Alamgir Hossain had said earlier that he cancelled the news conference after a senior journalist asked him to do so. Alamgir later apologised for the incident and the organisation's executive committee had condemned the decision. The LabAid managing director Saturday said: "We came to know that a few of our people were involved in the incident. Action will be taken against them." LabAid's press conference came three days after eight people went public on Jan 23 with their grievances against the hospital. The eight had said that negligence of duty, mismanagement and wrong treatment were pervasive in the hospital. One Mehnaz Ahmed, who also attended the Jan 23 press conference and claimed to be a physician of Brooklyn Hospital in New York, said that she was also one of the victims. Mehnaz said her mother Mostari Begum was admitted to LabAid Hospital with chest pains on Sept 16, 2004. The doctors at the emergency could not detect the disease and referred the patient to the central hospital where she suffered a heart attack. Mostari was then taken back to LabAid in the evening, but senior consultant Dr APM Sohrabuzzaman treating her came midday the next day. Mostari died. Mirpur trader Parvez alleged that his father AKM Fazlul Haq died from wrong treatment. He said that LabAid general manager Imran Chowdhury beat his brother as he protested the mismanagement at the hospital. LabAid's chief administrator Dr Manjur A Molla Saturday trashed the allegations and said there was a "deep-rooted conspiracy" against the hospital. He said that there had been "relentless propaganda" against the hospital in the last two and a half months. Molla said the patients used to go abroad for treatment but the trend changed as treatment of the international standards was available at home. It saves Tk 6,000 crore every year and that agents of foreign hospitals have not accepted the changes, he said. The administrator denied the allegation made by the daughter of Mostari Begum. The matter is now on trial, he said, questioning the prudence of a press conference on a matter pending with court. About the death of Afiya, he said the 45-day-old baby had four holes in her heart and that major vessels in the heart were not in order. "Necessary treatment for her was not available in Bangladesh. We tried our best and talked to her family. They later wanted to take her to another hospital and we agreed," he said. He said doctors reviewed the records of the treatment applied to the people, but found no evidence of negligence. Referring to statistics of the American College of Cardiology, Molla said that the deaths of 12 patients in case of stenting out of every 1,000, was not unusual. There were 2,750 such surgeries in the hospital in the last three and half years, but only 17 patients died. He alleged that a website had been opened to taint the reputation of the hospital. Misleading information was being sent to newspapers, senior government officials and intelligence agencies, Molla alleged. bdnew
