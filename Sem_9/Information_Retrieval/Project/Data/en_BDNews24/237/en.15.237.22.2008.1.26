 Davos, Switzerland, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks between trade ministers this week could help to create new momentum for getting a long-delayed world trade deal this year, the top US trade official said on Saturday. "President (George W.) Bush is fully committed to a successful Doha round outcome in 2008," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab told Reuters. "The talks here in Davos this week could prove significant in terms of regaining momentum. There is a sense of urgency about what is going on in the world economy. We're going to be quietly optimistic," she said. Trade ministers from several countries have held bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week. They are due to gather for a lunch on Saturday with World Trade Organisation (WTO) chief Pascal Lamy at which they will discuss the chances of getting a breakthrough in the WTO's Doha round of negotiations for a global trade deal. Brazil's foreign minister said on Friday the mood seemed right for a push to try to complete the Doha round. Without a deal soon, the round -- launched in 2001 -- risks further delay as the United States heads into its presidential election campaign and a change in administration.
