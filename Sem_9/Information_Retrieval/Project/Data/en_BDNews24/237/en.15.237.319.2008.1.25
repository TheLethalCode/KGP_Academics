 ADELAIDE, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's Adam Gilchrist hopes to finally get the recognition he deserves for his prowess behind the stumps after the wicketkeeper-batsman broke the world record for the most test dismissals on Friday. Gilchrist bettered South African Mark Boucher's world record when he caught Indian captain Anil Kumble shortly after the tea interval on the second day of the fourth and final test. The catch gave Gilchrist his 414th victim, eclipsing Boucher's record of 413, and added another milestone to his glittering career. "I am thrilled to be the world record holder," he told a news conference. "It is a really nice satisfying achievement. "It is not something that you set out to achieve, if you set out with that in mind you are never going to get close. "You just play your cricket and all the sudden you creep up and get close." Breaking records is nothing new for Gilchrist although most of his previous feats have been with the bat. A devastating striker of the ball, the lefthander has long been regarded as one of the most exciting players of his generation. However, Gilchrist believes his success with the bat has unwittingly detracted from his glovework and he has been heavily criticised at times in his career. "It has always felt like, with my keeping, I always have had to maintain the high standards and if I didn't people will pounce on it very quickly," he said. "I'm not sure if that is a result of my batting and people suggesting that I am just a batsman and a backstop, I've used that as incentive to help motivate me and I feel like I've maintained a high standard more often than not. NOT RETIRING "I've made a lot of mistakes, if you rock for 96 test matches you are going to make the odd mistake. "I've always felt there have been some critics out there that have been quick to pounce, but it's those critics that you use as a little bit of inspiration and encouragement to keep going and get better and try and improve and hopefully that's what I've been able to do." At 36, Gilchrist is in the twilight of his career and has little else to achieve, though he says he has no intentions to retire. He has played in three World Cup winning sides and had the honour of captaining his country, even though he waited longer than most to get his chance to play for Australia. Gilchrist was included in the Australian one-day team in 1996 as an opening batsman and wicketkeeper but did not make his test debut for another three years, despite playing 76 limited-overs internationals and helping his country win the 1999 World Cup. It was not until Ian Healy, Australia's last world record holder for wicketkeeping dismissals, retired in November 1999 that Gilchrist finally got his test chance. After waiting so long, Gilchrist was always in a hurry to make up for lost time and apart from his dismissals -- made up of 377 catches and 37 stumpings -- he has also scored 5,556 runs at an average of 47.89, plus 17 hundreds and a high score of 204 not out. "I just want to keep playing, I've been enjoying it," he said. "I've had the best of the best...(Shane) Warne, Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie, all of them have been brilliant. "I've had the best journey keeping to those blokes, they are why I can sit here and talk about this record.
