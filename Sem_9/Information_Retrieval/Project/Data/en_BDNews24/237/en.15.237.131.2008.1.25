 WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House condemned the bombing on Friday in a Beirut suburb that killed at least three people and said it was aimed at undermining Lebanese institutions. "We strongly condemn the terrorist bombing in Beirut today that killed a police captain and many other Lebanese. This bombing is an attack by those who seek to undermine Lebanon's institutions, the democratic process and to delay further the selection of a new Lebanese president," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. The blast near an overpass on a busy road in a mainly Christian suburb targeted a vehicle used by a senior police official, a security source said.
