<TITLE> Race relations challenge country on Australia Day: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sydney, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Race relations between black and white Australians is one of the nation's great challenges, the country's new prime minister said in an "Australia Day" message, as the word "Sorry" was written in the sky above Bondi Beach. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, elected last November, has promised to say sorry to Aborigines for past injustices, reversing an 11-year policy under the previous conservative government that damaged race relations. "Australia Day is a time to celebrate our nation's past achievements and it's a time to embrace our nation's future," Rudd said on Saturday. "We should be deeply proud of our country. Proud of aboriginal culture, which represents the oldest continuing culture in human history," he said. "We stand in awe as we hear the songs and the sounds and the stories and the music which have come down to us from antiquity," he said on Australia's national day. Aborigines are Australia's most disadvantaged group with many living in third-world conditions in remote outback settlements. Aborigines and indigenous Torres Strait Islanders number only 460,000, 2 percent of the country's 20 million population, and have a life expectancy 17 years less than white Australians. They have far higher rates of unemployment, imprisonment, alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence. Rudd said Australia faced great challenges such as climate change and an uncertain global economic outlook, and "how to achieve effective reconciliation, so that we can all move forward together -- aboriginal and non-aboriginal Australia". "These challenges are great," said Rudd. "As prime minister, I am optimistic, supremely optimistic, about what our nation can achieve in the future." On a typically hot, summer's day, millions of Australians celebrated their national day in iconic fashion, with beach picnics, barbecues, and cricket and tennis. As a sky-writing aircraft wrote "Sorry" above Bondi, hundreds of people floated in the surf on green and gold (national colours) inflatable mats, as lifesavers patrolled for sharks. Gambling-mad Australians in Brisbane wagered on cockroach races, with insects named Roachback Mountain and Cockzilla. Sydney Harbour was closed to commercial ships, as about 2,000 spectator boats watched a commuter ferry boat race, kicking off celebrations that will end in a fireworks display. RACE RELATIONS The Australia Day Council said the national day was no longer just a celebration of white Australia, but also a focus for racial reconciliation with the nation's indigenous people. "I'm also glad to see the large number of people of indigenous backgrounds out celebrating Australia Day," said Michael Egan, Australia Day chairman in New South Wales state. Aboriginal leaders have long demanded the Australian government issue an apology, using the word "sorry", for past injustices such as the assimilation policies that took black children from families to be raised in white families. Those children are called the "Stolen Generation". Rudd is expected to say sorry when his government sits in parliament for the first time in February. Until 1967 Aborigines were governed under flora and fauna laws. In a referendum that year, Australians voted to include Aborigines in the national census and be granted citizenship. Governor-General Major-General Michael Jeffery, who represents Australia's head-of-state Britain's Queen Elizabeth, said "Australia Day" was a time to reflect on the success in forging a peaceful and prosperous multi-cultural society. But Jeffery said Aborigines were the nation's first settlers and their ancient culture should also be celebrated. "I will continue to encourage all Australians to care for ourselves, for one another, our nation and the land...," he said. "We can, for example, care for our nation by celebrating our unique 60 millennium history as a settled land..."
