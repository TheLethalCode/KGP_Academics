 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The cold spell sharpened by drizzles will start fading from Dhaka Sunday, a weather forecaster said. Dhaka skies were cloudy with periods of rain. Light and variable winds added to the chill factor. Morning fog twinned with drizzles slowed life in the capital. Dhaka's lowest temperature for Saturday was recorded at 15.7 degrees Celsius, according to a weather bulletin released at 9am. Another cold spell is likely to strike in a couple of days, AM Mahmudul Haque, weather official of the Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com. Weather conditions are likely to improve in Rajshahi, Dinajpur and Rangpur Saturday, he added. Riverside regions remained covered by fog Saturday. In the capital, slum dwellers and children are the worst victims of the cold bite. Authorities cut short the three-day Biswa Ijtema, the second largest congregation of Muslims after hajj, with final prayers Friday because of the cold weather and drizzles. bdnews24
