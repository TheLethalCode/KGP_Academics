 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh is unlikely to take part in the World Hockey Olympic Qualifying round because of fund crisis. One of three qualifying rounds is scheduled to start on March 1 in Santiago, Chile, with Australia, Bangladesh, Great Britain, India, Mexico and the hosts playing in a group. Three top teams of the three groups will join five continental champions along with hosts China in Beijing Olympic 2008. "We need a huge budget of Tk 61 lakh to travel Chile and we have requested the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) and the National Sports Council to provide the fund for the qualifiers," Bangladesh Hockey Federation general secretary Sajed AA Adel told bdnews24.com Thursday. "We told them verbally that we are not able to provide such a huge fund in a short time," BOA director and chief operative official Col (retd) Waliullah told bdnews24.com. When attention was drawn to Waliullah's comment, Adel said they were now waiting for the official announcement from the BOA. Adel, however, saw a ray of hope to go to Chile if Dhaka Bank sponsors the national team. "We have written a letter to Dhaka Bank today (Thursday) for sponsoring the national team for the Olympic Qualifying round. If they say 'yes', then we start taking preparation," Adel said. In the last World Cup qualifiers in Scotland in 2001, Bangladesh finished 16th out of 16 nations. Bangladesh lost to Argentina 8-4, Belgium 5-0, France 5-2, Scotland 7-0, Wales 1-0, Russia 5-0, Egypt 2-0 and Russia 4-2.
