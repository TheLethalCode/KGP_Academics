 NAIROBI, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki on Thursday to try to end a crisis over the nation's disputed election, after having persuaded the opposition to call off street protests. The 69-year-old statesman met with the Kenyan president for just over an hour at Kibaki's official State House residence in the capital Nairobi, after discussions with African diplomats and African Union representatives. "These were just the initial talks," presidential spokesman Isaiya Kabira said. Opposition leader Raila Odinga and other officials of his Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) met Annan late on Wednesday, and agreed to call off protests planned for Thursday.

Diplomats hope Annan can bring about a power-sharing deal between Kibaki and Odinga. World powers have urged the two to sit down and many ordinary Kenyans are furious they have not in the face of the continued fighting. ODM demanded international mediators, saying it has no faith in Kenya's courts or institutions -- especially the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK), which was internationally criticised for its handling of the tallying. The ECK's Dec. 30 announcement that Kibaki won amid claims of rigging on both sides, enflamed parts of the country already tense or breaking out in violence over the delayed tallying. The government has been cool to outside mediation from the start, saying Kenya has more developed institutions than other African states that do need external he
