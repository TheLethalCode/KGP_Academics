 PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis scored a century to guide South Africa to a one-day series win over West Indies on Sunday. South Africa won by seven wickets with eight balls to spare to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Kallis struck 121 not out in South Africa's total of 256 for three after West Indies, who won the toss, made 252 for seven from 50 overs with Marlon Samuels top-scoring on 98. Kallis faced 133 balls and hit 12 fours and a six in his 16th one-day century. The visitors were put on the path to their useful total in a second-wicket stand of 75 between Sewnarine Chattergoon and debutant Patrick Browne. The partnership was ended in the 24th over when off-spinner Johan Botha bowled Chattergoon off the edge of his bat for 52. Botha struck again four overs later to trap Browne in front for 35. Samuels struggled to find firm support in the second half of the innings, and he took on most of the responsibility for raising the scoring rate in the final overs. Samuels was dismissed with the last ball of the innings when he attempted to hit fast bowler Morne Morkel out of the ground to reach his century and was caught by JP Duminy at long-on. Number three batsman Kallis came to the crease in the eighth over with 40 runs on the board after opener Herschelle Gibbs (15) slashed a delivery from fast bowler Daren Powell into the hands of Jerome Taylor running around the boundary from third man. Kallis and Graeme Smith added 82 for the second wicket before Smith pulled a ball from off-spinner Samuels and was smartly caught by Darren Sammy at short mid-wicket for 56. South Africa fell to 168-3 in the 34th over when AB de Villiers (18) skied a ball from fast bowler Fidel Edwards to Taylor at mid-on. Kallis and JP Duminy, who was 36 not out, ensured South Africa stayed on track for victory with an unbroken stand of 88 for the fourth wicket. The fourth match will be played in Durban on Friday
