 Davos, Switzerland, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Economic firefighters claim to be cooperating on global crises like never before, but an array of global bodies with overlapping and competing roles fails to dispel anxiety over how the world economy is policed. This year's annual World Economic Forum in Davos was overwhelmed by the global credit market and banking turmoil of the past six months and many of the 2,500 business and government delegates wanted to know who was sorting it all out. If the net result of the recent financial seizure is the first serious world economic slowdown in six years, the question was a reasonable one. Not everyone was convinced by the answer. In a vote taken at one "brainstorming" session in the Swiss ski resort, the number one threat to the world economy this year was seen as a lack of a coordinated response to crisis. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown seemed underwhelmed too. "If anything there has not been enough globalisation," Brown told a Davos gathering. "There has not been enough contact between regulatory supervisors and a recognition that we are going to have to have global insitutions for global markets." For sure, central banks from the Group of Seven industrialised nations did act in concert last month to loan banks enough cash to get them through a perilous yearend. But there has been little appetite to go beyond that and, for example, lower interest rates in tandem. After stock markets in Asia and Europe plumetted earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Reserve executed an emergency rate cut -- its biggest in more than 20 years -- to ward off a similar move on Wall St. The European Central Bank stood pat. Differing mandates and underlying economies out of synch was a fair excuse. But the sequence of events did not instill confidence that the world's two most influential central banks were singing from the same hymn sheet. "The thing that markets are desperate for right now is leadership, whether globally or regionally, and it seems this is lacking," John Studzinski, head of U.S. private equity firm Blackstone's advisory business, said on Wednesday. Veteran financier George Soros was more blunt. "Central banks have lost control." CONSTANT CONTACT? Many officials in Davos insisted central banks and governments were in constant contact over the crisis. "There has been an enormous amount of cooperation that has taken place within the context of near-term policy decisions," Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David McCormick told Reuters. Yet, there were doubts about how close institutions were on other matters. On Thursday, a Fed source said the U.S. central bank was not informed by the Bank of France of a $7 bln trader fraud at Societe Generale. The French central bank found out on Sunday. Some in financial markets believe the unwinding of trades associated with the fraud may have triggered Monday's equity market rout and, by extension, the Fed's dramatic response. Then there is the issue of who organises central bank contact anyway. The assumption is that the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, where the world's major central banks meet regularly, is the key forum -- even though day-to-day contact is more likely ad hoc and informal. But another question is where that leaves the International Monetary Fund, tasked for the past 60 years with being the world's financial firefighter. The IMF, which spent much of the last 30 years bailing out crisis-hit developing countries, is trying to re-invent itself now that emerging markets have accumulated vast stores of their own reserves during five years of rapid globalisation. But its attempts to re-position itself as a policy policeman that will warn of contagion from the financial world seeping into real economies seemed to come too late for the latest crisis. How soon it can cement that role is still debateable. Instead, the G7's Financial Stability Forum -- a group of regulators and policymakers set up after the 1990s emerging market crises -- was tasked with the review of what went so awfully wrong with credit and financial markets last summer. Looking at market transparency, valuations and credit rating agencies, the FSF will liaise with the IMF on lessons learned. The IMF, on the other has been tasked with looking at concerns about investments in western companies by sovereign wealth funds from cash-rich emerging markets. But it is likely to share that role with the 30-nation Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Confused? It's not clear there is any one response. The G7 possibly provides an umbrella; but it is hard to find any economist of policymaker who thinks those seven rich countries in any way reflect the shape of economic power in the 21st century and will always be hamstrung by the absence of emerging giants in China, India, Brazil and elsewhere.
