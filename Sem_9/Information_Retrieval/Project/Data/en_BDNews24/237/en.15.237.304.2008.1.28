 BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers launched on Monday a long-delayed mission to eastern Chad to protect civilians and aid workers caught up in the violence in neighbouring Darfur. The 3,500-plus mission, likely the most demanding undertaken by the 27-member bloc, will start deploying in coming weeks and have an initial mandate for 12 months. "They will be on the ground before the rainy season, which is important," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told reporters. The operation, due also to have a presence in the Central African Republic, was to have started last October but suffered shortfalls in key equipment, notably helicopters. The operation will be led by Irish Lieutenant-General Patrick Nash, while former colonial power France is expected to provide more than half the troops. A further 13 EU states have pledged to provide troops, an EU diplomat said. The foreign ministers insisted in a joint statement that the mission would act in a "neutral, impartial and independent manner", a formula intended to reassure Chad rebels concerned that the operation might favour Chad leader Idriss Deby. The Darfur conflict has taken some 200,000 lives and driven more than two million from their homes since rebels took up arms against the government in 2003. Ministers also pledged that the operation would coordinate fully with the larger planned joint United Nations-African Union mission in Darfur itse
