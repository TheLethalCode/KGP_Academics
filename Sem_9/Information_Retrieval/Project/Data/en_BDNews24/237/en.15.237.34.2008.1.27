<TITLE> Italy's centre left in tatters after Prodi quits </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Riven by deep policy divisions and personal rivalries, Italy's centre left is in tatters after the collapse of Romano Prodi's government and faces a likely drubbing if a snap election is called. Prodi's resignation after several allies voted against him in the Senate was not just a defeat for the 68-year-old premier, but for the whole of his "suicidal" centre-left coalition, as one commentator put it. "The problem for the centre left is that it comes out of this test reduced to shreds. It does not exist anymore, and the score-settling has not even started yet," wrote Massimo Franco in an editorial in Corriere della Sera newspaper. Throughout Prodi's 20 months in power, the nine-party, Catholics-to-communists coalition that allowed him to narrowly beat Silvio Berlusconi in the 2006 election offered a grim spectacle of infighting and mutual sabotage. His so-called allies argued on just about everything, from foreign policy to gay rights, from economic reforms to abortion. "They only kept going through vetoes, threats and blackmail, weakening the prime minister and forcing him to mediate rather than take the lead," wrote left-leaning La Repubblica. Even fear that a government collapse would help Berlusconi -- who has a clear lead in opinion polls -- return to power was not enough to stop the bickering and defections. Tellingly, among the "allies" who voted with Berlusconi's centre right against Prodi on Thursday were Catholic centrists, liberal democrats and a hard-line communist. RIVALRY But perhaps the worst sign for the centre left is that its flagship, the Democratic Party (PD) which merged the bloc's two largest forces as Prodi pushed for greater unity, is also threatened by divisions three months after it was formed. Ever since Walter Veltroni, the Rome mayor and Prodi's heir to lead the centre left, took the helm of the PD last October, the rivalry between the two was laid bare. Veltroni immediately started negotiations with Berlusconi on how to reform Italy's messy electoral law, blamed for the chronic instability of governments. Although the talks failed, Veltroni's stream of headline-grabbing statements often overshadowed and surprised Prodi. While Prodi's collapse was ostensibly triggered by the pullout of the small Catholic Udeur party from his coalition, many political analysts say Veltroni also played a part. His pre-crisis announcement that the PD would run on its own at the next election irked coalition allies, particularly smaller parties who fear their weight will be greatly reduced in future governments if the voting rules are changed. "Veltroni's disastrous comments shattered the coalition and led to Prodi's fall," said communist senator Manuela Palermi. "Now the damage has been done, and to rebuild the centre left will be an arduous task."
