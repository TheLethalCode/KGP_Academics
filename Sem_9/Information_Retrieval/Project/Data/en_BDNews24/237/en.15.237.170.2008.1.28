<TEXT>
 Giribungun, Indonesia, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people lined the roads around Indonesia's royal city of Solo on Monday for the state funeral of autocratic former president Suharto at the family's mausoleum. Suharto's body was flown to Solo in central Java from Jakarta on Monday morning and then driven to the family mausoleum at Giribangun, 35 km (21 miles) northeast of the city. Ousted in 1998 in a student-led protest amid social and economic chaos, Suharto died in hospital on Sunday aged 86 after suffering multiple organ failure. He leaves a controversial legacy after 32 years in power. Praised by many as a visionary who helped modernise his country, he was also heavily criticised for widespread corruption and human rights abuses. "I on behalf of the nation and the Indonesian military, surrender the body and soul of Haji Muhammad Suharto to the soil of the motherland," said President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Suharto's coffin was then lowered into his grave, next to that of his wife, who died in 1996, and one salvo was fired. Tens of thousands of people, many with handheld TV cameras and cellphone cameras in their hands, lined the roads leading to the airport and the cemetery waiting to see the former president's funeral procession. Some waved as the hearse went by, others threw flowers. Security was tight at the family mausoleum where dozens of soldiers and police stood guard near blue and white tents erected for the stream of officials and dignitaries who arrived for the funeral. "I want to express my sympathies to Pak Harto and visit his grave so that I will also receive blessings and enjoy a healthy and prosperous life," said Suwarni, a 60 year old villager who managed to get in to the mausoleum. Suharto, the son of a minor official from a small village in central Java, married Siti Hartinah, a member of one of Solo's royal families, later using that connection to assume the manner of a Javanese king. The Suharto family mausoleum at Giribangun, built on a hilltop surrounded by trees, is only a few hundred feet from the Mangkunegaran royal family's tomb where the first, second, and third Mangkunegaran kings were buried. Antara reported two tonnes of jasmine flowers and 100 kg of red roses have been prepared for the funeral ceremony. DEBATE OVER LEGACY Suharto's admission to hospital in critical condition earlier this month sparked a national debate over his legacy. Some Indonesians argued his errors should be forgiven, while others urged the state to press ahead with a civil suit against him for graft, and to consider legal proceedings for human rights abuses. Despite his humiliating overthrow in 1998, many of the region's leaders and Indonesia's elite had rushed to his bedside to pay their respects as he lay dying. Singapore's former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew flew to Jakarta to see him, paying tribute to Suharto's role in bringing stability to the region, particularly during the Cold War period. At the family mausoleum, police and soldiers lined the streets, and flags flew at half-mast. "We will miss Pak Harto," said Sugito, a taxi driver, referring to Suharto by his common title and nickname. "He was a good president. He understood little people like us. Under Pak Harto, basic commodities were cheap. But the present government wants to lift all subsidies. Pak Harto built roads but now they don't even fix broken roads." Suharto rose to power after he led the military in 1965 against what was officially called an attempted communist coup. Up to 500,000 people were killed in an anti-communist purge in the months that followed. Over the next three decades, Suharto's armed forces committed numerous human rights abuses, killing student activists, criminals, and opponents to the regime in the rebellious provinces of Aceh and Papua, as well as in East Timor, which Indonesia invaded in 1975.
