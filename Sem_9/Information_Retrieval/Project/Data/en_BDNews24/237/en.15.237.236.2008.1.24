 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Thursday decided to close retail shops and malls in urban areas by 8 pm during the irrigation season to ensure the supply of electricity to rural areas. The government will implement the decision after discussing the move with shop owners. Any violation of the order will result in a fine and a disconnection of electricity to the shop. Agriculture secretary Abdul Aziz, power secretary Fauzul Kabir Khan, energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin were among those who approved the decision Thursday at a meeting at the PID conference room. The agriculture secretary said the current year's estimated demand for fertiliser is 28 lakh tonnes, of which 12 lakh tonnes would be required in the boro season. January's requirement for fertiliser was estimated at four lakh tonnes, which has already been allocated. Farmers can now collect fertiliser from around 14,000 dealers and dealers' representatives throughout the country. "The government has another five lakh tonnes of fertiliser stockpiled to meet February's demand," said Abdul. March's fertiliser requirement will stand at three lakh tonnes, half of which has been stockpiled by the government, said the secretary. "Initiatives have been taken to import the rest of the fertiliser as soon as possible," he said. The Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation has already started the process of importing 50,000 tonnes of the fertiliser required for March. This year, boro paddy would be planted on about 45 lakh hectares of land, up from 42 lakh hectares last year, Abdul said. "The government has taken the initiative to supply fertiliser, seeds and other agricultural needs to meet farmers' requirements," he added. The secretary said the government's existing policy will be followed in distributing current stocks of diesel. "Cash subsidies totalling 750 crore taka will be given to farmers for diesel-run pump irrigation. The money will be distributed under the supervision of the upazila nirbahi officer and joint forces," Azizul said. This is the first time such cash subsidies have been distributed to farmers, he said, adding that the money may take until mid-March to reach the recipients. Power secretary Fauzul Kabir Khan said the government plans to provide power connections to 2.25 lakh pumps used for irrigation. This amounts to 25,000 more pumps than last year, with connections already given to 1.60 lakh pumps, Fauzul said. "In January last year the production of electricity stood at 2,729 megawatts, this January 3,400 megawatts will have been produced," he added. About 800 to 1,000 MW of electricity will be allocated for agricultural irrigation. The power secretary stressed that this year priority had been given to ensuring the electricity supply to rural areas rather than in urban areas as in previous years. bdnew
