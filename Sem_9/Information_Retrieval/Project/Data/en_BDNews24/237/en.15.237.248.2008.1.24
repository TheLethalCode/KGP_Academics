<TITLE> Politicians say many things: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Election commissioner Sohul Hossain Thursday said the recent assertion by BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain that the commission was 'biased' would not interrupt their activities. "That statement will not slow down our activities in the slightest. Politicians say many things," Sohul said. Delwar, secretary general of the BNP and leader of the pro-Khaleda Zia faction, alleged Wednesday that a conspiracy was underway to hold a stage-managed election. "A programme will soon be announced to resist the conspiracy," said the secretary general at the seminar in the capital. The election commissioner said: "Our lawyer Dr Kamal Hossain appealed to the court on Tuesday and again today (Thursday) to resolve the issue quickly." "We hope a court hearing will be held by next week. We want to complete the dialogue this month," Sohul said. He said the commission wants to hold dialogue with all parties and finalise the electoral reform law by February. "We already have a draft of the laws. They will be finalised after discussions with the political parties," he said. Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan told reporters Wednesday that the constitution had been violated when the caretaker government failed to hold the national polls within 90 days of assuming power. In response, Sohul said: "Many more than 90 days passed before the present election commission took office." On Monday chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said the government would meet with the political parties after the EC concluded its dialogues with them. The major holdup in the process now is a writ petition filed on Nov 18 with the High Court on behalf of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. Following her petition, the court stayed the EC's request for talks with the opposing Hafizuddin Ahmed-led BNP faction for two weeks. The court also asked the commission to prove the legality of the invitation. The EC initiated dialogue with political parties on electoral reform laws on Sep 12 last year. They have now completed talks with 16 parties. Dialogue with the BNP was originally scheduled for Nov 22. bdnew
