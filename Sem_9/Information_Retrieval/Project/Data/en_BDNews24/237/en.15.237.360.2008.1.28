<TITLE> Germany`s Merkel suffers setback in state vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives suffered heavy losses in an election in the western state of Hesse on Sunday, dealing her a blow ahead of next year's national vote. Long-time Hesse Premier and Merkel ally Roland Koch had run a bitterly divisive campaign advocating crackdowns on foreign criminals which was backed by the chancellor but ultimately backfired. His Christian Democrats (CDU) took 36.6 percent of the vote, down sharply from the 49 percent they scored in the last Hesse election in 2003, and a shade behind the rival Social Democrats (SPD) at 36.9 percent, preliminary results showed. In a separate election in the northwestern state of Lower Saxony, CDU Premier Christian Wulff held on to power, but also saw his support dwindle from five years ago. While Wulff's victory had been widely expected, the vote in Hesse, home to Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, was seen as a crucial test for Merkel's party as it seeks momentum ahead of the next federal election in Sept. 2009. Merkel remains highly popular over two years after narrowly defeating Gerhard Schroeder and taking power atop an unorthodox left-right partnership between her CDU and the SPD. But she faces risks from a slowing economy and the outcome in Hesse represents a new setback. It could aggravate tensions in her already fraught "grand coalition" and bring policymaking to a standstill. "There's no doubt, it's a blow for Merkel," said Constanze Stelzenmueller, Berlin director of The German Marshall Fund. "It will increase tensions within her coalition." Nationally, the parties are at odds on issues ranging from tax and the minimum wage to energy, security and foreign policy. FINELY BALANCED Exit polls showed a finely balanced picture in Hesse, with the FDP, preferred partners of the CDU, on 9 percent and the Greens, with whom the SPD wants to share power, at 8 percent. Because both the big and small parties are so close, it is still unclear whether Koch will cling to power or cede it to SPD leftist Andrea Ypsilanti, who may now become the only woman state premier in Germany. But a gloomy Koch, who only a few months ago seemed assured of winning new term in the state he has ruled since 1999, sounded like the loser on Sunday. "We didn't mobilise our own supporters enough," Koch said on public television. "This is not easily for me personally." Ypsilanti, by contrast, was welcomed by cheering crowds of SPD backers in the state capital of Wiesbaden. She had failed to gain traction with her campaign for a minimum wage but rose sharply in the polls in recent weeks, benefiting from Koch's youth crime proposals, which immigrant groups denounced as xenophobic. "Dear comrades, tonight we can say that Social Democracy is back," Ypsilanti told her supporters. The elections in Hesse and Lower Saxony showed a clear shift to the left after years of dominating regional performances by Merkel's CDU, but the news was not all good for the SPD. The new Left party, a far-left grouping of ex-communists and disaffected blue collar workers that has been eating into SPD support in recent years, passed the 5 percent threshold to enter the parliament in Lower Saxony and looked on track to do the same in Hesse. It is the first time that the party, led by populist former German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, will enter parliament in a large western state.
