 MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Champion Roger Federer continues his bid for a 13th grand slam title with a mouth-watering Australian Open semi-final against young pretender Novak Djokovic on Friday. While Federer has reached the last four without playing anywhere near his best, third seed Djokovic has eased through the draw without dropping a set and looks ready to challenge the Swiss maestro's dominance of the sport. The world number one, however, is confident his experience will subdue the 20-year-old Serb. "I'm looking at history, looking at my own game," Federer said. "I'm number one in the world, so I'm more concentrated on that than the youngsters." Djokovic has seen off former world number one Lleyton Hewitt and fifth seed David Ferrer in the last two rounds and has been talking up his chances of toppling Federer. The Swiss, however, is unconcerned. "I have absolutely no problems with what Novak has been saying or apparently been saying," Federer said. "I really don't care because he cares about his game. It's good when we play each other." Federer has won five of their six matches, including last year's U.S. Open final, but Djokovic produced a superb performance to beat the Swiss in last year's Montreal Masters final. "It's an amazing feeling," Djokovic said. "They were saying the year after breakthrough year is the most difficult one but I'm feeling really really good at the moment, physically and mentally. I'm playing with a lot of confidence." The winner of Friday night's clash on Rod Laver Arena will play unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final on Sunday
