<TITLE> Hamas says accepts invitation to meet Fatah in Cairo </TITLE>

 Damascus, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas accepted on Friday an invitation by Egypt to hold talks with President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction in Cairo to solve the Palestinian schism. "I and all the brothers in the Hamas leadership welcome participating and will seek to make the dialogue a success," Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal told Reuters. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in an interview to be published on Saturday, invited the two sides to meet for talks in Cairo. The rift between Hamas and Fatah widened after Abbas agreed to re-launch peace talks with Israel following the Annapolis peace conference that convened in the United States in November. Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June after routing forces loyal to Abbas in fighting that killed dozens of Palestinians. Abbas has demanded that Hamas relinquish its hold on Gaza and agree to early presidential and parliamentary elections before resuming a dialogue with the Islamist group. Hamas, which defeated Fatah in elections in 2006, has rejected those terms and called for unconditional talks.
