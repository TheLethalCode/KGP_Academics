 Brdo, Slovenia, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said on Friday he was concerned that the UN Security Council remained deeply divided over Kosovo and the impasse could be dangerous. The leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, who make up 90 percent of the breakaway province's 2 million people, say they are within weeks of declaring independence from Serbia. The United States and major European Union powers are expected to recognise the move despite opposition from Belgrade and its main ally -- and U.N. Security Council member -- Russia. "I have expressed my concern about the fact that the Security Council still remains deeply divided on the way forward on Kosovo, this is dangerous for the situation on Kosovo," Ban told a news conference after meeting Slovenia's prime minister. "If this impasse continues the situation may take its own dynamics ... this will be very dangerous." Ban declined to say whether he supported EU plans for a police and justice mission in Kosovo or if an existing U.N. Security Council resolution gave legal grounds for the mission, which the EU is expected to endorse in February. Asked if Security Council resolution 1244, adopted in 1999 after NATO air forces drove Serb troops out of Kosovo, provided adequate legal basis for the continued presence of outside peacekeepers and overseers, he said: "I will assess the situation as it develops in the future... I will have to closely consider and examine the legal implications of this, therefore I am not at this time in a position to say any definitive answer." Diplomats say Kosovo's declaration of independence could come in February or March, following a run-off election for Serbian president on Feb 3. Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said in Brussels on Thursday the declaration was "an issue of days".
