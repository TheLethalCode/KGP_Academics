<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday petitioned the High Court to cancel an extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against her. Her lawyers filed the appeal with the bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mohammad Abdul Hye. The appeal argued that there had been no allegation against Hasina either in the case details or charge sheet or in other documents. Besides, Chowdhury himself had recently said he did not charge the detained former head of government in the case. Chowdhury, chairman of Prime Bank, Thursday told reporters that he did not file any case against Hasina. He also said that he had no idea how Hasina's name surfaced in the case. "Sheikh Hasina is the daughter of Bangabandhu (independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman). She was prime minister of the country. I cannot even think of suing her," Chowdhury said to reporters. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana, who lives in England, and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are the other accused in the case. Chowdhury said he had filed a case only against Selim for extorting money from him in return for a promised deal. bdnew
