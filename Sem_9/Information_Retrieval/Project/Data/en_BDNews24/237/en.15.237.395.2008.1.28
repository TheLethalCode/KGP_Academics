 HONG KONG, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks slid 4.3 percent on Monday, tracking regional losses, as investors booked profits after a pre-weekend rally on concerns that the US central bank might not cut a key interest rate as much as expected to blunt a slowdown in the world's largest economy. But coal shares were a bright spot after China told its miners and port authorities to stop coal exports for the next two months to end a severe power crisis. Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the US dollar and thus sensitive to US rate cycles, was a top loser on a day when equity markets tumbled across Asia. Deep losses in global stock markets a week ago spurred the Federal Reserve into making a 75 basis point reduction in its benchmark overnight rate, its biggest in more than 23 years. "People are worried the Fed might not cut by another 50 basis points," said Andrew To, sales director at Tai Fook Securities. "But if the Fed disappoints, it may have to do more later." The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed down 4.3 percent, or 1,068.76 points, at 24,053.61, having earlier fallen more than 6 percent to near its 250-day moving average. The China Enterprises index of H shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, fell 5 percent, or 696.26 points, to 13,319.49. "I would be on the buy side, because we're so close to the 250-day moving average," To said. "If we can hold at these levels, there may be a rebound towards Chinese New Year." Among coal plays, Chinese coking coal miner Hidili Industry International Development was the top gainer, finishing up 2.5 percent at HK$10.5. Yanzhou Coal rose 2.7 percent to HK$13.96 and China Coal put on 1.2 percent to HK$20.95. Chinese oil firm CNOOC Ltd ended down 5.6 percent at HK$11.08. The company has sold a 3.06 percent interest in Indonesia's Tangguh liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to Canada's Talisman Energy for US$ 212.5 million, it said in a statement on Monday. News of heavy snow across central and eastern China sent shares in Chinese down apparel company Bosideng International Holdings Ltd up 14.1 percent to HK$2.10. Mainland financials were among the worst-performing sectors after posting fat gains on Friday. China Life, the morning's most active stock, fell 6.3 percent to HK$31.4 and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China skidded 5.4 percent to HK$4.92. China Construction Bank dropped 5.8 percent to HK$5.83. It said on Friday that it had priced 2.765 billion yuan ($384 million) of securities backed by non-performing loans, the first ABS deal by a Chinese bank that involves NPLs. Cellular operator China Mobile slid 4.8 percent to HK$117.1. Bellwether and global bank HSBC Holdings plc shed 3.3 percent to HK$116.5. Mainboard turnover was HK$107.8 billion (US$13.8 billion), compared to Friday's HK$126.7 billion. (US$1=HK$7
