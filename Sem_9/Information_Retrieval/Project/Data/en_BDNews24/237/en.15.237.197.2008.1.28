 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday fixed Feb 3 to indict former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and seven others in a power plants corruption case. The charges would be framed at Dhaka No. 1 Special Judge's Court. Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haq Monday set the date and sent the records to the court after completion of all legal process for trial. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking bribe in return for allowing three barge-mounted power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna and using the money for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. The court received the chargesheet in the case on Jan 10. Former power and energy secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury is in jail as he turned himself in.
