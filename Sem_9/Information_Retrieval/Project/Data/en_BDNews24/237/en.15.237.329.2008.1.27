 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday asked the Election Commission and the interim government to explain why they would not be directed to hold the Jatiya Sangsad election in a "reasonable timeframe". The High Court also asked the EC and the government to explain why the delay in holding an election in 90 days from the dissolution of parliament is not illegal. The chief adviser, the Election Commission secretary and the law secretary have been asked to reply to the order in four weeks. Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Shahidul Islam gave the order after hearing a writ petition, filed by barrister Masud Reza Sobhan Thursday. According to the writ petition, although there is a constitutional obligation to hold an election in 90 days from the dissolution of parliament, the election was deferred in the name of making a new voter list, national ID cards and holding dialogue with the political parties. The appeal said there was no logic to defer the election in the name of making the national ID cards. The petitioner said the Election Commission had no mandate to declare a roadmap in line with the constitution, and the commission is not authorised to invite political parties to dialogue. He said there was a compulsion to hold the polls in 90 days after the previous elected government ended its five-year term on Oct 28, 2006. "But the commission has violated the constitution by not holding the polls in 90 days," Reza Sobhan told the court. The Election Commission has said that elections will be held by year-end after completion of the voter list. "If the voter list is prepared in all areas of the country simultaneously the election can be held earlier," the lawyer said in his appeal. The petitioner referred to Article 123 (3) of the constitution and argued that it is mandatory that the elections must be held in 90 days after the dissolution of the national parliament. "Can the Election Commission go beyond the 90-day deadline? Can the government make a law on preparing the national ID cards and extend the election deadline? Can that law stay upon the constitution?" Reza Sobhan argued in court. The petition asked why the commission is not taking steps to prepare the electoral roll simultaneously across the country. "Why is the commission making the voter list in one place and then going for another without doing it simultaneously?" the petition said. It accused the commission of killing time in the name of doing election-related activities. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed in his counter argument said the petitioner had earlier filed a writ petition, asking for declaring the current government an "interim government" and demanding that more advisers get appointed for better functioning of the administration. "We thought then that he (Reza Sobhan) was a well-wisher of this government. But now he seems to be speaking for political parties," Salahuddin told the court. The state lawyer said: "Everything does not depend on the government. There is something else." bdnews24.co
