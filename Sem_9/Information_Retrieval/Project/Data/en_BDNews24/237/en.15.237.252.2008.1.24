 LONDON, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former bodyguard Trevor Rees said on Thursday he felt pressured by his boss, luxury storeowner Mohamed al-Fayed, to remember details of the car crash that killed his son Dodi and Princess Diana. Rees was the sole survivor of the crash in Paris in August 1997 that also killed chauffeur Henri Paul, who British and French police investigations have concluded was drunk. The former bodyguard, who suffered horrific facial injuries in the crash and still bears the scars, told the inquest into Dodi and Diana's deaths that while recuperating: "I felt the pressure to remember what had occurred." "The fact that I could not frustrated myself and also obviously frustrated Mr al-Fayed," Rees told the court, concluding two days of dramatic testimony about the night that so nearly cost him his life. Rees said in his meetings with Fayed, the owner of the London store Harrods would suggest possibilities and "I would reply 'That's a possibility'". He said he specifically remembered Fayed asking him if there was a flash in the tunnel which caused the accident. "I would say 'That is a possibility'," Rees added. Rees told the court: "I did not feel comfortable being in his presence at that time. He was obviously a very upset man." Mohamed al-Fayed says he believes that a blinding flash of light from a stun gun caused the chauffeur to lose control and crash at speed in the road tunnel. He alleges that his son and Diana were killed by British agents on the orders of Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's husband and Diana's former father-in-law. Fayed believes her killing was ordered because the royal family did not want the mother of the future king having a child with his son. He says Diana's body was embalmed to cover up evidence she was expecting a baby. He has also accused Rees of being part of a conspiracy to cover up murder, an allegation that prompted a sharp rebuke on Wednesday from Lord Justice Scott Baker, the inquest judge. "They are very grave allegations and one would have thought a man with any decency who is not going to pursue them would withdraw them," he told Fayed's lawyer Michael Mansfield.
