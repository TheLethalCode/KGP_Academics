 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  The akheri munajaat or concluding prayers of the Biswa Ijtema, which had been scheduled for Sunday, is underway at the Tongi Ijtema ground, according to Tongi municipality chairman Azmat Ullah., Maulana Zubairul Hasan Imam of Delhi Mosque is leading the prayers that started at 8pm. Earlier, Azmat Ullah told bdnews24.com that inclement weather had compelled the organisers to call an early end to the second largest Muslim gathering after the hajj. Considering the sufferings of the devotees', the elders of the managing committee decided to hold the akheri munajaat Friday night. The annual event has been drawing the largest number of Muslims, after the hajj, from all over the world since 1967. The organisers of this year's Ijtema expected about 2.2 million devotees at the Ijtema grounds. Some devotees had been suffering discomfort due to the cold spell and foggy weather. Many arrived prepared to cope with the January cold, but the rains and bitter cold winds have been unexpected, they said. Since Friday morning, eminent Islamic scholars have been delivering lectures on various aspects of Islam and the Muslim Ummah, which are being simultaneously translated into 16 major languages including Bangla. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed issued separate messages marking the event. The president's message called upon all assembled to help build the nation as a strong entity and devote their lives and resources to raising a capable nation. Fakhruddin expressed hope that the Ijtema will play a significant role in strengthening the bonds of Muslim brotherhood across the globe. The Ijtema premises, sprawling over 190 acres of land beside the river Turag, were abuzz with activities on the morning of the first day. About 4,500 representatives from 62 countries had arrived at the Ijtema by Friday morning. Hundreds of vehicles loaded with devotees of all age groups coming from far and wide were still seen to be approaching the venue. The government set up dispensaries around the grounds for devotees. Around 40 voluntary organisations have also set up free medical treatment centres to provide the devotees with first aid and medicines. Organised by the Tablig Jama'at, the Biswa Ijtema 2008 is the 42nd annual gathering. The very first Ijtema was organised at Kakrail in Dhaka in 1946; it became a regular annual event from 1967. bdnews24.com/sm/c
