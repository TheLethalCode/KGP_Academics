 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has increased grants to Dhaka clubs significantly to strengthen their financial condition ahead of the prestigious Premier Division Cricket League and other Dhaka leagues. "The Dhaka clubs have been suffering a financial crisis this time and the board has come forward to help them considering the situation," chairman of BCB cricket operation and Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis (CCDM) Gazi Ashraful Hossain Lipu told bdnews24.com Saturday. The board has increased to Tk 7.5 lakh each, from the previous Tk 2 lakh, grants to the top six teams of the 12-team Premier League this season while six bottom teams get Tk 5 lakh each from the previous Tk 1.5 lakh. Besides, each club of the 12-team Premier Division Twenty20 League will get Tk one lakh. The previous grant was Tk 50,000. "I think the board's decision to increase the grants will benefit the clubs in forming better sides as well as inspiring the donors to extend their hands to the clubs," said Lipu. On January 10, BCB president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali had an open discussion with representatives of Premier and First Division League Clubs and expressed his determination to revive domestic club cricket along with enhancing the grants and prize money this season. Later, the clubs in a meeting asked the CCDM to increase the grants to Tk 10 lakh each for top six premier league teams and Tk 5 lakh each for the remaining teams. "The BCB president feels that increasing the financial benefits will encourage more cricketers at district and divisional levels to reap the benefits and that in turn can only improve the standards of cricket outside the capital," Jamali was quoted by tigercricket.com as saying. The grants to the First, Second and Third Division teams have also gone up two to three-fold comparing with those in the last couple of seasons. Top 10 teams of 20-team First Division League will get Tk three lakh each while the rest Tk 2.25 lakh each. Each of top 12 teams in the Second Division will obtain Tk one lakh while bottom 12 teams Tk .8 lakh. Top eight and bottom 12 teams of the Third Division will receive Tk 50,000 and Tk 40,000 respectively. The board has also increased the prize money for all competitions, and introduced prize money for the first time for the third finishers in the Premier League and Twenty20 League. The champions, runners-up and third finisher in the Premier Division League will be awarded by Tk 5 lakh, 4 lakh and 2 lakh instead of Tk 2 lakh and 1.5 lakh while the first, second and third finishers in the Twenty20 League will be given Tk 2 lakh, 1.5 lakh and .75 lakh respectively. The prize money for the first division champion has been increased to Tk 2 lakh from 1 lakh while the second and third division champions will get Tk 60,000 each instead of 30, 000.
