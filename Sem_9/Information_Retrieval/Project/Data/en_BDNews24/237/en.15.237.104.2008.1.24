 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks ended up Thursday after the trading week's losses. The day saw an increased number of trades as well as turnover increasing by about Tk 1 billion. The number of shares traded on the DSE reflected the previous week's pattern, said observers, with decreased trading during the week rising on the closing day. Analysts said the market was in positive territory but still contained some volatility. "Apparently the market is in a positive mood with increased number of traded shares and turnover. But still it's not stabilising," Yaweer Sayeed said.
