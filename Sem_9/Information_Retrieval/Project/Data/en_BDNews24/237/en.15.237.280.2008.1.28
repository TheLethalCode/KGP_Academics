<TITLE> South Korea`s Lee names ex-foreign minister as PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect named the first member of his cabinet on Monday, saying he wants a veteran diplomat and a low-key conservative who is now working on a UN climate change team to be his prime minister. By naming Han Seung-soo as premier, Lee Myung-bak is turning to a proven technocrat who has already served as foreign, finance and commerce minister, to manage the government's policy at home and abroad, analysts said. Prime ministers in South Korea hold little real power but play an important role in coordinating the tasks of various government agencies. Analysts view Han's appointment favourably, seeing him as more of a pragmatist than an ideologue. "At a time like this, the new government will face some economic difficulties," Han said at a news conference. "But if it eases regulations and investment in the private sector becomes active, I think many of these problems can be overcome." Conservative Lee, who takes office Feb. 25, won the Dec. 19 presidential election with pledges to rebuild South Korea's economy and improve ties with the United States and Japan, which had been strained by the current liberal government. Han's appointment needs to be approved by parliament, which is controlled by left-of-centre lawmakers.
