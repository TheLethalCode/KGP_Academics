<TITLE> No need to regulate wealth funds now: Qatar regulator </TITLE>

 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - State-run investment firms show no sign of destabilising global economies or manipulating the financial system and are not now in need of regulation, a top Gulf regulator says. Phillip Thorpe, chairman and chief executive of Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority, joined a host of emerging market policymakers who argued on Wednesday that concerns about rapidly growing sovereign wealth funds are unjustified. "There is a lot of rhetoric at the moment. Nothing has actually happened. As far as I can see there is transparency about transactions and there is no manipulation. So what is the problem? From regulatory perspectives I'm baffled about what concerns are," Thorpe, who was a former managing director at the UK Financial Services Authority, told Reuters. "Do we have any evidence yet that these funds are creating instability in market place or taking speculative positions? Are they not compliant with rules and regulations in countries they are entering? Answers to all of that is no. If no, I cannot yet see justification for more regulatory dimensions," Thorpe said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. "Regulators are always accused of over-regulating. It will be sensible to see the case for regulation. At this stage I don't see a case." MAIN DRIVERS Sovereign Wealth Funds, which manage assets of over $2 trillion, are one of the hottest topics at the World Economic Forum as debate rages over whether these cash-rich funds are the saviours of global finance or a threat to economic stability. With their $60 billion cash injection into the ailing U.S. banking sector in recent months, these funds have replaced hedge funds and private equity as the main drivers of the world economy. But their rapid growth has raised concerns that they may gain control of firms important to national security. "Whether it is some phobia about SWFs or some competitive aspects dressed up as concerns about security and foreign influence, there is a mix of emotions or motivations," Thorpe said. He said regulators always welcomed more transparency and said some government controlled funds, for instance in Singapore and Norway, have set up good examples. "Some SWFs or similar bodies have taken the approach of being extremely open about overall objectives and their reporting. Certainly it is a useful set of parameters for government funds that are responding to political set of demands," Thorpe said. "There is not the same degree of transparency or accountability which you might find in Norway or Singapore. But this shouldn't be confused with regulatory issue
