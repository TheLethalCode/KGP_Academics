 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The Akheri Munajaat of the Biswa Ijtema, that had been scheduled for Sunday, is underway at the Tongi Ijtema ground, according to Tongi municipality chairman Azmat Ullah. Imam Zubairul Hasan of Delhi Mosque is leading the prayers. Earlier, Tongi municipality chairman Advocate Azmat Ullah told bdnews24.com that inclement weather had compelled the organisers to call an early end to the gathering. Biswa Ijtema, the second largest Muslim congregation in the world, began Friday after Jummah prayers at Tongi near the capital. Some devotees had been suffering discomfort due to the cold spell and foggy weather. Many arrived prepared to cope with the January cold, but the rains and bitter cold winds have been unexpected, they said. The annual three-day Ijtema has been drawing the largest number of Muslims, after the hajj, from all over the world since 1967. The organisers of the 2008 Biswa Ijtema expected about 2.2 million devotees at the Ijtema grounds during the religious event. bdnew
