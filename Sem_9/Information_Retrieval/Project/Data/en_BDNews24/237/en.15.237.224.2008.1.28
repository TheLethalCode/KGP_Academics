<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Two Dhaka University teachers who walked out of jail on presidential pardon said they would appeal to High Court against the verdict that convicted them of inciting August 2007 campus unrest. Professor Harun-or-Rashid Monday told bdnews24.com that they would appeal for justice. His lawyer Shafiul Bashar Bhandari told bdnews24.com that his client had asked him to prepare to file the appeal despite the presidential mercy. The professor also said, "We'll all discuss the matter and appeal as soon as the preparation is complete." Asked why they would appeal despite having been pardoned by president Iajuddin Ahmed immediately after the verdict, he said: "We did not get justice. We were all acquitted in one case but convicted in the other case. We believe we will get justice in the High Court." Prof Anwar Hossain said they would make the move once they received the copy of the verdict. His lawyer Abdul Hannan Khan said: "We will appeal to prove that the charges in the case were false." Khan said there was no legal bar to appealing the verdict. Another convicted teacher, Professor Sadrul Amin, said he would decide whether to appeal after discussion with others. Prof Amin's lawyer Masud Ahmed Talukder, however, told bdnews24.com that he had not received such instruction from his client. Prof Amin however did not rule out the possibility of filing an appeal. "I may appeal. I will take the decision after discussing with others." The three teachers were sentenced to two years in jail in a case related to August campus unrest. They were freed from prison after the President pardoned them. Dr Neemchandra Bhowmick and 15 students of the university were acquitted in the case. All four teachers and 11 students were acquitted in another case related to the same incident. bdnews24
