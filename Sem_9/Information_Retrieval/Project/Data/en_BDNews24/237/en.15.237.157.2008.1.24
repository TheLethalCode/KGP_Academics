 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has cancelled the licence of manpower recruiting agent Nobodoy International for fraud. "The licence of recruiting agent Nobodoy International has been cancelled in accordance with the Emigration Ordinance 1982," the government said in a statement Thursday. Nobodoy International is among the recruiting agents that have been charged with defrauding workers in Malaysia. Bangladeshi workers in Kuala Lumpur staged a hunger strike in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in August last year to draw attention to their position. They alleged that some recruiting agents had sent them to Malaysia with jobs in fake companies. They also claimed the recruiting agents had collected more money than the government-fixed limit. The government sent a high-level delegation, led by the expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary, to Malaysia to investigate the allegations. The committee also found some High Commission officials and employees were involved in the scam. bdn
