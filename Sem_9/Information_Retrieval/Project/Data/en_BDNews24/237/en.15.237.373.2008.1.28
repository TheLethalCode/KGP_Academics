 ACCRA, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angola and Tunisia moved to within a point of qualification for the quarter-finals of the African Nations Cup on Sunday. Angola upset group favourites Senegal 3-1 and Tunisia followed up with a victory over South Africa by the same score in the Group D matches in Tamale. Tunisia and Angola clash on Thursday in Tamale, needing only to draw the game to eliminate the other two sides from the tournament in Ghana. Senegal and South Africa, who meet in Kumasi on Thursday, have taken only one point each from their two games. Striker Manucho provided two goals for Angola and Tunisia's Brazilian-born Francileudo dos Santos grabbed a pair in his side's victory. Angola came from behind after Abdoulaye Faye had given Senegal a halftime lead with a header midway through the first half of a pulsating game. Manucho headed the equaliser five minutes after the restart and put Angola ahead from a goalmouth scramble in the 67th minute for his third goal of the tournament. STUNNING TURNAROUND Flavio completed a stunning turnaround in the 77th minute to leave Angola with four points from two games, the same as Tunisia. Angola coach Luis Oliveira Goncalves said: "The great team does not always win the big battles. We won and we won well." In the Senegalese capital Dakar, students angry over their team's defeat briefly blocked a main road with burning refuse. But the fire brigade and police quickly intervened and no injuries were reported. Francileudo was on target for Tunisia in the eighth and 34th minutes and was also involved in the second goal in between when his shot struck the post for Chaouki Ben Saada to snap up the rebound. Francileudo's first was a diving header and his second came after he ran onto a shallow back pass from South Africa defender Nasief Morris and rounded the keeper to score from a tight angle. Substitute Katlego Mphela made the score more respectable for South Africa when he notched a late consolation. The result was a reality check for South Africa, who are using the tournament to build a team to host the 2010 World Cup but were thoroughly out-muscled by their opponents. On Monday, hosts Ghana return to action when Group A is concluded. They play Morocco in Accra needing a point to win the group. Guinea meet Namibia in Sekondi at the same tim
