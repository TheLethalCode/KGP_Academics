<TITLE> Merkel`s party faces test in German state votes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Voters in two western German states go to the polls on Sunday in a test for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) before next year's federal election. Senior CDU figures are fighting to hold on to power in both states but the race is especially tight in Hesse, home to the financial capital of Frankfurt, where Merkel ally Roland Koch has run a divisive campaign focused on crime and immigration. Koch's battle has ratcheted up tensions in Merkel's fractious national coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). A strong SPD showing in Hesse could mean a further deterioration in relations and policy gridlock. The latest Forsa poll shows the CDU on 38-39 percent and the SPD on 37-38 percent. But pollsters say more than 40 percent of voters are undecided. Koch, a hardline conservative seen by supporters on the CDU's right as a future chancellor, is set to lose his absolute majority but he hopes to form a coalition with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP). A defeat or even heavy losses for Koch would reflect badly on Merkel, who remains highly popular in Germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year's national vote. "A loss in Hesse would be bad for morale for the CDU nationally and for Merkel," said Juergen Falter, a political scientist at Mainz University. She backed Koch's controversial proposals to crack down on crime committed by young foreigners, a drive immigrant groups and opposition parties have denounced as xenophobic. Designed to mobilise conservative supporters, the campaign has instead fired up the SPD and laid Koch bare to criticism about his own crime record since taking office in 1999. The fortunes of both the CDU and SPD in Hesse will depend on smaller parties, notably the far-left Left party which is fighting to cross the 5 percent threshold and enter the parliament in a large western state for the first time. The SPD, led by leftist Andrea Ypsilanti, wants to share power with the Greens and FDP in Hesse in what could be a model for a future federal coalition. But depending on the arithmetic, a myriad of partnerships are possible in the state, including a "grand coalition" that mirrors Merkel's government in Berlin. In Lower Saxony, opinion polls show CDU premier Christian Wulff, a more moderate and charismatic conservative than Koch, on track to retain power in a partnership with the FDP.
