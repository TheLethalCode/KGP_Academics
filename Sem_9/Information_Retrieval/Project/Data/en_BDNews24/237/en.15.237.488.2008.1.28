 Manila, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines halted the award of a 1.2 billion peso ($29 million) helicopter supply contract to a local partner of MD Helicopters Inc after an inquiry showed irregularities in the bidding procedures. Defence Undersecretary Ariston delos Reyes said on Friday that the government would re-tender for six night-capable attack helicopters after an inquiry found "serious flaws" in an earlier tender in September 2007. "The bidding process was not properly observed," delos Reyes told a news conference at the army's main base in Manila, adding the contract was awarded to a supplier whose product failed to meet the basic technical requirements. Asian Aerospace Corp., a local partner of MD Helicopters, won the bidding with an offer to sell MD530F attack helicopters. Another bidder, Poland's state-owned PZL-Swidnik S.A., had protested the bidding procedures, saying the MD530F fell short of the technical requirements of 3,000-lb (1,361 kg) payload. The U.S.-made aircraft only has a payload of 1,500 pounds. Poland was offering to supply the Philippines its advanced version of the Russian-made Mi2-Plus attack helicopters, known as Kania (Kitty Hawk), a NATO-certified aircraft. A third bidder, Italy's Agusta-Westland, was disqualified because it could not guarantee to deliver the aircraft within a 12-month period. Delos Reyes said a separate inquiry to determine the liability of some officials involved in the bidding process was proceeding. He said there was an attempt to change the aircraft's technical specifications during the tender. "The alteration of the specs happened in the preparations of the bidding documents. This is the responsibility of the bids and award committee," he said. The Philippines opened the bidding in September 2007 as part of its plan to acquire new helicopters and step up efforts to defeat communist rebels and Islamic militants. Arroyo has given the military about 7 billion pesos to upgrade its fleet of Vietnam-era aircraft, part of a long-term 210 billion peso-modernisation plan to catch up with better-quipped neighbours in Southeast Asia. Currently, the Philippines has 85 UH-1H and 22 MD520 attack helicopters, but only about half of them are in flying condition. Most of the aircraft were donated by the United States as part of its military aid.
