 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Freed Dhaka University teachers and students Thursday demanded the release of Imtiaz Hossain Bijan, a student of WIBT College detained over the August campus unrest. Freed teacher Professor Anwar Hossain also called for a non-violent movement for the trial of war criminals. "The nation is united today on this demand and Dhaka University students will have to be united on the issue as well," Prof Anwar said at a rally at the Aparajeyo Bangla monument. The rally was held for the teachers and students recently released from jail after presidential pardon. Anwar called on the students to resist the influence of student organisations Islami Chhatra Shibir and Chhatra Mukti. He said the former in particular had destroyed the academic atmosphere in many universities but Dhaka University had so far been saved. He asked DU students to keep up the resistance and demanded the release of Bijan. Professor Sadrul Amin echoed the demand of freedom for Bijan, saying that justice has to be established through truth. Bijan's mother Sanjida Alam asked authorities to free her son. "I don't know why my son has been kept behind bars. He didn't commit any crime. I want my son back like others." She mentioned that students and teachers of WIBT College had boycotted class to press for Bijan's release. Freed teacher Harun-or-Rashid urged students not to surrender to injustices, wrongs and oppression. "We protested injustice and wrongs standing on ethical ground. We stood beside troubled students," he reiterated. Student Manobendra Dev, released Wednesday, said Dhaka University students had not done anything wrong. Another freed student, Deen Islam asked army chief Moeen U Ahmed to withdraw the cases against the DU students. "Please consider us as your sons and withdraw the cases," he said. Dhaka University teachers aligned to the Awami League and left-leaning parties had earlier suspended their protest programmes, but vowed to roll out new plans for withdrawal of cases against students if necessary. Professor Muhammad Samad, spokesman for the teachers, said their protest was suspended as their main demands for release of teachers and students had been fulfilled. Around midday, the teachers lowered the black flag that had been hoisted atop the Arts Building. bdnews24.
