 LONDON, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks surged 4.5 percent on Thursday as hopes of a bailout for bond insurers and surging Nokia stock helped investors shrug off Societe Generale's disclosure of a huge fraud. At 1224 GMT, the benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 4.45 percent at 1,317.77 points, on track for its biggest one-day gain since March 2003. HSBC gained 4.4 percent and Banco Santander rose 6 percent, while SocGen's rival French bank BNP Paribas, which said it saw no exceptional loss or item in its 2007 accounts, jumped 8.3 percent. Nokia, the world's largest handset maker, soared 14 percent after posting strong fourth-quarter earnings, lifting the DJ Stoxx European tech sector index by 8.5 percent and making it the best-performing sector. New York's insurance regulator pressed major banks on Wednesday to put up billions of dollars to support ailing bond insurers and prevent investors from being forced to sell billions of dollars of bonds the insurers had covered. "This is quite significant news, because lots of banks have CDOs (credit default obligations) insured with them and people need to be confident these guarantees will stand. So all those who stand to benefit will be asked to chip in," said Andrew Bell, European strategist at Rensburg Sheppard. Problems for bond insurers became the latest blow to European shares when U.S. bond insurer Ambac lost its vital triple-A credit rating from Fitch Ratings last Friday, putting at risk billions of dollars of corporate and municipal bonds covered by the company. Monoline insurers underwrite securitised debt products, which effectively transfers the triple-A ratings the insurers have to the repackaged debt securities that typically comprise tranches of risk well below the very highest grade. If the insurers lose their top ratings, so do the bonds they have underwritten. Bell said Thursday's rally showed that share falls earlier this week had been excessive, though markets were in need of more sustained relief. "We need three things: the cost of credit needs to come down, the availability of credit needs to be addressed as banks are shutting up shop for new customers, and there needs to be some support for demand through short-term tax cuts or a sustained fall in the oil price," he said. LINKED WITH BLACK MONDAY? SocGen shares fell 4.8 percent when they started trading after 1105 GMT, but the news had little impact on stock in other banks, with the sector the top-weighted gainer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index. SocGen said fraud by a single trader had caused it a 4.9 billion euro loss and that it would seek emergency funds as a result. SocGen said the trader, responsible for futures hedging on European equity market indexes, had taken massive fraudulent positions in 2007 and 2008 beyond his authority. The bank said it had decided to close the positions as quickly as practicable after they were discovered and investigated on Jan. 19 and 20. The FTSEurofirst 300 fell nearly 6 percent on Jan. 21, its biggest one-day fall since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And the US Federal Reserve served up a surprise 75 basis-point interest rate cut on Tuesday. "The huge amount of futures selling could be one reason why markets fell off a cliff on Monday, and maybe that was an ingredient in forcing the Fed to bring forward a part of its interest rate cuts," said Bell. The FTSEurofirst 300 is down 19.3 percent from a multi-year peak hit in July last year. Many analysts consider a fall of 20 percent from a peak as signalling a bear market. Among standout gainers, the world's top interdealer broker ICAP jumped 11 percent after saying increased market volatility would help its full-year pretax profit to top analysts' expectations. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 5.8 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 4.2 percent and France's CAC 40 up 4.5 perce
