 LOS ANGELES, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Directors Guild of America on Saturday chose Ethan and Joel Coen as best feature film directors for 2007 for their gritty crime drama "No Country for Old Men," an award known for signaling which filmmakers will win top Oscars. Under the specter of a screenwriters strike that has brought Hollywood to a standstill for nearly three months, the Coen brothers beat four other candidates, including Paul Thomas Anderson for "There Will Be Blood" about the rise to wealth of a California oil prospector, and Sean Penn with his wilderness adventure "Into the Wild." The field was rounded out by Tony Gilroy for his directorial debut with legal thriller "Michael Clayton" and painter-turned-director Julian Schnabel for "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly," who won the Golden Globe for best director a few weeks ago.

But the 2007 movie year has given way to one of the most unpredictable Hollywood awards seasons in recent years as "Atonement" and "Sweeney Todd" took top Globe honors, but fell behind "No Country for Old Men" and "There Will Be Blood," in Oscar nominations. On Sunday night, the Screen Actors Guild will hold its annual awards and writers will not picket the event since actors have been loyal supporters in the conflict. No such deal has been reached with organizers of the Oscar ceremony on Feb. 24, casting doubt on whether the movie industry's biggest showcase will go ahead in its usual fo
