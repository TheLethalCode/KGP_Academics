 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cautious retail investors withdrew record amounts from British-registered funds in December as market uncertainty continued, while outflows from property funds also accelerated. Net retail fund outflows rose to 377.4 million pounds in December, up from 332.3 million pounds in November -- the previous record outflow -- the Investment Management Association (IMA) said in a note on Monday.
