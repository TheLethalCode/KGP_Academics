 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said on Thursday the world should judge his country on economic progress and its fight against militancy, not Western ideas of human rights. Repeating a promise to hold free and fair elections next month, Musharraf set out priorities for Pakistan which put greater emphasis on the economy and the fight against al Qaeda than the Feb. 18 vote, which is meant to complete a transition to civilian rule in Pakistan. "Judge economic performance, the welfare of people and political stability," Musharraf told business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. "Please don't judge (us) on maybe unrealistic Western perceptions of democracy and human rights." Musharraf, who took power in a military coup in 1999, imposed emergency rule in November to oust judges who appeared set to annul his re-election by parliament to a second five-year term. Limits on civil rights remain in effect despite a formal end to the crackdown last month. On Wednesday, he met U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who urged him to ensure next month's vote is free. The Bush administration has been under strong pressure from the U.S. Congress to cut aid to Pakistan, or at least impose restrictions linking democratic reform to funding levels. "The elections must be free, fair and trasparent. And I've added another word -- peaceful," Musharraf said on Thursday. "We will make sure that they are peaceful." BHUTTO ASSASSINATION Pakistan, still shaken from the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in a gun and suicide bomb attack last month, has seen a spate of attacks and suicide bombings. The government blames militancy cascading out of the tribal lands on the border with Afghanistan, where the Taliban and al Qaeda have taken refuge. Musharraf declined to say whether he would be prepared to reinstate ousted Supreme Court judges to rule on any possible complaint of electoral fraud. "Look at Pakistan from Pakistani eyes and not from foreign eyes," he said. "You should see our performance on ... whether the welfare of the people, the economic progress of the country is being addressed and whether we are moving forward." Musharraf, sharing a platform with the head of Bangladesh's army-backed interim government Fakhruddin Ahmed, said both countries sought political stability and economic growth. Fakhruddin said free and fair elections in Bangladesh by the end of the year were "the number one priority", but he also stressed the need to increase the wealth of Bangladesh's poor. The interim administration took charge in Bangladesh on Jan. 11, 2007, following months of political violence, imposed a state of emergency and cancelled an election planned for Jan. 22, 2007. It launched a massive crackdown on corruption and has detained more than 170 politicians. Among them are former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and her rival Begum Khaleda Zia, who are in jail facing trial for suspected corruption and abuse of power. Fakhruddin said the government was building up institutions including local government, and promised more measures to ease controls on political activities. "In terms of political activities, I said in my last speech to the nation we're going to open up," he sa
