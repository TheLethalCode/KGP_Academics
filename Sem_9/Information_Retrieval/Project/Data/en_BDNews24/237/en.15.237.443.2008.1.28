<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Visitors to the Ekushey Book Fair at Bangla Academy will not have to pay any entry fee, an official said Monday. "It has been decided not to charge any entry fee for the book fair following appeals from different quarters," acting cultural ministry secretary Md Sharful Alam said to bdnews24.com. Bangla Academy director general Prof Syed Mohammad Shahed in a recent interview with bdnews24.com had spoken about fixing Tk 2 as entry fee to the fair. He said that the full amount, collected as entry fees, would be spent on research and publication. The book fair has always been free of entry fee. Sharful also said this year the stalls in the book fair would be 360, down from 430 last year. The number of stalls has been kept limited to facilitate the movement of visitors, he added. An adequate number of RAB and police members would be deployed round the clock inside and outside the fair premises to ensure overall security. CCTV cameras have been fitted at different spots on the fair premises. Adjacent Suhrawardy Udyan has been kept under security cover and six archways with metal detectors have been set up at the two entrances to the fair. Sharful also said visitors would use two entrances and one exit. They would enter the fair in six rows, three each from TSC and Doyel crossing ends. The three rows coming from TSC end would enter the fair through the entrance beside the Academy sales centre while the three rows coming from the Doyel crossing end would enter through the main gate of the Academy. Bangla Academy sources said the work of the decoration of the fair had for the first time been given to a private firm, namely "Step Media", an event management firm. Step Media is setting up the stalls at its own cost. They would use advertisements of different organisations in the stalls. However, the source said that no advertisement that marred the dignity of Bangla Academy could be used. Information would be displayed digitally for the benefit of the visitors at this year's fair. Besides, there would be media centre for journalists and outside the fair there would be food stalls and sanitation facilities. The covers of all books published in a day would be displayed at one place. There would be a stall for selling little magazines. Food stalls would be set up on both sides of the road from the Three Leaders' Graves to Bangla Academy premises. Some 80 such stalls would be allotted. An appeal has been made to Dhaka City Corporation to make sewerage arrangements through the Suhrawardy Udyan. bdnews24.
