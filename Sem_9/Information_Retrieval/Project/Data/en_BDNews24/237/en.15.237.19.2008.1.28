 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Demand from adult collectors nostalgic for a childhood playing with model trains and Scalextric racing cars helped toymaker Hornby cope with a tough Christmas for Britain's retailers, it said on Monday. However, delays rolling out new products in mainland Europe knocked shares in the 100-year old manufacturer, which also makes Airfix plastic model kits. "We are relieved, very puzzled and slightly surprised at the way sales continued to be strong through the Christmas period," Chief Executive Frank Martin told analysts and reporters. "The evidence we are experiencing through the month of January has been very positive," he said. Strong sales of railways and Scalextric sets before Christmas had boosted demand for accessories in late December and January, he said. Hornby said strong growth had continued in the new year, with like-for-like order intake rising around 20 percent. "New products launched this month to our retail customers have been extremely well received. The further development of the Scalextric and Hornby digital ranges is expected to continue to lead to an increase in average prices as consumers migrate to the digital format," it said. Digital controls allow users to operate more cars and do more with them, like overtaking and lane changing. Hornby said it had been relatively unscathed by the general downturn in the British retail market in part because it was not focused purely on children's toys, but also appealed to adults. But the group said its expansion into Europe, aimed at reducing its dependence on the British market, had placed an additional strain on the supply chain, slowing new product launches. It said it was taking steps to address the problem. Hornby, which makes goods based on the Doctor Who science fiction television series, said it had expanded to include Nimrod plastic planes, characters from the Shaun the Sheep animated children's series and products based on the forthcoming James Bond movie. At 1150 GMT, shares in Hornby, which has made toys over the past century after starting life as Meccano Ltd in 1907, were up 0.3 percent, having fallen to 193p. That compared to a 0.5 percent fall in the FTSE Small Cap index. "We think that baby boomer spending on hobby interests will prove more resilient. But we have trimmed our earnings forecasts by around 2 percent given the situation in Europe and our target price has been lowered by 10 pence," WH Ireland analysts said. Analysts expect Hornby to report 9.8 million pounds in pretax profit in the year ending March on revenue of 56.6 million, according to four analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Martin said slower European growth would mean revenue would be around 1 million pounds less than it had expected, with an impact of some 300,000 and 400,000 pounds on prof
