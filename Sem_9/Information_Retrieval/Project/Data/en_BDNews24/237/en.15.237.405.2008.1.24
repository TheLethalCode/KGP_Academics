 GENEVA, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday demanded Israel lift its week-long blockade of Gaza, rebuking the Jewish state for the third time for violations in the Palestinian territories since the forum was set up in 2006. The 47-member council adopted a resolution presented by Arab and Muslim states by a vote of 30 states in favour and one against with 15 abstentions, and one delegation absent. Israeli military attacks on Gaza and the West Bank city of Nablus constituted "grave violations of the human and humanitarian rights" of Palestinian civilians, it said in a text which made no mention of the rockets launched into Israel by Palestinian militants. Mohammed Abu-Koash, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN in Geneva, told the special emergency session called to address conditions in the Palestinian territories that Israel's siege and raids in Gaza constituted "war crimes". "We hope the resolution will trigger international pressure and action to lift the Israeli siege and restore supplies of food, fuel and medicine, open border crossings and end repeated Israeli military attacks throughout the occupied Palestinian territory," he said. bdnews24.com/lq/1939hrs Israel, facing frequent rocket attacks from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, tightened its border closure last week. It briefly halted fuel delivery to a Gaza power station and cut supplies to petrol stations, and blocked food and other humanitarian aid. The Israeli army estimates about 250 rockets and mortar rounds have pounded Israel since last week. Israeli troops killed more than 30 Palestinians over the same period. VIOLENCE U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour, in a speech on Wednesday, denounced Israel's "disproportionate use of force and targeted killings" as well as the Palestinian militants for firing rockets into Israel. Arbour, a former U.N. war crimes prosecutor, told the forum that international law forbids collective punishment and said Israel should lift all restrictions on aid intended for Gaza. "All parties concerned should put an end to the vicious spiral of violence before it becomes unstoppable," she said. Delegations from the United States and Israel, which both have observer status at the council, boycotted the two-day session, diplomats said. Most of those abstaining from the vote were Western states, including France, Germany and Britain. China and Russia backed the resolution, while Canada was the lone vote against it. Syria's ambassador Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, speaking on behalf of Arab states and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), accused Israel of turning Gaza into a "huge prison". Egypt's envoy Sameh Shoukry, speaking for African countries, urged Arbour's office to conduct more regular visits to the Palestinian territories and report more extensively on it. John Dugard, an independent U.N. expert on human rights in the Palestinian territories, last week accused Israel of bombing the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza with the knowledge that a wedding party was being held nearby. One woman was killed and at least 30 were injured. Israel's envoy Itzhak Levanon dismissed the criticism as the latest in a "long history of vitriolic attacks" on his country. "The main challenge Israel faces is to defend itself from terrorist organisations that use populated areas for cover in order to launch rockets and mortars into Israel," he said in a statement.
