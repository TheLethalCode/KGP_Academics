<TITLE> Kingfisher`s B&Q head to become group CEO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kingfisher Plc, Europe's biggest home improvements retailer, promoted Ian Cheshire to chief executive on Friday and said recent trading had been broadly in line with its expectations. Cheshire, currently head of Kingfisher's B&Q business in Britain, will take over from Gerry Murphy on Jan. 28. Kingfisher, which also owns Castorama in France, has been looking for a new CEO since Murphy said in November he would step down after five years in the job. Cheshire, 48, had been tipped as the most likely internal candidate. "He has extensive experience of international home improvement retailing and knowledge of the Kingfisher businesses, both in the UK and internationally," Chairman Peter Jackson said in a statement. "This makes him uniquely placed to lead the business and drive through the changes necessary to improve returns and maximise the value available from the opportunities in our business." Cheshire, appointed as B&Q head in 2005 when the British home improvement market was in a sharp decline, has since led a restructuring of the business by changing the format of B&Q's large outlets and renewing product ranges. NO BIG SURPRISE Analysts expect no dramatic strategic changes from Cheshire, noting that he has been on the board since 2000. "It's difficult to see how you can take a significant strategic departure, having appointed someone internal," Rob Mann, an analyst at Collins Stewart said. Mann said Kingfisher would continue to come under pressure, with no immediate visibility on earnings recovery, as B&Q had tried most things in the past few years amid a gathering slowdown in consumer spending growth. Kingfisher, like many Britain's home improvement retailers, is battling a slowdown in consumer spending, with shoppers hit by higher bills and a weakening housing market. The group, which has nearly 760 stores in nine countries in Europe and Asia, will announce its fourth-quarter sales to Feb. 2 on Feb. 21. It reported in November a lower quarterly profit. At 0920 GMT, Kingfisher shares, which have underperformed the DJ Stoxx European retail index by 50 percent over the past 12 months, fell 1.3 percent to 141 pence. Cheshire, who studied economics and law at Cambridge, has spent more than 20 years in the retail industry, having previously worked for Sears and Guinness
