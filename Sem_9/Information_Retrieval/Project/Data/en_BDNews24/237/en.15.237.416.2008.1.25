 ADELAIDE, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adam Gilchrist broke Mark Boucher's world record for dismissals on Friday before Australia began the daunting task of trying to match India's imposing total on the second day of the fourth and final test. Gilchrist claimed his 414th test victim, eclipsing the South African's previous record of 413 dismissals by a wicketkeeper, to end India's first innings on 526. Australia, in reply, were 62 without loss when stumps were drawn with Matthew Hayden unbeaten on 36 and his opening partner Phil Jaques on 21 and the home side still 464 runs in arrears. Gilchrist said the Australians were exhausted after their long stint in the field but had not given up hope of winning the match because the pitch was still playing so well. "It's two very tiresome days for us, but I guess it shows the wicket is a nice wicket," Gilchrist told a news conference. "Fortunately, we have got through tonight unscathed and have a good foundation to work from and we can take a lot out of the Indian innings as encouragement for our batting." The Adelaide Oval has long been renowned as a batsmen's paradise and the Indians made the most of their opportunity thanks to some spirited lower-order batting. Sachin Tendulkar top-scored with a majestic 153 while skipper Anil Kumble (87), opener Virender Sehwag (63), spinner Harbhajan Singh (63) and middle-order batsman Vangipurappu Laxman (51) all helped themselves to half-centuries. Australia briefly looked as though they might restrict the Indians to less than 400 when they got rid of Tendulkar with the total on 359 but struggled to mop up the last three wickets. Kumble and Harbhajan kept the tail wagging with an adventurous eighth-wicket partnership of 107 then the Indian captain put on a 58-run stand with the number 11 Ishant Sharma to frustrate the Australians and lift the total past 500. BIG DAY "I think it's a very good wicket to bat on but we've got the runs on the board now so we can play around with our field and put them under pressure and try to get the wickets," Harbhajan said. "We have a good chance to beat them in this game if we bowl the right sort of length and if we take our catches. We need to back ourselves and go out there and have a big day tomorrow and the next day." Left-arm seamer Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the Australian bowlers, capturing four wickets, while express paceman Brett Lee toiled hard in the searing heat to claim three victims. Australia made a bright start to the day when they dismissed Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 16 then grabbed the prize wicket of Tendulkar in the first hour of play. However, the hosts blew their chances to polish off the innings quickly when Jaques dropped Harbhajan at short-leg off the first ball he faced. Harbhajan, who missed India's victory in last week's third test in Perth when the selectors opted for an extra paceman, made the butter-fingered Australians pay dearly for their missed chance, one of seven catches they dropped in the innings. He pounded seven boundaries to join the list of half-century makers before he chanced his arm once too often and skied a catch to Gilchrist off all-rounder Andrew Symonds. That gave Gilchrist a share of Boucher's record and the 36-year-old claimed the outright record for himself when Kumble edged a simple catch off Johnson to end the innings. The Indian skipper had batted 260 minutes, faced 205 balls and struck nine boundaries to fall just short of a second test hundred, but not before he put his team in a strong position to push for a series-equalling win. Australia won the first two matches in Melbourne and Sydney but India's victory in Perth has presented the tourists with the chance of salvaging a draw. "Any team is beatable if you play to your potential and we have got a very, very good team and great players," Harbhajan said. "No team has challenged the Australians the way we have challenged them. "We are not very far from them. They have done very well in the past but I don't live in the past.
