 NAIROBI, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an investigation into "gross and systematic" rights abuses in Kenya on Saturday and said the crisis had gone well beyond a dispute over election results. The Nobel Peace laureate is leading mediation efforts in the east African nation to try to end weeks of unrest which has killed some 700 people since the controversial Dec. 27 polls. "Let us not kid ourselves and think that this is an electoral problem. It is much broader and much deeper," Annan told reporters after visiting the towns of Eldoret and Molo in the Rift Valley, the scene of some the worst violence. "We have to tackle the fundamental issues that underlie what we are witnessing today. If we do not do that, three, five years from now we may be back at this," he said. Kenya's rapid descent into chaos after President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election has horrified Western powers, damaged one of Africa's most promising economies and shattered its image as a regional trade and tourism hub. The political stand-off has triggered feuding between members of Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe and Luos and Kalenjins who backed his rival Raila Odinga. But in the Rift Valley, it has evolved into a broader settling of scores over issues including land rights. Annan -- accompanied by former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Graca Machel, wife of former South African leader Nelson Mandela -- were flown by military helicopter to visit camps housing civilians made homeless by the violence. "We saw people pushed from their homes, from their farms. Grandmothers, children, families uprooted," Annan said. "We saw gross and systematic abuse of human rights of fellow citizens. It is essential the facts be established and those responsible be held to account," he said, adding the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was ready to help investigate. Two days of tribal clashes in another Rift Valley town, Nakuru, have killed at least 27 people. Annan scored an early success in his mediation mission on Thursday when Kibaki and Odinga met and shook hands for the first time since the start of the crisis. But the optimism quickly faded when, just two hours later, Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement slammed Kibaki's statement that he was the country's "duly elected" president and accused him of trying to undermine the negotiation efforts. Many Kenyans fear what will happen if Annan leaves the country without brokering some sort of deal. "It should be patently obvious to everyone that the three of us are not going sit here for months on end, so time is of the essence," the former U.N. chief said. "But even if we are not here, the mechanisms we set up will allow the negotiations to go on. We will make sure there is an independent, neutral person in the chair ... and we will remain engaged and be on the ground as and when necessary."
