<TITLE> A Franco-American tragedy in several acts </TITLE>

 Martyn Warwick London, Jan 25 (telecomtv.com/bdnews24.com)  A couple of days ago, the French weekly business publication, L'Exapansion, ran an article saying that "reputable sources" had told one of its journalists that Serge Tchuruk, the chairman of Alcatel Lucent is on the verge of resigning from the company. The story was followed up by the long-established satirical weekly, Le Canard Enchaine. The magazine claims that M. Tchuruk (and Alcatel Lucent's American CEO Patricia Russo) is in the cross-hair sights of Thierry Breton, the sometime head of France Telecom who left the post to become finance minister in the now defunct government of President Jacques Chirac. Le Canard Enchaine claims that Breton has ambitions to take over as head of Alcatel Lucent and is pushing to get both the current chairman and CEO ousted. The story prompted a furious denial from the company as a hastily convened coven of company spin doctors spun their silken tales. Things got so bad that M. Tchuruk himself felt compelled to issue an outright denial. He went on the record to refute "any suggestion" that he is about to depart. Since 2005, when Alcatel and Lucent waltzed up the aisle together in what was, at the time, lovingly described by corporate matchmakers as "a marriage of equals" but was evident to anyone with half an eye to be anything but, the two companies have struggled to gain any lasting advantages from what was then a hasty, indeed panicky, union that is now being repented at leisure. The welding together into an harmonious whole two vastly different cultures (Alcatel has long claimed to be an international company that just happens to be headquartered in Paris, but it remains resolutely and indisputably as Gallic as a packet of Gauloises despite the fact that Serge Tchuruk changed the company's official language to English, while Lucent is only too readily identifiable as a Yankee enterprise) has proved to be all but impossible. Alcatel Lucent has seen several "re-organisations" and the enforced departure of more than 12,500 staff while sales have slumped and the value of the company has plummeted following a series of profit warnings. Alcatel Lucent's share price fell by more than 60 per cent over the course of 2007, much to the chagrin of investors who had been promised rich rewards for supporting the merger. And, to make matters worse, the company's stock has fallen by a further 18 per cent in the year to date, (i.e. in just the last 25 days). They fell back by five per cent on Tuesday alone on rumours that the company is to lower its forecasts yet again. Three years ago the Stock Exchange value of Alcatel Lucent was 28 billion. Today it is 11 billion and falling  and yesterday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Alcatel Lucent's stock from "neutral" to "sell". Given the volatile and delicate nature of the market there can be little doubt that some investors will take that advice and put even more pressure on the company and its top management. Goldman Sachs says the outlook for Alcatel Lucent is "greatly challenging" and that the company is unlikely to record any growth in 2008. Q4 results are due on February 8 and they are expected to make dismal reading. So, what are we to make of all this swirling rumour? One thing we do know is that Patricia Russo is, and has been, living on borrowed time. Her stewardship of the merged company has resulted only in decline and loss of money and, despite the fact that, in public at least, she puts a brave face on things and constantly emphasises that the fruits of the amalgamation will not be evident for two or three years, investor unrest and board concerns mean that unless she can pull a very fat rabbit out of the company's increasingly battered top hat, her days are numbered. There were stories that Ms. Russo's position was shaky before the release of the poor Q3 results back in October, but the CEO denied that she was under pressure or that she had been given an ultimatum to shape-up or ship-out. Hitherto, M. Tchuruk, who turned 70 in November last year, (he was born on November 13, 1937) has managed to remain above the fray and relatively undamaged by the barrage of flak that has wounded his CEO. He gained kudos in the eyes of his native society when, at the age of 68, he agreed to move from the delights of Paris and to take up residence in the decidedly less charming hinterland of New Jersey for a couple of years in an effort to kick-start the ailing merger. It would have been a big sacrifice but vicious political infighting between some over-inflated egos resulted in him withdrawing the offer and he has remained resolutely a French resident ever since. Meanwhile, other stories circulating  to the effect that Patricia Russo does not like France, doesn't like travelling there and either will not or cannot learn the language  make her seem to the French public to be aloof and overly US-centric, especially given that Alcatel is, by any yardstick, the senior partner in the merged company. And now, apparently, looming over all this is the long shadow of Thierry Breton. We can't be sure exactly what machinations are underway, but we can be pretty sure given the strength of the reaction to rumours of plots and coups that something is happening. No doubt all will become evident soon before or soon after February 5. One thing history has taught us though is that playing the role as Dauphin to a French king is a perilous game fraught with anxiety, uncertainty and the ever present possibility of sudden violent death. I for one would be prepared to wager that it is quite likely that M. Tchuruk will still be around later in the year whilst his CEO may well be spending more time with her family.
