 MULTAN, Pakistan, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Shahid Afridi blasted a flamboyant 85 to power Pakistan to a 37-run victory and an unassailable 3-0 series lead against Zimbabwe on Sunday. Pakistan restricted Zimbabwe to 235 for seven after Afridi smashed 85 from 52 balls to lead is side to 272 for nine in the third one-day international of the five match series. Zimbabwe left Pakistan reeling at 78 for five before Afridi lit up the Multan stadium with his explosive hitting. The visitors looked like they could be on course for a rare victory when Sean Williams (71) and Brendan Taylor (55) batted fluently to add 105 runs for the fourth wicket but their innings fell away after the enterprising stand was broken by captain Shoaib Malik. Taylor was stumped by Kamran Akmal in the 36th over, beaten in flight by Malik's off spin after notching up his 12th half century. Williams brought up his second fifty in the series after flicking Malik past short fine leg. But as soon as he was dismissed by Afridi in the 39th over, the writing was on the wall for Zimbabwe. Earlier, Pakistan's decision to bat first on a flat track appeared to be backfiring before Afridi tore into the visitors' attack. SIXES RECORD He also equalled Sanath Jayasuriya's world record for most sixes (392) in the one-day game with his sixth and final six as he put on 116 runs for the sixth wicket with Misbah-ul-Haq (44). Tawanda Mupariwa returned his best figures of four for 46 in his first match of the series. Pakistan looked in danger of slumping badly when they lost four wickets in seven overs, while adding just 12 runs. Salman Butt (23) was out cutting Elton Chigumbura to point while and Nasir Jamshed (32), who has had two half-centuries in the series, holed out Mupariwa to Chamu Chibhabha at mid-wicket. Younis Khan (10) was trapped by a slower one by Mupariwa to give him his second wicket while Mohammad Yousuf was caught and bowled by Mupariwa for just five. Pakistan lost Malik for just three to a brilliant direct throw from square leg before Afridi and Misbah resurrected the innings. Afridi was finally out with the score 194 for six, hitting Mupariwa straight to captain Hamilton Masakadza at cover and missing out on a chance to make his first ODI hundred in three years. The tailenders also chipped in with wicketkeeper Akmal and debutant Kamran Hussain both scoring 28 to help boost Pakistan's total
