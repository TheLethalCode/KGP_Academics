<TITLE> Indonesia's Suharto draws praise and anger in death </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - News of Suharto's death drew sympathy from many ordinary Indonesians, while others expressed anger over the corruption, cronyism, and human rights abuses that occurred under his New Order regime. Indonesia ranks among the most corrupt countries in the world. Under Suharto, the armed forces invaded neighbouring East Timor in 1975, and brutally crushed dissent in the rebellious provinces of Aceh and Papua, as well as on student campuses. "For the ordinary people it's a loss, but if we remember back to the Suharto days, there were so many things that were not right. Think of the victims of conflict in East Timor and Aceh - that's what we don't like," said Nanang Suhyarna, a security guard in south Jakarta. "But he was the father of development in this country and Indonesia has got more chaotic since he stepped down. It's now harder for people to get their daily needs, like food," he added.

Several people blamed Suharto's children and inner circle for Indonesia's endemic corruption. "I like Suharto but his children are too greedy. They are the guilty ones and should be tried in court," said Hendra, a motorbike driver in Jakarta's Kemang district. Pudji, a 35-year-old doctor, said the failings of the Suharto era began to show towards the end.

"However, I think the Suharto days were better for ordinary people. Today the rich get richer and the poor get poorer." Ety, an 18-year-old student lunching at McDonald's, said she found out about Suharto's death by text message. "I was a bit sad when I heard. I was only young when he was in power, but I think that was a good time," she said. "It's so different now. It's harder to get cooking oil and basic foods." She said that while free speech was repressed during Suharto's rule, now the pendulum has swung too far the other way. "Every day there's a new demonstration, people wanting all sorts of major changes. I think it's got too free," she said. Another student, Mira Eliana, 20, said outstanding charges against the former leader should be dropped. "It's not important for Indonesia," she sa
