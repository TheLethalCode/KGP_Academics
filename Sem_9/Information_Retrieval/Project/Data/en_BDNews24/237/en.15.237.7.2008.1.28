<TITLE> Germany's Merkel calls election losses painful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel described hefty losses for her conservatives in a state election as painful but vowed the results would not destabilise her increasingly troubled left-right national coalition. The election in Hesse, home to the financial capital of Frankfurt, was a setback for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) in the run-up to the next federal election in Sept. 2009. Hesse premier Roland Koch, a Merkel ally, finished a whisker ahead of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), but his support plunged by 12 percentage points compared to the last state election in 2003. Leading newspapers described the result as a debacle for Koch, who ran a campaign on crime and immigration that was backed by Merkel but denounced by critics as xenophobic. "In Hesse, we sustained losses -- that is painful, there is no way of ignoring that," Merkel, standing next to Koch and Lower Saxony Premier Christian Wulff, told a news conference. "But the CDU is still the strongest force" in Hesse, Merkel said, adding that her party was looking ahead to next month's election in the city-state of Hamburg where another conservative premier faces a tough battle to retain power. Finely-balanced results for three smaller parties mean it is unclear whether the CDU or SPD will be able to lead a coalition in Hesse, and the haggling is likely to poison the atmosphere further in their fractious federal "grand coalition". Although Merkel is still one of Germany's most popular chancellors two years into office, her hands are tied by coalition tensions, and business and industry groups warned of a policy gridlock. "We fear any zeal for reform which remains in Berlin's grand coalition will now be very much weakened," Anton Boerner, head of the BGA exporters' association told Handelsblatt newspaper. The two parties disagree on most policy areas -- from a minimum wage to crime policy -- and many economists fear Merkel will shift leftwards to woo centrist voters. "There are obviously large parts of the population that want more 'social justice' and that see the past reforms as a mistake," said Goldman Sachs economist Dirk Schumacher, adding he expected no more meaningful reforms before 2009's election. Merkel, however, insisted the coalition's work was on track. "For Berlin, for the grand coalition it means continuing to work out the problems people face," said Merkel, who faces the threat of a slowing economy after two years of robust growth. A complicating factor in the coalition-forming process in Hesse is the success of the Left party, a far-left grouping of ex-communists and disaffected SPD members, which won enough votes to enter the state parliament. In another election on Sunday in the northwestern state of Lower Saxony, home to carmaker Volkswagen, CDU Premier Wulff retained power in a coalition with the liberal Free Democrats although he also saw his support drop. The Left will also enter that parliame
