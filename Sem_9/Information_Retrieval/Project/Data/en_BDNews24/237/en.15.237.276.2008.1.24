 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Another freedom fighter filed a murder case Thursday against Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid, assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Mollah, Mohammad Kamaruzzaman and six others. Md Ameer Hossain Mollah, a veteran of Sector Two during the War of Independence, filed the case with Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court at 10:30am. After hearing, metropolitan magistrate Emran Hossain Chowdhury ordered the officer in charge of Pallabi Police Station to accept the case as an FIR and submit an investigation report. The case details said the complainant had trained in guerilla warfare with Squad Six, Alpha Company, Mujib Camp at Laylapur in Assam of India and joined the war under Sector Two. Inspired by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's historical speech on March 7, 1971, Ameer had raised a volunteers' army and they would train at Iqbal Hall of Dhaka University under the supervision of the then student leaders to continue with the countrywide non-cooperation movement. He alleged that Kader Mollah, one of the accused, also initiated a training programme simultaneously for 70/80 Biharees (non-Bengalis) to bolster the spirit of Pakistani integration. On March 25, 1971, the Pakistani soldiers posted in East Pakistan began killing the innocent civilians in Dhaka. At dawn on April 24, Pakistani troops in helicopters landed in Albadi village by the river Turag and they along with some 100 people led by Kader Mollah opened fire simultaneously on the innocent villagers from the eastern side of the village to massacre them. As many as 64 villagers were killed21 of them being the complainant's relativesin the mayhem carried out by the Pakistan army and Kader's anti-people non-Bengali armed cadres. The joint onslaught also killed another 344 people including 280 farmers and paddy harvesters who had arrived there from other districts to eke out a living, the case alleged. The dead were dumped into three dug wells, which were sealed unceremoniously and the whole village was torched as well. While all those atrocities were being committed, the plaintiff with his family hid themselves in a nearby water body. On Dec 14, 1971 the accused in this case killed hundreds of Dhaka University teachers, intellectuals, journalists and innocent civilians and dumped them in Rayerbazaar killing grounds in Dhaka. As independent Bangladesh emerged on Dec 16, about 1000 Al Badr members including the accused in this case sought refuge at Mohammadpur Physical Training Institute with the Razakaars. On Dec 18, the plaintiff along with around 100 freedom fighters led by Mominul Haque, commander of Mohammadpur thana unit, encircled the garrisoning accused and opened fire. The accused and their cohorts retaliated heavily, leading to the death of Abdus Sattar, the plaintiff's co-fighter. The case details also said the plaintiff was shocked to hear the anti-liberation war elements speaking lowly about the War of Independence 36 years after the great event. Ameer said he had not been able to file a case against those killers before Jan 11, 2007 because of obvious obstacles. He said he could file the case now that the judiciary has become independent. The plaintiff demanded that the accused be arrested and tried befittingly. Some 80 unidentified non-Bangalees were also made as accused in the case and 15 witnesses were mentioned. On Dec 5, 2007, freedom fighter Fazlur Rahman of Keraniganj filed a treason case against some of the accused in the present case, which was cancelled due to disapproval of the court. On Dec 17 that year, another freedom fighter, Mozaffar Ahmed Khan, filed a case against Nizami, Mujahid and others for killing freedom fighters. bdnews24.com
