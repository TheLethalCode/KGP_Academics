 BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Monday to consider sending its monitors back to Gaza's border with Egypt, provided all parties there agree, EU diplomats said. Any such move seems remote for the time being, however. Gaza's Egyptian border crossing at Rafah was blasted open last week by Hamas Islamists, allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to pour across to stock up on supplies in defiance of an Israeli-led blockade of the Hamas-controlled territory. European border monitors had been stationed at Rafah until June, when Hamas routed secular Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas has since wielded little authority beyond the Israeli-occupied West Bank. "The EU is ready to consider resuming its monitoring mission in Rafah," the diplomat said after the 27 EU foreign ministers discussed it on Monday. Such a move was conditional on a prior agreement between the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and Israel on the movement of persons, the diplomat said. Arab foreign ministers meeting in emergency session in Cairo on Sunday welcomed a suggestion by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that it would take control of the border and run the crossing. "The European Union is ready to play its own role," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana had told reporters when arriving at the EU ministers' meeting. He said he would be going to Egypt at the week-end to talk with President Hosni Mubarak. The European Union, which like Israel shuns Hamas and calls it a terrorist organisation, has voiced support for a plan by Abbas to assume control of Rafah, along with the Gaza Strip's main crossing points with Israel, but the move faces opposition from Hamas. Israel has also been cool to the idea, arguing that Abbas's security forces are no match for Hamas's. "The European Union is looking into a comprehensive solution to the question of the (Gaza) crossings, including the possible redeployment at Rafah," a European official told Reuters in Jerusalem, referring to Gaza's only crossing with Egypt. In addition to the border terminal at Rafah, the EU is exploring the possibility of establishing monitoring arrangements at Gaza's crossings with Israel, which says Hamas brings arms in from Egypt to launch rocket and other attacks on its cities. But European and Western officials based in the region said the major sticking point was security and getting Hamas to sign on. "We cannot deliver Hamas, someone else has to," one of the European officials said, noting EU diplomats could not speak directly to Hamas. "The situation with Hamas has to be clarified. Hamas has to agree to it," he said on condition of anonymity. Another European official involved in the stalled monitoring programme at Rafah said: "The security situation is very tricky and will take time to work out." Israel's Foreign Ministry held preliminary talks over the weekend with members of the EU monitoring mission, now based in southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. During the meeting, Israeli officials asked mostly logistical issues about the mission's capabilities. They did not specifically request that EU monitors return to the crossi
