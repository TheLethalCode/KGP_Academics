<TITLE> Iraq's 2008 budget unlikely to pass soon, MP says </TITLE>

 BAGHDAD, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's 2008 budget is unlikely to be passed soon because of divisions within parliament and anger at the government's handling of the issue, a senior lawmaker said on Thursday. Lawmakers refused to ratify the $48 billion budget this week because of disputes over allocations, particularly for the largely autonomous northern region of Kurdistan. Members of parliament have also accused the government of not giving them enough time to examine the budget. The impasse remains despite meetings this week with senior government officials including Finance Minister Bayan Jabor and parliamentary speaker Mahmoud Mashhadani. "There was a big argument over the budget figures," said lawmaker Mehdi al-Hafudh, a member of the parliamentary economic committee. "So far, the minister has given no answer." Mashhadani urged lawmakers on Tuesday to hurry up and sign off on the budget and had hoped in vain that it would pass when parliament sat on Thursday. The planning minister has said delay will hold up vital state projects. But lawmakers doubted it would pass even when parliament sits again on Saturday. "There are many questions raising serious concern. I doubt parliament will reach a consensus on Saturday, or even a few days after that," said Hafudh, from the secular Shi'ite Iraqi National List of former interim prime minister Iyad Allawi. One of those issues was the failure of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shi'ite-led government to deliver accounts for the 2007 budget to parliament, he said. "Such records should be delivered and discussed before adopting the 2008 budget," Hafudh said. Another matter of dispute is the 17 percent of the budget allocated to Kurdistan, based on population estimates. In the absence of an accurate census, some lawmakers have argued Kurdistan should only receive 12 percent of the budget.
