<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister will urge collective action to tackle a "21st century-style crisis" of global share slides triggered by the US subprime problem when he speaks to world economic leaders in Davos on Saturday, a Japanese newspaper said on Friday. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda will also promise the issue will be discussed substantially at a Group of Eight summit in northern Japan in July, the Daily Yomiuri newspaper reported. Commenting on the speech to the annual World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference that Fukuda would express his views concerning international cooperation in regard to global share price falls and rising oil prices. Kyodo news agency reported that Fukuda would say the effects of the subprime turmoil on Japan's economic and financial systems were limited and the country's economic fundamentals were sound. But he will also call for increased policy coordination with other economies to better cope with a recession in the United States in the wake of the financial turbulence, Kyodo added, quoting a Japanese foreign ministry official. The US Federal Reserve slashed rates by 75 basis points on Tuesday, and some Japanese politicians have urged the Bank of Japan to cut its key policy rate, already a mere 0.5 percent. European Central Bank policy makers on Thursday rejected talk of lower rates, despite politicians saying a cut could be on the cards
