 ADELAIDE, Australia, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Factbox on Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist after he announced his retirement on Saturday. Born: November 14, 1971, Bellingen, Australia. Left-hand bat, wicketkeeper. Test debut: v Pakistan, Brisbane, November 1999. 96 tests, 5,566 runs av 47.89. 17 centuries. High score: 204 . 377 catches, 37 stumpings. 414 dismissals (world record) 277 ODI's, 9,594 runs av 36.03. 15 centuries. High score: 172. 401 catches, 53 stumpings. 454 dismissals (world record) Arguably the greatest wicketkeeper-batsmen the game has ever seen and one of the world's most entertaining players. Has been equally effective in tests and one-day internationals and captained Australia in both forms of the game. He made his one-day debut for Australia in 1996 and was promoted to the test team in 1999 at the expense of Ian Healy. A big-hitter who scores his runs quickly and effortlessly, Gilchrist opens the batting in one-dayers and bats at seven in tests. Holds the Australian record for the fastest century and double hundred in tests and is the only player in history to hit 100 sixes in tests. Holds the world record for the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in both tests and one-dayers. Has played in three World Cup winning teams, including last year where he was named man of the match, and was a member of the Australian team that twice set world records for 16 consecutive test wins. His three most famous innings were his unbeaten 149 against Pakistan at Hobart, his 204 not out against South Africa at Johannesburg, and his 57-ball century against England in Perth. Will be remembered as one of the few modern players who voluntarily walks when he is out
