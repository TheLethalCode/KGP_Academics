 Nazran, Russia, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian special forces tightened security in the southern region of Ingushetia on Friday and warned of possible attacks, a day before a protest against alleged vote-rigging in last month's elections. Russia is fighting a growing insurgency in Ingushetia, a mainly Muslim region that borders Chechnya, where Russia has fought two wars since the fall of the Soviet Union. The Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had information militants were preparing attacks and declared parts of Ingushetia a "counter-terrorist operation zone", allowing authorities to restrict movement of people and vehicles. "Members of the armed rebels are preparing a number of terrorist attacks in public places in Ingushetia, as well as attacks on administrative buildings and armed provocations against law enforcement officers," the FSB said in a statement. The "counter-terrorist zone" includes parts of the regional capital Nazran, where a protest against alleged falsification of parliamentary election results is planned for Saturday. Rally organisers said the FSB's move was an attempt to suppress turnout at the rally. "We believe 100 percent that this is linked to the rally we are holding in Nazran, which shows the authorities want to frighten those who want to take part," Magomed Yevloev, one of the organisers, told Reuters. "If authorities try to use force to disrupt the protest, then there will be mass street fights in Nazran," Yevloev said. Official election figures reported a 99 percent turnout for Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party in the region. Yevloev has helped gather 88,000 signatures from people who said they did not vote, from a total population of 450,000. The FSB's order takes effect less than six weeks before Russians vote for a successor to Putin, who enjoys strong domestic support for restoring stability and bringing relative calm in Chechnya
