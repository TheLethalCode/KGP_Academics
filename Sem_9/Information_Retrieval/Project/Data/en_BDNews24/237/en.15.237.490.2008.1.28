 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 percent early on Monday as persistent fears of a US recession hurt growth-sensitive banks and commodity shares. At 0825 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 75.1 points at 5,793.9, after losing 0.55 percent last week. The UK's blue-chip index is down 10 percent so far this month, on track for its biggest monthly percentage loss since September 2002. "We have a lot of news out this week in terms of the U.S. economy. We have got (President George W) Bush's state of union address tonight. And we have the Fed meeting and the consumer sentiment report later this week. I think everyone is running a bit scared," said Roger Cursley, UK strategist at Investec. European shares also fell sharply in early trade. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average lost nearly 4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed about 4 percent. Banks, which have borne the brunt of global credit market turmoil, were again hammered, shaving 26 points off the index. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, HBOS and Lloyds TSB lost between 1.7 and 3 percent. Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower said the central bank needs to stop worrying about inflation and cut interest rates to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. Commodity shares also came under pressure on concerns that slowing growth would crimp demand. Oil major BP fell 1.1 percent and Royal Dutch Shell dropped 1.9 percent. In the mining sector, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Lonmin, Anglo American and Vedanta Resources slipped between 1.1 and 3 percent. Xstrata however, advanced 1.3 percent on takeover speculation. The Financial Times said Brazilian mining group Vale is lining up financing, reported to be about $50 billion, for a possible offer for Xstrata. The miner also announced a 28 percent increase in the total estimated mineral resource at the Collahuasi copper mine in Chile. Retailers, housebuilders and property counters also fell, with Marks & Spencer down 1.7 percent, British Land easing 1 percent and Persimmon losing 2.6 perce
