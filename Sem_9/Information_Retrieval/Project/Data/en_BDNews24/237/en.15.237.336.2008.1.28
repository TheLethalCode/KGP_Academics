 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all rounder Andrew Flintoff said he hopes to make his return from injury this summer. Flintoff, 30, underwent a fourth operation on his troublesome left ankle in October and has since been building up his fitness with rehabilitation periods in South Africa and the United States. "I'm not making big statements about when I'll be playing again but, fingers crossed, I'll be OK for the summer," he told British daily The Sun on Monday. "I'm just taking things steadily. It's not worked the last three or four times I've tried to get back so I won't rush it this time." England host New Zealand and South Africa in test series this summer
