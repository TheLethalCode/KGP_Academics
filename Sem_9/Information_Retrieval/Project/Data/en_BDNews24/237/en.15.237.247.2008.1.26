<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Liberation war sector commanders campaigning for trials of 'war criminals' Saturday repeated their calls to be united for the cause. "A number of people in the country collaborated in the genocide, looting and raping of thousands of women during the War of Liberation in 1971," retired air vice marshal AK Khandaker said at a function. "They committed crimes against the country. The time has come to put them on trial," he said. "The country must be united to this end," Khandaker said, adding that trial did not get through as people were not united. "If all the people raise their voice, the government will be compelled to initiate trial of the killers." The Sector Commanders' Forum organised the function in part of their campaign against "war crimes". He said some 80 organisations expressed solidarity with their campaign. Different political parties have also agreed to adopt the issue of war crime trials as an electoral agenda, he said. Retired Lt Col Kazi Nuruzzaman who commanded Sector 7 in 1971 said: "The demand for trial of war criminals has been raised internationally." "Leadership is the main crisis," Nuruzzaman said, adding that the Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee should get support to re-initiate the trial of war criminals. Retired major general CR Dutta, who was in charge of Sector 4, said: "An integrated effort is needed to try the war criminals." That movement should include freedom fighters, professionals and social and cultural organisations joining hands in the same way they had fought for the country, Dutta said. "The sector commanders are making that effort to unite all," he said. Retired Lt Col Abu Osman Chowdhury said: "Though the trial of crimes such as genocide, torture and arson had begun in 1972, it came to an end after the 1975 killings." "Trials could not proceed because of a change in the political scenario," he added. "Different governments have reinstated war criminals either socially or politically," Osman said. He asked the caretaker government to try war criminals by setting up special tribunals. Maj Gen (retd) Jamil D Ahsan, coordinator of the Sector Commanders' Forum, said: "It is high time to be united for the trial of the war criminals. We have to avail ourselves of the opportunity." Member secretary of the forum Dr M A Hassan said that the 'defeated forces' were showing guts due to lack of justice. "The trial of the war criminals should be held in the country in the same way as Cambodia and Vietnam did in their countries after long," he said. He asked all to identify 5,000 killing fields, scattered in various places of the country. Hassan asked the government to form a probe commission for the trial of the 'war criminals'. Professor Hassan Azizul Haque said, "The glory of our liberation war is about to be blurred for the audacity of the Jamaat-Shibir. "If the war criminals are not tried, we won't be able to raise our heads as a nation," he said. Language veteran advocate Golam Arif Tipu said that the war criminals had been identified and should be tried under national and international laws. bdnews2
