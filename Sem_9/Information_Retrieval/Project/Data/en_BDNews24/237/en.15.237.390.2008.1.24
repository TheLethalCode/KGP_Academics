<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Chairman of Prime Bank Azam J Chowdhury claimed Thursday that he had not accused former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in a case involving charges of extortion. Full Story "I don't know how she was implicated in that case," Chowdhury told reporters after the annual business conference of Prime Bank at a Gulshan hotel. "Sheikh Hasina is the daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and I cannot even think of suing her," he said. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Thursday halted the High Court stay order on proceedings of the Tk 3 crore extortion case against Hasina filed by Chowdhury. The trial of Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim is again set to proceed in the court of metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque. Chowdhury filed the case in person with Gulshan Police Station on June 13, 2007. But Chowdhury Thursday told bdnews24.com that his allegation was only against Hasina's cousin Sheikh Selim. He alleged that Selim had taken the money from him in return for a promised deal. "I want to make it clear that I did not file a case against Sheikh Hasina. Sheikh Selim took the money from me in return for a contract," he claimed. "He (Selim) told me that he would get the deal done with the help of Sheikh Hasina." Chowdhury further claimed that Selim had said that Hasina requested Selim to take the money. Chowdhury added that he, himself, had not paid the money directly to Hasina. "Nor did she demand it from me." In reply to Chowdhury's statement Thursday, Hasina's lawyer Rafique-ul Huq told reporters: "I have heard Azam J Chowdhury is saying he did not file any case against Sheikh Hasina. If it is true, there is no case against Sheikh Hasina then." The lawyer said Hasina would be acquitted from the case if Chowdhury gave evidence before the court in this respect. "Azam J Chowdhury realises he will have to stay in this country. So he has admitted the truth," Huq added. Chowdhury, also managing director of East Coast Trading, filed the case on June 13 with Gulshan police, naming former health minister Sheikh Selim as the main accused in the case. Hasina was taken from her home and detained under emergency powers rules on July 16, 2007. She was later shown arrested in the case. The High Court had stayed the proceedings on Jan 17 until the legality of bringing the case under EPR was settled. On Wednesday, the court began hearing a writ petition that challenged the legitimacy of the case in this context. During the hearing of the writ petition, Hasina's counsel argued that it was in no way appropriate to try the case under EPR. Barrister Shafique Ahmed pointed out that the alleged incident of extortion was dated before a state of emergency was imposed in the country. The lawyer added that applying the Emergency Powers Ordinance to an incident that took place a long time ago contradicted the ordinance itself. According to the case details, Chowdhury alleged that Sheikh Selim took Tk 2.99 crore from him in several installments between 2000 and 2001, in return for helping him gain a contract to set up a power plant at Shiddirganj in Narayanganj. The case files record the transaction was made through eight cheques issued by Standard Chartered bank and Southeast Bank. bdnews24.com/at/ra/
