 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday set Jan 30 for a verdict on two writ petitions that challenged the detention orders of BNP's senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman and former prime minister Khaleda Zia's political adviser ASM Hannan Shah. The High Court bench of Justice Mirza Hossein Haider and Justice Mamnun Rahman completed hearing the writ petitions before setting the date for the delivery of the verdict. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq argued the case in the hearing on behalf of Tarique and Hannan. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan and barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim assisted him. The state was represented by additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed and deputy attorney general Mubina Asaf. Joint forces arrested Tarique, also elder son of Khaleda, on March 7 last year. The government on April 13 ordered detention of Tarique under the Special Powers Act. The petition for Tarique was filed with the High Court on Dec 2 last year. The same day the court ordered the government to explain why the detention order would not be declared illegal. Police arrested Hannan on Nov 7 last year and the government on Nov 25 ordered his detention under the same act. A writ petition challenging the detention order was filed with the High Court on Dec 2 and the court the same day asked the government to prove that the detention order was lawful. bdnew
