 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com) As many as 14 'high-profile' detainees are staying in hospital cells although their problems are minor, a top prisons official said Sunday. Inspector general (prisons) brigadier general Zakir Hassan said that they have failed to bring them back to jail despite repeated efforts. He said only five detainees out of 19 now in prison cells of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital are suffering from serious physical troubles but the rest are good enough to return to jail. He said some detainees often fake sickness to stay in the hospital. "I have sent my officials several times to bring them back. But the physicians said they still have problems and need treatment," he said. "But they seemed quite okay to our officers." "It's preventing us arranging treatment to prisoners who need it the most," he said. The prisons boss said there are 12 cells for prisoners in the hospital while they have kept other detainees in wards under a special security arrangement. Superintendent of the BSMMU retired brigadier general Zahir Uddin Ahmed refused to make any comment after bdnews24.com contacted him. bdnews24.
