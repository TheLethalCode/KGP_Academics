<TITLE> Enter a Dalit, pursued by India`s worried leaders </TITLE>

 New Delhi, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Months after an outright poll win in India's most populous state, a Dalit or "untouchable" leader is gaining political momentum nationally and could hold the balance of power after a general election slated for 2009. Mayawati, now Uttar Pradesh chief minister, and her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which champions the Dalits' cause, threaten to suck support from the ruling Congress party by appealing to low castes and the poor feeling left out of India's economic boom. For her 52nd birthday this month, she flew to the capital and announced a likely prime ministerial bid. Her party also plans to contest a host of state polls this year that will be a dress rehearsal for the general election. The first poll will be in India's north-east in February and March. If Mayawati does well, it could cast doubt on what economic direction a future government with her would take and further entrench caste politics nationally. It could also weaken national mainstream parties' six-decade grip on India. "Mayawati has the potential to create a political space with a rainbow coalition of the disadvantaged," said Mahesh Rangarajan, a political analyst who teaches at Delhi University. About 16 percent of India's 1.1 billion population are Dalits. They are typically among India's poorest and are often relegated to menial jobs, such as scavenging and toilet cleaning. Now one of their own holds one of India's top political jobs running a state of about 170 million people. Uttar Pradesh also provides the single biggest bloc of seats for the national parliament. "The Congress party seems out of touch with the poor ... and Mayawati already has a strong base with Dalits," said Rangarajan. Since independence in 1947, India has mainly been governed by two parties, the left-of-centre Congress and the more pro-market Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Each has held on to power through coalitions with smaller parties. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rules thanks to the support of a group of leftist parties in parliament. Now they might be looking over their shoulders. The BSP could displace the Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPI(M), as India's third-biggest party in as little as a year, when the latter's support could have been eroded among poor farmers as it tried to promote industry, analysts say. The Congress party has performed poorly in state elections, with many voters feeling an economic boom is bypassing them. It was a sign of the times that on Mayawati's birthday this month, Prime Minister Singh even took time out from a state visit to China to congratulate her by phone. FLUSH WITH RESOURCES When Mayawati won Uttar Pradesh in May, it was the first time in nearly two decades a party gained an absolute majority in the state assembly. Her win was in part due to her alliance between Dalits and high Brahmin castes against a middle, farming caste traditionally seen as exploiters of poor and "untouchable" villagers. Since her win she has campaigned for a coalition of all castes, but analysts say Dalits will remain her core support. "Mayawati is flush with resources and she's determined to make an impact on the national stage," said Swapan Dasgupta, a political analyst. The BSP has since eyed other state elections, looking to gain in image as an all-India party to boost its image ahead of 2009. "It's pretty close to being a national party the way it's going up. We've offices in all the states apart from the northeast," said Swami Prasad Maurya, BSP head in Uttar Pradesh. It may have a hard task expanding beyond Uttar Pradesh. India politics is regional and her caste alliance might not fit in other states. Her Brahmin allies could also be poached by other parties. Mayawati lost a recent by-election in Uttar Pradesh, a sign she might be failing to consolidate her voter support. Mayawati is also controversial, with a history of corruption allegations against her. She has raised eyebrows by spending more than $100 million on parks and statues in her honour. But in the western state of Gujarat last December, the BSP won more than 500,000 votes, or nearly 3 percent of the vote -- a small amount, but up from 66,000 votes in the previous election. It was the third-biggest party behind Congress and the BJP. In Himachal Pradesh state, it won a seat for the first time. In India, a third party only needs a relatively small number of seats. The third-biggest party, the CPI(M) has 43 seats in the national parliament, compared to 152 for Congress. BSP now has 18 seats nationally. If Mayawati's May state win was replicated at a general election, she could gain 40 seats in the national parliament. "She's enough presence in northern and parts of western India to act as a spoiler to Congress," said Dasgupta. "She wants to consolidate UP, get 40 or so seats at the next election so she has bargaining clout." Mayawati is unlikely to forge any pre-election alliances. But post-election, she could side with any party, political analysts said. In Uttar Pradesh she has often allied with the BJP. "She knows you don't become a chief minister or prime minister with just one constituency," said Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Secretary Shasank Shekhar Singh
