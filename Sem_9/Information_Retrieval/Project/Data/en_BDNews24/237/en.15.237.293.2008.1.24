 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has decided to serve notices on three former lawmakers asking them to submit wealth statements, an official said Thursday. The notices will be sent out next week, ACC director general (administration) Colonel Hanif Iqbal told reporters in his office in Segunbagicha in the city. The three ex-MPs are Shahidul Haque Jamal and AKM Fazlul Haque Milon of BNP and AKM Jahangir Hossain of the Awami League. The ACC will serve Milon's wife with a notice for wealth statement as well. Iqbal said they had not accepted the wealth statement of the AL's policymaking presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury because she had not signed it. He said there had been no decision on whether Sajeda Chowdhury would be sued for not submitting wealth statement in time. bdnew
