 Jakarta, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's Supreme Court on Friday sentenced a former pilot for national carrier Garuda to 20 years in jail for the murder of a prominent human rights activist, a court official said. The court overturned its own previous verdict, passed in October 2006, which cleared Pollycarpus Priyanto of a lower court's conviction and a 14-year jail term for the murder of activist Munir Thalib. Munir died of arsenic poisoning while he was on board a Garuda flight from Singapore to the Netherlands. The Supreme Court's latest decision came after prosecutors filed a case review, presenting what they said was fresh evidence that Priyanto served Munir with a poison-laced drink while in transit in Singapore's Changi Airport. "The defendant was proven guilty of premeditated murder," the Supreme Court's spokesman Djoko Sarwoko told Reuters
