<TITLE> Five-member team to see AFC president over FAs guidelines </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  A five-strong delegation will soon meet Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Mohamed Bin Hammam to inform him about the importance of installing government representatives to local football associations in Bangladesh. The move came, as the global football regulator FIFA was against inclusion of a government official to any Divisional and District Football Associations (FAs) in Bangladesh. But local football organisers and officials want government officials play their role in the associations. The decision for seeing the AFC president came Saturday at a meeting of the high-ups of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF), the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) and representatives of various football clubs. "We have talked about the importance of involvement of the local administrator in the associations," organiser Fazlur Rahman Babul told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said the meeting decided to send a team of five--- two BFF officials, two organisers and the chief operating officer of the BOA. He said the delegation would try to convince the AFC president to relax the FIFA guidelines on the formation of FAs in Bangladesh. In April last year, FIFA asked the BFF to form FAs at district and divisional levels keeping the government officials out of the committees. But there is a growing concern over the FIFA rules that if it is possible to organise football competitions in the divisional and district levels without the help of local government officials. The FIFA had also asked the country's football governing body to hold an annual general meeting (AGM) or extra-ordinary meeting (EGM) after forming FAs. But many have questioned the guidelines, saying how the BFF would call an AGM or EGM with new representatives of FAs, which doesn't support the BFF constitution. The FIFA's guidelines confront some of the provisions of the BFF, and the officials think the guidelines of the global regulator should match local rules and regulations. Many of the former booters and organisers had protested the move of keeping the government officials out of the FAs. National Sports Council chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed had also earlier said the government would take the issue to FIFA. BFF acting president Monir Ahmed, vice president Abdur Rahim, acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu, BOA acting secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed, BOA chief operating officer Col (retd) Waliullah attended Saturday's meeting. Organsiers Badol Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, Nurul Alam Chowdhury and Fazlur Rahman Babul were also present in the meeting.
