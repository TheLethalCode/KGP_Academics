<TITLE> Zimbabwe sets March 29 vote, opposition cries foul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Harare, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe said on Friday Zimbabwe will hold general elections on March 29 but the opposition denounced the date as a snub to regional mediation efforts to guarantee a fair vote. The 83-year old leader, who has ruled the country since independence in 1980 and is running for another five-year term, said parliament would be dissolved the day before Zimbabweans vote in presidential and parliamentary elections. But the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which has threatened to boycott the polls if they are not pushed back to June, said Mugabe's announcement was a slap in the face for South African-mediated talks between the rivals to hammer out a new constitution. Critics accuse Mugabe of rigging previous elections, using tough security laws to keep his opponents in check and of economic mismanagement. Mugabe denies these charges. The elections will take place against a backdrop of economic meltdown in what was once one of Africa's most prosperous economies, with the inflation rate officially at 8,000 percent, mass unemployment and severe food shortages. "I do, by this proclamation dissolve parliament with effect from midnight, the 28th March 2008 and ... fix Saturday the 29th March as the day of the election to the office of President, the general election and the elections of councillors," Mugabe said. The MDC slammed the announcement, which came amid efforts by South African President Thabo Mbeki to broker a political agreement between Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF and the opposition that was supposed to pave the way for the elections. "What Mugabe has done is a slap in the face, not only of the MDC, but of Mbeki and the Southern African Development Community (SADC)," said Nelson Chamisa, an opposition spokesman. WASHINGTON REGRETS MOVE Washington said it had wanted to see a level playing field. "We regret that President Mugabe has insisted on proceeding with the presidential and parliamentary elections on March 29 without having reached an agreement on conditions that would have levelled the playing field for all parties planning to compete in those elections," U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said in a written response to a reporter's question. The ZANU-PF and the MDC have been in talks on revamping the constitution since June, 2007 in an effort to end the political and economic turmoil and ensure future election results are accepted by all parties. "We're currently deadlocked on three main issues: a new constitution, the political environment and election date, but he has proceeded to ambush us before the dialogue is completed," Chamisa said, adding the MDC would meet soon to review the situation. On Wednesday, police used tear gas to disperse a banned march staged by MDC pressing for political reform. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was briefly detained ahead of the march. Earlier this month, Mbeki said the elections would still be held in March. Lovemore Madhuku, a constitutional lawyer leading a pressure group pushing for a new constitution, said the election date came as no surprise. "It was always clear the elections would be held in March," Madhuku said. "The challenge is to continue pressing the Mugabe regime -- which, because of the twisted electoral environment, will still be there in the post-election period -- to adopt a new constitution." Mugabe's foes in the West see him as a ruthless autocrat whose people are victims of his mismanagement. But southern African leaders look up to him as a liberation hero who stands up to the United States and Britain.
