 Nusa Dua, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia hosts a United Nations anti-corruption conference of more than 100 countries this week, as the Southeast Asian nation comes under the spotlight over its failure to bring to account former president Suharto. Clawing back some of the billions of dollars in assets stolen by corrupt leaders will be a central theme of the conference in the resort island of Bali. The following list ranks the world's most and least corrupt countries, based on a 2007 index put out by corruption watchdog Transparency International. MOST CORRUPT LEAST CORRUPT COUNTRY CPI SCORE COUNTRY CPI SCORE Somalia 1.4 Denmark 9.4 Myanmar 1.4 Finland 9.4 Iraq 1.5 New Zealand 9.4 Haiti 1.6 Singapore 9.3 Uzbekistan 1.7 Sweden 9.3 Tonga 1.7 Iceland 9.2 Sudan 1.8 Netherlands 9.0 Chad 1.8 Switzerland 9.0 Afghanistan 1.8 Canada 8.7 Laos 1.9 Norway 8.7 The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) measures the perceived level of public sector corruption based on expert assessments, business analysts and opinion surveys of about 180 countries. The lower the CPI of a country, the higher corruption is, with 0 being the most corrupt and 10 being very clean. Indonesia had a score of 2.3 last year and ranked 143rd out of 179 nations in the survey.
