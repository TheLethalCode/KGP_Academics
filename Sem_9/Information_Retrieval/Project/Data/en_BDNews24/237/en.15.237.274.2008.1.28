 BEIJING, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two workers died during the construction of the showpiece stadium for this year's Olympic Games and not the 10 reported last week, Beijing officials said on Monday.

Scheduled to be completed by the end of March, it will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics and soccer at the Aug. 8-24 Games. The Sunday Times report said the "conservative estimate" of 10 deaths "was reached by comparing numerous accounts of witnesses who worked at the site in different periods".
