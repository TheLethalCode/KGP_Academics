<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  The three-day Bishwa Ijtema, the second largest Muslim congregation in the world, began after Friday prayers at Tongi near the capital. The annual event has been drawing the largest number of Muslims, after the hajj, from all over the world since 1967. The organisers of this year's Ijtema expect that about 2.2 million devotees will be gathering at the Tongi Ijtema grounds. Some devotees have been suffering discomfort due to the cold spell and foggy weather. Many arrived prepared to cope with the January cold, but the rains and bitter cold winds have been unexpected, they said. The elderly Ali Imaam Mohammad from Noakhali, however, brushed aside such complaints, saying bravely: "We've come to serve God, He'll surely protect us from all disasters and discomforts." Since Friday morning, eminent Islamic scholars have been delivering lectures on various aspects of Islam and the Muslim Ummah, which are being simultaneously translated into 16 major languages including Bangla. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed issued separate messages marking the event. The president's message called upon all assembled to help build the nation as a strong entity and devote their lives and resources to raising a capable nation. Fakhruddin expressed hope that the Ijtema will play a significant role in strengthening the bonds of Muslim brotherhood across the globe. The Bishwa Ijtema or "global gathering" will be rounded off with akheri munajaat (concluding prayers) Sunday. Tight security measures with the deployment of 20,000 law enforcers and CCTVs have been put in place to ensure safety of devotees as they conduct their rites. The Ijtema premises, sprawling over 190 acres of land beside the river Turag, were abuzz with activities on the morning of the first day. About 4,500 representatives from 62 countries had arrived at the Ijtema by Friday morning. Hundreds of vehicles loaded with devotees of all age groups coming from far and wide were still seen to be approaching the venue. The government has set up dispensaries around the grounds for devotees. Around 40 voluntary organisations have also set up free medical treatment centres to provide the devotees with first aid and medicines. Organised by the Tablig Jama'at, the Bishwa Ijtema 2008 is the 42nd annual gathering, which was first initiated by Muhammad Aktar Ilias. Though Ilias had organised the very first Ijtema at Kakrail in Dhaka in 1946, it became a regular annual event from 1967. bdnews24.com/s
