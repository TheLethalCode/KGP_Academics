 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Sunday asked AB Bank and Axiom Technologies to re-offer prices for the sponsorship right for the home series between Bangladesh and South Africa next month. The cricket regulator's move came since both the companies Sunday offered the lowest prices that are less than expected, said BCB chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman. "We have asked them to re-bid tomorrow (Monday) as both bidders failed to meet even the floor prices," Mahmudur told bdnews24.com Sunday. Rahman said the sponsorship package has been decked up by three categories with first one pricing at Tk1.2 crore while the second and the third at Tk 40 lakh each. South Africa is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on Feb 14 to play a two-Test and three-ODI series against the host. AB Bank is the sponsor of the Bangladesh U-19 team in next month's ICC World Cup and a BCB partner in selling tickets for home series. The Axiom Technologies had earlier taken part in a bid for the sponsorship right of the national team in ICC Twenty20 World Cup, but it lost to AB Bank. The BCB earned about Tk4 crore from the sponsorship in the series between Bangladesh and India in April-May last year.
