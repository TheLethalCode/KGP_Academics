 Seoul, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A South Korean special counsel raided an insurance arm of Samsung Group on Friday as a part of its probe into whether the country's largest conglomerate may have bribed public officials, the company said. Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance Co, a non-life insurance firm, is the latest in a series of high profile targets raided by the special counsel that included the home and office of the country's richest man, Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee. Officials at the special prosecutor's office would not confirm the raid. A Samsung Fire and Marine official said investigators were searching its offices but declined to elaborate. South Korea's parliament approved the probe in November after a former top Samsung legal executive accused the group of using its subsidiaries to create a slush fund and paying off public officials to avert investigations into its management practices.
