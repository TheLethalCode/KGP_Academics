 RAFAH, Egypt, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Gazans streamed past a flattened border wall into Egypt on foot or by bicycle for a second day on Thursday to stock up on goods scarce in the coastal strip, defying an Israeli blockade. A handful of camouflaged Egyptian riot forces watched from a distance as Gazan men, some dressed in traditional black and white scarves, grabbed sheep by the horns and dragged them over the border, a day after Palestinians blasted it open. "We haven't eaten meat since the Eid (holiday in December). There are sheep in Gaza but they are more expensive than here," said Ramzi Abed, a Gazan father of 10. He dragged two sheep on a rope across the border and cradled a lamb in his arms. Palestinian militants set off bombs on Wednesday and destroyed the Israeli-built southern border wall, a move that allowed ordinary Palestinians to cross a border that had been largely shut since June. Israel, which defends its blockade of Hamas-controlled Gaza as intended to counter rocket fire by militants, said it wanted to cut its links with the coastal strip by handing the supply of electricity, water and medicine to others. An Israeli security official said Egypt should take over responsibility for the territory, from which Israel pulled its troops and settlers in 2005 following 38 years of occupation. Inside the dusty Egyptian town of Rafah, a normally quiet road was transformed into a crowded street market packed with vendors selling everything from cigarettes to sheep and motorcycles, with prices as much as double the norm. "Here we sell Viagra," read a large sign posted at a tiny store in Rafah visited by Palestinian customers. Egyptian trucks full of supplies were backed up for miles in the border area. Palestinians unloaded and carried goods into Gaza by foot. Palestinian women at the border, some in traditional dress, hefted crates of fruit and vegetables onto their heads to take home to Gaza. Many men carried boxes of cigarettes. CHILDREN SCRAMBLE ON WALL Children at the border, some of them barefoot, scrambled over the flattened remnants of what had been a towering rust-coloured metal wall, turning parts of it into a slide. But some supplies were running low. Several Egyptian petrol stations reported running out of gasoline even as more Palestinians walked into Egypt carrying empty plastic jerrycans they were hoping to fill. Diesel fuel was still available. Currency dealers lined the streets to sell Egyptian pounds at inflated rates of 4.7 to 5 pounds per dollar, well off the 5.54 pounds on offer elsewhere in Egypt. Egyptian merchants were also taking payment in dollars or Israeli shekels. "No one is happy in Gaza but at least there is freedom to move now and we can buy things," said Mohamed Mansi, a 28-year-old farmer who was making repeated trips to Egypt to buy fuel and cigarettes to resell in Gaza. He said he found petrol nearly 80 percent cheaper in Egypt, where gasoline is heavily subsidised by the government, although one petrol dealer said stations had raised rates. Some Palestinians said they were buying medicine for sick family members. Others carried bags of cement and some led camels and cows across the border. Others, such as Gaza clothes merchant Mohamed Zaki, were trying to restock their shops after merchandise dwindled. "I brought clothes since my store had run out of new clothes," he said. "Merchants of animals are here, merchants of cigarettes, of flour, of cement, of medicine, almost everybody." A Hamas spokesman said the Islamist group had paid 16,000 government employees early so they could go shopping. But even those Palestinians who had no money to spend were taking the trip just to get out of Gaza. "We passed freely and we are happy here. The prices here are much cheaper even though I have no money to buy anything," said Samir Samiri, 30, who stepped out of Gaza for the first time in his life on Thursday.
