<TITLE> Prodi warns Italy of "vacuum" if he has to quit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi told the Senate on Thursday that if it forces him to resign with an expected no confidence vote, a "power vacuum" will leave Italy's economy vulnerable to a global slowdown. "The country needs more than ever to be governed. Italy needs continuity in its government and cannot afford a power vacuum," said Prodi, whose 1-1/2 years in office have been dogged by instability in his fragmented centre-left coalition. Defeat for 68-year-old Prodi in the vote scheduled for 1900 GMT would probably bring early elections, which polls suggest would return former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to power. As markets reacted nervously to the prospect of the collapse of Italy's 61st government since World War Two and more turmoil, Prodi told the debate that changing government was a "luxury Italy cannot afford" at a moment of global economic nervousness. "Italy risks finding itself in a negative economic cycle which we will face with still imperfect economic structures," he told senators at the start of a rowdy debate where one senator was shouted down and carried out of the chamber on a stretcher. Prodi sought confidence votes in both houses after a small Catholic party withdrew its support for him, erasing his tiny majority in the upper house. Further defections mean even the support of unelected lifetime senators is unlikely to save him. But the man known in Italy as the "professor" decided to go ahead with the vote, rejecting the advice of President Giorgio Napolitano to step down after winning an easier vote in the lower house on Wednesday. FRAGMENTED Even one of the prime minister's most acerbic critics, Senator Roberto Calderoli of the far-right Northern League, said he admired his pluck: "He will lose the confidence vote but he will fall with a soldier's honour for having fought to the end." The centre-right opposition led by Berlusconi, who lost to Prodi in 2006 elections, hopes Napolitano will then call early elections which, according to opinion polls, Berlusconi would win by a clear margin. But there is a groundswell of pressure in Italy for reforms to election rules, tampered with by Berlusconi before the last elections, which are widely blamed for the unstable system of fragmented coalitions whose bickering dogged Prodi's tenure. Commentators and analysts warn that holding early elections soon, without changing the messy voting rules, would merely prolong instability which has already impeded economic reforms needed to stop Italy underperforming its euro zone peers. Prodi, an economics professor and former president of the European Commission, takes credit for tidying up the public finances of the euro area's third largest economy, but new data show its consumer confidence at its lowest in 2-1/2 years. The turmoil took its toll on markets, where spreads between Italian government bonds and German bunds widened to near levels not seen for 6-1/2 years. Traders said the upheaval had further encouraged a flight to quality as the world economy slows down. "A couple of basis point in terms of the spread of longer bonds are due to political uncertainty," said one bond trader. "HEART ATTACK" To win, Prodi needs the support of a handful of unelected life senators who have rescued him in previous votes and some elected senators would have to throw him a lifeline by not showing up for the vote, lowering the quorum. One life senator, ex-president Francesco Cossiga, said he would back Prodi "but this is the last time because ... Italy's political system cannot lurch from one heart attack to another." In the unlikely event that he wins, Prodi told the Senate he would consider "redefining the structure and composition" of his government, which would likely mean a cabinet change. If he loses, Napolitano could ask Prodi or another senior politician or technocrat to form an interim government with a mandate for electoral reform before new elections are called. Italy has turned to technical governments before in times of crisis and some economists see it as quite a positive option. "It often doesn't make much difference who governs Italy but technical governments have actually done quite well in the past," said Holger Schmieding of Bank of America.
