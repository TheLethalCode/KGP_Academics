 Kandahar, Afghanistan, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan forces searched on Sunday for a US aid worker kidnapped by gunmen from the southern city of Kandahar. No one has claimed responsibility for the abduction of the 49-year-old unidentified burqa-clad woman who was seized from her car along with her driver while heading for work on Saturday. "We have had no luck so far and the search continues," said one official who requested to remain anonymous. The woman had been living for years in a rented house in Kandahar, part of the main stronghold of Taliban insurgents who have been behind a series of abductions of foreigners and Afghans in recent years. Apart from the Taliban, criminal gangs have also carried out kidnappings. No one has claimed responsibility for the latest kidnapping and Afghan officials say gunmen were behind it.
