 BRUSSELS, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission ducked the question of a date for Kosovo's planned declaration of independence from Serbia after talks on Thursday between its enlargement chief and new Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. "Commissioner (Olli) Rehn reiterated the European Union's readiness to carry its responsibility by steering a coordinated and managed process to finalise the settlement of Kosovo's status," Commission spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy told a news conference.

They said the United States, Germany and some other European powers were keen to recognise Kosovo's independence once the Feb. 3 second round of Serbia's presidential election is over.

NATO, which holds a summit in early April, waged an air war in 1999 to end the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Serbian forces trying to crush Thaci's guerrilla army.
