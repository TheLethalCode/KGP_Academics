<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The three-day Biswa Ijtema is to end early because of cold weather, said Tongi municipality chairman Ajmatullah Friday. The akheri monajaat to be held at 8pm will wrap up the congregation after less than a day of devotions. Biswa Ijtema, the second largest Muslim congregation in the world, began Friday after Jummah prayers at Tongi near the capital. Some devotees had been suffering discomfort due to the cold spell and foggy weather. Many arrived prepared to cope with the January cold, but the rains and bitter cold winds have been unexpected, they said. The annual three-day Ijtema has been drawing the largest number of Muslims, after the hajj, from all over the world since 1967. The organisers of the 2008 Biswa Ijtema expected about 2.2 million devotees at the Ijtema grounds during the religious event. bd
