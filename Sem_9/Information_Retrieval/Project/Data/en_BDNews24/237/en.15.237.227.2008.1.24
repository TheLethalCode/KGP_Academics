 MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Built like a prize-fighter, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga pummelled world number two Rafael Nadal into submission to reach the Australian Open final on a spectacular Thursday night at Melbourne Park. Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic had wowed the day session, beating Jelena Jankovic and Daniela Hantuchova to set up a mouth-watering women's final, but the night belonged to unseeded Frenchman Tsonga. In only his fifth grand slam tournament, the 38th-ranked Tsonga tore up the form book and sent Nadal shuddering to the exit 6-2 6-3 6-2. "Just amazing... unbelievable... nothing could stop me today," the 22-year-old grinned. "I tried to hit everything and everything went in, so... what can I say?" Frequently likened to a youthful Muhammad Ali for his poise and powerful build, Tsonga will need to stay grounded for three more days. He will meet either Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final. Serb Ivanovic staged a sensational fightback to reach the final where she will gun for a first grand slam title. FIRST-SET WHITEWASH The fourth seed recovered from a first-set whitewash to oust Hantuchova 0-6 6-3 6-4. Ivanovic won just nine points in the first set and trailed 6-0 2-0 before pulling things around. "It definitely was a disappointing start for me," the relieved 20-year-old smiled. "I just had a feeling she was playing really good and I was always on the back foot and always defending. I just couldn't find my rhythm. I tried to hang in there to stay with her." Hantuchova left court having barely congratulated her conqueror and later accused the Serb of gamesmanship for squeaking her shoes on the court when receiving serve. Ivanovic swept aside the accusation. "There was nothing I could do, because if I want to move my feet to return a ball, you know, this was the sound I was producing," she told reporters. Sharapova reached Saturday's showpiece in vastly contrasting style, hammering Serb Jankovic 6-3 6-1. The Russian followed on from her quarter-final thrashing of world number one Justine Henin with a devastating display against the third seed. BLASTING SERVES Pounding groundstrokes into the corners and blasting serves down, she never allowed the Serb to settle on Rod Laver Arena. Jankovic, struggling with a lower back injury, was unable to keep up or even compete as she was left watching shots fly past her. "I wanted to withdraw, but it was not fair for the crowd. It's a semi-final, so I played how much I could to finish the match," Jankovic said. "I thought that Maria played very, very well, and anyway, she deserved to win. But I couldn't really give a match." For Sharapova, there is unfinished business in Melbourne after last year's final defeat. "From the beginning of the tournament, you want to go a step further than you've done in the past. That's always your goal, and your mantra going into a tournament," the Russian said
