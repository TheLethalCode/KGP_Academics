 NICOSIA, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos has a slim lead in opinion polls three weeks before elections but could still lose to his communist rival, surveys suggested on Sunday. Polls in the Simerini and Politis dailies gave Papadopoulos 33.2 percent and 30.5 percent respectively, just ahead of Communist leader Demetris Christofias with 32.4 percent in the Simerini poll and 30.0 percent in the Politis survey. Right-wing candidate Ioannis Kassoulides was running a strong third on 30.1 percent (Simerini) and 29.9 percent (Politis), making the election too close to call. Presidential elections are scheduled on Feb. 17. If a candidate fails to win an outright majority a runoff ballot will be staged between the two frontrunners on Feb. 24. The latest polls suggested a runoff between the incumbent Papadopoulos, a hardliner who led Greek Cypriots into rejecting a U.N. reunification plan for Cyprus in 2004, and Christofias, a populist leader who is speaker of parliament. Simerini's poll suggested the communist Christofias would prevail over Papadopoulos by 42.8 percent to 40.8 percent. But the Politis poll made Papadopoulos the eventual winner with 40.1 percent of the vote compared to 38.4 percent for Christofias. Nine candidates are running in the election, held every five years. Cyprus has a presidential system of government. The winner of the vote will be tasked with negotiating a way out of a deadlock in peace talks with Turkish Cypriots. Cyprus has been divided between its ethnic Greek and Turkish populations since Turkey invaded north Cyprus in 1974, following a Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military then ruling Greece. The Greek Cypriot south is internationally recognised and represents Cyprus in the European Union, while the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in its north remains a hurdle to Turkey's bid to join the 27-nation bloc.
