 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The International Chamber of Commerce for Bangladesh Thursday claimed some foreign individuals are involved in money laundering and siphoning foreign currency out of the country in the name of investing in the services sector. ICCB officials raised the alarm at a meeting with senior Board of Investment officials at the ICCB boardroom. "In some cases foreigners do not even obtain the necessary visas or permission from the BoI before doing business," ICCB president Mahbubur Rahman told the BoI executive chairman Kamaluddin Ahmed. "These activities and clandestine operations hardly contribute anything to the economy, rather it drains foreign currency and encourages money laundering," said Rahman. The ICCB president said foreigners are working in Bangladesh's services sector both independently and with local partners. Freight forwarding, visa processing, shipping, buying houses, beauty parlours, restaurants and shops are the foreigners' main areas of investment, he added. Rahman suggested the BoI collaborated with the Bangladesh Bank to produce accurate statistics on both foreign and domestic investments to increase understanding of the issue. He also asked the BoI to take some concrete measures to reduce red tape for investments, and bring all investment promotion agencies under one umbrella. The BoI executive chairman said he would consider the ICCB's suggestions. bd
