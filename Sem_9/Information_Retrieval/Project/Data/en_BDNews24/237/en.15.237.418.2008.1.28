 Magura, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Monday stressed the importance of a sound moral education in the fight against corruption. "Corruption can never be eliminated from the society through purely legal measures," said Hasan Mashhud at a meeting in Magura on prevention of corruption. "To eliminate corruption, our moral education has to be strengthened from the family level through to the educational institutions," he said. The ACC chairman said raising public awareness on the issue was crucial, and advised the people to participate in meetings and peaceful rallies to promote higher ethical standards in the country. "Resorting to corruption must be made dangerous by creating social pressure, so that no one dares to behave in that way," he said. "Corruption is endemic in our society, it cannot be eliminated overnight. A social movement is required for this," said Chowdhury. "However, no one will be spared if they act in a corrupt way," The ACC chairman said a reputation for corruption had tarnished the nation's image oversees. "The task now is to bring corruption under control and later eliminate it. We want to present a corruption-free country to the next generation," added Chowdhury. bdnews24.co
