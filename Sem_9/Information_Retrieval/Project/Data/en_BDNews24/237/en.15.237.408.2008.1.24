<TITLE> Italy PM mulls whether to quit or risk vote </TITLE>

 ROME, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi had to decide on Thursday whether to resign or risk a confidence vote he would be expected to lose, obliging his centre-left government to step down anyway. "Prodi's Last Battle," proclaimed La Repubblica, one of a chorus of headlines underscoring a grim political situation which threatens prolonged instability for the third largest economy in the euro zone. The 68-year-old prime minister, whose 1-1/2-year-old government was thrown into crisis when a small coalition party withdrew its support this week, went to confer with President Giorgio Napolitano before announcing his decision. Prodi won a confidence vote on Wednesday in the lower house of parliament -- as expected, since he has a clear majority there. But his prospects look bleak in the upper house or Senate, where a second vote is scheduled later on Thursday. Political commentators said Napolitano would prefer Prodi to resign and skip the messy vote he is likely to lose in the upper house, where his once slim majority is no longer guaranteed. The president may ask Prodi, or some other senior politician or technocrat, to form an interim government with a mandate to change Italy's complicated electoral law, which is widely blamed for the country's chronic political instability. But Prodi has indicated that he wants to battle to the end and risk the Senate vote as a matter of political honour and in the slim hope that he might be able to sway some legislators. ELECTIONS INEVITABLE The turmoil took its toll on markets, where spreads between Italian government bonds and German bunds widened to near levels not seen for 6-1/2 years. Traders said Italian political news had further encouraged investors to seek safe bets as doubts over the international economy grow. Italy's economy, which has long underperformed its euro zone peers, suffered more bad news with the worst consumer confidence data for 2-1/2 years. Political commentators and analysts warn that holding snap elections now, without changing the messy voting rules, would merely prolong the unstable system of bickering coalitions. But even one cabinet member -- Higher Education Minister Fabio Mussi -- said early elections now looked evitable. "What happens after this are all variations on one single truth: there will be elections," Mussi told reporters. Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, waiting in the wings to return to power, wants Napolitano to dissolve parliament and call elections immediately. Prodi's term in office should have lasted until 2011. If Prodi does face the Senate vote he will need the support of a handful of unelected life senators who have rescued him in previous votes. Dissenting elected senators could also throw him a lifeline by not showing up for the vote, lowering the quorum. If an interim government is formed, it might be led by a non-party technocrat, a formula Italy has turned to before in times of crisis. Some economists, disappointed by successive governments' inability to make progress on reforms, view the option quite positively. "It often doesn't make much difference who governs Italy but technical governments have actually done quite well in the past," said Holger Schmieding of Bank of Ameri
