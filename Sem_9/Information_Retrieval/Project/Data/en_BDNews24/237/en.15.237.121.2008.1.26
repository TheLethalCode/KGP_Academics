 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Blazing 51 runs from Nazimuddin powered the GP-BCB Academy team on Saturday to a three-wicket win over Hong Kong in the curtailed third one-day match at the Hong Kong Cricket Club ground. After being invited to bat first, the hosts could manage 146 all out in 36.2 overs as Academy pace duo Delwar Hossain and Kamrul Islam wrecked the top and middle orders sharing seven wickets. Delwar led the attack with four for 13, followed by Kamrul on three for 34. Spinner Nayeem Islam took two wickets for 17 to wrap the tail up. Shawkat Ali and Munir Daar made 32 and 31 to help Hong Kong cross the triple digits in a 38-over-a-side affair. The GP-BCB side reached 147 for seven in 22.7 overs as Nazimuddin smashed five sixes and three fours to make 51 while Nayeem remained unbeaten on 17 to steer their side home. The visitors defeated the hosts by 71 runs in the first match before the second match was abandoned due to rains Friday.
