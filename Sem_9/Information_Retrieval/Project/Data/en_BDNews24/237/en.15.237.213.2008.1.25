 Gaza, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Israeli air strikes on cars killed at least four Palestinian militants in the southern Gaza town of Rafah on Friday, security officials and medical staff said. An Israeli army spokeswoman confirmed the military had carried out both air strikes, saying that the targets had been "terror operatives". In the first strike on Friday morning the car of the two men who were hit was completely destroyed. Hamas said the second later strike targetted two of its local militant commanders in the area. Israel frequently carries out strikes against Gaza militants in an effort to stop them launching rockets and mortar bombs across the border into nearby towns in the Jewish state. Rafah became the focus of international attention on Wednesday when tens of thousands of Palestinians poured into Egypt from the Gaza Strip to stock up on food and fuel which is in short supply due to an Israeli blockade. The border wall was breached in a series of explosions. Israel stepped up a blockade on the coastal territory which is controlled by Islamist Hamas, in an effort to clamp down on the militants
