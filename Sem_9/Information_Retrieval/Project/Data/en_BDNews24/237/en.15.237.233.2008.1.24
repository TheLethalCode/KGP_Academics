 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  A senior lawyer Thursday filed a writ petition with the High Court, seeking an order to hold a parliamentary election in 90 days. The bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Shahidul Islam will hear the petition Sunday. Barrister Masud Reza Sobhan filed the appeal. The chief adviser, law secretary, the Election Commission and the EC secretary were made respondents to the case. In his appeal, Reza said there was a constitutional obligation to hold the polls in 90 days. But the election was delayed in the name of making a new voter list and national identity cards. bdnew
