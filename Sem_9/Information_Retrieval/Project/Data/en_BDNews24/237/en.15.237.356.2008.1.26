 Patuakhali, January 26 (bdnews24.com)  The local administration in Patuakhali has banned the sale of poultry and their eggs until Feb 1 in a bid to contain the spread of bird flu. An extended ban of three months has been imposed on Akhrabari and Puranbazaar following reported cases there. The deputy commissioner said those who ignore the ban will face severe legal consequences.
