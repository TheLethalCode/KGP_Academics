 LOS ANGELES, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britney Spears says her life is so dull under her father's watchful eye that she feels old and boring. With her new album "Circus" out next week, the 26-year-old singer is working on a comeback after seeing her life spiral out of control with a run of strange behavior, a bitter custody battle over her two sons and the loss of her rights to administer her own affairs. "I feel like an old person now," Spears told Rolling Stone in an interview for the music magazine's December 11 issue. "I do! I go to bed at, like, 9:30 every night and I don't go out or anything, you know what I mean? I just feel like an old fart." In 2007, the Louisiana native was a near-constant figure on the Hollywood party scene. She shaved her head, then wore a pink wig and spoke with a fake British accent. By early this year, she was hospitalized twice for psychiatric evaluation. By February, a California court named her father as a conservator of her estate, giving Jamie Spears control over her personal and business affairs. Since then, she seems to have put her life back in order. "Womanizer," the first single from "Circus," reached the top of Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in October. The album is set for release on December 2, the singer's 27th birthday, and she plans to tour this spring to promote it. In excerpts posted online on Tuesday, the story "Britney Returns" -- www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/24612561 -- details limitations put on her life by her conservatorship and notes she is watched constantly by guards hired by her father. The interviewer was restricted from asking Britney about her troubled months. Instead, she talks about her current life and going on chaperoned dates with men who failed to impress her. She jokingly describes one as "an older version of Harry Potter but skinnier." Spears also discusses being a mom to her two sons, Sean Preston, 3, and Jayden, 2, whom she sees three days a week. "To be a really good mom, I feel your child needs to be your full-time job," Spears told the magazine. "I want to raise my kids and share all of those precious moments with them." The Rolling Stone with Spears on the cover hits newsstands on Friday.
