 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  It may be possible to publish the results of the 28th BCS preliminary tests as early as January, chairman of the Public Service Commission Sa'dat Hussain told bdnews24.com in an exclusive interview Monday. "As the month of December will be busy with the national election and has many holidays including Eid, Victory Day and Christmas, the PSC will try to publish the preliminary BCS exam results in January," said the chairman. About one lakh examinees took the preliminary tests on Nov 28. The chairman the 29th BCS exams notification will also be circulated in January, adding that the 28th BCS recruitment process would be rounded off by Nov-Dec 2009. "If it were a board exam, we could have tried to publish the results sooner. Based on these results, the most coveted government jobs are offered; hence, meticulous care is needed in publishing them," said Dr Hussain. On the pass marks for the preliminary exams, he said, "The pass mark for the written exam is 50. But the preliminary qualifiers will be the topmost performers, as there are no pass marks set for the preliminary." On efforts to prevent question leaks, which have marred past exams, the PSC chairman said: "Guarding against any test paper leaks, we took extra precaution this year and prepared multiple sets of test papers." "Just minutes before the examination, the commission members sat in a meeting and decided via lottery which set to use and passed on the decision to the exam centres over telephone," he pointed out. "We were doing all these when the examinees were already seated in the halls. The process, therefore, was 'leak-proof', you might say." Asked to comment on the complaints that the test papers were tough this time, Dr Hussain said, "The PSC chairman or members do not get involved with this. Experienced university teachers and experts prepare the test papers." "We would like to end past 'traditions' and methods of the PSC's functioning. We want the best candidates to perform their best and bag the best trophies." bdnews24.com/
