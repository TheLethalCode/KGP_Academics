<TITLE> Obama names Clinton, 'buries past rivalry' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Arshad Mahmud in Washington, DC Washington, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)President-elect Barack Obama formally introduced former rival Hillary Clinton Monday morning as the secretary of state-designate at a ceremony in his transition office in Chicago. The formal introduction confirmed speculations over past weeks since the Obama transition team sent feelers out in Clinton's direction. The overture by Obama, political analysts say, was intended to bury the ill-feeling caused by the bitter campaign fought by the two former Democratic rivals for the party nomination during the primary. The president-elect's plans to unveil the national security team after the Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27) took on additional urgency after the terror attacks in Mumbai. The attacks, which left at least 180 dead, including six Americans, offered a stark reminder that for all Obama's focus on fixing the economy, national security may take priority for a president at any moment. Both the Obama and Clinton camps had been preparing the ground for days, though the official announcement was reportedly delayed due to former President Bill Clinton's extensive business and philanthropic interests around the world. The issue was resolved after the former president agreed to a nine-point plan covering disclosure, vetting and other areas to avoid potential conflicts of interestincluding the release of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation by the end of the year. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton will essentially lead the national security team that will include Robert Gates staying on as defense secretary, homeland security secretary-designate Janet Napolitano, national security adviser-designate retired Marine General James Jones, attorney general-designate Erik Holder and UN ambassador-designate Susan Rice. At a time when the country remains engaged in two wars and still faces the threat of international terrorism, Clinton is expected to play a centrist role in the security team. Obama's national security team nominations have drawn praise from Washington heavyweights including Senator John Warner, the retiring Republican elder. "The triumvirate of Gates, Clinton and Jones to lead Obama's national security team instills great confidence at home and abroad," Warner, a former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told the New York Times. " and further strengthens the growing respect for the president-elect's courage and ability to exercise sound judgment in selecting the best and the brightest to implement our nation's security policies." While the choices have generated praise across the aisle, some critics have pointed out that the team represents experience rather than the 'change' Obama promised on the campaign trail. All of his top choices served in either the Clinton or Bush administrations. In an effort to counter that perception, Obama last week said in a news conference that he was trying to "combine experience with fresh thinking" and added that "the vision for change comes" from him. bd
