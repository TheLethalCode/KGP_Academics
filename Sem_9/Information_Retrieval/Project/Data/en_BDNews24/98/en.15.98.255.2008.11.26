 Dhaka, Nov 26(bdnews24.com)  Awami League has again said it has doubts over the general elections taking place in time and accused the Election Commission of favouring 'a party'. "The Election Commission is making the polls uncertain by changing its polls schedule again and again. We cannot say that elections will be held on schedule," the party's spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said. "It is working to favour a particular political party," he said after a meeting of the party's policymaking presidium. "We accepted Dec. 29 as the date for general election in the interest of the country. We thought the Election Commission would be fair to all political parties. Now its seems they are working to give the advantages to a political party," he said without taking names. Ashraful said the EC was misinterpreting its own laws and inciting 'a particular party' to infringe electoral laws. The EC was preparing the ground for that party to win polls on the pretext of creating a level playing field for all political parties. He said an election commissioner had said that If anyone fails to run the elections from a political party, he can switch the party to run the race. " We protest his comments." Ashraful asked the EC to provide the candidates printed voter list for a fee because printing machine required to print the lists from CDs given by the EC are mostly absent outside Dhaka. He said a meeting of AL Central Working Committee will be called on Dec 5 to approve the party's election manifesto, which party chief Sheikh Hasina will unveil on Dec. 12. After the presidium meeting, Zaker Party chairman Mostafa Ameer Faisal met Hasina. bdnews24
