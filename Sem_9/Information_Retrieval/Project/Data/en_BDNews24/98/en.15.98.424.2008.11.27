 By Rina Chandran MUMBAI, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's prime minister Manmohan Singh said on Thursday the attacks in Mumbai that killed more than 100 people were well planned and probably had "external linkages". Singh was speaking as witnesses in Mumbai said commandos were preparing to storm the Taj Hotel, the Trident-Oberoi and a Jewish centre, where militants have trapped or taken hostage scores of people. "The well-planned and well-orchestrated attacks, probably with external linkages, were intended to create a sense of terror by choosing high-profile targets," Singh said in an address to the nation. Gunfire and explosions were heard from Mumbai's Taj Hotel on Thursday as commandos took on Islamist militants holed up there, with smoke billowing from one open window, witnesses and TV channels reported. At the nearby Trident-Oberoi Hotel, where scores of people were trapped and some taken hostage by militants, there was also a fresh round of firing, with television channels saying commandos had also entered the building. At least three people were seen leaving the hotel's back door, television channels said. Commandos had also gathered outside Nariman House, a Jewish centre where a rabbi is thought to have been taken hostage, but later apparently decided to hold off from an assault. A militant holed up in the centre phoned a television channel on Thursday to offer talks with the government for the release of hostages, but also to complain about abuses in Kashmir. "Ask the government to talk to us and we will release the hostages," the man, identified by the India TV channel as Imran, said, speaking in Urdu in what sounded like a Kashmiri accent. "Are you aware how many people have been killed in Kashmir? Are you aware how your army has killed Muslims. Are you aware how many of them have been killed in Kashmir this week?" Commandos earlier freed hostages from the Taj but battled on with the Islamist militants who had launched their audacious attack after arrived by boats in Mumbai on Wednesday. The gunmen had fanned out in the heart of the city, firing indiscriminately, and attacking luxury hotels, a landmark cafe, hospitals and a railway station. Some 17 hours after the late-evening assault, soldiers and militants were still exchanging intermittent fire and more than 100 people were trapped inside rooms of the Taj Mahal hotel, a 105-year-old city landmark. "People who were held up there, they have all been rescued," Maharashtra state police chief A.N. Roy told NDTV news. "But there are guests in the rooms, we don't know how many." Roy said some people were still apparently being held hostage at the nearby Trident/Oberoi Hotel. "That is why the operation is being conducted more sensitively to ensure there are no casualties of innocent people." Police said at least six foreigners were killed and another 287 people were wounded in the attacks, which were claimed by the little-known Deccan Mujahideen group. "Release all the mujahideens, and Muslims living in India should not be troubled," said a militant inside the Oberoi, speaking to Indian television by telephone. The man, who identified himself only as Sahadullah, said he was one of seven attackers inside the hotel, and wanted Islamist militants to be freed from Indian jails. Later, an explosion was heard at the hotel, a Reuters witness said. At least two guests, trapped in their rooms in the Taj, also phoned TV stations. One said the firedoors were locked, and another said he had seen two dead bodies by the swimming pool. "Two of my colleagues are still in there and the last we heard from them was three hours ago and then the phone battery died," said a German national who escaped the Taj. The attacks were bound to spook investors in one of Asia's largest and fastest-growing economies. Mumbai has seen several major bomb attacks in the past, but never anything so obviously targeted at foreigners. Authorities closed stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, and the central bank said it would continue auctions to keep cash flowing through interbank lending markets, which seized up after the global financial crisis. The militants struck at the heart of Mumbai's financial and tourist centre on Wednesday, with one of the first targets the Cafe Leopold, a famous hangout popular with foreign tourists. They fired automatic weapons indiscriminately and threw grenades before settling in for a long siege at the Taj and the Trident/Oberoi. "There could be 100-200 people inside the (Trident/Oberoi) hotel, but we cannot give you the exact figure as many people have locked themselves inside their rooms," Maharashtra state deputy chief minister R.R. Patil told reporters. "There could be 10-12 terrorists inside the hotel," he said. "There are no negotiations with the terrorists." The attackers appeared to target British and Americans as they sought hostages. Israelis were also among the hostages, a television channel reported, while police said an Israeli rabbi was also being held by gunmen in a Mumbai apartment. Witnesses said the attackers were young South Asian men in their early 20s, most likely Indians, speaking Hindi or Urdu. Television footage showed gunmen in a pick-up truck spraying people with rifle fire as the vehicle drove down a Mumbai street. Hotel staff evacuated wounded on luggage trolleys, with passers-by covered in blood after they rushed to help. Some clambered down ladders to safety. BLOW FOR RULING PARTY, INVESTMENT The attacks could be another blow for the Congress party-led government ahead of a general election due by early 2009, with the party already under fire for failing to prevent a string of bomb attacks on Indian cities. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would address the nation on television at 4:30 p.m., a spokesman said. Opposition leader L. K. Advani cancelled plans to campaign for ongoing state elections and prepared to visit the city, the Press Trust of India reported. Strategic expert Uday Bhaskar said the attacks could inflame tensions between Hindus and Muslims. "The fact that they were trying to segregate British and American passport holders definitely suggests Islamist fervour," Bhaskar said. Police said they had shot dead four gunmen and arrested nine suspects. They said 12 policemen were killed, including Hemant Karkare, the chief of the police anti-terrorist squad in Mumbai. Schools were closed and a curfew was imposed around the Gateway of India, a colonial-era monument. But train services were running as normal taking people to work in the stunned city. Rakesh Patel, a British witness who was staying at the Taj Mahal hotel on business, said the attackers were looking for British and U.S. passport holders. "They came from the restaurant and took us up the stairs. They had bombs. Young boys, maybe 20 years old, 25 years old. They had two guns," he told the NDTV channel, smoke stains covering his face. An Australian, an Italian and a Japanese national were among those killed in the attacks, their governments said. In Washington, the White House and President-elect Barack Obama condemned the attacks, as did France, current president of the European Union, and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba denied on Thursday any role in the Mumbai attacks which killed more than 100 people. "Lashkar-e-Taiba strongly condemns the series of attacks in Mumbai ... Lashkar has no association with any Indian militant group," Abdullah Gaznavai, chief spokesman of the group, told Reuters. Lashkar is often blamed by India for attacks in its territory
