<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Nov 28(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's spy chief has agreed to share intelligence with New Delhi on the brazen militant attacks in Mumbai, India said on Friday, as a siege at two hotels and a Jewish centre neared its end amid gunfire and more deaths. India again pointed a finger at Pakistani-linked "elements" for Wednesday's coordinated attacks by Islamist militants in its financial capital, which police said killed at least 121 people. In a diplomatic exchange that raised the prospect of renewed tension between the nuclear-armed rivals, Foreign Minister Pranab urged Pakistan to dismantle infrastructure supporting militants. His counterpart, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, called in turn on India not to play politics over the attacks in Mumbai. "Do not bring politics into this issue. This is a collective issue. We are facing a common enemy and we should join hands to defeat the enemy," he told reporters during a visit to the Indian town of Ajmer. But, in a move that perhaps reflected Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's conciliatory stance towards his neighbour, Islamabad agreed to send the head of its military intelligence service, the ISI, to India to share information on the attacks. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh requested the visit of Lieutenant-General Ahmed Shujaa Pasha when Pakistani leaders telephoned him in the wake of the attack, his spokesman said. "We confirm the news," he said of television reports. One of the militants arrested in Mumbai was a Pakistani national, the interior minister of Maharashtra, R.R. Patil, told reporters. Commandos took control of the Trident-Oberoi hotel on Friday, some 36 hours after the evening strike on the city. Mumbai police chief Hassan Ghafoor said 24 bodies were found in the building. But battles raged on with militants who were still holed up in another luxury hotel and a Jewish centre with at least half a dozen foreign hostages. "The Oberoi Hotel and Trident are now under our control," the National Security Guards chief J.K. Dutt said. "Oberoi-Trident have been evacuated, we have killed two terrorists." After a morning of shooting and explosions, the head of one commando unit flushing out militants at the five-star Taj Mahal hotel said he had seen 12 to 15 bodies in one room among a total of 50 in the hotel. The commandos found money, ammunition and an identity card from Mauritius that they suspected belonged to the militants, the commander, his face disguised by a black scarf and sunglasses, told a news conference. At least one militant was still thought to be holding two hostages in the luxury Taj Mahal Hotel, an army commander said. But army Commander Lieutenant-General N. Thamburaj told reporters almost all guests and staff had been evacuated from the Taj and the operation would be wrapped up in a few hours. HELICOPTER ASSAULT At the Jewish centre, Indian commandos -- their faces covered by balaclavas -- rappeled from helicopters onto the roof to flush militants there. A Reuters witness said troops fired inside to provide cover as the commandos made at least three sorties. Israel's ambassador to India said he believed about six Israeli nationals were still being held hostage there. "A couple of days ago an Indian caregiver managed to escape with a tiny baby belonging to the rabbi in Chabad House, but the rabbi and his wife are still inside," Mark Sofer told Times Now television. Mumbai, a city of 18 million, is the nerve-centre of India's growing economic might and home to the "Bollywood" film industry. Hindu-dominated India, which has a sizeable Muslim minority, has been hit by militant attacks for decades. But this strike seemed aimed at crippling its ability to draw foreign investment. Australia upgraded its travel warning for India on Friday, telling nationals to reconsider any plans to go there "because of the very high risk of terrorist activity". India's main stock markets reopened on Friday after being closed on Thursday due to the attack, but the main share index closed up 0.73 percent. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday pinned blame for the attacks on militant groups based in India's neighbours, usually an allusion to Pakistan. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947. He warned of "a cost" if these nations did not take action to stop their territory being used to launch such attacks. An estimated 25 men armed with assault rifles and grenades -- at least some of whom arrived by sea -- had fanned out across Mumbai on Wednesday night to attack sites popular with tourists and businessmen, including the city's top two luxury hotels. At least eight foreigners, including one Australian, a Briton, a Canadian, an Italian and a Japanese national, were killed. Scores of others had been trapped in the fighting or held hostage. Police said 279 people were wounded. The Hindu newspaper said at least three of the attackers taken into custody were members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, based in Pakistan. The group made its name fighting Indian rule in disputed Kashmir, and has been closely linked in the past to the ISI. Lashkar-e-Taiba has denied any role in the attacks.
