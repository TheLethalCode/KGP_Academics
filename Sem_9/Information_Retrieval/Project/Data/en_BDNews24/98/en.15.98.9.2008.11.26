 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain met Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka Wednesday over BNP nominations for Dhaka metropolitan constituencies in the upcoming national elections. "We still have a strong presence in the metropolitan area, though this time the total number of constituencies in Dhaka has been increased to 15 from eight," Khoka, one of the 15 BNP hopefuls to contest in Dhaka metropolitan, told reporters after the meeting at Delwar's NAM Flat. BNP candidates won all the previous eight constituencies in 2001, though many doubt if the party and its allies have the same strength this time round. "The chairperson will finalise the candidates for the constituencies considering the overall situation," said the mayor, who won a High Court stay Tuesday on the Election Commission's ban on mayors running for parliament. Party chief may now nominate Khoka for Dhaka-6, metropolitan leaders speculate. BNP began selling nomination papers Tuesday, with more than one leader picking up nomination forms for each constituency of Dhaka. Those who have filed their forms so far include BNP standing committee member and former lawmaker advocate Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmad (Dhaka-12), Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui and first Dhaka mayor Abul Hasnat (Dhaka-7), BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah (Dhaka-17), city BNP former general secretary Abdus Salam (Dhaka-8), former lawmaker SA Khalek, his son SA Mohsin and Eklasuddin Mollah (Dhaka-14) and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's lawyer barrister Nasiruddin Ashim (Dhaka 11 and 12). Ward commissioners and ward leaders have also submitted forms. bdnew
