<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29(bdnews24.com)The family of expelled Jubo League leader Liakat Hossain have again appealed to know his whereabouts, and requested immediate government intervention to locate him after he was grabbed from his from his father-in-law's Lalmatia home last Wednesday. "After my brother was taken by persons claiming to be RAB on Nov 26, we have tried to contact concerned authorities including the inspector general of police and the police commissioner," said Liakat's sister Parul Akhter on Saturday. "None of them saw us. Even after lodging a complaint with police, we are not getting their help in any way," said Parul at a press conference at the Crime Reporters' Association office. "Will nobody take responsibility?" she asked. She called for the government's assistance in the matter, mentioning that her brother's wife had become ill since receiving no news. Also present at the press conference Liakat's cousin Zohirul Islam, also demanded immediate intervention of the government to know about his whereabouts and condition. Farhana Hossain, Liakat's wife, appealed last week for information on the whereabouts of her husband. "A group of men claiming to be members of RAB grabbed Liakat early Wednesday morning and that has been no news about him since," said Farhana in a press conference at Dhaka Reporter's Unity the day after he was taken. "Mohammadpur police have been notified," she added. "My husband is a politician and a freedom fighter. He was among the few who publicly protested the killing of Bangabandhu and, for that reason, was jailed several times," said Farhana. The High Court recently granted him bail and if there had been any complaint against him then he would have been arrested after getting bail, she added. Liakat is one of the 23 'top criminals' listed by police during the previous BNP-led government. He was arrested on Oct 1 2003, and released by a High Court bail order on Sept. 4 this year. Demanding Liakat's freedom, Farhana further said, "If there are any allegations against my husband, then those should be settled in a legal way." RAB has denied the arrest. Colonel Gulzar Ahmed, additional director general of the elite anticrime force, told bdnews24.com Wednesday that they had not arrested anybody by the name of Liakat. His whereabouts was still unknown on Saturday and no other law enforcing agency has admitted his arrest. bdnew
