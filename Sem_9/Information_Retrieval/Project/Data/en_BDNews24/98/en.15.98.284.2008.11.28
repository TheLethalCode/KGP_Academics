<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A six-storey building in Chawk Moghultuli in Lalbagh tilted in the early hours of Friday, the eastern base of the house sinking 6-7 inches into the ground, police said. "The inmates of house 66 on Biren Ghosh Street said they were roused by a strange rumbling noise in the early hours today," sub-inspector Mohammad Faruque, in charge of Chawkbazar police outpost, said to bdnews24.com. "The same rumble was again heard in the morning. The tenants investigated the matter and found the house tilted to a side, burying that base 6-7 inches underground." The inmates informed the police who, in turn, notified all other offices and authorities concerned. Faruque said, "The tenants of the house and the locals said the owner built the house on a skimpy one and a half kathha plot without any architectural plan or design." The owner as well as the tenants have all abandoned the tilted house, as panic gripped the people living in the neighbouring houses too. A general diary has been recorded with Lalbagh Police Station. bdnew
