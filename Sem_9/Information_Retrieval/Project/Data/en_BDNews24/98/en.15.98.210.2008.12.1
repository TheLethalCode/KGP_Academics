<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has stayed until Dec. 3 the Election Commission decision barring city mayors from running for parliament for three years after leaving office, meaning Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin can contest the election, a lawyer said on Sunday. Section 12 of the revised Representation of the People Order forbids the city corporation mayors or ward commissioners to contest the election for three years as they hold the "offices of profit." On Sunday the bench of justices Tarik-ul-Alam and Farah Mahbub passed the order following a writ petition filed by mayor Mohiuddin. The court asked the chief election commissioner, the Election Commission secretary, the law secretary and the principle secretary to the chief adviser to let the court know why such a decision by the Election Commission would not be declared illegal. Abul Baset Majumder, the lawyer for the mayor, told bdnews24.com that "following the order, the mayor can now contest the parliament election." Baset in his argument said, "The office of the mayor is a non-profit one. A mayor does not come under the definition of the office of profit. The yardstick on which a mayoral post is profitable is not right." The Election Commission decided on Nov. 17 that a mayor cannot participate in the election in less than three years after completion of his tenure. Mohiuddin filed a writ petition with the High Court on Nov. 20 challenging the decision. Baset Majumder assisted by Ajoy Shankar Bhowmik argued for the mayor. On a similar appeal filed by Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, the High Court stayed the order. The same court will hear the petition of Khoka on Dec. 3 that he had filed the writ on Nov. 23. bdne
