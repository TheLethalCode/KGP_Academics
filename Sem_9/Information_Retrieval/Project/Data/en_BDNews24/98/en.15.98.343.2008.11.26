<TITLE> GDP not likely to fall: Mirza Aziz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Wednesday ruled out the World Bank prediction of shrinking GDP in the face of a worldwide economic downturn. "GDP growth will not fall under 6 percent," the adviser told reporters after a Secretariat meeting with chairmen of three state-owned commercial banks and their managing directors. "We had the meeting to assess the progress of Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks and the information placed before us shows that they have progressed in almost all quarters," said the adviser. "Only the operation cost has risen and that has happened because employees were given dearness allowance since July last." He also said that no employee of government-owned banks will be handed forced retirement. "They will be retired only if they wish it." The World Bank earlier in the day predicted tough times for the incoming elected government with Bangladesh's economy shrinking in the wake of the ongoing global crisis, though the finance adviser rejected any forecast of a slowdown in GDP growth. "The negative impact of the global financial crisis will affect Bangladesh's economy in the near future," said the Dhaka bureau's chief economist Vinaya Swaroop at a workshop at the Bank's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar office. He said export earnings and remittances are likely to shrink which in turn will mean a decline in GDP growth from 5.4 percent to 4.8 percent. The GDP growth rate has been targeted at 6.5 percent for the current fiscal year. In 2007-08 it was 6.2 percent. The WB economist also said that it was estimated that 1 million people would go abroad for work this year, but only 2 lakh people had found overseas work in the first three months (July-September) of the current FY. There is much doubt whether the remaining 8 lakh people would find work abroad in the face of the current crisis, he said. "The present caretaker government might go more or less unscathed, but the new government taking over in January 2009 shall be facing the challenges posed by the global crisis," Swaroop said. That's why, he stressed, the next government must undertake economic activities after drawing up specific and detailed plans. The country's economists also fear that the current global credit crunch might lessen remittances, foreign loan and aid. The finance adviser on Tuesday had called for "greater utilisation of internal resources" to cushion the impact of the global crisis. bdnews24.com/ar
