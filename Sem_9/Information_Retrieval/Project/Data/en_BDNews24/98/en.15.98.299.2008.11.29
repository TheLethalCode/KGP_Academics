 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  The army will be deployed as a mobile striking force over the general election period from Dec. 24 to 31, said election commissioner Mohammed Sohul Hussain on Saturday. The army will be deployed as a striking force but army personnel will not be present inside voting centres, he said. Only police, ansars and village defence parties will be deployed inside the voting centres to maintain law and order. Nor will members of intelligence agencies be present in the Election Commission's 'control cells' which will be located at the home ministry and at the offices of each returning officer, said Sohul. The decision was made at a Nov 27 meeting of the EC, he added. The army will patrol election areas two days prior and after Election Day just as a "show of force ", with each mobile striking teams based at police stations countrywide, said the commissioner. The period of deployment has been pushed back in line with deferment of the parliamentary polls from Dec. 18 to 29. Upazila polls have also been deferred from Dec. 28 to Jan. 22. The Nov. 27 meeting further decided executive magistrates will be deployed alongside with each army team, with mobile courts awarding spot fines to those breaching electoral laws. The EC on Nov. 12 originally asked the government to keep striking forces deployed from Dec. 12-31 to maintain law and order and ensure security through both general and upazila polls. On that day, the EC decided on formation of 'election control cells' to maintain law and order comprising members of BDR, RAB, police, ansar, VDP, army, navy, coastguard and intelligence branches. The Nov. 27 meeting decided against the presence of intelligence members in the control cells. For the 8th parliamentary election of Oct. 1 2001, armed forces were deployed for 15 days from Sep. 22 to Oct. 6. Political parties, meanwhile, have demanded full withdrawal of the state of emergency before the 9th Jatiya Sangsad vote, but nothing certain has been announced as yet by the government. Sohul was talking to reporters after a visiting UN team of led by UN's former assistant general secretary Frances Vendrell met him and fellow election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain at the EC secretariat. The UN team expressed satisfaction at the EC's preparations for a credible and fair election. bdnews24.com/
