<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com)  Chief selector Rafiqul Alam on Monday termed the ICC suspension on left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak a big blow for Bangladesh, ahead of the home series against Sri Lanka in December-January. "It is certainly a big loss for Bangladesh in both versions of the game as the team has been going through a transitional period since the players' exodus to the Indian cricket league," Alam told bdnews24.com. The 26-year old spinner has been suspended from international cricket for illegal bowling action and will remain out of cricket until he is corrected. "He (Razzak) was a very important player on the side, especially on home ground," said Alam and added, "We are hopeful about finding a solution to this current crisis soon." Razzak has taken seven wickets in five test matches and claimed 110 victims in 79 one-day internationals. The Bangladesh cricket team is scheduled to return home on Tuesday evening from South Africa, where they lost both the one-day internationals and the Tests series. Coach Jamie Siddons is not coming with the team as he had already left South Africa for Australia. bd
