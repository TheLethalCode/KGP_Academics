<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  A four-wicket haul from Mohammad Shahajada guided Rajshahi to hand an emphatic eight-wicket defeat to Chittagong with one day to spare in the seventh round four-dayers of the National Cricket League on Wednesday. Opener Jahurul Islam smacked a 50-ball 45 not out as Rajshahi raced to 73 for two in 16.2 overs after the hosts Chittagong set the visitors to chase 68 runs to win at Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Chittagong, resuming the third day on 89 for two, added 138 runs for eight wickets as Masumuddowla converted his overnight score of 34 to 53 off 177 balls studded with six fours. Besides, Tariq Ahmed (24), Yasin Arafat (32) and Tareq Aziz (22) put some runs on the board as Chittagong bettered their follow-on innings to finish at 227 all out after being skittled out for 80 in the first innings. Rajshahi made 240 all out in the first innings. With fourth win in seven matches, last year's runners-up Rajshahi have 74 runs, seven points less than the leaders Barisal, who on Tuesday handed an innings and 52-run defeat to holders Khulna to stay atop in the six-team point table. Chittagong have 53 points while Khulna have 46 points from seven outings. Dhaka vs Sylhet The match between Dhaka and Sylhet was seemingly heading for a draw as Dhaka were 420 for eight at stumps riding on two centuries from Mahmudullah Riad and Javed Omar at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Dhaka having resumed the day on 155 for four added another 265 for three as Riad converted his overnight score of 52 to 103 before being victim of Taposh Ghosh. His overnight partner Nadif Chowdhury provided a great support to make 81 before also being victim of Taposh. Javed remained unbeaten on 106 when the bails were drawn for the third day. Sylhet were all out for 363 in the first innings. bd
