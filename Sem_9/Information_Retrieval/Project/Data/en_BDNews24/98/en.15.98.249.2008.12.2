 Chittagong, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  The commerce adviser again said Tuesday that the emergency rule will be lifted ahead of the general election on Dec. 29. But he would not be pinned down on when the lifting was likely. CEC ATM Shamsul Huda after a meeting with president Iajuddin Ahmad on Monday had said the parliamentary polls will not be held under the state of emergency. "There is no doubt that the emergency will be lifted before elections," Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters at Shah Amanat Airport in Chittagong. Asked when this would be, however, the adviser said: "We have to consider all factorsthe administration, recommendations of the Election Commission and the demand of political parties." The adviser travelled to the southeastern districts on Monday, including Bandarban and Khagrachhari. He briefed reporters Tuesday about the progress of the development package taken for the port city of Chittagong. "We have to take the city forward to build it up as a world standard city." Hossain Zillur confirmed the major factories and industries in Chittagong would be provided gas supply on a priority basis from the start of December. Other factories, CNG stations and power stations would be provided gas in phases by June next year, he said. The city's development package tackles water logging, energy crisis and infrastructure for industrialisation among other pressing issues. The adviser hoped that the next government would continue the project considering the contribution of the port city to the economy. bdnews
