 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Eid-ul-Azha will be celebrated on Dec 9, said Baitul Mukarram Khatib Mufti Mohammed Nuruddin. The decision came as the National Moon-Sighting Committee announced that it failed to see the moon of the Arabic month of Jilhaj in the sky over Bangladesh on Friday. The 30 days of the month of Jilkad end on Saturday, and from Nov. 30 Sunday, the counting of the month of Jilhaj will begin. Based on that calculation Eid-ul-Azha will be observed on 9 December, said the khatib. The decision was taken at the moon-sighting meeting held at the Islamic Foundation, presided over by joint vice president of the National Moon-Sighting Committee and secretary to religious affairs ministry Mamunur Rashid Chowdhury. bdnews24.
