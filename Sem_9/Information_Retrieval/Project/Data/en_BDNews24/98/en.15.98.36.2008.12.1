 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has deferred the verdict in a graft case involving setting up digital telephone lines against former president HM Ershad and others to Feb. 2 next year. Dhaka divisional special judge Md Golam Mortuza Majumder delayed the judgement, expected on Monday, as two other accused in the case, Anwarul Kader and Majid Chowdhury, did not appear for the hearing because of illness. Jatiya Party chairman, and aspiring to be president again, Ershad was present in court Monday. All three accused have secured bail in the case. The defunct Bureau of Anticorruption official Upendra Chandra Das filed the case on Sep. 5, 1992 with Tejgaon Police Station. The accused are Ershad, former BTTB deputy general managers Samsul Islam (fugitive) and Kader, former BTTB chairman Maksud Ali Khan (died during trial) and owner of Expo Trade Majid. Ershad's former telecommunications minister Kazi Firoze Rashid was also on the list of the accused, but the investigators dropped charges against him in May 2007. According to case details, a decision to install digital telephone lines in 89 upazilas was made on credit from Finland. But skirting the opinions of his planning minister and External Resources Division secretary, Ershad during his time as president had set up the telephone lines on French credit that allegedly cost the state an extra Tk 30 crore, including Tk 71.65 lakh in interest on the credit. bdnew
