 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Interviews of BNP hopefuls for the upcoming election began Thursday, with thousands of BNP leaders and workers converging at the Gulshan office of the chairperson, in what was termed a 'festive mood' though security was kept tight. The interviews are being taken by a parliamentary board led by chairperson Khaleda Zia, that includes secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain and presidium members. "The interviews started at 11 in the morning with the aspiring nominees from Brahmanbaria," said BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. Once the interviews are over, the final list of nominees will be released today or tomorrow, he added. "Since Tuesday morning, 2,096 applications have been submitted," he said. Before lunch, interviews of 361 persons were taken for a total of 68 seats and, of these, 40 were from Sylhet division and 321 from Chittagong. The total number of seats in Chittagong and Sylhet are 55 and 19 respectively. Several hopefuls from Chittagong, after emerging from the interview, reported that the party chief called on them to work together to ensure the victory of the person who gets the party ticket. Thousands of BNP workers and leaders converged in front of the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office for the interview sessions, with marquees erected and mobile fast-food vans stationed near the office. "With the interviews, there is a festive mood in the air," remarked Rizvi Ahmed in a press briefing. However, Road 86 was closed down resulting in traffic gridlock on surrounding streets. Police were stationed from early morning, while BNP appointed three hundred volunteer workers. Interviews of Dhaka and Rajshahi hopefuls began in the evening, and by Thursday night, the interviews of 1200 aspiring nominees for 94 seats in Dhaka and 276 candidates for 57 seats in Rajshahi will be complete, said Rizvi. BNP did not take any interview for the 37 seats reserved for allies of the four- party-alliance: Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Oikya Jote and Bangladesh Jatiya Party. bdnews
