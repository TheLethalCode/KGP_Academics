 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The world observes the World Aids Day on Monday with a slight ray of hope as global HIV/Aids epidemic has been stabilising, though not adequately, since 2001, according to the UN. "The global epidemic is stabilising but it is still at an unacceptably high level," said the UN's 2008 report on global Aids epidemics. "Globally, there were an estimated 33 million people living with HIV in 2007. The annual number of new HIV infections declined from 3 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2007," the report said. As per the UN estimates, Sub-Saharan Africa remains most heavily affected by HIV/Aids, accounting for 67 percent of all people living with HIV and for 72 percent of AIDS deaths in 2007. "The rate of new HIV infections has fallen in several countries although globally these favourable trends are at least partially offset by increases in new infections in other countries," the report said. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed expressed strong commitment to contain the possible onslaught of HIV/Aids in Bangladesh, one of the lowest HIV/Aids prevalent countries in the world. "HIV/Aids has turned into one of the greatest obstacle to development and advancement of the human being. There is no alternative to creating mass awareness about the killer syndrome," Iajuddin said in a message marking the day, when individuals and organisations from around the world come together to bring attention to the global AIDS epidemic. Fakhruddin vowed Bangladesh's determination to encounter HIV/Aids onslaught. "We have adopted a national strategy to face HIV/Aids. Besides, regional and international initiatives are getting stronger," he said. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are 13,000 HIV/Aids patients in Bangladesh. "However, the country's vulnerability is very high. National HIV surveillance indicates that the rate of HIV infection among street-based sex workers in central Bangladesh is high compared with sex workers in other parts of South Asia," the WHO said in its country position report. "HIV among injecting drug users is already 4 percent, (very alarming rate)," warned the UN health body. bdn
