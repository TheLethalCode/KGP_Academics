<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders Abahani Limited got a heavy jolt in their ninth encounter in the Citycell B. League when they went 2-0 down to Brothers Union on Monday. Nigerian Chibuike Divine put the All Orange outfit ahead in the 10th minute while Jahid Hasan sealed the match in the 38th minute at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The third triumph in eight outings meant Bothers ended their four-match winning drought as the Gopibagh-based outfit had earlier lost to Sheikh Russel and drew against Mohammedan, Muktijoddha and Arambagh KS in a row. Brothers joined Chittagong Mohammedan and Rahmatganj MFS with equal 13 points from eight matches to stay in the fourth position after holders Abahani stuck to their previous 19 points from nine outings, two points more than second-paced Sheikh Russel KC, who played a match less than the leaders. Title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan SC are in the third position with 15 points from eight games. Smarting from a 2-1 loss to Sheikh Russel, Brothers Union bossed the play throughout the game and left the pitch with a deserved victory against Abahani, who struggled against Muktijoddha in their 2-0 win in the previous match. The Gopibagh-based outfit did not waste time as they took a 10-minute lead with Divine heading a Shakil Ahmed right-side cross home. Henry Quaye went close to double the lead in the 38th minute, but Abahani goalkeeper Biplob Bhattachriya thwarted the Ghanaian striker's shot to rescue his side, but the keeper could not save the sky blues from a counter attack one minute later. Biplob cleared a lone ball outside the danger zone, but Brothers winger Jahid picked up goalkeeper's clearance on their own half to race down from the middle before hammering a powerful shot at the edge of the box to find the back of Abahani net. Abahani had only one shot on the target when striker Jahid Hasan Emily drove a shot in the 40th minute, but Ziaur Rahman easily gripped Emily's effort. After resumption, Brothers yielded two more opportunities, but both were denied by keeper Biplob while it seemed Abahani had no sign of fight-back in the game. bd
