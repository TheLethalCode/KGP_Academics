<TITLE> Economists join chorus against WB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  The leaders of Bangladesh Economic Association have joined the growing chorus slamming World Bank predictions that the ongoing global economic crisis will hit exports and remittances, slowing GDP growth. "The crisis would rather fetch good results for RMG exports because the country makes low-cost apparels that may see a rise in demand due to the crisis," predicted association president Kazi Kholiquzzaman at a discussion on the global economic recession at BEA's New Eskaton office in the city. The Bank last week predicted tough times for the incoming government with Bangladesh's economy shrinking in the wake of the ongoing global crisis. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam and garment exporters rejected outright the WB forecast. Kholiquzzaman did concede on Saturday that "foreign remittance inflow and foreign aid might have to brave a negative impact if the crisis deepens." But the economist rejected as baseless the WB forecast that the country's GDP growth would fall to 4.8 percent. "The WB cannot know more than we do about the GDP growth," he claimed. The association president urged the government to unearth the cause behind such "worthless" and "insignificant" remarks. Agreeing with Kholiquzzaman, BEA general secretary Prof Abul Barkat said international buyers fall into three categories  high-price, medium-price and low-price. "The crisis will boost the number of third category buyers, and Bangladeshi ready-made garments cater best to the demands of this category," he said. Vinaya Swaroop, the Bank's chief economist in Dhaka, told a workshop last Wednesday that the negative impact of the global financial crisis will affect Bangladesh's economy. He said export earnings and remittances are likely to shrink which, in turn, will mean a decline in GDP growth from 5.4 percent to 4.8 percent. The GDP growth rate has been targeted at 6.5 percent for the current fiscal year. In 2007-08 it was 6.2 percent. bdnews
