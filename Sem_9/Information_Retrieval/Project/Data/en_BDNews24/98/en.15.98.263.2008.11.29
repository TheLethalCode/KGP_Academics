<TITLE> Chances of fair polls higher than 2 years ago: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com) The visiting UN polls assessment team said Saturday there was "no reason to doubt" the Dec 29 polls would be held in a free, fair and credible manner. "I think that the chances of a credible election today are much higher than they were two years ago," said Francesc Vendrell, chief of the three-member UN panel that arrived on Nov 23. "I think that there is no reason to doubt with the cooperation from the political parties, caretaker government, electoral commission that you will have, Bangladesh will have a good election," he said. He said his team hoped that the winners and losers in the next parliamentary polls would accept the results and there would be amicable relations between the ruling party and the opposition. The UN panel will submit a report on Bangladesh's political situation to the UN secretary-general, Vendrell told a press conference at the Dhaka Sheraton before leaving Dhaka. During its visit, the team had meetings with government representatives, the Election Commission, political leaders, diplomats, civil society members and other stakeholders, he said. Vendrell reported that the caretaker government had assured that the emergency would go sometime before Dec 29, but not before Dec 11, the last date for withdrawal of candidacy. The UN official also expressed surprise that some prominent citizens were in favour of holding the general election under the state of emergency. "It is true that not only General Ershad but other prominent people in Bangladesh think the state of emergency should remain until Election Day. It is an unusual experience for us," said Vendrell. "We would, of course, say the most important thing for the election is that political freedoms are in place: that there is freedom of speech, there is freedom of assembly, freedom from violence and intimidation. "It seems to an outsider it would make sense to lift the state of emergency," he added. Vendrell opposed diplomats' role in the domestic politics of the country. "I don't think the diplomats should be the main players in domestic politics." "I think their tasks are very clear. They are here to represent their governments. They are here of course to ensure the assistance they give is properly utilised," he said. "I think it is up to the people of Bangladesh to tell the foreigners to get off if we appear to be infringing into the internal affairs of Bangladesh," said the UN representative. bdn
