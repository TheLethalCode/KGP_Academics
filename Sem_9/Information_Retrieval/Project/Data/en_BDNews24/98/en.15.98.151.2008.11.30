<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)A Supreme Court lawyer Sunday served a legal notice to the Election Commission to wipe the name of former prime minister Khaleda Zia for providing false and misleading information about her date of birth and educational qualifications. Advocate Md Motaher Hossain Saju sent the legal notice by registered post on behalf of the Supreme Court lawyer Fazilatun Nasa Bappy. Advocate Saju told bdnews24.com that the notice was served as Khaleda had furnished "certain false and concocted particulars in the voter form". "We demanded that the EC deletes the name of Khaleda Zia from the voter list within 24 hours, failing which we will take appropriate legal steps and seek direction from the court to delete her name." The notice stated that it was evident from reports published in various newspapers, on Aug. 9 1997, that Khaleda Zia took the matriculation examination in 1961 recording her date of birth as Sept. 5 1947, but did not pass the exam. The notice further said the BNP chairperson enlisted as a voter on Nov. 29 2008, recording her birth date as Aug. 15 1947, which contradicts the date of birth recorded in her matriculation examination form. "Begum Khaleda Zia has mentioned her date of birth as 15.08.1947 for some years in order to frustrate the death anniversary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with a malafide intention and sinister motive," the notice said. The notice added that the former prime minister also applied for a passport on April 1 1978, stating her date of birth as Sept 1946 without mentioning a specific date, while in her marriage certificate, as wife of Major Ziaur Rahman, her date of birth was shown as Aug 9 1947. Copies of the notice were handed to the Election Commission Secretariat, the chief election commissioner and Dhaka district election officer.
