<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Two late strikes from Shahajuddin Tipu and Jahid Hasan Emily helped holders Abahani Limited regain their lead in the Citycell B. League with a hard fought 2-0 win over Muktijoddha Sangsad on Friday. After a barren first half, Tipu put the sky blues outfit ahead in the 79th minute while Emily sealed the match six minutes from time at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. With six wins in eight matches, Abahani raised their points tally to 19, two points cushion of Sheikh Russel KC, who have 17 points from eight outings. Rahmatganj MFS and Chittagong Mohammedan shared the third position with 13 points each, playing eight matches while title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan played a match less to have 12 points. Back to the match, Abahani, who came into the match with the back of 2-2 draw against Mohammedan Sporting Club, could hardly impress a few hundred spectators against struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad, who had only one win in the previous seven outings. Tipu, who substituted Jahed Parvez Chowdhury in the 75th minute, headed an Emily cross past Muktijoddha goalkeeper Nizam Majumder to give Abahani the lead. Muktijoddha defender Shahnur Ronny brought Emily down in the danger zone and referee Abul Kalam Azad awarded Abahani a penalty shot. Emily converted the spot kick in the 84th minute. bd
