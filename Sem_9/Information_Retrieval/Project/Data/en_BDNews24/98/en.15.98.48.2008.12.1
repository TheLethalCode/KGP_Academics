 PARIS, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Bruno Cheyrou goal led Stade Rennes to a 1-0 win over Paris St Germain and Ligue 1 second place for the first time this season on Sunday. Cheyrou struck just before halftime, sidestepping PSG striker Guillaume Hoareau and firing a 25-metre shot which bounced just in front of goalkeeper Mickel Landreau. In a tight game between two teams ranked four and fifth and level on points before the weekend, Rennes had most of the possession in the first half. PSG pushed hard after the break but their efforts were denied by the Rennes defence second only to Olympique Lyon's with 11 goals conceded including four in the first game of the season drawn 4-4 against Marseille. "It's a very good result but we should have killed the game in the second half. In a way, it's good to know that we still have to improve," Cheyrou told television channel Canal Plus. On 29 points from 16 games, Rennes are five points adrift of leaders and seven-times champions Lyon who were held to a goalless draw in driving rain by lowly Valenciennes at Stade Gerland on Saturday. Olympique Marseille, also held 0-0 at unsung Toulouse on Sunday, and Nice, whose match against Grenoble was postponed two days running after rain storms hit the Cote d'Azur, are third on 28, two points ahead of PSG and Girondins Bordeaux. Bordeaux match at struggling Sochaux also ended in a goalles draw on Saturday. In the only other game scheduled on Sunday St Etienne, who were on a run of seven Ligue 1 defeats, won 2-1 at Nancy. Midfielder Paulo Machado and striker David Gigliotti were the St Etienne scorers. Striker Batefimi Gomis missed a penalty after Nancy goalkeeper Gennaro Bracigliano was handed a straight red car in the 55th minute for bringing down Gigliotti in the area. Nancy scored a face-saving goal through Issiar Dia 15th minutes from time. St Etienne move out of the relegation zone on 13 points, one ahead of 18th-place Le Havre. Nancy stay 15th on 1
