 LONDON, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunderland manager Roy Keane responded to a third straight Premier League home defeat on Saturday by asking if he was the right man for the job. "I'm the manager of the club, I'm responsibleI've never shied away from it. I will take full responsibility for the run we are on and everything else," Keane said after his side slipped into the drop zone with a 4-1 loss to Bolton Wanderers. "I ask myself every day: 'Am I the right man for Sunderland?' At the moment I think I am but it might be different tomorrow or Monday," he was quoted as saying on Sunderland's official website (www.safc.com). Djibril Cisse gave Sunderland an early lead at the Stadium of Light but mid-table Bolton hit back in style with goals from Matthew Taylor, Gary Cahill and a brace from Sweden striker Johan Elmander, the club's record signing. "I really can't legislate for individual mistakes, stuff like that does not make me as angry," said Keane. "But the goals we conceded make it impossible to win any game of football, never mind in the Premier League. We made it so hard for ourselves after a decent start." RELEGATION BATTLE Keane had hoped to celebrate his 100th game in charge of Sunderland with a win on Saturday but instead found himself facing the prospect of a relegation battle. "It's a test for everyone at the club. Football is the best game in the world when you are winning; when you are losing  and we have lost four in a row at homeit's about characters," he added. On top of three straight home league defeats Sunderland also lost to Blackburn Rovers at home in the League Cup fourth round. "It's a disappointing day we make it hard for ourselves and we seem to get punished for every mistake, that's why the league is so brilliant, it's a harsh world the Premier League. "We'll find out if we have the right characters in the squad. We can't bring anyone in until Januaryand I've said before we haven't got many options in terms of bringing players in. I've brought enough players in. "As a manager, I have no excuses," he adde
