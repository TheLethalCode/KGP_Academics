 Chittagong, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Berth operation system at Chittagong port needs to go a few notches up, port users say but acknowledge that there have been improvements with the port handling after the emergency government took office. Private operators to run yards and berths have not yet been appointed and the port users and businesspeople blame the port authority for the delay. In 2007, Chittagong Port Authority (CPA), as part of reforms, took the initiatives for the private operation of Chittagong Container Terminal (CCT), Dhaka Inland Container Depot, New Mooring Container Terminal (NCT) but no organisation was entrusted with these duties even after 20 years have elapsed, they said. "At present, these are being operated on contracts," a port official, who would not want to be named, said. Officials said that most of the time was spent making operational guidelines, issuance of gazettes and fixing of tender details. If the yards and berths had been operated through competition, the cargo clearing and forwarding would have been less expensive, said the port users who demanded immediate appointment of experienced and skilled operators on open competition. "There has been delay because the berth operating system is new and it takes time to finalise the process," CPA chairman commodore RU Ahmed said. "As for CCT, the appointment of operator has been delayed due to legal complications." Dismissing the allegation of deliberate waste of time, the CPA chairman said, "Tenders have been called again this month and the port authority will complete the work as soon as possible. Preference will be given to appointment through competition." Senior vice president of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry MA Latif is not impressed. "This is illogical," he said about the delay in the appointment of yard and berth operators. "As the appointment for the current operator has been done without competition, the port has to pay Tk 2 crore in extra to Saif Power Tech every month," he complained. As the response from the first tender was lukewarm, Dhaka ICD called re-tenders on Nov 23, seven months after the first call. Time was lost to a legal hassle between the current operator Saif Power Tech and the port authority. On May 26, some 11 organisations dropped bids for operating the yard. Saif Power Tech is demanding Tk 1200 per container, as there is no competitor. However, in the cancelled tender, the lowest bidder submitted Tk 453 whereas Saif Power Tech, the third lowest, quoted Tk 505. On the other hand, 21 months after the introduction of the berth operator system, separate tenders were called for general cargo and container handling. But, on Dec 2 last year, a circular was issued for appointment of a berth operator and for a work plan. As part of the reforms, the caretaker government annulled the 50-year-old stevedoring and introduced the berth operator system. Fifty berth operators are now sharing work in 13 units of the port jetties and 10 units of the outer anchorage, port officials said. It will take at least a couple of months to finish the process of the tenders and entrust qualified organisations with the work. "A business-friendly environment does not exist in the port anymore and as operators have not been appointed through competition, we have to pay exorbitant charges," complained BGMEA director Mahbub Chowdhury. He also said Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association would soon have a meeting with the chief adviser on these issues. "Those who are working in the port on contract are charging high holding the port users hostages," observed port affairs secretary of the C&F Association Liaqat Ali Hawladar. "The authorities should urgently appoint the operators," he said. bdnew
