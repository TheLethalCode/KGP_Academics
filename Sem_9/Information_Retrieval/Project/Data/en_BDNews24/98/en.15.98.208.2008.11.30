 Adelaide, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/BBC)- Australia looked to be heading for a series win over New Zealand after notching up 535 in their first innings on day three of the second Test. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (169) scored a maiden Test century and Michael Clarke hit 110 as Australia took a 265-run first-innings lead in Adelaide. Pace bowler Iain O'Brien recorded 3-111 and spinners Daniel Vettori and Aaron Redmond took two wickets each. At the close, New Zealand had reached 35 without loss, a deficit of 230. Clarke and Haddin came together when Michael Hussey (70) and Andrew Symonds (0) were dismissed in quick succession by Chris Martin in the morning. Clarke, who was bowled for 98 in the First Test at the Gabba, gave his fans a scare as he closed in on triple figures. He pushed the ball out onto the leg side, hesitated mid-pitch before completing the single that notched up his ninth Test century. Haddin had some luck with Daniel Flynn dropping the simplest of catches at mid-on when he was on 72 while an appeal for a bat-pad catch was turned down despite it appearing to catch an edge and glove on the way through. After being stuck on 97 and taking two overs to complete his ton, Haddin let rip with the bat and brought up 150 with a slog sweep before being caught on the mid-wicket fence by Peter Fulton. New Zealand batted positively in the nine-over stint before the end of play with Redmond (15) and Jamie How (13) unbeaten at the crease. Australia lead the two-Test series 1-
