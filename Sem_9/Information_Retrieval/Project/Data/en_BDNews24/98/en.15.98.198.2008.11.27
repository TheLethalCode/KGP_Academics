 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Registered female voters outnumber male ones for the first time, ahead of the 9th Jatiya Sangsad election, the Election Commission said on Wednesday, indicating the fate of candidates may be in the hands of more women than ever before. EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar told bdnews24.com on Wednesday women voters have never outnumbered men in voter rolls to date. They outnumber men by nearly 14 lakh this time round, with registered voters totalling 8.106 crore, split into 3.9822 crore males and 4.1236 crore female. The figure shows 50 lakh more women voters listed than the last time while registered male voters have edged up 13 lakh compared to the last parliamentary polls. Sarwar said that there would be 35,216 polling centres with nearly 1.77 lakh booths with some 5.67 officials overseeing the voting. EC public relations officer SM Asaduzzaman said nearly 3.53 crore voters were listed for the country's first ever JS elections in 1973, but there is no record of the numbers of male and female voters registered at that time. All successive parliamentary elections saw registered male voters exceeding female, according to subsequent EC statistics. By the eighth parliamentary polls, held in 2001, the total number of registered voters stood at approximately 7.50 crore with women numbering 3.63 crore. bdnews
