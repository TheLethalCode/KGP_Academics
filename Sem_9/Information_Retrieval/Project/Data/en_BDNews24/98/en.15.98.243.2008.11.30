<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will increase security in the country and on its borders to a "war level" in the wake of the deadly attacks in Mumbai that killed nearly 200 people, a government minister said on Sunday. "Our intelligence will be increased to a war level, we are asking the state governments to increase security to a war level," Sriprakash Jaiswal, India's minister of state for home affairs, told Reuters in an interview. India said on Sunday it had proof of a Pakistani link to the Mumbai attacks, while officials in Islamabad said it would move troops to the Indian border if tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals spilled over. "They can say what they want, but we have no doubt that the terrorists had come from Pakistan," Jaiswal said. India has already boosted coastal security with the Indian Navy and the coast guard carrying out coordination patrols. The Mumbai attackers are said to have come to the city by sea from the Pakistani port of Karachi, according to security officials. They have said they were from the Lashkar-e-Taiba a Pakistan-based group that has been blamed for previous attacks in India. "We have evidence of their nationalities. We will reveal everything soon," Jaiswal added.
