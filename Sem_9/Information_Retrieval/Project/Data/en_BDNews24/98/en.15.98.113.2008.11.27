 KARACHI, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan cricket authorities are willing to send their top Twenty20 team to India to participate in the Champions League, despite a wave of terror attacks in Mumbai that have left more than 100 dead. The tournament features eight sides from five countries and is scheduled to start in Mumbai on Dec 3 with at least six of the teams booked to stay at the luxurious Hotel Taj, a focal point of the gun and grenade attacks that started on Tuesday night. Pakistan will be represented in the tournament by the Sialkot Stallions, led by national captain Shoaib Malik. "We have asked the Indian board to keep us up to date with the situation and the status of the Champions League, but we have told them we are willing to send the Sialkot team," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters. "What has happened is a great tragedy but we strongly believe you can't stop sporting activities because of these terrorist strikes," he added. India's scheduled tour of Pakistan in early 2009 is currently awaiting approval from the Indian government before the tourists can confirm their participation in a series put in doubt by security concerns. English champions Middlesex, two Australian sides and two from South Africa have delayed decisions over their participation in the Champions League
