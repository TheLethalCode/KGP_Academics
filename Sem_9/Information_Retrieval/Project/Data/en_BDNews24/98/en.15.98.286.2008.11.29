<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com) - The price of gas may be hiked as much as 10 to 15 percent, say BERC officials. "The new price will be finalised in a meeting on Sunday. We will also decide on when it will come into effect," Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Golam Rahman said Saturday. Commission sources said the gas price may be hiked by 10-15 percent. The commission arranged a public hearing following a proposal by Petrobangla to the energy regulatory commission for a massive 65 percent hike in gas price. Currently, Tk 350 is charged to domestic consumers for a single-burner gas supply and Tk 400 for double burners, while Tk 133 is charged per unit gas to meterised consumers. For power plants, Tk 76.91 is charged per unit gas, Tk 63.48 is charged to fertiliser factories, Tk 148.13 for industries, Tk 105.59 for captive power and Tk 233.12 for commercial use. The commission is also planning to hike the price of electricity on proposals in September by Dhaka Power Distribution Company, Dhaka Electric Supply Company and Westzone Power Distribution Company. DPDC managing director Ataul Masud told bdnews24.com, "When we took over DESA (Dhaka Electric Supply Authority), total system loss was 25 percent and the government hiked electricity price by 16 percent for bulk consumers." "In this situation, therefore, our loss is being magnified. There is no scope but increasing the retail price. We proposed a 14.7 percent increase." Golam Rahman, however, said around three months would be required for a final decision on electricity prices. bdnews2
