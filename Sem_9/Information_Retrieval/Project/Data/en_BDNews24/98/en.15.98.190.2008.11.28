 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The HM Ershad-led Jatiya Party hopes to settle the sharing of seats with Awami League on Saturday for the Dec. 29 general election, acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud says. The allies met from 11 in the morning until 4:45 in the afternoon on Friday, with an afternoon break, at the Dhanmondi office of the AL president. Presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Motia Chowdhury and joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam of the AL met with Mahmud and presidium member Ziauddin Bablu of JP. 'The main topic of discussion was strengthening the grand alliance and, at this moment the seat-sharing is not the main issue," commented Mahmud. The JP has demanded 74 seats to go to the election as part of the Al-led alliance and on Thursday night, Mahmud and Bablu had a met with AL chief Sheikh Hasina. Mahmud said that meeting assessed the results of JP in the last election and added, "Nomination will be given to the ones who have the potential to win." He hoped the JP might be given more seats this time than the 50 seats for the cancelled Jan. 22 election. "We will sit for talks again tomorrow at 11am," added Mahmud. Responding to a question, he said that the JP had submitted 280 nominations. "Once the matter of the seat distribution is finalised, candidates will withdraw their nomination." During the afternoon break in the talks, Sajeda Chowdhury, Sheikh Selim and Motia Chowdhury went to the Sudha Sadan home of the AL president. "Discussion is on-going and, maybe a final decision will be reached [Friday]," Sajeda Chowdhury had told journalists. Other parties have already informed AL of their demands with Liberal Democratic Party and Jatiya Party (JP-Monju) demanding 30 and 12 seats respectively. Other allies in the 'grand alliance', JSD, Worker's Party and Democratic Party have also asked for seats. However, the AL has nominated its candidates for the 300 seats on offer and party leaders say they will withdraw nomination papers for the seats that will be given to the allies. bdnews
