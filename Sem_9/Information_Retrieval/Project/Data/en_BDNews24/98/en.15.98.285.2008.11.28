 MUMBAI, Fri Nov 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's stock market and the rupee fell on Friday and government bond yields inched up as trading resumed after deadly attacks in the financial capital, Mumbai, which shut its markets for a day and killed at least 121 people. The benchmark share index dropped 1.5 percent at the start of trade but then recouped some losses to stand 0.6 percent down from its previous close on Wednesday, at 8,993.17 points. It is however down more than 55 percent this year, already badly pummelled by an outflow of foreign capital as a result of the global financial crisis which has hit markets worldwide. Commodity markets would also be open for business on Friday, B.C. Khatua, chairman of the Forward Markets Commission, told Reuters. The benchmark 10-year bond yield opened higher but then slipped to 7.09 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's close which was its lowest finish since December 2005. "Rate cut expectations still haven't gone away. That's why the market is holding up," said Piyush Wadhwa, a senior vice president at ICICI Securities. "Some people feel that rate cut expectations have increased after all these (attacks)," he said. Indian forces were battling militants in three pockets of the financial capital on Friday, more than 36 hours after the band of heavily armed fighters staged coordinated attacks. Heavy gunfire erupted from one of the locations after Indian commandos were dropped by helicopter on to the roof of a building where suspected Islamist militants were holding at least 10 people. Shares in Indian Hotels Co Ltd fell 12.9 percent to 42.20 rupees and hotel operator EIH Ltd was down 8.5 percent at 85 rupees after their main hotels -- the Taj Mahal hotel and the Oberoi-Trident were hit by the attacks. Some shops were open in the south of the city as businesses began the process of getting back to normal but traffic was reduced in the usually bustling city and normally packed morning trains were also less crowded. The partially convertible rupee fell to 49.85/90 per dollar, 0.7 percent weaker than Wednesday's close of 49.48/50 and heading back towards a record low of 50.60 set earlier this month. Traders said volumes were thin. "The first 10 minutes was sentiment related. The focus now goes back to fundamentals," Harihar Krishnamoorthy, treasury head at Development Credit Bank, said. "I don't see the 50 level breached today.
