<TITLE> Old car dealers defy new SRO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  The association of reconditioned vehicle importers and dealers (BARVIDA) has threatened to stop importing cars under the proposed new SRO, angrily refuting allegations that they have purposely evaded import taxes. BARVIDA secretary general Abdul Hamid Sharif, in a Saturday press briefing in the capital, said: "The previous SRO must be in force and we will not import reconditioned vehicles if the new SRO takes effect." The National Board of Revenue imposed the new statutory regulatory order on June 26, which was supposed to be effective from July 1 though importers are still following the previous SRO. They, however, blame the government for the situation. "Inefficiency and negligence of the customs authorities should be blamed for vehicle imports under the old SRO," Sharif said. However, the High Court stayed the new regulation for three months on Sept 3 on a writ petition filed by the association, he added. BARVIDA leaders said the NBR asked customs authorities to impose a depreciation rate of 30 percent on both four and six year-old reconditioned vehicles, which BRVIDA termed unrealistic. Some 658 vehicles were imported during July 1 to Aug 2, but the association halted clearance at the port for days from Aug 2 until Sept 24, he said. "We asked authorities to allow a 50 percent depreciation rate for imported six-year-old reconditioned cars, but NBR stuck to 30 per cent," Sharif said, adding that this had compelled them to go to the court. The reconditioned car importers said the government should count the age of a reconditioned car from the manufacturing date inscribed on the vehicle's chassis. "But the new SRO imposes that the age should count from the date of first registration and the same depreciation rate should be applied for four to six year-old vehicles." The BARVIDA secretary general said the new method would cost the importers an additional Tk 40,000 to Tk 70,000 in taxes. The press briefing also revealed that a record 20,000 reconditioned vehicles have been imported this year, yielding nearly Tk1000 crore as revenue to the treasury against 12,000 vehicles in 2007. bdnew
