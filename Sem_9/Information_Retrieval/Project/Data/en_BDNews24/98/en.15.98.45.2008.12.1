<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed said on Monday a final understanding on seat-sharing with BNP had not been reached but he hoped it would be resolved before Eid-ul Azha (Dec 9). He said his party was allocated 35 seats so far but "we want more." Dec. 11 is the last day for withdrawal of candidacy ahead of the Dec. 29 general election. Mojaheed was replying to questions from journalists on Jamaat's nominations at the party office in Moghbazar on Monday. Mojaheed, however, did not disclose how many more or which seats his party sought from the alliance, but instead mentioned "the tyrannies the four-party experienced over the last two years." Some party leaders were bargaining over alliance tickets to constituencies in Chapainawabganj, Meherpur, Jhenidah and Meherpur, party sources said. A total of 49 Jamaat hopefuls filed nominations as the deadline for submissions end Sunday. Jamaat was allocated 34 seats from the four-party alliance ahead of the cancelled Jan. 22 2007 elections. bdnew
