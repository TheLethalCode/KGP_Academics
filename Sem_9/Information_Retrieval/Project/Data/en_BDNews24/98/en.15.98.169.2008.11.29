<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Most of the 'reformist' BNP leaders have wooed but failed to win party tickets for the upcoming general elections, leaving the old-guard "at ease", BNP electoral body members said on Saturday. Among the so-called reformists who managed a slot in the list of nominees are such party stalwarts as former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, ex-minister Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed and former parliamentary defence committee chairman Lt Gen (retd) Mahbubur Rahman. Those who were denied nominations include former education minister Osman Faruque, former state ministers Shah Mohammad Abul Hossain, former state minister professor Rezaul Karim and former state minister Mosharef Hossain Shahjahan, former whip Rezaul Bari Deena, and former MPs Abdul Alim, Nazir Hossain, Ataur Rahman Angur, Mosharraf Hossain Mangur, Fazlul Azim, SA Sultan Titu, Dr Ziaul Huq Molla, Masud Arun, Abdul Ghani, GM Mohammad Siraj, Kazi Rafiqul Islam and Sarder Sakhawat Hossain Bakul. Meanwhile, the BNP chairperson's adviser Maj Gen (retd) ZA Khan, BNP assistant office secretary Emran Saleh Prince and party officials AHM Mofazzal Karim, MA Hakim and Dr Mushfiqur Rahman did not seek party nominations. They have also been known as 'reformists'. And, former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, former joint secretary Ashraf Hossain and former office secretary Mofiqul Hasan Tripty -- all 'pro-reform' party veterans sacked last year -- remain black-listed. Former secretary general Mannan Bhuiyan made a 21-point reform proposal on June 25 for wider democratic practices within the party. This caused a split within the party, and chairperson Khaleda Zia on Sep 3 last year, just prior to her arrest, replaced Bhuiyan with Khandaker Delwar Hossain as BNP secretary general. bdnew
