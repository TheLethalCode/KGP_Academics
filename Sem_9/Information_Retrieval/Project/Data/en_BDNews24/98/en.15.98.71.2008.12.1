 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The finance adviser has highlighted the imperatives for the "capital-rich developed countries" to address the global economic crisis and its impact on the poor nations. AB Mirza Azizul Islam, now visiting Qatar capital of Doha, spelled out the must-dos at the plenary session of a three-day talks that opened on Saturday, finance ministry sources said on Monday. In a written address on behalf of the least developed countries (LDCs), he dwelt on the impediments to meeting millennium development goals (MDGs), the developed countries not meeting their "commitment to provide 0.7% of their GNI (gross national income) as ODA (overseas development assistance) to developing countries and 0.15-0.2% to LDCs, duty-free and quota-free market access." He also jotted down suggestions to resolve the longstanding predicament with special focus on "access to energy, including renewable sources of energy, and modern eco-friendly technologies at an affordable cost" for LDCs to achieve the MDGs and other internationally-agreed development goals. Azizul said the governance regime of the Brettonwoods Institutions should be changed. "Special weightage should be accorded particularly to LDCs in setting the new quota formula." Pointing at the poor financial and technical resources of the LDCs, the adviser said, "Development finance for them is critically important and the Doha outcome must focus on the special concerns and priorities of the LDCs." "Both Monterrey and Doha are critically important, a comprehensive and diverse multi-stakeholder is necessary and a concrete decision on the effective follow-up of the Doha conference is vital." The follow-up international conference on financing development was taking place in Doha at a critical juncture, Azizul said. Persistent global imbalances, sustained net capital export from developing countries, high volatility in the exchange rates of major currencies, unregulated expansion of speculative markets and failure of the WTO trade negotiations pose grave risks to achieving sustained economic growth and the MDGs in developing countries, particularly in LDCs. Rapid rate of climate change, devastating financial crisis in mature economies, soaring oil and non-oil commodity prices, particularly unprecedented food price rise are adding to the risks, he said. "LDCs are likely to suffer seriously from potentially dangerous consequences of exports, remittances, FDI and ODA, which constitute the backbone of their economies," he warned. Azizul expressed confidence that "fast deteriorating global economic scenario can only be remedied through inclusive multilateralism." "United Nations General Assembly has the legitimate authority and expertise to lead the process." The finance adviser also noted that the G-20 Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy held in Washington DC on Nov. 15 can complement the inclusive multilateral process. But the G-20 group did not represent the LDCs; the adviser regretted and asked the G-20 countries to "include a voice of the 49 LDCs in the process "to make it more participatory." He called for an international summit, under the UN auspices, to review the international financial and monetary architecture and global economic governance structures. "LDCs with the world's 12 percent population receive less than 2 percent of the total world investment," the finance adviser pointed out. He suggested the international community make more foreign direct investment in the LDCs. "The failure of the completion of Doha Round is a major setback for the multilateral trading system." He added the developed and the developing countries must provide duty and quota-free market access to all products from all LDCs. Prior to flying out for Doha on Saturday, the finance adviser said to bdnews24.com: "The meeting is vitally important for South Asia and the Middle East, especially for Bangladesh as it will discuss ways to avert the impacts of the global financial quandary." Finance ministers from South Asia including Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, and the Middle East attended the meeting. Representatives from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund and developed nations also joined the meeting. The finance adviser is expected return home on Monday, officials said
