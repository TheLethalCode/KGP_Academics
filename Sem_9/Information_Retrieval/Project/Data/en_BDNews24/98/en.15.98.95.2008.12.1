<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court directed the government on Monday to notify it within 72 hours as to the whereabouts of expelled Jubo League leader Liakat Hossain, who was taken from his family home by law enforcers on Nov 26, according to relatives. His wife has said "some six or seven armed men identifying themselves as RAB members" whisked Liakat away from his father-in-law's residence in Dhanmondi and the family has had no news of him since despite appealing to authorities. RAB have denied their involvement in the incident. The HC on Monday issued a show cause notice to the government to explain why Liakat was not produced in court within 24 hours of 'arrest' according to the law, and why his detention should not be declared illegal. The bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Mohammad Rezaul Haque passed the order on a writ petition by Liakat's wife Farhana Hossain. The home adviser, director general of the Rapid Action Battalion, inspector general of police, deputy commissioner of Dhaka and chief metropolitan magistrate have been asked to reply to the notice. Liakat's lawyer Abdul Baset Majumder told the court that his client was leading a "peaceful life" after his release from jail in September and that he had been illegally arrested and detained. The Jubo League leader, one of 23 'top criminals' listed by the previous BNP government, was arrested on Oct 1 2003 and released on a High Court bail order on Sept 4 this year. bdnew
