<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com)--Brazil will open a resident mission in Bangladesh "soon" as bilateral trade increases, says an adviser. "This offer has been made in a note received from the government of Brazil by the ministry of foreign affairs," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Monday at foreign ministry. "The volume of Bangladesh-Brazil bilateral trade now stands at US $26 million from last year's US $11 million," said Iftekhar. He said the next government could think of opening a mission in Brazil, the largest country in the South America. "This decision would certainly expand bilateral cooperation. We should also be thinking of reciprocating," the adviser said. Currently, Bangladesh has no mission in the whole South American countries.
