 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission wants to finish its tasks by Dec 16 since a one-month stay on a High Court ruling, declaring the commission illegal, ends by that date. "We want to finish by Dec 16, even though the commission's tenure closes in January next year," TAC chairman Habibur Rahman Khan said on Wednesday. The High Court on Nov 13, adjudged the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance that begot the Truth Commission as against the constitution and law ordered the commission to halt its acticities. The Supreme Court stayed the HC order for a month on Nov 16 on an appeal. "If the court extends the stay period, we can work for longer," Habibur said. "But if the High Court order is upheld the commission will return our salaries and benefits received during the whole period of our work," the former justice added. "Some 170 people so far have received clemency," the Truth Commission chairman, mentioning some 327 hearings had been completed out of 481 cases filed with the TAC. A total of nearly Tk 31.50 crore has been sought from those pardoned, of which Tk 16.10 crore has so far been deposited with the state treasury. "The commission accomplished this formidable task in 54 working days since it debuted on Aug 3," the TAC chairman said. bdnews24
