 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina says while she was in jail, authorities offered to punish any rivals within her party she would name who had slighted her in the past. "I was asked to name anyone who might have insulted me. The authorities assured me that they would punish the offenders," Hasina told a faction of Islami Oikyo Jote leaders on Tuesday when they met her at AL's political office in Dhanmondi. Commenting on her life under detention, she said, "The authorities asked us to name anyone who had let us down in the past at any stage of our political careers. I said Allah will take care of all injustices." "When they asked me again and again, I told them they knew the offenders very well because they had then added fuel to the fire." "Upon their insistence on eliciting names of offenders, my neighbour gave names and they were nabbed right away," she said in an indirect reference to her arch political rival BNP chief Khaleda Zia who had been detained in another special jail in the same parliament complex. "Succeeding with my neighbour, the authorities came up to me again and pressed for names. I only said I trusted Allah to take care of everything." "I bore everything patiently, never losing hope. The thought of the people of my country kept me going." "You look at me now, I'm very much alive without going for any compromise. I am talking to you all freely by the grace of Allah." Addressing the IOJ delegates, Hasina said, "If voted to power, we'll initiate raising a taskforce with participation of all our neighbouring nations in a bid to establish peace in South Asia." "The Muslim world must take steps to curb terrorism in the name of Islam," she said. "Awami League will go for controlling the spiralling commodity prices first, then will follow promotion of education and employment through modernisation of traditional religion-based madrasa education." "Unemployment has to be addressed as an emergency, as unemployed youths tend to engage in all kinds of anti-social and unwarranted activities." "Bangladesh must regain its identity as a secular democratic state," the former prime minister said. On the recent destruction of the Balaka sculpture by islamist militants, Hasina said, "I don't understand why those misled people desecrated a beautiful sculpture." IOJ vice chairman Nurul Islam Khan said, "We hope the AL will evaluate the IOJ from the right and just perspectives." The IOJ leaders present included chairman Misbahur Rahman Chowdhury and secretary general Muniruzzaman Rabbani and the AL participants at the views-exchange meeting included Motia Chowdhury and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. bdnews
