 CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The shuttle Endeavour astronauts packed equipment and tested landing systems on Saturday before a scheduled Sunday homecoming at Florida's Kennedy Space Center. During their 16-day mission, the shuttle astronauts prepared the International Space Station for an expanded, six-member crew by delivering a water recycling system, a second toilet, two small bedrooms, a galley and additional exercise gear. The astronauts also conducted four spacewalks to fix a long-standing problem that was hampering the station's solar-powered electrical system. "We came up here with a very long list of objectives and (although) we encountered a glitch or two along the way, we managed to achieve them all," Endeavour commander Chris Ferguson said during an in-flight interview on Saturday. "My mind is on the landing," he said, "but I'm extremely satisfied with what this fine crew has accomplished." Endeavour is set to touch down at NASA's Florida base at 1:19 p.m. EST (1819 GMT) to wrap up the agency's fourth and final mission of the year. But weather forecasts show possible crosswinds and thunderstorms near the landing site on Sunday. The shuttle could stay in orbit until the weather clears or land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead, said Bryan Lunney, a NASA flight director. 'YESTERDAY'S COFFEE' Nine shuttle flights remain, including a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope, before the ships are retired in 2010. Among the items returning to Earth for analysis are bags of what Endeavour crewmember Don Pettit delicately termed "yesterday's coffee." He worked with station commander Mike Fincke and returning station flight engineer Greg Chamitoff to install a water purification system that recycles urine and humidity condensate from the air into drinking water. NASA wants to have the system running for three months before adding three more residents to the orbital research base. The shuttle remained docked at the space station for an extra day to bring home water that had been processed through the machine. Ferguson, pilot Eric Boe and flight engineer Stephen Bowen checked Endeavour's steering jets and movable body flaps that will be needed during Sunday's descent and landing. After scanning the shuttle's wings and nose for possible damage from orbiting debris, NASA officials ruled it fit to withstand the extreme heat of re-entry. "It's as clean or cleaner than any vehicle we have ever flown," said LeRoy Cane, chairman of the mission management team. Astronauts also released a small satellite for the Air Force intended to test a new type of solar cell
