 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League is still hopeful about sealing a seat-sharing deal and keeping Jatiya Party in the electoral alliance after the JP did not show up for a scheduled meeting on Sunday. The JP leaders did not arrive at the AL president's Dhanmondi office until midday on Sunday, as scheduled, the third consecutive day for negotiations to strike an accord. JP acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud Saturday told reporters that they would hold talks at around 10:30am on Sunday. "We hope to settle the sharing of seats with Awami League on Sunday," he said. But no JP leader showed up for the meeting. AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that JP would continue to be a part of the 'grand alliance'. Asked about the Sunday's meeting that had not taken place, the AL joint general secretary said: "The meeting has not taken place but we are maintaining contact with them." AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said: "Jatiya Party was with the grand alliance and still remains." Another presidium member Tofail Ahmed said he had contacted the JP chairman and that he had been busy with election work. "He confirmed to me that he would come to the meeting," Tofail said. Sunday is the deadline for submission of nomination papers for the Dec. 29 general election. Both the AL and JP asked the party candidates to submit nomination papers. If the parties reach a seal, other candidates will withdraw their candidacy in favour of the candidates selected by the alliance, sources said. JP chairman HM Ershad's press secretary Sunil Shubho Roy told bdnews24.com on Saturday that they had not been given as many seats as they had sought and there had not been any announcement of making Ershad president if the alliance went to power, either. "Awami League seems indifferent over the issue," he said, adding "It is not certain whether we are joining the grand alliance." Sunil said the JP's policymaking presidium was set to hold a meeting at around 3:30pm on Sunday to decide on the matter. JP sought 60 seats from AL and after Saturday's meeting Anisul Islam said his party would get at least 40 seats from the alliance. JP remained with the AL-led grand alliance in the forestalled Jan. 22 elections and the AL formed government in 1996 with JP. The AL also made JP leader Anwar Hossain Manju as a minister that time. Later the JP chairman, Ershad, withdrew support, but Manju remained with the government by forming a new faction. bdnew
