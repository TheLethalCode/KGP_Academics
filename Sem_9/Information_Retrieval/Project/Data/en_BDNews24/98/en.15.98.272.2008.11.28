 LONDON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England players will be allowed to make their own decision on whether to return to India for a two-test series next month after the militant attacks in Mumbai, captain Kevin Pietersen said on Friday. England cut short their one-day series to fly home on Friday but are scheduled to return in December. The first test is scheduled to start on Dec. 11 in Ahmedabad and the second was planned for Mumbai from Dec. 19 but will now be switched to a new venue. "We will make every effort to come back and play in the tests but at the end of the day if it's not safe we won't be coming back," Pietersen told BBC radio. "I'll never force anybody to do anything. A man is a man and he can make his own decisions for himself. "It's the right decision right now to get the boys out of here, to get them to their families, even if it's only going to be for a couple of days. "It has been really, really hard. It's something that we weren't expecting and when unexpected things happen you deal with them in certain ways." Pietersen said postponing the series until after Christmas were not practical and that plans were in place to set up a new practice match in place of the scheduled three-day game in Baroda from Dec. 5. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he and the rest of the performance squad would have been in Mumbai, and possibly in one of the hotels targeted by gunmen, if they had not been moved to Bangalore. "It was only at the last minute it was switched, I don't know why," Vaughan wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. "We could have been there in one of those hotels when they were attacked. "All our test kit is in the Taj Mahal hotel where one of the sieges has been going on. It was deposited there after England's two practice games there. That's how close the danger is. "I can imagine the (one-day) England squad must have been going through some really tough meetings. Some players will have wanted to go home permanently, some will have wanted to stay. "I just hope the decision to return for the tests is taken out of their hands and that it is not a financial decision but is made with their well being, and the supporters and media, first and foremost.
