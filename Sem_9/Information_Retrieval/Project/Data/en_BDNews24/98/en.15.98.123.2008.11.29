<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam has expressed shock at the nominations of rival party BNP, terming the inclusion of one leader indicted in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case as "provocative". "The nation is stunned and disappointed to see the list of nominees," Ashraf said Saturday, referring especially to former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, nominated for Tangail-2. Pintu has been among those indicted for the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. The attack injured Sheikh Hasina and killed senior aides such as Ivy Rahman. "We expected political parties would behave responsibly after 1/11, whereas BNP has nominated a leader indicted in the Aug 21 grenade attack case and corrupt leaders. "What is it that BNP wants? Do they want to push the country to a civil war? "The nomination of those people is provocative," he said. The AL general secretary demanded that BNP withdraw the names of those "charged with murder" from its final list on Sunday, the last date of submission of nominations for the 9th Jaitya Sangsad elections. bdnews
