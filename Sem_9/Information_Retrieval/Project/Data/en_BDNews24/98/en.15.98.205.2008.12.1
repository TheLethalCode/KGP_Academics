<TITLE> We can't lose sight of challenges: Alexander </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  UK development minister for South Asia, Douglas Alexander, who visited Bangladesh last December, in a message on World AIDS Day says "we cannot lose sight of the challenge that remains". In the write-up, he reviews the success of measures taken worldwide, and in Bangladesh, to check the spread of this devastating disease -- and what still needs to be done in the global fight against AIDS. Alexander writes: "The twentieth World AIDS Day gives us a chance to reflect on the progress made and the challenge that remains in the global fight against HIV and AIDS. "In the last twenty years, global funding to tackle the disease has risen from $59 million to $10 billion. One in every ten dollars spent on development assistance is today being spent to tackle AIDS. "That investment has produced results. Three million people in developing countries now receive antiretroviral drugs  a ten-fold increase in the last six years. UNAIDS estimates that the number of new infections may be starting to level off. "Here in Bangladesh action has been taken to keep the overall rate of HIV infection under 1%. This is a significant achievement. "But recently, HIV prevalence rates amongst Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) have risen to between 1-10% in some urban localities. This means that there is a real risk that, without appropriate action, HIV could spread rapidly though the population to become a generalised heterosexual epidemic. "Continued support for the Government of Bangladesh led health programme by the UK and other donor partners, to implement effective HIV prevention work with high risk groups, will help to mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDs in Bangladesh. "But we cannot lose sight of the challenge that remains. There are still 33 million people living with HIV around the world, and fewer than a third of those who need antiretroviral treatment receive it. Nearly 7,000 people are infected with HIV every day. "On World AIDS Day, we must all ask how we can best contribute to the global effort to reach universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. "The United Kingdom is determined to be at the forefront of the global fight against AIDS. Last year, I pledged that the United Kingdom would provide 1 billion to the Global Fund. But to achieve universal access to the services that people need, and not just halt but reverse the spread of AIDS, we also need to improve health care. Because in the real world, we cannot prevent or treat AIDS without better equipped health facilities and well trained doctors, nurses and other health workers. "That is why UNAIDS says that a quarter of the world's resources to reach universal access should go towards strengthening health care. And that is why, when I launched the United Kingdom's strategy to tackle HIV and AIDS earlier this year, I pledged 6 billion to strengthen health systems and improve services. "This investment will help to prevent the spread of HIV. This will not only benefit the lives of those who are vulnerable to HIV, but can also be more cost effective than a long course of treatment  for every dollar spent on prevention in Thailand, 43 dollars were saved a decade later by avoiding the need for expensive treatments. "Our investment will help to get antiretrovirals for those who need them. The United Kingdom is committed to helping an extra eight million people to access the medicines they need. "By expanding our investment in health services we will help to meet the urgent shortfall of some 800,000 health workers in the 36 worst-hit African countries. "The spread of HIV shows how connected we are at the beginning of the twenty-first Century. Since it was first identified in 1981, AIDS has devastated lives and communities on all continents. "Yet if the disease itself shows just how close we are in this interconnected world, then I believe our response to the disease can show the same. On World AIDS Day, the world stands together united by a common cause  because universal access to prevention, treatment and care will only be reached through common endeavour."
