 Centurion, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A familiar batting slump saw Bangladesh suffer another innings defeat on Friday to hosts South Africa who swept the two-match series in the second and final Test with two days to go. Trailing by 179 runs in the first innings, Bangladesh were wrapped up for 131 in the second innings, to go down by an innings and 48-runs, as the batsmen hurried to throw their wickets away with almost one session left on the third day at SuperSport Park. It was a contrasting show from the Tigers, who had dared to bat first against the South Africa's all-seam attack on greenish pitch and made 250 in 76.2 overs in the first innings. But the visitors lasted only 36.4 overs in the second innings before being skittled out for a paltry total. Apart from the failure of the visitors' batsmen, some brilliant fielding from the hosts prompted Bangladesh's batting collapse as three batsmen were run out stupidly while taking unnecessary runs. Opener Imrul Kayes (5) went to chase a short and outside ball off Makhaya Ntini and was caught at first slip by Graeme Smith in the very fourth over of the innings while one-down Junaed Siddique had got a hit on his gloves off a Jacque Kallis bouncer before being caught at point by Hashim Amla for 16. Tamim Iqbal cut a short and wide ball off Morne Morkel to the backward point, but Neil McKenzie drove his right to take an excellent catch to see off Tamim for 20. With Bangladesh wobbling at 47 for three, Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful and Mehrab Hossain Junior got out in the space of 12 balls while taking completely unnecessary double. Amla from the bowler's end broke Mehrab's stumps from a direct hit for a four-ball duck while Ashraful found short of the ground by a Dale Steyn direct throw from the long-leg that left Bangladesh tottering at 68 for five in 19.2 overs. Shakib (two) slashed a short and wide delivery off Morkel with Ntini taking a diving catch at the deep backward point before Mushfiqur Rahim was the second victim of Ntini, who bowled Bangladesh's wicketkeeper for 4. Roqibul Hasan became Bangladesh's third batsman to find short of the ground as Ashwell Prince broke Bangladesh's top-scorer stumps. Roqibul made 28 off 62 balls. Monde Zondeki cleaned up the tail removing Shahadat Hossain and Mahbubul Alam before Mashrafee Bin Mortaz played a 21-ball 23 to take Bangladesh beyond the 100-mark. Earlier, Shakib and pacer Shahadat Hossain shared five wickets as the hosts could manage only 72 runs to finish at 429 in the first innings after Bangladesh made 250 all out in the first innings. Ashwell Prince struck his career-best 162 not out as the overnight batsman hit 23 fours and two sixes in 223 balls. Shakib removed Mark Boucher, Morne Morkel and Monde Zondeki in four deliveries to peg South Africa back for the second time in the innings and returned six for 99, his third five-wicket haul. After Shakib's success, Shahadat picked up the wickets of Ntini and Dale Steyn to remove the tail to return two for 89. Shakib first had overnight batsman Mark Boucher caught at short-cover by Roqibul Hasan for 117 and in the very next delivery bowled Morne Morkel for a first-ball duck to stand on a hat-trick. He had almost snared rare hat-trick with Monde Zondeki pushing at the ball and nearly got an edge before the ball went to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim. Shakib, however, had Zondeki caught by Mushfiqur in the next ball. In the next over, Shahadat had Ntini caught superbly by Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful for a two-ball duck and three overs later bowled Steyn for one.
