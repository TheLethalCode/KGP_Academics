"The total number of nominations submitted against the 300 parliamentary constituencies will be made public on Sunday evening," senior assistant secretary of EC Secretariat Farhad Ahmad Khan told bdnews24.com. Khan also said in the forestalled Jan. 22, 2007 polls, about 2,000 candidatesboth independent and nominees of 76 political partieshad submitted nominations. A presidential order issued on Jan. 11 first stayed and eventually cancelled the 2007 polls process. In the eighth parliamentary polls held in 2001, 2,563 candidates had submitted nomination papers, 486 as independent and nominees from 55 political parties.

Deputy secretary at EC Secretariat Jasmine Tully in a letter to the returning officers and assistant returning officers on Nov. 27 reiterated that any registered political party may primarily nominate more than one candidate for a seat. These provisional selections have to be honed down to one candidate against one constituency, officially endorsed by the party chairperson or general secretary or a party office bearer of equivalent rank and status for submission with the returning officer, Tully's letter said. As per polls schedule, nomination papers deposition began on Nov. 2 which ends Sunday, scrutiny of the submitted nominations will be completed on December 3-4 and candidates will be able to withdraw their nominations until Dec. 11. bdnews24
