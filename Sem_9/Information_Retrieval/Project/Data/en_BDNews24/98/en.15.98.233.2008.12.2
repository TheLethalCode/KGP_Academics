 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  A 'people's tribunal' on Monday slapped a ban on the operations of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank in Bangladesh. The "WB-IMF-ADB people's tribunal" adjudged the operations of the three international financial institutions "illegal" and "evil" and liable to be stopped immediately. The self-styled tribunal instructed the government to punish those found guilty of conniving with the WB and its associates (IMF and ADB) in implementing their "wrongdoings". After a long unilateral hearing at the National Press Club, 'tribunal judge' Golam Rabbani gave its 'verdict' against the three financial bodies on charges of carrying out "anti-people programmes". The judgement said the national preparation committee for the 'WB-IMF-ADB people's tribunal' was set up on Nov 3, 2007 to collect letters of complaints from aggrieved people across the country. The committee members also made investigations and researches to gather information based on which seven 'charge-sheets' were framed. After scanning the charges the tribunal judge gave a two-page verdict. It said, "The tribunal deems the World Bank, IMF and ADB through their destructive policies, projects and illegitimate activities have caused the country a huge financial and social loss." The tribunal also ordered institution of an expert committee to assess the losses and the international institutions under question are to pay the damage to the country. "The government must take appropriate steps to realise the amount of losses the nation incurred," the judgement said, adding that these institutions had "agenda to serve the interests of their masters and their own." "Therefore the activities of the World Bank, IMF and ADB must stop immediately." Gana Shanghati Andolon coordinator Zunayed Saki, Centre for Law Research and Support convener Shah Alam, the University of Dhaka teacher MM Akash, the University of Chittagong teacher Dr Moynul Islam, Bazlur Rashid Firoze, Dr Mushtaque Hossain, Jahangirnagar University teacher professor Anu Mohammad pressed charges against the institutions. They were accused of undertaking harmful programmes in agriculture, jute, industry, banking, education, health and energy sectors in country. Judge Rabbani said, "Notice was served on the World Bank, IMF and ADB to appear before the tribunal, but they didn't show up." The people's tribunal said the World Bank and its two associates IMF and ADB were imposing anti-people strategies on the government on the plea of foreign assistance or on threats to stop it. Local industries went into the red, a huge number of workers were laid off, and the prices of the utilities and essentials soared because of the ill-advised policies, the tribunal noted. bdnews24.com
