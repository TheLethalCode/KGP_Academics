<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  A number of organisations are observing 'Dr Milan Day' on Thursday in remembrance of Dr Shamsul Alam Khan Milan who was killed this day in 1990 protesting against military dictator HM Ershad's autocratic rule. Dr Milan was shot dead near the Teacher-Student Centre of Dhaka University while he was taking a rickshaw ride from Dhaka Medical College Hospital to a meeting of the Bangladesh Medical Association at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. His death sparked students across the country to launch mass demonstration programmes and the eventual fall of Ershad regime. Political leaders and citizens have given messages marking the day of mourning. "The ideal Bangladesh that Dr Milan died dreaming of has not been realised until today. We have to work together, defeat all evil forces and establish the long-cherished rule of law and justice," said the Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina in her message. BNP chief Khaleda Zia said, "Dr Milan had laid down his life to promote Bangladesh's struggle against misrule and anarchy. People of Bangladesh now must get rid of all oppressors and realise the martyrs' dreams." Different political and social organisations and cultural bodies are observing the day through various activities including offering floral wreaths at Milan's grave on the DMCH premises, hoisting the national flag at half-mast and offering special prayers for his salvation. bdnew
