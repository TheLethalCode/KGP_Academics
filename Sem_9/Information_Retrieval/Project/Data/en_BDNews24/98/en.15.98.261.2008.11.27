<TITLE> Thai PM declares emergency at airports amid coup talk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat declared a state of emergency at two Bangkok airports besieged by anti-government protesters, a deputy minister said on Thursday, as rumors of an imminent army coup swirled through the capital. Deputy Agriculture Minister Thirachai Sankaew said that police would be in charge of the Suvarnabhumi and the old Don Muang airports blockaded by the People's Alliance for Democracy. "The cabinet agreed to use the emergency decree at the two airports to bring the situation back to normal," he told Reuters after a cabinet meeting. Earlier Somchai urged the army to stay in its barracks as rumors of a coup swirled after increasingly violent anti-government protests in Bangkok. Government spokesman Nattawut Saikuar denied rumors that Somchai planned to sack army chief Anupong Paochina, a day after the general called for a snap election to defuse the country's political crisis. "Troops should stay in their barracks and the prime minister is not going to sack anybody," Nattawut told reporters in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where the cabinet was meeting. Pressure has built on the military to intervene to avert civil unrest after Somchai rejected calls to quit, but pro-government forces are threatening to hit the streets if the elected administration goes. Some office employees left work early in Bangkok and the United Nations advised its staff to go home and remain indoors. Thailand's three-year-old political crisis has intensified since the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) began a "final battle" on Monday to unseat a government it accuses of being a pawn of former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted in a 2006 coup. Somchai held the cabinet meeting amid speculation he was considering a state of emergency, while rumors of the military preparing for a putsch swept the capital. "They are 100 percent on standby," a high-ranking former military officer, who declined to be named, told Reuters. As with a brief period of emergency rule in September, the army appeared reluctant to move against the PAD. "If the government insisted on dispersing the crowd, the army will meet again to find new measures. We already have a contingency plan," Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd told reporters. Tensions spiked on Tuesday when the PAD blockaded Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, a major Asian air hub, where all flights were canceled, stranding thousands of tourists. Protesters also laid siege to the old Don Muang airport, shutting what is a big domestic hub and severing air links to the city of 8 million people. "We appreciate this has affected private business, but the cause of the problem is this government," PAD leader Somsak Kosaisuk told reporters at Don Muang. "We know this government is nearing its end," said Somsak, whose group defied a Wednesday night court ruling ordering it to cease the airport protests. Somchai's refusal to call a snap election, as army chief Anupong Paochinda said he should on Wednesday, intensified speculation of an imminent coup. Anupong has repeatedly said he would not take over, arguing the army is powerless to heal the fundamental political rifts between the Bangkok elite and middle classes who despise Thaksin, and the rural and urban poor who love him. DEBATING OVER COUP? But one military source said army, navy and air force top brass were locked in talks late into the night, debating whether to launch what would be the 19th coup or attempted coup in 76 years of on-off democracy. There were signs that the latest surge in violence could backfire against the PAD, with newspapers that have indulged it in the past appalled by the airport disruption. "This is not civil disobedience. It's the PAD holding travelers hostage," the Nation said in an editorial. Tension has been rising across the country. A rival pro-government group has threatened to hit the streets against the PAD, and there were reports of gunfire during the night near Government House, the prime minister's compound occupied by the PAD since August. No injuries were reported. In Chiang Mai, a pro-government gang shot dead an anti-government activist after dragging him from his car. The long-running unrest has paralyzed government decision making, stirring fears it could exacerbate the impact of the global slowdown and tip the export-driven economy into recession.
