 ISLAMABAD, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan condemned on Thursday militant attacks in Mumbai in which at least 101 people have been killed, and reaffirmed its opposition to terrorism. India has in the past accused elements in Pakistan of supporting Islamist militants battling Indian forces in the disputed Kashmir region, and of complicity in bomb attacks elsewhere in India. "Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani while strongly condemning the incidents of violence in Mumbai has expressed deep sorrow over the loss of precious lives," the government said in a statement. Gilani, who came to power after February elections that restored democratic, civilian rule, said he hoped authorities would secure the safe release of all those being held by the militants, adding Pakistan had always opposed terrorism. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi arrived in India on Wednesday for a four-day visit that will include talks on the nuclear-armed rivals' tentative four-year peace process. Their main dispute is over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both countries claim in full but rule in part. Pakistan offers political support for what it calls a freedom struggle in mostly Muslim Kashmir but denies supporting terrorism
