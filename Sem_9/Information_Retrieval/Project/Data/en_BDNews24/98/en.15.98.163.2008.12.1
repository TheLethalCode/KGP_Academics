<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission may be faced with challenges under the next elected government but is prepared to overcome any obstacles, said the ACC chairman on Monday. "Many believe the work of the Commission will become difficult once a political government comes to power," Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury observed at a weekly press briefing. "But, the Commission is prepared to face all kinds of possibilities," he affirmed. "There have already been many efforts to influence the work of the commission. Due to various obstacles and legal wrangles, the Commission could not meet expectations, but it is up to the people to measure its success," he said. "The Anticorruption Commission has been formed according to law and it will not be wise if attempts are made to curtail its power," cautioned Hasan Mashhud. Cooperation from the law ministry, attorney general and others will be sought under the next elected government; at the same time, the public's involvement will be increased, to strengthen the ACC as a national institution, he said. The chairman, responding to a question, said the ACC did not want to be associated with the upcoming election. "This is outside the jurisdiction of the Commission and for this, the Election Commission is enough," he said. bdnew
