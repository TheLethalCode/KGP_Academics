<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday ordered the government to prove it was sufficiently prepared to avert unnecessary loss of lives in case of earthquakes. Directing authorities to submit a list of current rescue equipment within 2 months, the court also issued a notice to the government to explain why any inaction in arranging sufficient rescue equipment, necessary to save lives in case of such a disaster, should not be declared illegal. The HC bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Qumrul Islam Siddiqi passed the orders on a public interest litigation petition filed by rights group Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The court asked the secretaries to the ministries of home, finance and disaster management and relief, the director general and director of fire service and civil defense to reply to the rule. HRPB chairman, advocate Manzil Murshid submitted before the court that according to newspaper reports major parts of Bangladesh including the capital are positioned in the earthquake zone. In future, there is every possibility that Bangladesh will be hit by a strong earthquake, but proper rescue arrangements are not in place, he claimed. He also submitted that if such an earthquake hit the country many people would die or be severely injured for absence of appropriate measures. "The government is duty bound to take appropriate steps to save the lives of th citizens. But it has failed to do its duty as it has not arranged sufficient rescue equipment in case of such disaster," the lawyer submitted. He also placed a list of equipment "necessary for rescue in case of earthquake disaster". Deputy attorney general Razik-al-Jalil was present during hearing of the petition.
