<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has said those convicted for more than two years in cases filed under emergency powers rules will not be able run for elections, but in line with the Constitution those sentenced to less than two years may contest. "Rule 11(5) of the Emergency Powers Rules 2007 is effective subject to constitutional provision embodied in Article 66 (2)(Gha)," ruled the HC bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Md Rezaul Haque Sunday, on a writ petition filed by former communication minister barrister Nazmul Huda. Deputy attorney general JBM Hassan told bdnews24.com: "The ruling means that those sentenced to more than two years will not be eligible but those convicted for less than two years will be able to contest elections." As Nazmul Huda has been convicted for more than two years he will not be able to run for elections, the DAG added. Huda's lawyer Ashanur Rahman, however, claimed Rule11(5) of the EPR was invalidated after the ruling. He also said that his client would be able to run for elections as he had appealed against his verdict. "There is precedent that one can run for elections under appeal against a conviction," the lawyer said. The issue must be considered as per the constitution, Rahman added. However, JBM Hassan replied in the negative when asked if those convicted would be able to run during their appeal. On whether the ruling would be applicable for all convicts, the DAG said: "The court's ruling on the writ petition will be applicable for all." Constitutional expert barrister Shafik Ahmed in his interpretation of the ruling told bdnews24.com: "The ruling is valid as the Constitution keeps the provision that those convicted of corruption will not be able to run for elections." "The High Court passed the order keeping the provision of the Constitution intact," he said. Rule 11(5) of the EPR states that any person convicted for any length of sentence under the Rules, even under appeal against the verdict, will not be able to run for any elections, local or national. Article 66(2)(Gha) of the Constitution states that no person is eligible to be elected as a lawmaker or remain as such if he is convicted to two years or more in a criminal case, and remains ineligible up to five years after his release from prison. The former communication minister filed the writ petition on Oct 28 with the High Court protesting that Rule 11(5) of the EPR went against Article 66(2)(Gha) of the Constitution. bdnew
