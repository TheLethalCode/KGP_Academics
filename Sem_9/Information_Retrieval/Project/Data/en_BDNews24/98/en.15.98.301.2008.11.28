 NEW DELHI, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian cricket board has switched the second test against England to Chennai due to safety concerns following the militant attacks in original venue Mumbai. "India's test series against England will be played as per schedule," the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement on Friday. "Chennai will host the second test from Dec. 19 instead of Mumbai," he said. The first test will be played in Ahmedabad from Dec. 11 as planned. The England players are to fly home on Saturday after the last two games in the one-day series were called off following the attacks in India's commercial capital which have claimed over 120 lives. The England board decided to send home the national squad with a final decision on returning to play the tests depending on security advice. Baroda will stage a three-day game between the touring side and the Indian board president's XI from Dec. 5
