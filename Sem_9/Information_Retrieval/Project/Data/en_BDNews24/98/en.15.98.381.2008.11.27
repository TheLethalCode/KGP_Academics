 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Thursday seriously condemned terrorist attacks that have paralysed Mumbai. She expressed her sorrow and concern over the death of over a hundred innocent people in a series of deadly shootings in the Indian city Wednesday night, to be followed by a hostage crisis which continued through Thursday. In a message sent to the Indian premier Manmohan Singh, Sheikh Hasina said, "I'm deeply aggrieved and saddened at this most deplorable chain of crises. On behalf of the people of Bangladesh, Awami League and myself, I extend my heartfelt sympathies to dear and near ones of the dead, the people and the government of India." Calling the attack "a most cowardly act", Hasina said, no sane, conscientious person can endorse such heinous acts. The former prime minister also said in her message, such incidents are being perpetrated to hamper the peace and security of the people of this Subcontinent and thwart regional advancement. bdnews2
