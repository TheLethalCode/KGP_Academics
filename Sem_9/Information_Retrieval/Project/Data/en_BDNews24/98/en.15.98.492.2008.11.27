<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club became the second victim of Rahmatganj MFS when they went one goal down to the minnows in the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Thursday. Ugandan striker Idris Kasirye struck the all-important goal in 25th minute for the old Dhaka outfit, who also stunned reigning champions Abahani Limited 2-1 in the league opener. Rahmatganj also broke the unbeaten run of the black and white outfit, who remained unconquered in the 11-team league until Thursday's match, and the shocking defeat means Mohammedan have now five points deficit than leaders Sheikh Russel KC, who played a match more than Mohammedan's seven. Holders Abahani, archrivals of Mohammedan, are in the second position with 16 points from seven outings while Rahmatganj raised their point tally to 13 from eight matches. With the absence of defender Mofazzal Hossain Saikat, midfielders Aram Aziz and Enamul Haq Sharif in the first half, Mohammedan looked disorganised and had no edge in the attack. Rahmatganj came close to a lead in the half way of the first half, but Mohammedan goalkeeper Aminul Haq thwarted a fierce shot by Hirok Joarder at the top of the box. Moments later, the old Dhaka outfit took a lead with Idris heading a Jahangir Patoary corner home. After resumption, Mohammedan got the momentum with enjoying a superior ball procession in the midfield but not before two close calls by Rahmatganj. Keeper Aminul salvaged Mohammedan in both occasions denying efforts from Idris and Nigerian striker Nche Francis in the 51st and 64th minutes respectively. Rahmatganj defender Ashraf bought Mohammedan's striker Mohammad Robin and referee Taiyeb Hasan awarded the Motijheel-based club a penalty, but play remained suspended for eight minutes following the demand of cancellation of the spot kick by Rahmatganj's players. Play resumed and Bukola Olaleken came to take the spot kick, but the Nigerian striker disappointed Mohammedan sending it over the crossbar in the 68th minute to miss the opportunity to bring his side in match. It was not possible for Mohammedan to split the solid defence of Rahmatganj in the remaining minutes and left the field with the first defeat in the league. bd
