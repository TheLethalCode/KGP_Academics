 KARACHI, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's cricket chief has admitted the terror attacks in Mumbai have badly hit the chances of India undertaking a test tour of Pakistan in January. Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said on Friday he was uncertain over the Indian team's visit after militant attacks killed at last 120 people earlier this week. "Before this tragic incident took place we were pretty confident the Indians would tour," Butt told a news conference. "But now the scenario has definitely changed and now it is entirely up to the governments what they decide." India is due to play three tests, five one-day internationals and a twenty20 game on a tour lasting nearly 46 days. The Indian board is awaiting clearance from its government for the tour, which would be Pakistan's first test series since December 2007. "The scenario has now changed completely and we have to wait to see what happens," added Butt, pointing to England's decision to return from their current tour of India. "England has gone home, the Champions League is postponed so it is not an ideal situation for anyone. But if India does come for the tour it will send a clear-cut message to these terrorists they cannot deter the people of both countries from leading normal lives." Butt insisted Pakistan would press for the series to be played on schedule. "We are trying 200 percent to have the Indians play in Pakistan," he told reporters. "If they don't come then we have the option of playing at neutral venues.
