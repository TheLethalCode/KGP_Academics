 NEW DELHI, Dec 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said he would increase the size and strength of the country's anti-terrorist forces after militant attacks in Mumbai killed nearly 200 people. "The anti-terrorist forces of the country will be further strengthened and streamlined," Singh said in a statement. Sharing the country's "anger and outrage" over the Mumbai attacks, he appealed to parties to rise above political considerations to meet the challenge unitedly. "Terrorists and enemies of our nation must know that their actions unite rather than divide us," he said in his opening remarks at the all party meeting convened by him to discuss the situation arising out of the terror strikes. Describing the attacks as "different" from the previous terror strikes, Singh said "in the face of this national threat and in the aftermath of this national tragedy, all of us from different political parties must rise above narrow political considerations and stand united. "We should work together in the interest of the country at this critical juncture." He said the parties should build a consensus on what needs to be done to strengthen the ability of the system to meet these threats. "The terrorists and enemies of our nation must know that their actions unite rather than divide us," the Prime Minister said at the meeting from which leader of the opposition L K Advani, BJP president Rajnath Singh and Shiv Sena stayed away. He hoped that the political parties would be able to give a collective assurance to the nation that, across the political spectrum, "we stand together at this hour." Maintaining that the government shared the hurt of the people and their sense of anger and outrage, Singh said several measures are already in place to deal with the situation. "But clearly much more needs to be done and we are determined to take all necessary measures to overhaul the system," he said. "We have finalised a set of legal measures based on the recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Commission which includes the setting up of a FIA," Singh said. The Prime Minister said the government would further strengthen maritime and air security for which measures have been initiated. This will involve the Navy, the Coast Guard and the coastal police, as well as the Air Force and the civil aviation ministry. "The anti-terrorist forces of the country will be further strengthened and streamlined. The National Security Guard, which is the principal anti-terrorist force of the country, will be given additional facilities and the size of the force is being augmented," he said. Steps have also been initiated to establish another four NSG hubs in different parts of the country. Additionally, the special forces at the disposal of the Centre would be appropriately utilised in counter insurgency operations.
