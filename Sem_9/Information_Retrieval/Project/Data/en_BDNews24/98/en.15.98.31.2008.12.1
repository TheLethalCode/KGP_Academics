<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Mon Dec 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops captured a town held by Tamil Tiger rebels for 18 years, after monsoon rains eased and soldiers resumed an advance on the separatists' self-declared capital, the military said on Monday. Troops took Kokavil on Sunday after heavy clashes along the road that leads to Kilinochchi, the town the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam's (LTTE) have set up as the seat of the separate state they want to create for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority. "We have taken over Kokavil town which is located along the A9 highway," military Spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. He gave no details of casualties. Kokavil is about 20 km south of Kilinochchi, in the northern jungles of the Indian Ocean island. The LTTE could not be reached for comment. Independent confirmation is all but impossible since both sides limit media access to the war zone. The military since September has been converging on Kilinochchi. Last week, the military said its fall was imminent with units moving in from three directions. The next day, it said monsoon flooding had slowed combat operations to a crawl. "It is still raining but the flooding in certain areas had subsided," Nanayakkara said. Over the weekend, the air force said it bombed rebel positions in support of troop advances. The pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com said one attack had killed three people, including a child, who had fled fighting. The report quoted eyewitnesses TamilNet did not name. Kilinochchi is a strategic target for a government that has made the most military progress of any in one of Asia's longest modern insurgencies, and a symbol of the separate state the LTTE has been fighting since 1983 to establish. Aid agencies estimate 230,000 people are displaced by the war, and diplomats say they are trapped between rebels who won't let them leave and soldiers they do not trust for safe passage
