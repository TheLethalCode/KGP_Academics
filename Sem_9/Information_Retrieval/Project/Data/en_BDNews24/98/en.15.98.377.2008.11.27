 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)Chief of the European Union polls observation mission Thursday expressed satisfaction over the election preparations. Alexander Lambsdorff, chief of the mission, following his talks with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, reiterated the EU call for lifting emergency ahead of the Dec 29 polls. "I congratulate the caretaker government on the preparations undertaken so far for the polls," Lambsdorff told reporters after the meeting at foreign ministry. He hoped that the upcoming general elections would be held in a "peaceful" way. On the state of emergency, he said: "Generally speaking it is desirable for the state of emergency to be lifted before the elections but I will talk to everyone involved and give a final assessment tomorrow (Friday)." Lambsdorff is scheduled to hold a press conference Friday on the findings so far of the EU polls observation mission in Bangladesh. Iftekhar Chowdhury told journalists that he had been in discussions and correspondence with his EU counterpart, external affairs commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, for some months now about fielding an observer mission from the EU. "I am glad that that this has finally happened," he said. The government and the EU were in disagreement over dispatch of the observation mission as the EU has never sent any mission to observe the polls held under emergency, and the government did not make it clear whether the year-end polls would take place under the state of emergency. The EU urged the government either lift or relax the emergency to ensure restoration of civil and political rights if it wanted to see a EU election observer mission. The government relaxed the emergency and has shown signs that it may be fully lifted for the election. bdn
