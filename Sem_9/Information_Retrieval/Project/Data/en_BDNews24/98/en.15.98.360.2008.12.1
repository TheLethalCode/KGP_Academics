 Dhaka, December 01 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League-led grand alliance has allocated 50 seats to Jatiya Party, said a top leader on Monday. "We made a courtesy call on the AL president at Suda Sadhan," acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud, and confirmed that his party had been sanctioned 50 seats. The two parties had earlier sat for two whole days, Friday and Saturday, in negotiations over sharing of constituencies. On Sunday evening, just hours after Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad threatened to quit the alliance, leaders of both parties jointly announced "an end to misunderstandings". "We've pledged to contest the polls together. If there is a problem regarding seat-sharing in a few constituencies, it is a minor issue," AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said. Anisul Islam said, "I want to say it clearly that the 'grand alliance' exists and it will. I know there were some misunderstandings, but now those are over." Anisul Islam, who had been present in the talks with AL over the previous three days, went to Sudha Sadan on Monday morning with JP presidium member Ziauddin Bablu. JP chairman Ershad said on Sunday his party had joined the AL-led alliance this time on a promise of at least 60 electoral seats and the presidency for him if the alliance goes to power, similar to the deal made ahead of the cancelled Jan. 22, 2007 election. JP initially approached AL with a 74-seat list from where negotiations took off. bdnews24.
