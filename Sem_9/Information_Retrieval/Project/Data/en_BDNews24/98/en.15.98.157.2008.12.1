 Dhaka, Dec 1(bdnews24.com)  The High Court has halted the suspension order for three months against seven students of Jahangirnagar University who had been agitating for sacking of a teacher on charges of sexual harassment, a lawyer says. The court asked the university authorities to explain in two weeks why drama and dramatics teacher Sanwar Hossain Sunny's name being cleared of the charges in a enquiry and the investigation itself were not illegal. The university has also been asked to say why a fresh probe under a former Supreme Court judge should not be conducted. The bench comprising justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui delivered the orders upon a writ petition by rights organisations Ain O Salish Kendra, Nijera Kori and Karmajibi Nari and celebrated personalities Prof. Serajul Islam Chowdhury and Kamal Lohani. "The High Court order made way for Jahangirnagar University agitators to get justice against sexual harassment," barrister Sarah Hossain, a lawyer for the writ petitioners, said to bdnews24.com after the orders. According to the writ petition, the students have been agitating for eight months for expulsion of Sanny on charges of sexual harassment. But, the university syndicate relieved Sani of the charges on Sep. 22, without giving any reason. Instead, it suspended seven agitating students including Chinmayee, Anik, Rumon on Oct. 22. During the hearing, Dr. Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury assisted Sarah Hossain, while deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil argued for the government. b
