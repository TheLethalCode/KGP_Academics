<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com) - Hours after Jatiya Party president HM Ershad threatened to quit the Awami League-led alliance, leaders of both parties on Sunday evening jointly announced "an end to misunderstandings". "We've pledged to contest the polls together. If there is a problem regarding seat-sharing in a few constituencies, it is a minor issue," AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said. JP presidium member Anisul Islam Mahmud said, " I want to say it clearly that the 'grand alliance' exists and it will. I know there were some misunderstandings, but now those vanished." "We want an effective parliament and balance of power between the president and prime minister," he added. The statements came at a joint press conference at the AL president's Dhanmondi office after several sessions between the parties' policymakers. Earlier on Sunday afternoon, the JP chief had threatened to leave the grand alliance for "not keeping its promise on seats". "We had joined the alliance following a deal that ensured us 60 electoral seats and the presidency if the alliance goes to power," former president Ershad had alleged in a press conference at JP's Banani office. Asked later whether Ershad had backtracked from his demand for the presidency, Anisul answered, "Mr Ershad has said 'presidency is not the biggest thing' and his main goal is to take the alliance to power." "We want an effective parliament and balance of power between the president and prime minister," the JP leader added. Ashraful Islam welcomed Sunday's High Court verdict barring those convicted to over two years under emergency powers rules from running for election. He also repeated criticisms made Saturday on rival party BNP's nominations, saying the nation expected better candidates from them. bdnews24.c
