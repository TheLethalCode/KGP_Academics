 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Monday stayed the trial of two graft cases against former communication minister Nazmul Huda for six months on a writ petition filed by the BNP leader. The High Court bench of justices Tariq Ul Hakim and Farah Mahbub also asked the government to submit Huda's medical report by Dec. 4. The court further directed the government and the Anticorruption Commission to answer within four weeks why filing of the two cases and their proceedings will not be declared illegal. The cases, involving charges of extortion and embezzlement, were filed with Dhanmondi and Ramna police on July 5 and Sept. 25 respectively. Adilur Rahman Khan and Ahsanul Karim stood for Huda in Monday's hearing, while deputy attorney general Khandakar Gulzar Hossain represented the government and Abdul Aziz Khan was for the ACC. bdnews
