 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Two-day long negotiations between Awami League and Jatiya Party over seat sharing, ahead of the Dec. 29 naional vote, have failed to bear fruit so far. "There will be more talks tomorrow (Sunday)," JP acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud Saturday told reporters after a meeting with AL president Sheikh Hasina. "We hope to settle the sharing of seats with Awami League on Sunday," he said. Prior to the one-on-one talks between Mahmud and Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home, the acting JP chief and senior AL leaders met for the second consecutive day at the AL president's Dhanmondi office on Saturday. The negotiations over seats began on Friday morning continuing up to evening. Talks resumed again from Saturday noon, said Mahmud. He said earlier in the day that they had hoped to reach a final decision by the end of the day, but would now have to wait till Sunday, which is also the last date for submission of nominations. The JP acting chairman said his party demanded 74 seats from the AL-led alliance. He, however, hoped JP might be allocated at least 40 seats. "We want the alliance to nominate the potential candidates," he added. "The AL-led electoral alliance must finalise their list of candidates soonif it is held up till Dec 11 (deadline for withdrawal of candidacy) then candidates will only have 18 days for preparation, which is not sufficient," Mahmud observed. Asked if Ershad would be president, in case the AL-led alliance is voted into power, Mahmud said, "We didn't discuss this issue yet." Mahmud added that Ershad would run from three constituencies in Rangpur, Kurigram and Dhaka. JP was represented by Mahmud and presidium member Ziauddin Bablu in the two-party talks, AL by presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury and Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and spokesman and joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. bdnews24.
