 Khulna, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Monday warned civil authorities against negligence in electoral duties during upcoming parliamentary and Upazila polls. "The two upcoming elections are very important in the recent history of the country. I urge you all to discharge your duties with honesty, integrity and impartiality." "I believe that no one will run the risk of any unlawful bias shown in favour of or against any candidate or party, or be lax in duties, as any of these attitudes will not be tolerated," he told government officials in Khulna. "The government is determined to hold a free, fair and neutral election," the CA said, adding that preparations for the ninth Jatiya Sangsad and third Upazila Parishad elections was nearing completion. The CA said, "The people are yearning to elect their representatives and it's your duty to ensure an fair election so that their wishes are reflected." "The new voter list with photographs has gone a long way to overcome a feeling of mistrust among the people that had centred around the cancelled Jan. 22 2007 election." Electoral law reforms for political parties and candidates, strengthening the yardstick to determine candidates' eligibility, submission of certain mandatory information, registration of political parties and other measures have revived a trust in the electoral system, Fakhruddin said. The CA stressed: "The efficiency of the presiding and polling officers is the key to a successful voting system." "Pay extra attention so that women, religious minorities, indigenous people and the older population can cast their votes without fear." "You will have to ensure that every voter can go to their voting centre and vote freely. You will have to ensure fair voting free from black money, corruption, criminal and muscle power." "You must work without fear by rising above threats, temptations and influence," the chief adviser told the government officials. The chief adviser also asked law enforcing agencies to strengthen the crackdown on criminals and to maintain strict vigilance so that electoral campaigning runs in accordance with the new laws. "Take strong measures to prevent the return of terrorists who are in hiding outside the country," he told law enforcers. He also called on the BDR, coastguard, navy and police to be extra cautious to prevent any move to bring in weapons, bombs and explosives to foil the election. Mobile and striking forces will remain on guard to enforce a three-tier security system for voting centres on Election Day, he said. Fakhruddin said he had already asked law enforcers to take steps to prevent conflict, animosity and violence between the supporters of rival parties. The meeting, presided over by Khulna deputy commissioner Md Yunusur Rahman, was attended by home adviser MA Matin, cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, home secretary Abdul Karim, among others. bdnews24.co
