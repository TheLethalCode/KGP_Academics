 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  To link the capital with Purbachal satellite town and improve the country's communications system, a new 14km road is being constructed along with a Tk 306 crore flyover at the entrance of Purbachal at Kuril Biswa Road in the city, a top official said Wednesday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to inaugurate the construction on Dec 16, said housing and works secretary ASM Rashidul Islam Hye. The Rajuk-financed flyover will be constructed over 12 acres of land, he said, adding: "It will save at least five hours of travel time." Of the 12 acres, 10 belong to Bangladesh Railway and the remaining 2 acres have been acquired from private hands, he said. The secretary also said that to implement the project, seven organisations have been selected through tenders and offers invited from them. The flyoverplanned to be 3.05 km in length, 48 feet in height and 8.9 metres in width with 10 entry pointswas initially projected to be opened to the public on March 26. Regarding possible delays, the secretary said the removal of 64 houses for the construction of the road and the demolition and subsequent legal proceedings of the Rangs building have caused some hold-ups. bdnews
