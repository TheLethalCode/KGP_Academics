<TITLE> Political situation right for polls: EU mission </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The European Union's election observation mission (EOM) has said the political situation is right to hold the general election slated for Dec.29. It also views the emergency rule and tight polls schedules as the two possible negative factors for the upcoming polls. EOM chief Graf Lambsdorff said at a media briefing at Sheraton Hotel on Friday the deployment of troops during polls would depend exclusively on the "national authorities". He said the government should withdraw the state of emergency before the Dec. 29 polls. "I believe there are more positive factors today than the negative factors for which we are here...There are consensus that the elections will be held. "If we believed that in the circumstances there would be no credible elections, we would not have deployed a full-fledged large and expensive observation mission in Bangladesh," Lambsdorff, chief of the 150-member monitoring mission, said. He said there were two positive sides for holding the polls: two years ago, people did not have confidence in the voter roll while the Election Commission secretariat was under the Prime Minister's Office. The EU withdrew its polls observation mission from Bangladesh ahead of the forestalled Jan. 22 polls last year. "I believe the current voters register appears to be better than one two years ago. "It is (Election Commission) now under a different ministry. Therefore, I believe there is structurally and institutionally a greater guarantee of independence of the Election Commission than we had two years ago," said Lambsdorff. On the negative sides, he said, "One factor that I would say more difficult is very tight schedule right now. And of course the factor we still have is the state of emergency which we hope would be lifted." "After our meeting with the foreign adviser it seems to me that he indicated publicly that he expects the state of emergency to be lifted," he said. "As far as the role of the army is concerned, in the election process as such the role of the army is non-existent. "Our mandate, of course, covers the election of the next civilian government of this country. Therefore, I see the role for the army would only be in providing security if your national authorities so decide," he said. Lambsdorff said the EU would not have deployed its polls observation mission if the government had not repealed the sections of the emergency powers rules that curb basic rights. bd
