<TEXT>
 Panchagarh, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  India and Bangladesh's border guards have agreed to shore up intelligence and patrol on the porous borders after the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and prior to general election in Bangladesh. A flag meeting between Bangladesh Rifles and Indian Border Security Force on Atowary border in Panchagarh district on Tuesday also discussed ways to stop killing of innocent Bangladeshis by the BSF, checking trafficking in women and children, and smuggling of drugs and other contrabands. Lt Col Shahed Kamal, captain of Thakurgaon 22 Rifles battalion, one of the attendees at the sector commander-level meeting, said they had agreed to intensify patrol on borders and stop incidents. An infant, its mother and another Bangladeshi were killed on Nov. 16 by the BSF men at Majhipara of Tetulia Upazila in the district, the country's northernmost border. They were shot in their sleep in home and a member of the BSF, who appeared to be 'drunken', ran amok and sprayed bullets. Dinajpur sector commander Col Rejaul Kabir led the Bangladesh team, while India's Kishanganj sector deputy inspector general R Chandra Mahon led the Indian delegation. bdnews24
