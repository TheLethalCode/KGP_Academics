<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal pointed out on Thursday that the Upazila elections as scheduled for Jan. 22 would be held under an elected government. "Since there's provision for the newly elected government taking oath within three days after the election results are published by gazette, there's no chance for the Upazila polls being staged under the present interim government," he said after a meeting with the UN pre-election observers delegation at his office. "The present government will be abolished automatically immediately after the winning party forms government," the adviser noted. Following the Election Commission's announcement of the new election schedules, Awami League accepted the new date for parliamentary elections on Dec. 29, but demanded that Upazila polls be cancelled and "held under an elected government". The UN delegation headed by Frances Vendrell, UN secretary general's former envoy to Afghanistan, also included Nepal's chief election commissioner Bhusraj Pukhrel and UN election affairs chief Arakeli Santana. bdnews2
