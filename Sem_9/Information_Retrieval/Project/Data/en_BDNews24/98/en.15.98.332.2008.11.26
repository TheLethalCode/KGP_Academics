 Dhaka, Nov 26(bdnews24.com) Private carrier United Airways inaugurated its Dhaka-Syedpur flight on Wednesday. The plane left Zia International Airport for Syedpur at 2.30 p.m. and left Syedpur for the return leg to Dhaka at 3.45 p.m. "To ensure convenient communication, we want to operate flights on all routes of Bangladesh," said chairman Tasbirul Ahmed Chowdhury, while inaugurating the new flight. "Due to improved service and an efficient workforce, we have become the leading aviation organisation in the domestic route," said the chairman. "The domestic route is used by about 3.5 lakh people and 40 per cent of that is flown by us." "Three days a week (Saturday, Monday, Wednesday), United will operate a flight on the Dhaka-Syedpur route," said public relations officer Qamrul Islam. A one way fare, including VAT, will be Tk 5495, he said. "But for the inauguration, special rates at Tk 3000 are being offered." With 95 per cent funds from expatriate Bangladeshis, United Airways began operation on July 10, 2007. At present, the airline operates flights on the Dhaka-Kolkata, Dhaka-Chittagong, Dhaka-Sylhet, Dhaka-Jessore, Dhaka-Barisal and Dhaka-Cox's Bazar route with two 32-seater Canadian Dash-8-100 aircrafts. State carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines stopped operation on the Dhaka-Syedpur flight in Feb, 2007. Royal Bengal Airlines, another private carrier company also funded by expatriates, restarted flights on this route from Aug 26 this year. bd
