<TITLE> Iraq parliament nears vote on US troops deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Thu Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Iraqi lawmakers prepared for a grueling round of talks on Thursday over a long-awaited pact setting a deadline for US troops to leave the country. Parliament had been scheduled to vote on the security agreement on Wednesday, but wrangling pushed it back a day. It now is expected to meet before midday (4 a.m. EST), subject to last-minute delay caused by negotiations between rival factions going on outside the house. The landmark deal will pave the way for US troops to withdraw by the end of 2011, bringing in sight an end to a US military presence that has lingered on since the 2003 US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shi'ite-led government and its Kurdish partners, who together hold most of Iraq's 275 parliamentary seats, probably could push the pact through by themselves, but would then struggle to sell it as representing the will of all of Iraq's fractious communities. "If they pass it by a slim majority, it would be totally unwise. They need consensus and we may not reach this consensus," said Laith Kuba, a former government spokesman and US-based analyst. "It will be a cause of discontent." Once-dominant minority Sunni Arabs are concerned the U.S. departure may curb their influence in Shi'ite-led Iraq and they have listed reforms they want adopted before they approve it. Legislators agreed to meet a demand from the two main Sunni Arab blocs that the pact be put to a referendum next year. But they rejected other conditions, including reforms that would cease the hunting-down and trying of former members of Saddam's Baath party and abolish the court that condemned the dictator to death -- demands which have nothing to do with the US presence but which the Sunnis want in any bargain. In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said a referendum would not delay implementation, which would go into force from the start of next year until a vote is organized. A spokesman for parliament's deputy speaker Khaled al-Attiya, said Maliki and senior members of his ruling coalition considered the demands late on Wednesday, but rejected them because they would require changing the constitution. But Maliki also needs a broad consensus to satisfy Iraq's most influential Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. "Sistani's trying ... to get as many people in there as possible so when it is signed, it marginalizes the radical voices against it," said Toby Dodge, an Iraq specialist at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those voices include followers of cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who oppose a deal with the Americans and have vowed to fight it. The cabinet has approved the pact and signed with Washington, but Iraqis remain in suspense as parliamentary debates rage on. "We want it to pass as soon as possible so there will be stability," said electrical appliance shopkeeper Abu Ali, 55. The deal, replacing a UN mandate, gives Iraq authority over US troops, makes them liable for some crimes committed when they are off duty and reins in private security firms. The 150,000-odd American troops in Iraq will have to quit the towns by mid-2009, and leave the country by the end of 2011. That will boost Maliki, who will get three more years of US support while claiming accolades for ending the occupation
