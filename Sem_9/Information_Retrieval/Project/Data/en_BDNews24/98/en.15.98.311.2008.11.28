 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  A strike called for Friday at Dhaka University by a 'madrasa students rights group' has been postponed following relaxation of admission criteria by DU departments. Admission tests of the university's 'Gha' unit for the 2008-9 session is scheduled for Friday. A Dhaka University press release on Thursday said all "having minimum qualifications who have applied can sit for the tests." An activist group under the banner "Madrasa Students Rights Protection Committee" have been carrying out month-long demonstrations to press home their demands to cancel admissions criteria to a number of departments. Several departments recently introduced rules that bar students from seeking admission who failed to study English and Bangla for 100 + 100 mark exams at HSC or equivalent level. The rules affect madrasa students, who argue the new criteria were discriminatory. The High Court on Oct 26 asked Dhaka University authorities to show cause as to why disputed criteria should not be declared illegal, on a writ petition by five DU admission seekers who secured GPA-5s in the madrasa education board examinations. Dhaka University vice chancellor, pro-vice chancellor, registrar, controller of examinations, deans of arts and social science faculties and chairmen of seven departments concerned have been asked to reply to the show cause notice within a week. Lawyer for the petitioners, barrister Abdur Razzak said the Dhaka University Ordinance 1973 does not contain any provision that admission seekers must have studied 200 mark exams in Bangla and English. "The Dhaka University admission notice, published on Sept 23 this year, did not mention any such condition either," he argued. The education ministry, in a 1986 circular, also declared that Alim exams will be considered of equal value to HSC exams, Razzak pointed out. The writ petitioners sought a court order staying the admission process at Dhaka University, but the Court gave no such order. bdnew
