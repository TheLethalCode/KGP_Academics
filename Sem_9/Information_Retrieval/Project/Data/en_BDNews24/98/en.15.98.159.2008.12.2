 ISLAMABAD, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan rejected on Monday what it called unsubstantiated allegations of complicity in the militant assault on Mumbai and sought help from allies to reduce tension with India. India said it had called Pakistan's envoy and informed him that deadly attacks in Mumbai were carried out by militants from Pakistan and demanded swift action against those responsible. Pakistan condemned the assault as a "barbaric act of terrorism" and has denied any involvement by state agencies but tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours has risen. Pakistan has vowed to cooperate with India in investigating the attack although it backtracked on a decision to send the chief of its main Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) security agency. Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir repeated Pakistan's condemnation and its offer of cooperation in a meeting with India's high commissioner in Islamabad. He also rejected Indian media reports of Pakistani involvement. "The foreign secretary refuted the unsubstantiated allegations by the Indian media of Pakistan's complicity in the Mumbai incident," Bashir's ministry said. India has said it has raised security to a "war level" and has no doubt about a Pakistani link. Pakistan and India went to the brink of their fourth war after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that New Delhi also blamed on Pakistan-based militants. Pakistan has warned that if tension with India escalates, it would have to move troops from its Afghan border -- where it is battling al Qaeda and Taliban fighters responsible for violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan -- to the Indian border. That would be a serious blow to U.S-led efforts to stabilise Afghanistan and defeat al Qaeda. BRITISH OFFER Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, had been trying to push forward a four-year peace process with India. He appealed to India not to punish his country for the Mumbai assault, saying militants had the power to precipitate war in the region, the Financial Times reported. As tension with India has grown, Pakistan has been trying to drum up international support. Zardari spoke to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who offered to help reduce tension, the state news agency reported. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has summoned political leaders to a national security conference on Tuesday to build a consensus, his office said. The last time the neighbours nearly went to war, after the 2001 attack on India's parliament, the United States helped cool tempers. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will visit India on Wednesday, played down the threat of conflict. New Delhi has not accused Islamabad's civilian government of involvement but has expressed deep frustration that its neighbour has been unable or unwilling to prevent militants using its soil to attack Indian cities. The tension with India comes as Zardari's government, elected this year, is struggling with an economic crisis and its own campaign against militant violence. The International Monetary Fund stepped in with a loan of $7.6 billion last week. The rupee firmed on Monday despite the tension with India and violence between rival ethnic-based factions in the commercial capital, Karachi. Pakistan has a history of using militants to further foreign policy objectives. It supported militants fighting Indian forces in the disputed Kashmir region for years but began to rein them in after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. An Indian police officer said the training of the militants who attacked Mumbai was organised by the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group, and conducted by a former member of the Pakistani army
