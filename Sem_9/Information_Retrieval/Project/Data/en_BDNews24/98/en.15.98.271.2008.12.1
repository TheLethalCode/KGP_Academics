<TITLE> Indian Shares swoon, rupee falters on growth worries </TITLE>

 MUMBAI, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The BSE Sensex shed 2.8 percent and the rupee fell towards an all-time low on Monday as a slew of weak economic data and shaky European markets rattled investors after last week's deadly attacks on Mumbai. Shrinking manufacturing activity as well as falling vehicle sales and exports provided fresh evidence of a rapidly slowing economy, which kept alive expectations for easier monetary policy and pushed bond yields to three-year lows. "People do not have the confidence and commitment. Bad news from the auto sector added to it," said Rajesh Jain, director and CEO at Pranav Securities. The main share index closed down 2.78 percent, or 252.85 points, at 8,839.87, as the industry activity in India, China and Europe slumped in November while Japanese officials said their economy was slowing rapidly. Rajen Shah, chief investment officer at Angel Broking, said foreign institutional investors, who have dumped Indian shares worth $13.7 billion this year, were among the big sellers. The benchmark, which had risen more than 2 percent in the morning, has lost 56.4 percent in 2008, largely due to the foreign selloff. Trading was largely normal as people reported back to work in the business district in south Mumbai near the site of the militant attacks, although at least one firm was operating out of centres in different parts of the country as a security measure. A reshuffling of key government posts following the attacks that killed nearly 200 people underpinned sentiment in early trade. Former finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram took over as the new home minister after the incumbent resigned, and the prime minister would look after the finance portfolio for now. The partially convertible rupee closed at 50.30/32 per dollar, 0.4 percent weaker from Friday's close of 50.09/12. It had hit a record low of 50.60 on Nov. 20, at which level it was down 22 percent in 2008. Exports in October contracted an annual 12.1 percent, the first year-on-year decline in nearly three years. The 10-year federal bond yield ended at 7.06 percent, a notch lower than Friday's close of 7.07 percent. It hit a three-year low of 7.01 in early deals, a level it last tested in September 2005. "I expect 7 percent to breach only after the rate cutwhenever it comes," Anoop Verma, associate vice president at Development Credit Bank. Factory output declined in November as credit conditions tightened and the global financial crisis hurt sentiment and reduced demand. The central bank has cut interest rates by 150 basis points since October to 7.5 percent to shield the economy from knock-on effects of the global credit crisis, and analysts said the attacks may hasten the central bank to act sooner. Data last week showed economic growth in the September quarter fell to its lowest annual pace in nearly four years
