 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)- A Dhaka court sent six members of Ulama Anjumane Al Bayenat to jail on Sunday in connection with an attack on the Balaka sculpture in the capital's commercial centre of Motijheel the previous night, said police. Police arrested eight activists of the Islamic outfit as they were caught Saturday night in the act of vandalising the famous monument by renowned sculptor Mrinal Haque. The eight are Mohammad Hasibur Rahman (28), Mufti Mohammad Jahangir Hossain (30), Shah Newaj Dipu (30), Mohammad Billal (40), Abdul Bari (32), Ziaur Rahman (32), Arafat (23) and Mostak Ahmed Chowdhury (51). Of the arrestees, two are now under treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said Motijheel police officer in charge Fazul Haque. Al Bayenat attacked the sculpture for being "un-Islamic", the fundamentalist group claimed as they defaced the legs of the six cranes and damaging parts of the bodies. The vandals later retreated in the face of police who filed a case with Motijheel station. Political parties and cultural organisations, meanwhile, have protested against the act of vandalism. bdnews
