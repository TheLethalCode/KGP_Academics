 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The knitwear exporters have also laughed off the World Bank's predictions that Bangladesh might suffer a slide in exports because of the impact of world economic recession. "There is no scope of exports falling in the knitwear sector in the current fiscal year compared with the last year," said Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Fazlul Haque at the launch of Knit+Tex Bangladesh 2008 Expo. The BKMEA and Conference and Executive Management Service are organising three-day held in exhibition, the first of its kind, at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in the city on Friday. "Our export growth rate stood at around 45 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. We also have a forecast on the next three months' exports, and even that does not indicate any decline." Knitwear exports grew 21.50 percent and fetched $ 5532.52 million in FY 2007-08. "America and European countries are the main markets for exports of our knitwear. As economic recession is going on there, there might have some fears in exports. But if exports in knitwear sector come down due to economic recession, it will still mark 12-15 percent growth rate in the current year." Commenting that the World Bank wittingly made such predictions, he said, "The World Bank had said in 2004 that half of the factories in Bangladesh will shut in the quota-free era. But the number has rather increased." On Thursday, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed and Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association dismissed the WB's predictions. Former adviser to the caretaker government and Regulatory Reforms Commission's chairman Akbar Ali Khan inaugurated the exposition. Referring to a few years' success in knitwear sector, Akbar Ali said, "It is only possible to survive in the competitive world market through the use of up-to-date technology." Apart from Bangladesh, a total of 75 institutions from 10 countries including China, India, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Spain, Pakistan and Japan are taking part in the exposition. The former adviser thanked them for their participation with diverse technological apparatus. "Once Bangladesh was called a basket case. But we have proved with our social and economic contribution in last four decades that Bangladesh is not all about a beggars' basket." b
