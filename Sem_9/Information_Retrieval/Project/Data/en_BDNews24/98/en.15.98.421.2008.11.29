 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was enlisted as a voter Saturday, said an election official, just hours after the party presented its list of hopefuls for the 9th parliamentary polls and a day before the deadline set for her enrolment. BNP and its allies finalised their seat allocations and nominations the previous day, said alliance members. BNP's announcement of names began from Saturday morning at the chairperson's Gulshan office. Khaleda, giving her birthday as Aug 15, completed her voter enrolment at around 6.30pm, from her Dhaka Cantonment residence, said district election officer Faisal Quader. "We received word from Khaleda Zia's people at around 4pm that she was ready to enlist," he said. Officials went to the Moinul Road residence to complete formalities of fingerprinting and photo-taking, he added. Nov 30 (Sunday) is the last day for submission of nominations, which was also the Election Commission's deadline for candidates' enrolment as voters. The EC had previously announced that, in line with new electoral laws, all aspiring candidates would have to enrol by the deadline for submission of nominations. The former prime minister had earlier in the year refused to enlist as a voter while behind bars in special jail. Her rival, Awami League president and ex-PM Sheikh Hasina however enlisted last June and received her national ID card in November. Khaleda on Friday night presided over two back-to-back meetings to finalise the nominations of the four-party alliance - one was the BNP parliamentary board's evaluation meeting and the other an alliance meeting. Until Friday, a total of 1,489 BNP aspirants, including 604 from Dhaka division, were interviewed. See link story for full list of BNP candidates bdnews
