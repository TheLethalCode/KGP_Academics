 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission has decided not to raise the gas prices "for the moment" as Petrobangla proposals on the issue were irrational and illogical, the commission said on Sunday. The apex body of the country's petroleum sector, Petrobangla has proposed a massive 65.92 percent hike in gas prices, read out at the BERC office in the city on Sunday. "There will be no rise at this moment in gas prices. But we will consider a 10-15 percent hike to build a planned 'Gas Development Fund' to ensure fuel security," said commission chairman Golam Rahman. "The nationalised companies will use the fund to explore and production. Currently we have to pay exorbitant prices to the IOCs (international oil companies) that cater to about 50 percent of the country's demands." "Prices will skyrocket if the local companies don't increase their production," he said. The BERC chairman pointed out, "Petrobangla is making profit from gas sales, and hence there is no need to put extra burden on the consumers." BAPEX, the lone Bangladeshi petroleum exploration body, can produce gas for Tk 70 per cubic feet whereas the country has to pay out almost Tk 110 to the IOCs, a Petrobangla official said. BERC in its decision Sunday, said Petrobangla's irrational fixing of prices was tantamount to ambiguous and put into question its transparency. The commission instructed Petrobangla officials to fix an average gas price that could be made effective from July 1 next year. BERC had initally arranged a public hearing following Petrobangla's proposal to the commission in June for the massive 65 percent hike in gas price. Currently, Tk 350 is charged to domestic consumers for a single-burner gas supply and Tk 400 for double-burner, while Tk 133 is charged per unit gas (1,000CFT) to meterised consumers. For power plants, Tk 76.91 is charged per unit, Tk 63.48 is charged to fertiliser factories, Tk 148.13 for industries, Tk 105.59 for captive and small power plants and Tk 233.12 for commercial use. The proposed increase would push commercial users to pay Tk 291.59 against the current price of Tk 233.12 per 1,000 CFT. Meterised households would have to pay Tk 208 from the existing Tk 133. For single-burner households the price would go up to Tk 550 from Tk 350 and for double burners Tk 600 in place of Tk 400, according to the Petrobangla proposal. Gas prices were last raised on Jan 1 2005. A series of abortive proposals to up the prices have been made over the last few years. bdnews
