 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  About 2.4 crore children will get polio vaccine on the 17th National Immunisation Day on Friday, said health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali. During the upcoming couple of Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) rounds on Saturday and January 3, kids aged 5 years and below will be given polio vaccine, those aged 1-5 years will have vitamin-A capsules and children aged 2-5 years will be given deworming pills. Ali launched the day's programme at the EPI building at Mahakhali. "Two million babies are born annually in this country. Hence vaccination programme will be continued until we may eventually declare Bangladesh 'polio-free'." As per health ministry statistics, Bangladesh was declared 'polio-free' when no polio cases were detected after 2002. But in August and Nov. 2006, 18 polio cases were reported again. The health ministry announced that to achieve total coverage under the immunisation drive, intense and continuous searches would be carried out for four days following the administration of each shot of vaccine. The health adviser said in a press conference on Thursday at the ministry after Nigeria, who suffers the maximum incidence of polio cases today, India has 509 patients, which must be reduced or eliminated gradually, before its neighbours may claim any sustainable immunity to polio. About six lakh volunteers will be busy administering the polio vaccine at 1,40,000 vaccination centres throughout the day, Ali said. Raising mass awareness and enhancing health infrastructures are crucial to rendering Bangladesh polio-free, the adviser said. AMM Nasiruddin, health secretary, SM Fayez, director general, health directorate, donor representatives and physicians were present. bd
