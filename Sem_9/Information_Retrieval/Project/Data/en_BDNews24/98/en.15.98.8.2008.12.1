 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has drafted a guideline policy for handing out licenses for an internal VSAT hub. "The licensees of the internal VSAT hub will be able to deliver legal Internet facilities to remote parts of the country," said BTRC chairman Maj Gen (retd) Monjurul Alam. "The whole connectivity can be put under monitor through the VSAT hub. As a result, Internet usage will increase both in the city and in the rural areas," he said. Licenses will be given to those who have already established VSAT facilities, informed BTRC and said that depending on demand, more licenses will be given in the future. The fees for the first year for establishing VSAT including license will be Tk 4 lakh. After this, the yearly fee will be T k2 lakh but no fees will be required for establishing terminals. Initially, the interested organisations will be given license for a 15 years term and after expiry of which, duration of the licenses will be increased by a five-year period. The draft guideline is published at the BTRC website (www.btrc.gov.bd) and, any person or institution can send their opinion about it to dvh@btrc.gov.bd within Dec 24. After assessment of public and other concerned opinions, a final guideline will be published. bd
