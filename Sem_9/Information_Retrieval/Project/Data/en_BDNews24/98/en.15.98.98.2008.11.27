 Dhaka, Nov 27(bdnews24.com)  Farhana Hossain, wife of expelled Jubo League leader Liakat Hossain, has appealed for information on the whereabouts of her husband. "A group of men claiming to be members of RAB grabbed Liakat early Wednesday morning and that has been no news about him since," said Farhana in a press conference at Dhaka Reporter's Unity on Thursday. "Mohammadpur police have been notified," she added. RAB has denied the arrest. Colonel Gulzar Ahmed, additional director general of the elite anticrime force, had told bdnews24.com Wednesday that they had not arrested anybody by the name of Liakat. "My husband is a politician and a freedom fighter. He was among the few who publicly protested the killing of Bangabandhu and, for that reason, was jailed several times," said Farhana. "Jealous of his popularity, people have branded him an extortionist and former state minister for home Lutfuzzaman Babar included his name in the terror list due to political feud," she claimed. The High Court recently granted him bail and if there had been any complaint against him then he would have been arrested after getting bail, she added. Liakat is one of the 23 'top criminals' listed by police during the previous BNP-led government. He was arrested on Oct 1, 2003 and released by a High Court bail order on Sept. 4 this year. Demanding Liakat's freedom, Farhana further said, "If there are any allegations against my husband, then those should be settled in a legal way." She appealed to the concerned authority to clarify her husband's arrest. Liakat's younger sister Parul Begum told bdnews24.com: "After my brother's arrest, we went to Dhanamondi thana to file a complaint. But the police kept us waiting for around 2 hours. Later, the on-duty officer recorded our written statement and told us to leave assuring us that we would be kept informed on the matter." "The police informed us Wednesday night that the scene from where Liakat was taken is situated in Mohammadpur and so, a GD was filed today," she added. bdnews24
