 GAZA, Mon Dec 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Israeli navy turned back a Libyan ship on Monday as it tried to transport humanitarian aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials said. They said the ship, Al-Marwa, sailed instead to a port in neighboring Egypt. It had departed from Libya last Monday, carrying 3,000 tonnes of food, medicine and other aid, Palestinian and Libyan officials said. Israel said there had been no physical confrontation between its naval vessels and the Libyan ship. "They understood that the navy was there and decided to turn around," said Andy David, a Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman. "We have a very clear policy (on the blockade) which is constantly publicized." Imposed to generate political pressure on Gaza's Islamist Hamas leadership, the blockade has been stepped up in recent weeks amid a surge in border clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. But Israel has in the past allowed ships carrying humanitarian goods to dock in Gaza to avoid a public confrontation
