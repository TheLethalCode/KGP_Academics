 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad on Sunday threatened to quit Awami League-led alliance on charges that it did not keep its promise on seats. After two days of inconclusive sessions with AL on sharing of constituencies for the parliamentary elections, Ershad fired the warning shots at a press conference at party's Banani office. He said if necessary they would run for the parliament in consensus with any other "suitable" party. "We had joined it following a deal that ensured us 60 electoral seats and [him] presidency if the alliance goes to power. But the Awami League has announced nominations to its candidates in our proposed seats without any discussion with us," the deposed president said. He, however, denied possibilities of joining BNP-led four-party alliance. "The Awami League's action has frustrated our leaders and activists. So we've asked all our candidates to submit their nominations." "We've have got over 600 candidates in 274 constituencies for Jatiya Party, although many of our candidates did not collect nomination forms considering the seat-sharing with the 'grand alliance'." He said if the AL did not honour the "deal", he would have no alternative but to run the polls independently. The Jatiya Party and the grand alliance had the "deal" prior to the cancelled Jan.-22, 2007 election, he said. Asked whether there was still any possibility of their contesting the polls as a partner of the so-called grand alliance, he answered, "There is no consensus so far but still there is possibility." "The grand alliance never broke up formally, so both the grand alliance and the agreement are still in force," Ershad said. Asked how many seats the AL had offered them, Ershad refused to comment. Jatiya Party leaders did not show up for a scheduled meeting on Sunday, as scheduled, the third consecutive day for negotiations to strike an accord. JP acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud Saturday told reporters that they would hold talks at around 10:30am on Sunday. bdnews24.
