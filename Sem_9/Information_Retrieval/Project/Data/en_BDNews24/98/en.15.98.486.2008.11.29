 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com) - At least 15 have been injured as activists of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed at Jagannath University in the old city on Saturday. The two student bodies, backed by rival political parties BNP and Awami League, engaged in skirmishes on campus and adjacent areas from 11.30am to 1.30pm, spreading fear among the general student body and public. Police charged with truncheons on the troublemakers to disperse them. Proctor of the university Prof Kazi Asad said the situation on the campus and adjacent areas was brought under control and police remained on guard to avoid further untoward incidents. JCD's Jagannath University unit president, ABM Parvez Reza, alleged the BCL men launched the attack on them without any provocation. However, his BCL counterpart Kamrul Islam Ripon denied the allegation, claming JCD instead launched the attack to "destabilise the country's political situation in a bid to foil the upcoming parliamentary election". The injured were sent to clinics for treatment. bdnews24
