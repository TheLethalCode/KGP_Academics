 LONDON, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool went top of the Premier League on Monday although they missed the chance to open a three-point lead after a 0-0 home draw with West Ham United. After Chelsea lost 2-1 to Arsenal on Sunday the stage was set for Rafael Benitez's side to seize the initiative in the title race but they produced a subdued display against a resolute West Ham.

Yossi Benayoun produced the save of the night from West Ham keeper Robert Green with a rising shot from an acute angle.
