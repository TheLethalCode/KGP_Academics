<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A (all times GMT): Inter Milan's Patrick Vieira is a doubt for the Serie A leaders' match against Napoli on Sunday (1400) after missing Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by Panathinaikos in the Champions League and training separately from his team mates this week. The France captain has a problem with his left leg, the club website (www.inter.it) said on Monday. Colombian Ivan Cordoba is expected to return to the starting line-up after a suspension to boost a back-line that is likely to be tested by Napoli's in-form Argentina forward Ezequiel Lavezzi. Midfielder Francesco Montervino said Napoli, in joint third, will have no fear of taking the game to the champions this weekend at their San Siro home. "Napoli have an innate offensive propensity given the (team's low) average age and the technical characteristics of its individual players," he told a news conference. "We play every match certain that nothing is impossible". Uruguayan Marcelo Zalayeta is available after suspension and is being tipped to partner Lavezzi in attack. Second-placed AC Milan, who trail Inter by three points, will be without suspended Brazil playmaker Kaka when they visit Palermo on Sunday (1930). Juventus's injury list remains long ahead of Saturday's home game against third-from-bottom Reggina (1930). Hopes that Cristiano Zanetti could return from a long absence after he trained with the rest of the team this week were dashed on Friday when he was left out of the squad for the trip. Fellow midfielders Christian Poulsen, Hasan Salihamidzic and Tiago are also out, as are defenders Jonathan Zebina and Dario Knezevic, while striker David Trezeguet will not be back from a knee injury until February. Gianluigi Buffon started running again on Thursday as he recovers from a leg injury, the club said on their website (www.juventus.com), but the Italy goalkeeper is not expected to return to first-team action until January. AS Roma's Simone Perrotta has served a one-match ban and will be available for Sunday's home match against Fiorentina (1400) when last season's runners-up will be seeking to continue their return to form after a poor start to the season. But Italy midfielder Alberto Aquilani is set to stay on the sidelines because of a new thigh problem after he missed a month with a muscle injury, the club website (www.asroma.it) said. Fiorentina, whose hopes of reaching the Champions League last 16 were ended by Tuesday's 2-1 defeat by Olympique Lyon, cannot call on suspended defender Gianluca Comotto. Lazio, who share fifth place with Fiorentina, are likely to be without Macedonia striker Goran Pandev at Atalanta on Sunday (1400) because of a thigh strai
