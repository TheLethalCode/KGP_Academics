 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed called for saving the rivers of Dhaka to make the capital city habitable as he launched the celebrations marking 400 years of Dhaka on Friday at the south plaza of Sangsad Bhaban. "The rivers of Dhaka like Buriganga, Dhaleswari, Shitalakshya and Turag are like the veins of the city and they need to be saved to make Dhaka a modern city. He urged the mayor, councillors, city planners and conscious citizens to make collective efforts to protect the dying rivers. He also asked authorities to take effective measures to preserve the heritage of Dhaka including the old buildings and structures like Lalbagh Fort, Ahsan Manzil and Bara Katra. At the time of the introduction of the municipal administrative system in 1864, the city was eight square kilometres in size, but greater Dhaka City is now 815 square kilometres, teh chief adviser said. The chief adviser also introduced commemorative stamps on occasion of the event and there was a fireworks display. Presided over by cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury, local government adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal and cultural affairs secretary Md Sharful Alam also spoke at the programme. The two-day long programme includes rowing competitions, food festival, kite flying festival, exhibition of old cars, marionette shows, establishment of a commemorative monument at the Dhaka Gate, painting exhibition for children and cultural programmes. As there is a difference of opinion among historians about the date on which Dhaka was acknowledged as the capital, with some supporting 1608 while others going for 1610, both the years are being considered. Hence, the three-year long celebration will run through to 2010. Organised by the cultural affairs ministry, the stately inauguration ceremonies were beamed by Bangladesh Television. Various Dhaka-based socio-cultural organisations will be celebrating the event through different colourful programmes until 2010. The main theme of the 400 year celebration, organised by the cultural affairs ministry, is  "Rajdhani Dhakar 400 bochor purtite ahen moji furtite", meaning, "Let's roll, gambol in celebrating capital Dhaka on its 400th year anniversary". Besides, the fabled 53 Dhaka lanes will roll out 53 multicolour processions of their inmates dressed like princes, princesses and clowns. Other programmes include the traditional boat race, foodies' festival centred around bakhar khani, biryiani and other Old City delicacies, kite flying, puppet shows, children's painting competitions and erection of a memorial at Dhaka Gate. During the two-day festival ending Saturday, the National Museum, Ahsan Manjil and Lalbagh Fort will remain open to all visitors free of entrance fees. b
