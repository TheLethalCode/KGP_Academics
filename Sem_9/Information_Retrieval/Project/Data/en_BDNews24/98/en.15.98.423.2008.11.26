 BAGHDAD, Wed Nov 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's parliament was likely to approve on Wednesday a pact that sets a date for US military forces to withdraw, but could make the agreement dependent on a public referendum next year, lawmakers said. The security deal, which would see the last US soldier leave at the end of 2011, more than eight years after the ouster of dictator Saddam Hussein, was due to be put to a vote but continued to be subject to dogged last minute haggling. The apparent agreement to hold a referendum is seen as a concession by Kurdish and Shia blocs to Sunni Arab deputies who have said they would back the security pact if it was put to a nationwide vote. It has already been approved by the cabinet and signed with Washington. If the proposal for a referendum is approved by parliament, the security pact would be passed, said Abdul-Kareem Al-Samaraie, a deputy from the main Sunni group, the Accordance Front, which had demanded the popular vote. "There will be an initial approval of the security pact until we hold the referendum in 2009. It will be valid until then. If the result (of the referendum) is a 'No', it will be canceled," he said. A senior lawmaker from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa party said he had no problem with that and a Kurdish lawmaker, whose group is a partner in Maliki's Shi'ite-led coalition, concurred. A government spokesman said the proposal had not been finalized but appeared to do "no harm." Maliki was probably popular enough after presiding over a sharp drop in violence to ensure approval of the U.S. troop deal in a referendum, said political analyst Kadhim al-Miqdad. KEEN TO SEEN AMERICANS GO On Baghdad's streets, where bodies once piled up overnight as death squads formed by majority Shi'ites battled al Qaeda-affiliated Sunni fighters, some looked forward to the eventual departure of American soldiers. "After five years of occupation, fighting, and instability, Iraq must be put on a steady base that will protect its sovereignty. The pact is the beginning of the end of the occupation," said Imad Hameed. A simple majority vote in favor of the pact had always appeared likely in parliament. But Maliki's government needed a broad consensus to satisfy Iraq's most influential Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Maliki says the pact is Iraq's best hope for restoring its sovereignty whilst avoiding a return to sectarian bloodshed. The deal would give Iraq authority over U.S. troops for the first time, makes U.S. soldiers liable for some crimes committed when they are off-duty and reins in private security firms that have enjoyed a bonanza during the war. The 150,000-odd American troops in Iraq will have to quit the towns by mid-2009, and leave the country by the end of 2011. That will strengthen the hand of Maliki, who will continue to be able to call on U.S. forces to fight violence whilst scoring nationalist points for being the one who ushered the invaders out. Some factions, including Sunnis who dominated Iraq under Saddam, fear Maliki will gain too much power. "This is an important step in restoring sovereignty to Iraq, but the road is still long, mostly because, regardless of Maliki's positions, governmental institutions and the security apparatus remain weak, and stability is fragile," said Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group. The referendum if held would likely be in six months. While lawmakers negotiated, a blast in central Baghdad close to the fortified government and military Green Zone compound killed two people and wounded five. The parliamentary vote had been expected around midday (4 a.m. EST) but was rescheduled to the afternoon
