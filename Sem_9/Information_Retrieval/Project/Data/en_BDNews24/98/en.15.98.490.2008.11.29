<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian commandos killed the last Islamist gunmen holed up at Mumbai's Taj Mahal hotel on Saturday, ending a three-day battle at landmarks across India's financial capital that has killed at least 155 people. "Taj is under our control," Mumbai police chief Hasan Gafoor told Reuters, shortly after the building was raked by heavy gunfire as flames leapt from windows. At least three militants and one trooper were killed after a running gunbattle through a maze of corridors, rooms and halls, the country's commando chief, Jyoti Krishna Dutt, told a news conference. The gunmen had set parts of the hotel ablaze as they played cat and mouse with scores of India's best-trained commandos, known as the Black Cats. "Our operations will continue until we check each and every room and floor," Dutt told a huge crowd of jostling reporters outside the hotel. He said a body seen thrown out of a window at the hotel was that of one of the militants. There was no word on the fate of hostages or any remaining guests who might have been trapped inside their rooms. Sniffer dogs were taken to the iconic 105-year-old hotel and ambulances arrived. Some commandos lined up ready to enter the hotel to sweep through the rooms, while others boarded buses to pull out, looking exhausted. The Taj Mahal was the last battleground after three days of intense fighting in various parts of the city of 18 million. Black streaks of soot stained the grey bricks, white balconies and red-tiled roofs of the hotel's facade, with two of its corner stained glass windows broken. DEATH TOLL Mumbai police inspector Ashok Patil told Reuters at least 155 people had been killed and "we are still counting." Newspapers said the toll was likely to rise as bodies were collected from the luxury Taj and nearby Trident-Oberoi hotels, scene of another siege. India blamed the strike on "elements" from Pakistan, raising tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. Pakistan said the two countries faced a common enemy and it would send a representative of its spy agency to share intelligence. The militants' action has struck at the heart of a city that is the engine room of an economic boom that has made India a favorite emerging market. It is also home to the "Bollywood" film industry, the epitome of glamour in a country still blighted by poverty. An Indian state minister said one of the militants arrested was a Pakistani national and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned of "a cost" if India's neighbors did not take action to stop their territory being used to launch attacks. But Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi struck a conciliatory note and promised full cooperation. "Whoever has done this is neither your friend nor our friend," he told reporters in New Delhi. "We are not responsible for this, nor is it in our interest to get involved in something like this." The attacks were carried out by at least a dozen young men armed with rifles and grenades, some of whom arrived by sea, who fanned out across Mumbai on Wednesday night to attack sites popular with tourists and business executives. Authorities said 18 foreigners were among the 144 killed. At least 283 were wounded. Three Germans, five Americans, one Australian, a Briton, one Canadian, two French, an Israeli, an Italian, a Japanese, a Singaporean and a Thai, were among the dead, according to various governments
