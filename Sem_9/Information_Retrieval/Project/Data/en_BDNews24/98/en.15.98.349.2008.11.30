 Dhaka, November 30 (bdnews24.com) - Some seven BNP "reformists", including the party's former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, have applied to run as independent candidates in the upcoming parliamentary polls. Bhuiyan (Narsingdi-3), the BNP chairperson's adviser ZA Khan (Dhaka-18), former state minister Mosharef Hossain Shahjahan (Bhola-1), former state minister Shah Md Abul Hossain (Barisal-4) and former lawmakers Abdul Alim (Joypurhat-1), Mofiqul Hasan Tripty (Jessore-1) and Mosharraf Hossain Mangur (Barisal-3) submitted nomination papers on Sunday, the last date for submissions. "I've always been with the people of Shivpur and I decided to run the polls independently because I want to be with them. I seek blessings from all," Bhuiyan told reporters after filing his papers with the returning officer at Naringdi-3 (Shivpur) Sunday afternoon. On running for the first time without the sheaf of paddy symbol, he said: "I've always worked for the well-being of Shivpur and its people. The people here have always voted me to parliament to voice their rights. I trust them wholeheartedly, because Shivpur is what my life is made up of and is my sole destination." Reluctant to comment on not receiving a BNP ticket this time, the 'pro-reform' Bhuiyan said, "The people of Shivpur will answer that question." The nation wants polls, and stability will be achieved if the elections are held, he commented. "Creating any more confusion over the polls would not be wise. We have to take the nation forward through elections," said Bhuiyan, expressing the hope that they would be held as scheduled on Dec 29. Many of BNP's so-called 'reformists' have been left off the party ticket for the upcoming general elections, leaving the old-guard "at ease", said party insiders. Among the one time 'pro-reform faction' who managed a slot in the list of nominees are such party stalwarts as former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, ex-minister Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed and former parliamentary defence committee chairman Lt Gen (retd) Mahbubur Rahman. Those who were denied nominations include former education minister Osman Faruque, former state ministers Shah Mohammad Abul Hossain, Prof Rezaul Karim and Mosharef Hossain Shahjahan, former whip Rezaul Bari Deena, and former MPs Abdul Alim, Nazir Hossain, Ataur Rahman Angur, Mosharraf Hossain Mangur, Fazlul Azim, SA Sultan Titu, Dr Ziaul Huq Molla, Masud Arun, Abdul Ghani, GM Mohammad Siraj, Kazi Rafiqul Islam and Sarder Sakhawat Hossain Bakul. Meanwhile, ZA Khan, BNP assistant office secretary Emran Saleh Prince and party officials AHM Mofazzal Karim, MA Hakim and Dr Mushfiqur Rahman, who were also labelled reformists, did not seek party nominations. Former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, former joint secretary Ashraf Hossain and former office secretary Mofiqul Hasan Tripty  all 'pro-reform' party veterans sacked from their party posts last year  remain black-listed. Bhuiyan ran for parliament in 1973 as a National Awami Party (Bhashani) candidate under the paddy symbol, which later was taken by BNP as its symbol. He later held office for 11 years as the secretary general of BNP, until he was sacked last year from the post by party chief Khaleda Zia. The "pro-reform" party veteran had made a 21-point reform proposal in June 2007 for wider democratic practices within the party, following the promulgation of the state of emergency. This caused a split within the party, and on Sep. 3 last year Khaleda, just prior to her arrest, replaced Bhuiyan with Khandaker Delwar Hossain as BNP secretary general. bdnews
