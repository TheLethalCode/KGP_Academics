 BEIJING, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Thursday blamed French President Nicolas Sarkozy's planned meeting with the Dalai Lama for pulling out of a China-EU summit which may have forged a joint response to the global economic crisis. France confirmed Sarkozy would meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, whom China brands a separatist, at a Dec. 6 ceremony in Poland to mark the 25th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize to former Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. China earlier this month warned Sarkozy, whose country holds the rotating presidency, that the European Union risked losing "hard-won" gains in ties with Beijing if he met the Dalai Lama. The decision could make it harder for the EU and China to cooperate on a host of pressing global issues and spill over into an often tricky bilateral trade relationship. At a meeting between Asian and EU leaders in Beijing last month the EU side backed a greater say for China in global financial bodies but urged China to use its clout to help to resolve the global economic crisis. "To maintain good relations with France and the European Union, China has told France time and again to properly handle the Tibet issue so as to create necessary conditions for the China-EU summit," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement posted on the ministry's website (www.fmprc.gov.cn). "Regrettably, the French side has not actively responded to (these) efforts, so that the summit cannot be held in a good atmosphere, nor achieve its expected goals. Under such circumstances, China has no choice but to postpone the summit." Trade disputes between Brussels and Beijing have been on the rise as the EU trade deficit with China has ballooned, hitting 160 billion euros ($207.4 billion) last year. This month Brussels imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese-made candles and non-alloy steel products and added tariffs to imports of some citrus fruits products. China routinely denies it breaks trade rules and says Europe resorts to protectionism against its low-cost advantage. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in the mountainous region, occupied by Chinese troops from 1950. China calls him a "splittist", but the Dalai Lama says he is merely seeking autonomy. A senior European diplomat in Beijing said Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, at a dinner with former Commission President Romano Prodi on Tuesday, passed on the message that China wanted to remain on good terms with Europe despite the cancellation. "They have insisted that they are still very attached to the partnership with the EU and that all relations will continue," the diplomat said. He said China took umbrage not at the meeting itself but the fact that Sarkozy had announced it publicly. They had been "explicit and open" on that point, he said. "They considered an announcement of this meeting was not a fruitful gesture," he said. The diplomat said Beijing was deaf to entreaties that Sarkozy had made a point of not receiving the Dalai Lama during his recent visit to France and that the French president could hardly avoid the Tibetan at Walesa's festival. By penalising the EU, not just France, China was administering collective punishment, the diplomat added, saying France in no way was signaling support for Tibetan independence. The diplomat said the EU had been told that the new "permanent dialogue" with the bloc would continue. The Free Tibet group said the cancellation showed the summit was the "latest victim of China's strong-arm Tibet diplomacy". "By postponing the EU Summit, China has highlighted its deep insecurity over its deteriorating human rights record in Tibet as well as its ongoing determination to avoid being held accountable for such abuses," spokesperson Matt Whitticase, said
