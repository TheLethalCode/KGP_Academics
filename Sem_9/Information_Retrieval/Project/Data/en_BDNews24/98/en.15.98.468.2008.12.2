 WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House on Monday said the investigation into the India attacks was continuing but it had heard nothing to suggest that Pakistan's government was involved. "I've heard nothing that says that the Pakistani government was involved," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. She said Pakistani officials have pledged to work with the Indian government to find out who was behind the attack. "We have been encouraged by the statements by the Pakistanis that they are committed to following this wherever it leads. We would expect nothing less of them on this instance," she said. She added that the United States would hold Pakistan to its commitment to cooperate with the investigation. At President George W. Bush's request, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will travel to New Delhi on Wednesday to show support for India as it tries to determine the motives for the attacks which killed 183 people and injured scores more. Perino declined to comment on assertions by Indian investigators that the gunmen responsible for the attacks trained in Pakistan for months but she said that the United States wanted to help reduce tensions between the two countries. She also declined comment when asked whether Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) security agency could have played a role. Rice spoke to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Bush's national security adviser Stephen Hadley talked to his Pakistani counterpart and "both said they would continue to work with the Indian government to try to find out where this started," Perino said
