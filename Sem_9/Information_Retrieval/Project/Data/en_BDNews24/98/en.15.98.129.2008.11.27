 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Some 9 million people in Asia have been infected with HIV over the last 20 years, while full-blown AIDS has claimed 3.8 million lives including 330,000 children over the period, said a report out Wednesday. The report by the Commission on AIDS in Asia, presented at the ICDDR,B, mentions that HIV was first detected in Asia 20 years back. Shame and taboo surrounding AIDS, HIV and other sexually-transmitted diseases in Asia, along with disparities among men and women affected, are major obstacles to helping sufferers in the region. According to UNAIDS estimates, there are about 11,000 people living with HIV in Bangladesh, though only 1,207 cases were reported up to the end of 2007. However, AIDS awareness and prevention programmes among sex-workers in Bangladesh have been highlighted as among the region's 'best practices' by UNAIDS. The Commission's report, meanwhile, titled 'Redefining AIDS in Asia' says males are mainly responsible for spreading AIDS. "Unsafe commercial sex, drug intake through needles and homosexual intercourse between men are the main attributable factors," it pointed out. "Spread of the disease through women in Asia is more unlikely since women in this region usually don't have sex with more than one man, but they could very well infect the foetus in the womb," it said. Additional health secretary Abul Kalam Azad was present at the report presentation programme as chief guest. He asked all concerned to work together at the public and the private levels to fight the disease and the secrecy that surrounds it. UNAIDS official Geeta Sithee presented the abstract of the report, while member of the Commission on AIDS in Asia Mahmuda Islam, Population Council Bangladesh representative Obaidur Rob and UNAIDS Bangladesh coordinator Dan Odallo also spoke among others. bdnews
