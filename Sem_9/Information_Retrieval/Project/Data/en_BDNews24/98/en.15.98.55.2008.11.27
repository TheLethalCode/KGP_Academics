 MILAN, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan stumbled into the last 16 of the Champions League despite suffering a 1-0 home defeat by Panathinaikos in Group B on Wednesday. Anorthosis Famagusta's draw with Werder Bremen meant the Italian champions go through because the Cypriots visit Panathinaikos in the last round of matches and both cannot finish above Inter. Jose Sarriegi tapped in on 69 minutes after goalkeeper Julio Cesar could only parry Giannis Goumas's towering header from a corner. Stuttering Serie A leaders Inter have only played well in one Champions League match this term, the 2-0 win at Panathinaikos in the opening group game. Jose Mourinho's side, on eight points, must beat eliminated Werder in Bremen next month to ensure top spot in the group while the Greeks have seven and need a point against Anorthosis to progress. Inter produced one of their best performances of the season on Saturday when they beat Juventus 1-0 in Serie A but they returned to recent form against Panathinaikos, struggling to break down a solid defence. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the best chance of the first half when he awkwardly lifted the ball over the bar while strike partner Adriano hit the post but was flagged offside following a neat move from the hosts. Inter's Luis Figo, given a surprise start having barely played this season because of injury, managed some clever touches and shot wide from distance. Esteban Cambiasso had a shot cleared off the line but Panathinaikos had their moments and were especially dangerous from corners. Simao headed over after Inter failed to clear their lines and later went close with a powerful drive
