 Centurion, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh bowlers failed to keep up the momentum following a record sixth wicket partnership by South Africa that snatched the match from the visitors at the close of the second day's play of the second and final Test on Thursday. The Proteas reached 357 for five at sumps, taking a 107-run leads in the first innings, thanks to unbeaten centuries from Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher at SuperSport Park in Centurion. Boucher and Prince together put on 223 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket, eclipsing the previous best of 200 set by Graem Pollock and HR Lance against Australia in Durban in 1969-70. Prince, survived twice from bold lbw calls by Mahbubul Alam and Shakib Al Hasan in the early stage of his innings, struck his 10th Test hundred to make 115 not out that included 16 fours and one six in 160 balls. Boucher struck Shahadat Hossain for four through the thirdman to bring up his fifth Test hundred and remained unbeaten on 102 off 162 balls studded with 14 fours. They together defied the Bangladesh attack to keep them at bay after left-arm spinner Shakib struck trice dismissing Jacques Kallis (24), overnight batsman Hashim Amla (71) and AB de Villiers (duck) to reduce the hosts to 134 for five. Shakib uprooted Kallis' off stumps with a straight delivery before had Amla caught at short cover by Imrul Kayes. Then, new batsman Villiers went down the tract only to see the stumps broken by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim. Bangladesh pace trio started with fine line and length in the first hour of the day to keep overnight batsmen Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla tight before paceman Mahbubul picked up the big wicket of Smith (27) before the first drinks break. Smith went across to miss the line and got hit in front as Mahbubul swung the ball superbly to finally get the reward. South Africa could manage 77 for the loss of Smith in the first session, but they gradually improved their run to make 95 runs in the second session with the losses of three wickets. The hosts were brilliant in the final session adding 165 runs facing no further damage. The hosts, having resumed the day on 20 for one, added 337 for four wickets to finish at 357 for five after Bangladesh made 250 all out in the first innings. bd
