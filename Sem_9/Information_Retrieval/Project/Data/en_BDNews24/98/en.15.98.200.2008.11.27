<TEXT>
 CUTTACK, India, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Virender Sehwag smashed 91 to guide India to a six-wicket win over England with more than six overs to spare in the fifth one-dayer on Wednesday to give the hosts a 5-0 lead in the seven-match series. Sehwag missed out on his 10th one-day hundred but added 136 with fellow opener Sachin Tendulkar (50) as India chased down England's 270 for four. Skipper Kevin Pietersen compiled 111 not out, his seventh one-day hundred, to steer England to a solid total after being asked to bat first. England's bowlers removed Tendulkar, in-form Yuvraj Singh (6) and Sehwag in the space of 20 runs, the last two off successive deliveries, before the hosts recovered to reach 273 for four in 43.4 overs. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit 50 and Suresh Raina was 53 not out, adding 94 for the fourth wicket, to ensure the comfortable win. Pietersen shared an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 112 with Owais Shah (66 not out) after adding 89 for the third with Paul Collingwood (40) as he led England's bid to stem the slide. "We've been outplayed again by Viru," Pietersen said. "Viru and Sachin at the top of the order played great knocks. "I said we wanted to keep the series competitive. "It was today, (but) we just have to keep it as competitive as possible." Sehwag was named man of the match for the second game in a row. EXPLOSIVE SEHWAG The explosive Sehwag struck his fourth fifty of the series in a 73-ball effort, scoring 15 fours and a six while evening dew made it difficult for the England bowlers to grip the ball in the second half of the day-night game. "I'm in good form, so wanted to make the most of it," Sehwag said. "I was unlucky I couldn't get 100, but I'm happy. I knew the bowling attack ..., I was ready." Sehwag revealed his awesome form again to make amends for Tendulkar, who initially struggled to find his timing. Sehwag smashed off-spinner Graeme Swann for three fours and a six off consecutive deliveries to take 21 runs off his first over before reaching his 33rd fifty. Tendulkar scored his 90th one-day fifty before fast bowler Steve Harmison bowled him as he shaped for a big heave against a pitched-up delivery which nipped back. England then struck twice in successive deliveries. Seamer Ravi Bopara had Yuvraj, who hit hundreds in the first two games, caught and bowled for six runs. Paceman Stuart Broad then trapped Sehwag leg before off the first delivery of the next over. Television replays suggested it would have missed leg stump. Dhoni and Raina rotated the strike initially before taking control. Broad walked off the field with an apparent foot injury after attempting to stop a Dhoni shot on the follow through. Left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan removed openers Alastair Cook (11), who replaced Ian Bell at the top of the order, as well as Ravi Bopara (24) in the England innings. Pietersen and Shah rallied England after Collingwood and all rounder Andrew Flintoff (0) fell in successive overs in the space of one run, reducing the total to 158 for four. Pietersen hit 10 fours from 128 balls, lofting Harbhajan Singh over long-on for six to reach 3,000 one-day international runs before going on to complete his hundred. Shah followed his 48-ball 72 in the previous game with a fluent 57-ball effort studded with nine fours. The sixth one-dayer will be played in Guwahati on Saturday
