 BERLIN, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hertha Berlin climbed into second place in the Bundesliga after Marko Pantelic struck four minutes from time to earn a 2-1 win over Cologne on Friday. Andriy Voronin set Gojko Kacar up with a clever pass to put the home team ahead midway through the opening half. A lapse in concentration allowed Cologne to equalise at the end of the first period when Milivoje Novakovic strolled in front of two defenders to head in a cross from the left. Hertha were struggling to create chances but Serb striker Pantelic nodded in at the near post from a late corner to seal victory on a freezing night at the Olympiastadion. A fourth successive league win gave Hertha 30 points from 15 matches, two points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich and one behind leaders Hoffenheim, who all have a game in hand. Leverkusen host Bayern on Saturday while Hoffenheim are at home to Arminia Bielefeld. Cologne remain 10th on 19 point
