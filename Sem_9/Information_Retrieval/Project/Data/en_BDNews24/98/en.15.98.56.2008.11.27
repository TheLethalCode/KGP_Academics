 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  Home secretary Abdul Karim and chief of police Noor Mohammad dispelled possibility of any militant attack in Bangladesh, after more than a hundred people were killed and India left reeling as the deadly and tragic incidents in Mumbai unfolded Wednesday night. However, they said they had asked all foreign organisations and international hotels to take extra security measures as a precaution. At this time, director general of RAB, Hassan Mahmud Khondokar, representative of BDR, Dhaka city police commissioner Nayeem Ahmed and other officials were present. "Bangladesh has no reason to be alarmed by the tragic incident in India because the government here is vigilant about preventing any militant activity," said the home secretary. He added, nevertheless: "The government has taken a coordinated plan to save the country from radical and extremist attacks." Though there is no fear in Bangladesh, precautionary measures will be taken, he said. "Law enforcing agencies and Bangladesh Rifles have also been alerted," said the home secretary. "Though we do not expect any such event, the diplomatic community has been asked to take additional security measures," said Noor Mohamad, the chief of police. "At any cost, the law and order situation in Bangladesh will be maintained." bdnews24
