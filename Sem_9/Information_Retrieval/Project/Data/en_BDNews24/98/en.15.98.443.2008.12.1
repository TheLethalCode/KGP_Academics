<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will start her election campaign after performing Ziarat at the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal (R) at Sylhet on Dec 12 or 13. She expressed the hope that the government would lift the state of emergency soon to facilitate the electoral campaign in a free atmosphere. "People cannot exercise their free right to vote under emergency," said the former prime minister. Speaking to reporters at her Gulshan office in the city on Sunday, the BNP chief thanked the newsmen "for taking pains over three consecutive days in collecting information about party nominations." The BNP election manifesto would be announced in a few days, she said pointing out: "There are challenges that must be faced boldly; whatever party is voted to power will have to shoulder the challenges." Asked about the crucial seat-sharing issue with their four-party ally Jamaat-e-Islami, she said, "We don't have any big issue that is unresolved." "I hope, as before during the elections, that I'll be able to start campaigning after performing Ziarat at the holy shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal (R) on Dec 12 or 13," said Khaleda. She said time was too short to travel all over the country. In reply to a question Khaleda sounded hopeful about winning the upcoming polls. "We've been working for the people and the people have supported us in return." The BNP chairperson was flanked by vice president Sarwari Rahman and information cell chief Maruf Kamal Khan Sohel. bdnew
