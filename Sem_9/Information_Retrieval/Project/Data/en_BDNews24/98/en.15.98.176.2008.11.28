 NEW DELHI, Nov 28(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel's ambassador to India said on Friday he believed six or more Israeli nationals were still being held hostage by gunmen at a Jewish centre in Mumbai. "We are estimating, and it's pretty much an educated guess, somewhere around six, maybe a little bit more, but I don't have complete information on that," Mark Sofer told Times Now television. "A couple of days ago an Indian caregiver managed to escape with a tiny baby belonging to the rabbi in Chabad House, but the rabbi and his wife are still inside." The Israeli rescue service Zaka, an ultra-Orthodox organisation, earlier identified two of the hostages as Rabbi Gabriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka, who ran a cafe and a synagogue for the Chabad Lubavitch religious group. Sofer said there had been also some Israelis trapped in two luxury hotels where Islamist gunmen have been besieged by Indian commandos. "To the best of our knowledge all of them are now out." Israel's foreign ministry said 13 Israelis were still unaccounted for in Mumbai, adding it estimated that about six additional people were being held hostage in Chabad House.
