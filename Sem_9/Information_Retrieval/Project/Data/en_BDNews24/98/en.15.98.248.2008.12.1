 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The general election "will not be held under emergency rule", stated the chief election commissioner on Monday. "The upcoming general election will not be held under the state of emergency. We hope it will be withdrawn in proper time," ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters after a meeting with president Iajuddin Ahmad at Bangabhaban. "Lifting of emergency is a much-talked-about issue with all political parties agreeing it should go," he said. Huda said the Election Commission had in recent weeks suggested to the chief adviser that the emergency be lifted for polls, and the interim government head had promised that it would be withdrawn "in due time". The CEC and two election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hossain met the president in the afternoon to inform him of the commission's preparations ahead of the national vote scheduled for Dec. 29. Huda said they briefed Iajuddin on the latest developments as the deadline for submission of nominations ended on Sunday. They told the president that a total of 2,460 candidates had filed nominationsor at least eight hopefuls for each of the 300 parliamentary seats up for grabs. Huda stressed: "If any one is ineligible for candidacy, his nomination papers will be scrapped." EC officials say the Dhaka-8 seat was so far the most sought after, with 23 hopefuls filing. Mymensingh-1, Tangail-1, Kishoreganj-4 and -6, Bagerhat-4, Thakurgaon-2, Pabna-2 and Gopalganj-2 have received the least nominations of three each. bdnews24.c
