 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)- Former state minister Amanullah Aman was released on bail on Thursday, said a prisons official. Deputy inspector general of prisons, Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "Aman was released from guard at the prison ward in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujiib Medical University at around 7:30pm." The BNP leader had been undergoing treatment in the hospital since July 27. Joint forces had arrested him on Feb 3, 2007. The High Court granted Aman bail on Wednesday on appeal against a graft case in which he had been sentenced to seven years by the trial court. Aman can now come out as a free man, said his lawyer. The former state minister for labour had earlier secured High Court bail in a case of concealing illegal wealth from the Anticorruption Commission, for which he was sentenced to 13 years. bdnew
