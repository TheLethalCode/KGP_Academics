<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The antigraft drive will hinge on the relations between the new elected government and the Anticorruption Commission, the country's top graftbuster said on Friday. "[God willing], we will be able to carry on with our work under the next elected government," ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said. The time has not come to tell if the antigraft drive has been successful, he said after inaugurating an anticorruption cartoon exhibition organised at the Drik Gallery in Dhanmondi. Transparency International, Bangladesh organised the show that put on display the winning cartoons before the launch. The chairman handed out prizes among the winners of the competition. The exhibition will run through to Dec. 4. Responding to a question as to why corrupt people were coming out one by one, the chairman said, "Our law remains the same and we will use them to deal with this." "Cartoon reflects the truth and therefore we trust them." "Our anticorruption drive needs to be spread all over the country and we need the whole nation to participate," he observed. Presided over by former adviser Sultana Kamal, artist Mostafa Monwar and executive director of TIB Dr. Iftekharuzzaman also spoke at the programme. "Our politicians fear cartoons because it tells the truth without literally saying anything," said Mostafa Monwar. Cartoonists often have to lose their jobs and end up in jail for telling the truth, he added. "It will take some time to get any concrete result on this," observed Sultana Kamal, and added by reminding that, it is the duty of all citizens to prevent corruption. "To prevent corruption, a social revolution has to take place, and to that end, the TIB has taken several programmes to create public awareness," said Dr Iftekharuzzaman "Efforts are underway to involve the young generation." This is the third time TIB has organised a cartoon competition to sensitise the public against corruption where 791 cartoons of 421 cartoonists were submitted. In groups Ka and Kha, seven persons were awarded and 52 others given special nomination awards, said the TIB executive director. To mark the Anticorruption Day on Dec. 9, the TIB has taken up a series of programmes including an anticorruption rally to be taken out from the parliament complex on Dec. 4 and cultural shows on Dec. 4 and 5 at Dhanmondi Rabindra Sarobar. bd
