<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 27(bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Thursday stressed that her party welcomes the election despite repeated changes in the schedule "allowing chances for conspiracies". "The nomination process of those for whom such changes were made has not yet started, whereas we have already completed the process," she pointed out. The AL president was exchanging views with leaders of the Sammilita Sangskritik Jote (Combined Cultural Alliance) in the evening at her Dhanmondi political office. Among those who were present were dramatist and cultural organiser Nasir Uddin Yusuf, actor Ali Zaker and TV personality Tarana Halim. Leaders of the cultural alliance asked the AL chief to "evaluate criticism in a constructive way" if her party goes to power. In reply, Sheikh Hasina said: "Criticism is good but it should not be the weapon in the hands of the enemy." The cultural activists also placed a host of demands to the AL president, including increased allocation for the cultural ministry, autonomy for radio and TV, annual grants to Shilpakala Academy at the district level, making the national anthem compulsory in every school and also making the subject of the liberation war compulsory. When the subject of the recent removal of the Baul sculpture on Airport Roas arose, Hasina said, "There are sculptures in different Muslim countries." She went on to promise: "If elected to power, we will reduce the prices of essentials. Our first tasks in power will be to cut down the prices of rice, lentils, edible oil and other essentials. We have to create a food security chain and augment production." Earlier in the day, a three-member European Union team led by its chief observer Alexander Graf Lambsdorff met with the AL chief at her Sudha Sadan home. Emerging from the meeting Lambsdorff told reporters that they had a successful meeting. They explained how the EU would observe the election, he said. AL election committee co-chairman HT Imam told reporters after the meeting that many unwanted incidents occurred during announcement of election results. "We have requested the European Union to be watchful so that no discrimination takes place," he said. Replying to a query, Imam said: "It is not right that the Election Commission will accept all demands of one party. We have to face many problems due to the postponement of election." bdnews24.com/sum/arb/
