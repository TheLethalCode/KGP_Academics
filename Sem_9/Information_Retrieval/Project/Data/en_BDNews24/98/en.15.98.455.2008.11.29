 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka University Alumni Association will honour barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq and professor Rehman Sobhan for their contributions in society. The declaration was made at the Alumni get-together, presided over by its president Syed Monzur A Elahi on Friday at the Nawab Ali Senate building of the university. "Every sector faces hindrances during extension of operation," said special guest former caretaker government chief Justice Habibur Rahman. "But despite these hurdles, everyone has to move forward." Dhaka University vice-chancellor professor SMA Fayez said the alumni association had played an important role in the development of the university. "It is carrying its duty properly and will hopefully do so in the future." "The activities of the alumni association will not be limited to organising get-togethers," said Monzur Elahi. From next year it would grant scholarships, provide free computer lessons to the children of the staff and involve in creative pursuits, he added. Former teachers of the university and officials of different banks were also present at the programme. b
