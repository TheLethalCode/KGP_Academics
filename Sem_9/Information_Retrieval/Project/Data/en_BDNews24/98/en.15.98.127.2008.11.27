 MUMBAI, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The last two matches of the India v England one-day series have been called off because of security fears following Wednesday's militant attacks in Mumbai, an Indian board spokesman said on Thursday. "The final two one-day internationals are off," Devendra Prabhudesai said. The future of next month's two-test series is yet to be decided. "We expect they will come to play the test series," Indian board secretary N. Srinivasan told reporters in Bhubaneswar. An England Cricket Board (ECB) statement said the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had agreed to its request to postpone the remaining two one-dayers. The fifth match was due to be played in Guwahati on Saturday and the final game on Dec 2. The tourists were trailing 5-0. The England team will not travel to Guwahati on Thursday as scheduled and will remain in Bhubaneswar overnight pending further discussions with the BCCI. A group of militants armed with automatic weapons and grenades burst into luxury hotels, a hospital and a railway station late on Wednesday and fired indiscriminately, killing more than a hundred people. The second test is scheduled to be held in Mumbai from Dec. 19. "The safety and security of the England team is of the utmost importance to ECB," ECB managing director Hugh Morris said. "We have reviewed all our security arrangements in the light of these attacks and will be taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the team. "I have also briefed the England players and management on the situation as well as liaising closely with the ECB chairman and chief executive and the players' representatives." Australia's tour of India in September also started in controversial circumstances after a series of bombs in New Delhi killed at least 20 people and injured 90. The latest attacks have raised doubts over the Indian board's lucrative Twenty20 Champions League next month which features foreign teams. "It will be evaluated," Srinivasan said
