 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The National Human Rights Commission started operation on Monday, a member of the three-strong body said. The government appointed Justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury as the chairman and former Fair Election Monitoring Alliance chair Munira Khan and the University of Dhaka professor Niru Kumar Chakma as members to the commission on Nov. 19. "Before the official launch we have met unofficially three times. As per the human rights act we are appointed here for three years," Chakma said to bdnews24.com in the evening. He said in Monday's first official meeting, they decided to ask the government for a permanent office, manpower and logistics. The government announced the institution of the commission on Sept. 1, with an office in the capital's Hare Road after the interim cabinet approved the National Human Rights Commission Ordinance 2007 on Dec. 9 last year. A six-member search committee handpicked three members for the president to approve. The commission will investigate any allegation against government agencies of violation or instigation to violate human rights, monitor human rights in prisons, correction centres or other forms of custody, and report to the government with recommendations. It will also make recommendations on ratification or signing of international human rights documents, dispose of accusations through mediation or compromise following investigation. The commission will not be entitled to deal with any cases pending trial in court or matters being considered by any ombudsman. Nor will it deal with the actions of in-service government employees that can be tried under the Administrative Tribunal Act 1980. bdnews
