 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  More research on biotechnology would spur economic growth in Bangladesh, experts said at a news conference on Sunday. The media conference, co-organised by private BRAC University and the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), was held ahead of an international symposium on 'Regulatory and Safety Issues in Commercialization of Biotechnology Research in Developing Countries' on Dec. 2-4. BRAC University professor Naiyyum Choudhury told the conference that the initiative came as a part of their efforts to promote biotechnology research in Bangladesh. "In June 2006 we had a daylong international conference on commercialisation and research of biotechnology in Bangladesh." The following year, university organised another three-day conference on promotion of biotechnology in Bangladesh, he added. Choudhury said this year's convention would look into the safety and ethical issues of biotechnology researches. ICGEB advisory board's member professor Ahmed Abdulllah Azad said biotechnology researches in agriculture, medicine and livestock in Bangladesh would pace the countries economic growth. Stressing on the need of policies and strategies for commercialisation, he said, "Polices are formulated in this country but it is very hard to implement them." Both the experts blamed bureaucratic red-tape as the major obstacle to development in biotechnological research in Bangladesh. Experts, joining from at least eight countries, would present papers on different topics such as technology transfer, intellectual property rights, clinical and filed trials, safety and ethical issues, and regulatory affairs on biotechnology research, reads a statement released by university.
