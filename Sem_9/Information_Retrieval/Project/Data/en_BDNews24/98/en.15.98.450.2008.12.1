 NEW DELHI, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) urged England on Sunday to play next month's test series in India if player safety concerns are addressed in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. "If safety and security allow then I would urge the England test tour of India to go ahead and if it does so then representatives of the ICC will be there to show solidarity with the competing teams," chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement.

Offering condolences to the Mumbai people, Lorgat said: "Sadly, terrorism appears increasingly to be a fact of life that we must endure. "What we as a cricket family must do is to try, wherever possible, to rise above it and show that those who wish to perpetrate evil cannot win." The ICC chief executive committee will discuss security challenges for the game when it meets in Cape Town next week. The ruling body already has major security concerns in Pakistan and postponed the September Champions Trophy until late next year after a possible boycott by five of the eight team
