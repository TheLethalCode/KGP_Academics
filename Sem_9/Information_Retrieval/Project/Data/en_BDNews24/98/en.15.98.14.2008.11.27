<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea proposed on Thursday direct talks with North Korea on its decision to expel South Koreans from a joint industrial enclave in the North and clamp down on crossings of their heavily armed border. North Korea said this week it would be expelling South Korean officials and some business managers from the park in North Korean border city of Kaesong on December 1 in anger at South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's tough line toward Pyongyang. "I propose government officials from the South and the North discuss the measures under the spirit of resolving issues through dialogue and negotiations," Unification Minister Kim Ha-joon said in a speech at an event promoting the sale of Kaesong-made goods. Six South Korean government officials based at the industrial park about 70 km (45 miles) northwest of Seoul will be pulling out on Friday and the two Koreas are bargaining over how many of the 1,600 South Korean businessmen stationed there will remain to run the nearly 90 factories. Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Ho-nyeon said at a news briefing that Seoul expected the North to respond to the minister's proposal. "The sooner the better." Analysts say the North may be trying to pressure conservative Lee to free up the billions of dollars in aid his left-leaning predecessor had promised Pyongyang, while it seeks aid on a separate front through nuclear talks expected resume on December 8. North Korea has called Lee, who took office in February, a "traitor to the nation" for his decision to link Seoul's aid to progress his impoverished neighbor makes in ending its nuclear arms program, the subject of six-party talks involving the two Koreas, Japan, Russia, the United States and China
