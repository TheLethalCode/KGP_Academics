<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Saikat Ali struck a century as bottom-placed Sylhet dominated the opening day of the seventh round four-dayers of National Cricket League over leaders Barisal at Sylhet Divisional Stadium on Monday. Hosts Sylhet were 279 for six at stumps with Golam Rahman and Taposh Ghosh batting on 70 and 16. At Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, pacer Delwar Hossain claimed five scalps to restrict hosts Dhaka to 142 all out and then visitors Rajshahi reached 91 for two at the close of the first day's play. Away at Birsreshthha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna, hosts Khulna were in a good position with 267 for six at stumps against visitors Chittagong. Sylhet vs Barisal After opting to bat first, Sylhet lost opener Imtiaz Hossain for nine, but Saikat and one-down Mithun repaired the damage before being separated. Mithun (24) and Kamrul Islam (duck) returned to the dressing room in the space of one run as Tariqul Islam and Saju Datta removed them respectively. However, Saikat and Golam Rahman added 86 runs to the fifth wicket before Saikat fell to Abul Bashar, but not before striking a century. Saikat hammered 111 off 203 balls studded with 16 fours and one six. Dhaka vs Rajshahi After being put in to bat first, Dhaka lost their wickets in regular intervals as Rajshahi pacer Delwar (5/45) and Saiful Islam (2/31) rattled the top order while Suhrawardi Shuvo (2/13) cleaned up the tail. Mahmudullah Riad topscored with 38 followed by Nadif Chowdhury on 24 and opener Javed Omar on 21. Arafat Salahuddina and Marshal Ayub struck identical 14. In reply, Rajshahi were trailing by 51 runs to reach 91 for two in the first innings as opener Jahurul Islam struck an unbeaten 56 off 118 balls with the help of eight boundaries. Khulna vs Chittagong After deciding to bat first against Chittagong, Khulna collapsed to 76 for four in the face of fierce spell from pacer Tareq Aziz Khan, but Khulna fought back riding on some brilliant knocks from the middle order batsmen. Raihan Anas and Nahidul Haq struck half centuries as Khulna recovered from the slump to reach 183 before Nahidul fell to Rezaul Karim for 67 off 136 balls that included nine fours and one six. Raihan soon followed Nahidul to become the fourth victim of Tareq, leaving the side at 206 for six. Raihan played a 184-ball 63 hitting nine fours. Mohammad Selim (20) and Ziaur Rahman (43) will resume the second day Tuesday. bd
