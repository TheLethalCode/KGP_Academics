 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)  The readymade garment exporters have dismissed the World Bank predictions that the global economic meltdown would leave the economy, export earnings and remittance inflow in a tailspin this fiscal year. "We reject the comments. The WB and IMF prescriptions don't carry solutions for the country," the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters' Association (BGMEA) president, Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, said on Thursday. "Despite the global predicament the country's readymade garment sector has enjoyed a 44.66 percent growth in the Q1 (July-Sept) this year," Parvez said at a press conference at the BGMEA office in the city. He pointed out a new GSP regime (generalised system of preferences), with 30 percent value addition, will take effect in Europe from January next year. "This will create bigger markets in the region." "The Christmas orders from Europe have been delayed, not cancelled The buyers have already started negotiating with us." The BGMEA chief questioned the WB or IMF dictating the country's economic policies and referred to the previous prescription on the Chittagong port customs automation where the government spent Tk300 crore for nothing. Bankers, exporters and investors would feel nervous at the WB comments, Pervez pointed out. He advised the government to build the infrastructures on a build-own-transfer basis. "We must stop begging and rely on our own resources," the BGMEA president said suggesting that the global crisis could leave slight impact on the commodity prices for which the government had to make a little downward adjustment. "Since prices in the world markets are falling our currency could be devalued six to seven percent." He also said he had no information on slide in the garment export the WB referred to. The bank on Wednesday predicted tough times for the incoming government with Bangladesh's economy shrinking in the wake of the ongoing global crisis, though the finance adviser rejected any forecast of a slowdown in GDP growth. "The negative impact of the global financial crisis will affect Bangladesh's economy in the near future," said the Dhaka bureau's chief economist Vinaya Swaroop at a workshop at the Bank's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar office. He said export earnings and remittances are likely to shrink which, in turn, will mean a decline in GDP growth from 5.4 percent to 4.8 percent. The GDP growth rate has been targeted at 6.5 percent for the current fiscal year. In 2007-08 it was 6.2 percent. The WB economist also said it was estimated that one million people would go abroad for work this year, but only two lakh people had found overseas work in the first three months (July-September) of the current fiscal year. The finance adviser, AB Mirza Azizul Islam, on Tuesday called for "greater utilisation of internal resources" to cushion the impact of the global crisis. b
