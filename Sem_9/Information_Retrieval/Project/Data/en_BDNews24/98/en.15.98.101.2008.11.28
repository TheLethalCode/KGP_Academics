<TEXT>
 BANGKOK,Nov 28(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat sacked his national police chief on Friday, fuelling speculation that the government is preparing to crackdown on protesters besieging Bangkok's main airports. General Patcharawat Wongsuwan, who was moved to an inactive post, had resisted previous orders to crackdown on the street protesters who began a "final battle" to unseat the government on Monday, Thai media reported. "The removal was the result of his performance during this current crisis," government spokesman Nattawut Saikuar told NBT television a day after Somchai declared a state of emergency to end the crippling airport sieges. Dozens of riot police with truncheons and shields gathered at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport on Friday, but took no action against the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) protesters camped outside the main terminal. In a televised address, Somchai said the government would use "gentle measures" against the protesters. "Don't worry. Officials will use gentle measures to deal with them," Somchai said, and invited human rights and media organizations to observe and film the process. Earlier, police said they hoped talks with protest leaders would end the siege, but warned they would "take other steps" if they failed. "We are asking them to allow the airport to resume operations," Lieutenant-General Suchart Muenkaew, the chief police negotiator, told reporters. But PAD leaders denied talks would even take place. "We will not enter in any talks with the police. We will fight until the end," spokesman Parnthep Pourpongpan told a crowd of supporters. The siege at Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi International Airport have cut the Thai capital's air links to the world, leaving thousands stranded and hurting the tourist-dependent economy. The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce said if the political turmoil and airport closures go on for another month, it would cost the economy up to 215 billion baht ($6 billion). "While the question on whether the mess can be cleared up in a year is still an important one, the question on whether confidence would return even if it does get cleaned up in a month is beginning to look less clear," said Carl Rajoo, an economist at Forecast in Singapore. Declaring a state of emergency at the airports from the government stronghold of Chiang Mai, 700 km (400 miles) north of Bangkok, Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat said the export- and tourism-driven economy could not tolerate further disruption. RELUCTANT TO ACT But with security forces reluctant to act, and the protesters insisting they'll stay out until the government falls, the standoff could continue. PAD guards had set up roadblocks on the main expressway to the airport and were stopping all cars and checking passengers and trunk compartments. The roadblocks were manned by youths in black jackets, faces partly covered by masks. Some wore body armor and wielded wooden stakes and golf clubs. "We will not leave. We will use human shields against the police if they try to disperse us," PAD leader Suriyasai Katasila told Reuters. Thailand's three-year-old political crisis has deepened dramatically since the PAD began a "final battle" on Monday to unseat a government it accuses of being a pawn of former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted in a 2006 coup. Somchai is Thaksin's brother-in-law. Pressure has built on the army to step in since Somchai rejected military calls to quit, but pro-government forces threaten to take up arms if the elected administration is ousted, raising fears of major civil unrest. Army chief Anupong has repeatedly said he would not take over, arguing the military is powerless to heal fundamental political rifts between the Bangkok elite and middle classes who despise Thaksin, and the poor rural and urban majority who love him. But rumors of the army preparing to launch what would be Thailand's 19th coup or attempted coup in 76 years of on-off democracy continue to swirl around the capital. The government began shuttling thousands of stranded tourists by bus to U-Tapao, a Vietnam War-era naval airbase 150 km (90 miles) east of Bangkok, as an alternative landing site for airlines. According to a schedule hand written on a white board outside the terminal, flights from Cathay Pacific, Thai Airways and Malaysian Air Services were expected. In bound flights bringing tourists for the peak season were expected to start arriving on Friday as well.
