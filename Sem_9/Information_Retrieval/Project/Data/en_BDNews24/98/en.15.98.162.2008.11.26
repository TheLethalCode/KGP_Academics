 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday said that the overall capital market situation is satisfactory. "Compared to the markets of the neighboring countries and the developed world that witnessed a 5O percent slump, the Bangladeshi market is doing pretty well," he told reporters after a meeting at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). "The only thing that is bothering the market now is high volatility." Lack of investors' confidence due to the upcoming national elections might be affecting the market adversely, he added. Mirza Aziz sat with the market regulator and the stock exchange authorities Sunday to attend a presentation on the book building method for IPO pricing. The method determines prices by the market demand  that is, through bids from investors. Currently, prices of Initial Public Offerings are determined by the company and approved by the SEC. The adviser stressed that introduction of the method would help determine the IPO prices in a 'more professional way.' bdnew
