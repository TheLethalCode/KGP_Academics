<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Werder Bremen came from two goals down to snatch a 2-2 draw with Cypriot newcomers Anorthosis Famagusta in Champions League Group B on Wednesday but it was not enough to prevent the Germans slipping out. Werder's comeback at the end of a frantic second half only succeeded in denting the home side's hopes of clinching qualification for the last 16 at the first attempt, although they do still have a chance. As it is, Inter Milan qualified with a game to spare despite losing 1-0 at home to Panathinaikos. The second berth will be decided when Anorthosis travel to face Panathinaikos on the final evening of matches next month. For the moment, Panathinaikos are second with seven points, while Anorthosis are third on six and Werder are bottom with four. It was a cruel finish for Anorthosis, after they had taken control with the first moment of quality in a poor match. It came in the 62nd minute when Nikos Nikolaou struck first time on the half-volley, low past Werder's stand-in keeper Christian Vander, as the ball drifted over from a corner. Brazilian forward Savio added a second in the 68th minute, turning in from close range after a crossfield ball from the right. Werder rarely threatened but they were given a lifeline when Diego lashed in from a penalty in the 72nd minute. The Germans came pouring forward and got an equaliser they perhaps deserved when Hugo Almeida struck with a low volley. Almeida was then handed a chance to revive Werder's season when he was put through on goal but the Portuguese shot straight at the keeper. "Sadly, we woke up too late," Werder coach Thomas Schaaf told reporters. "When at the end we did play better it wasn't enough. We haven't reached our target for the season.
