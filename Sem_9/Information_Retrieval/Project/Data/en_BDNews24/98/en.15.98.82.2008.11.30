 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  A 90-minute goal from Nasir Hossain brought Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club back in the winning run with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Farashganj Sporting Club in the B. League encounter on Sunday. The black and white outfit went behind with Enamul Haque putting Farashganj ahead in the 28th minute before Alamu Bukola Olaleken cancelled the lead of the Old Dhaka Outfit in the 76th minute, and Nasir struck the all-important goal for Mohammedan in the dying minute at Bangabandhu National Stadium. With the fourth win, Mohammedan climbed up to the third position in the 11-team point table with 15 points, four points behind the leaders Abahani Limited, playing the same eight matches.

Mohammedan went into the match with a shock 0-1 defeat to Rahmatganj MFS in the previous match, and greatly felt the absence of injured playmaker Arman Aziz that caused them to lose the midfield possession in the first half. And, the black and white outfit's coach Maruful Haq played striker Mohammad Robin behind Nigerian striker Olaleken, who could hardly make any trouble in the Farashganj defense though his 17th minute grounder could have caused the damage had the opponent goalkeeper Khairul Hassan Titu not timely gripped it. Just 11 minutes later, Kalu Johnson advanced into the left side of the Mohammedan territory to cut the ball for striker Enamul, who at the edge of the box lashed a powerful shot past Mohammedan goalkeeper Aminul Haq, giving no chance. Mohammedan had tried to come back in the match with going close to an equaliser in the 41st minute when Faisal whipped a cross from the left for Nasir, who volleyed inside the danger zone and Robin pushed on it to the near post only to see Nigerian defender Emeka Lucky cleared it from the goal line. Emeka then hammered a dipping free kick from 40 yards, but goalkeeper Aminul thwarted it to save Mohammedan for a corner one minute from the breather. In the stoppage time of the first half, Mohammedan were deprived of the equaliser as a Robin shot rattled the woodwork and Sharif sent the follow-up wide to disappoint Mohammedan. After resumption, Farashganj had started to play in defensive mood and Mohammedan did not mistake to cash in on that after bossing the midfield throughout the second half. Olaleken came close to level the margin in the 56th minute, but the striker saw his placing shot that beat Rahmatganj keeper Titu, but went inches wide of the far post while Robin headed a Nasir cross wide in the 64th minute. Three minutes later, Emeka almost doubled Rahmatganj margin, but his powerful header off an Arafat Ronny corner went narrowly wide while Mohammedan were deprived for the second time with Sharif firing the sidebar in the 73rd minute. Mohammedan finally found the equaliser in the 76th minute with Olaleken from close range nicely placing a Ripon Khan lob to the near post. With 1-1 margin, Al Amin substituted goalkeeper Titu to stand under the Rahmatganj post, but the newly installed goalkeeper could not save his side. In the dying minute, Mohammedan medio Sharif drove a shot near the center area to stimulate Al Amin coming out of his cave and the keeper did so to fist the ball only to see Nasir promptly took an over-head shot from the midfield that kissed the back of his open net before getting back to his position. bd
