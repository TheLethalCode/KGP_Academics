 BHUBANESWAR, India, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will wait for security advice before deciding if they are to proceed with their cricket tour of India after a series of deadly attacks in Mumbai on Wednesday. "We are obviously taking security advice from a number of different sources," England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Hugh Morris told a news conference on Thursday. "We are looking at a number of different options." The England and India cricket boards cancelled the last two games in the seven-match one-day series after the attacks on Wednesday which have claimed more than 100 lives. England are due to play two tests from Dec. 11 with the second match scheduled in Mumbai from Dec. 19. Morris said media reports that the team had decided to cancel the tour were incorrect. "We did not request the cancellation of the test series," he said. "The players are keen to play international cricket but there are big issues affecting everybody in India." The England players are currently in the eastern town of Bhubaneswar, where they were based for Wednesday's fifth one-dayer in Cuttack. India won to lead the series 5-0. The England performance programme squad including some players selected for the tests only, are based in Bangalor
