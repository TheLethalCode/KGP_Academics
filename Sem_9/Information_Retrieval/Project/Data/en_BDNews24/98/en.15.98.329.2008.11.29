 MOSCOW, Fri Nov 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia has intensified efforts to develop new ballistic missiles in response to US plans to deploy an anti-missile system in Europe, Interfax news agency quoted a top Russian general as saying on Friday. The decision by the United States to deploy interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic has angered Moscow, which says Russia's national security will be compromised by the US anti-missile system. Colonel-General Nikolai Solovtsov, Commander of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, was quoted by Interfax as saying that Russia had bolstered its efforts to develop new missiles. "At the present time, work has been intensified to create the research and technical foundation for new missile systems, which will be needed after 2020," Solovtsov said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced on November 5 that Moscow would install Iskander short-range missile systems near the Polish border if Washington proceeds with its missile plans. Medvedev also said Russia would try to electronically jam the U.S. system. Russia's relations with Washington this year hit their lowest ebb since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union after a row over the war against U.S. ally Georgia and Moscow's recognition of two Georgian rebel regions as independent states. Kremlin officials say the U.S. has failed to listen to their concerns about the missile shield, which Washington says is needed to protect against "rogue states" such as Iran. Russia's missile forces commander said the first of a new generation of Russian RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles will enter service in December 2009, Interfax reported. Russia test fired one of the RS-24 missiles on November 26, the third such test in two years. Russian generals say the RS-24 can pierce any anti-missile system. It can be armed with up to 10 different warheads and is intended to replace Russia's earlier generation intercontinental missiles such as the RS-18 and RS-20. Solovtsov said the global financial crisis probably would impose some limits on funding, although he said Russia would test 13 missiles next year, almost double the seven tests this year, Interfax reported. "Due to the world financial crisis, certain resource restrictions will be applied but still the (missile) force should be able to fulfill its duties," he was quoted as saying. Civilian personnel in Russia's military forces also will be cut by 150,000 to 600,000 as part of ongoing reforms to defense structures, Interfax separately reported, quoting a source in Russia's Defense Ministry
