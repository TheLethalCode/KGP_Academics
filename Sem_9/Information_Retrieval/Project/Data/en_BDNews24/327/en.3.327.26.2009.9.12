<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League's acting general secretary Mahbub Alam Hanif on Saturday asked the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources and Power and Ports to withdraw Monday's hartal. Talking to reporters in Dhanmondi's party office, Hanif said he believed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its three political allies have a role behind the call for a half-day general strike in the name of protecting natural resources. He said the BNP-led four-party alliance is trying to recover its popularity by making non-issues into political ones. He said the protesters were silent during the military-backed caretaker, which initiated the gas exploration bid, but now they are talking about this. Hanif said the protesters should look into details of the deals with US company ConocoPhillips and Ireland's Tullow. Meanwhile, the executive committee of Dhaka City Awami League also urged the national committee to lift the hartal in a meeting at party headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue on Saturday. The meeting also decided to convene its next council to choose its city leadership on Oct 31 at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Such council is to be held in every two years, but the party is going to hold it after six years. The last council of Dhaka city Awami League was held in 2003 when late AL leader Mohammad Hanif was elected president and Mofazzel Hossain Chowdhury Maya was elected general secretary. Later MA Aziz took charge as acting president on behalf of Hanif while Kamrul Islam, incumbent state minister for law, acted as general secretary in place Maya. Maya had been into hiding during the caretaker government to avoid arrest. Acting president MA Aziz presided over Saturday's meeting, where Kamal Ahmed Majumder, Dr HBM Iqbal and other city AL leaders were also present. Kamrul and Maya also attended the meeting. bdnews24
