<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)--Garment workers on Thursday repeated their demand that factory owners clear up all dues including Eid bonuses by Wednesday. AKM Ruhul Amin, general secretary of Garments Sramik Trade Union Kendra, placed the demand at a news conference in the city. Reading out a statement, Amin also demanded authorities fix Tk 5000 as monthly minimum wage for a garment worker. He said all "false charges" filed against trade union leaders in the sector be withdrawn. It was irrational for apex apparel body BGMEA to seek assistance from the government to pay its workers salaries and allowance ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, Islam said. "There is no instance in the world of paying privately owned industries' workers' salaries and allowances from the state coffer." The industry owners pocket all profit they make from their business. But the law says five percent of the profits from garments' trading should go to workers." It means the owners did not pay workers thousands of crore of taka over the years, he added. "On the other hand, they are trying to deprive us of our due pay and allowances by confusing people with misinformation and citing problems in the garment sector." The leaders also alleged that many owners are now dilly-dallying over the payment of salaries and allowances. Advisor to Garments Sramik Trade Union Kendra Montu Ghosh, Sadekur Rahman Shamim, Ziaul Kabir Khokon, Joli Talukder Tuhin Chowdhury were also present at the news conference.
