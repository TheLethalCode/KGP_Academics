 ATHENS, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Medical experts will examine the results of gender tests on South African world champion runner Caster Semenya and athletics' governing body does not expect a final decision before late November, a spokesman said on Friday. The International Association of Athletics Federations was commenting after Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that tests on Semenya, who won the women's 800 metres gold medal at the World Championships in Berlin last month, had revealed she had both female and male sexual characteristics. "The IAAF has noted statements in recent media articles regarding the athlete Caster Semenya of South Africa. We would like to emphasise that these should not be considered as official statements by the IAAF," IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said. "We can officially confirm that gender verification test results will be examined by a group of medical experts. No decision on the case will be communicated until the IAAF has had the opportunity to complete this examination," he added. "We do not expect to make a final decision on this case before the next meeting of the IAAF Council which takes place in Monaco on November 20-21." Davies said Semenya was not running in this weekend's World Athetics Final in Thessaloniki, Greece, and was at home in South Africa. Some South Africans have accused the IAAF of racism for ordering the gender tests on Semenya, saying her broad shoulders and imposing musculature are common in women's athletics and she should not be singled out. She received a heroine's welcome on returning from Berlin. Quoting an unnamed source familiar with the IAAF inquiry, the Daily Telegraph said the tests had shown Semenya was a hermaphrodite -- someone with organs of both sexes. The IAAF "is ready to disqualify Semenya from future events and advise her to have immediate surgery because her condition carries grave health risks", it said. "They have also not ruled out stripping Semenya of her 800m world championships gold medal." South African President Jacob Zuma has said Semenya should not have been subjected to public humiliation. Julius Malema, firebrand leader of the ruling ANC's militant Youth League, complained that not enough whites turned up at the airport to show their support for the athlete.
