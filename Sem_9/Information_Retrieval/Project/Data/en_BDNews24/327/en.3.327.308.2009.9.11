 Kushtia, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)Two more so-called militants died early on Friday in Kushtia and Mymensingh in 'gun battles' between gunmen and police-RAB joint forces, taking the total number of dead in the current crackdown to nine in the last two weeks. Kushtia Sadar police chief SM Faruque Hossain said acting on a tip-off, RAB-12 and Kushtia sadar police jointly conducted a raid in Bhadalia at 4am. The alleged terrorists holding a rendezvous there opened fire on the intruding law enforcers, they fired back and a gun battled ensued. Ziko Parvez aka Samrat, 32, son of late Abdul Aziz of Baliaparha of Kushtia, died during the gun fight but his cohorts fled the scene. Police retrieved a rifle, a shutter gun and four rounds of ammo from the grounds. Samrat's body has been sent for autopsy. Faruque said the dead was a member of the banned extremist outfit Gano Muktifouj and he had five cases including three for murder filed against him with the Sadar Police Station. In Mymensingh, one 'Nasim', the ring leader of the notorious 'Nasim group' got killed in a gun fight with RAB. Nasim was identified as the son of Abdul Kader Matu from Balashpur. Major Sheikh Amin, RAB company commander, said the elite force raided Nasim's meeting place in Kewatkhali railway colony on Thursday evening and nabbed the gang leader although his associates fled. At the RAB local office after some quizzing, Nasim gave out information about arms cache and then the law-enforcers started a search taking Nasim along with them. As they approached Maurakhola at Kewatkhali, Nasim's cohorts opened fire at them, RAB retaliated and the fight continued for about 15 minutes. Nasim was killed when everybody else escaped and RAB recovered an LG, a pipegun, a round of ammo, five ramdas -- long-bladed machete with a long wooden handle -- and a king-sized knife. He faced about a dozen cases filed with the Sadar Police Station accusing him of extortion, mugging, vandalism, hijacking motor cycles at gunpoint and theft, Amin said. Senior police officials said the law enforcers are cracking down on 13 south-western districts to curb increased militancy. On Sept 12, police and RAB officials from the districts are scheduled to sit in a meeting in Pabna. Shamsul Haq Tuku, state minister, home affairs will be present there. 'Odhikar', a human rights organisation, said at least 19 people were killed in August across the country in so-called 'crossfire, encounter or gunfight'. Of the deceased, 10 allegedly belonged to different underground militant outfits. According to available figures, a total 577 people died in 472 'crossfire' incidents across the country since RAB was constituted on March 26, 2004. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Most recently, controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Home minister Sahara Khatun has claimed that no extra-judicial killing was taking place during the crackdown in the southwest. Former state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed had said the RAB had launched a departmental investigation into the death of the two students. According to rights group Odhikar, 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past decades have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. bdnews
