<TITLE> Low rainfall threatens groundwater </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)The lowest recorded rainfall so far this year since 1994, including a weak monsoon, may pose a serious risk to Bangladesh's water table, officials said Saturday. Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq said on Saturday replenishment of underground water could fall short due to lack of rain and natural flooding this year. Water Development Board officials agreed. The water table has been dropping significantly in recent years, due to population pressure and greater consumption of water for drinking and irrigation, Razzaq told a seminar on water resources and disaster management at the BRAC Centre Inn in the capital. He said the growing extraction of huge amounts of groundwater throughout the country is still compensated to an extent by seasonal flooding, but this year's dearth of rain and flooding might fail to replenish underground stocks at all. A WDB official at the seminar said the typical flood season in Bangladesh started in July and ended in October, although this year had seen unusually low levels of flooding with only some parts of the country facing isolated flash floods for a relatively short period. Razzaq said Bangladesh is vulnerable to natural disasters as a result of its geographical location, and the country will be vulnerable to more calamities if water resources are not managed properly. "We must formulate coordinated measures to mitigate disaster risk with an emphasis on food security," said the minister. He said increased regional cooperation was also vital to ensure the normal flow of shared rivers in the region, adding that over 90 percent of surface water in Bangladesh originated from the Padma, Brahmaputra and the Meghna rivers. Executive engineer Selim Bhuiyan of the WDB's Flood Forecast and Warning Centre told bdnews24.com on Saturday the centre has been keeping records since 1972. According to available data, 1994 is regarded as the last serious drought year. "There has been less rainfall this year compared with 1994," said Bhuiyan. "Except for June, there has been less rainfall than normal in every month so far this year." He said the only period of significant flooding in the country was for about a week between August 22-28, but it was too short a period. Flooding must inundate 20-27 per cent Bangladesh's land area to be beneficial to agriculture and environment. "But this year's overall flooding will be much less, though a full assessment is yet to be done as the flood season is not officially over." Flood assessment is done annually in early October, he said. "But this year it will be completed early as there is little chance of further significant flooding throughout the country," said Bhuiyan. He agreed with the disaster minister's observation that Bangladesh may face a crisis of groundwater due to poor rains. bdnews24.c
