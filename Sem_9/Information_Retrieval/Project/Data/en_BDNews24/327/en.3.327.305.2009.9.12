 JERUSALEM, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli gunman shot and wounded two Palestinians in East Jerusalem on Friday, and police arrested the suspect at the scene, a police spokesman said. The shooting occurred near the old walled section of Jerusalem where tensions have flared recently after Israel evicted two families and threatened to demolish dozens of homes it says were built illegally. Shmuel Ben-Ruby, an Israeli police spokesman in Jerusalem, said the gunman, 20, shot and wounded a 13-year-old boy and a 40-year-old man from Silwan, a mostly Palestinian neighborhood. Both were injured lightly in the legs, he said. Police said the gunman had told them he opened fire after a group of Palestinians had either threatened or assaulted him. Palestinians protested the shooting by throwing stones at police and Jewish homes in Silwan, and a Palestinian man was injured by a rock thrown in that confrontation, Ben-Ruby added. Israel annexed East Jerusalem as part of its capital after capturing it in a 1967 in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians also want the city as capital of a future state. East Jerusalem has been a key issue in stalled peace talks the United States has been trying to revive, most recently through the efforts of President Barack Obama's envoy George Mitchell, due to arrive on Saturday for a fresh round of talks
