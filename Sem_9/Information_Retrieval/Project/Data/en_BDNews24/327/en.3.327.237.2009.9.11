<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep11 (bdnews24.com)--The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry has urged the government to punish rogue traders who have pushed sugar prices exorbitantly high in recent days. "On visiting markets, we have found prices of most commodities stable except for pulse and sugar," FBCCI vice-president Abul Kashem, who led a monitoring team, told bdnews24.com on Friday morning. "There is no valid reason for a rise in sugar price in our country though sugar is selling dear in other parts of the world." "So, the government should take legal action against those who are making excessive profit by pushing price," Kashem said At Shantinagar kitchen market, the FBCCI team had an argument with a buyer who questioned the benefit of market monitoring by FBBCI leaders. He said it was an 'eyewash'. Kashem told him that market monitoring is a part of their routine work. The price of sugar was up 20 percent just three days after the government held talks with the traders to keep the price stable. A visit to several markets revealed that sugar was selling at Tk 60 a kg from Tk 48-50 only three days back. Retailers at some kitchen markets alleged that the wholesalers are hiking the price of sugar on the pretext of short supply. The wholesalers blamed it on refinery mills for insufficient supply. bdnew
