 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  India's status as the number one one-day team proved short-lived after the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side slumped to a 139-run defeat against Sri Lanka in an inconsequential match of the tri-series on Saturday, reports PTI. Although India were already assured of a place in Monday's final of the tri-series after their big win over New Zealand on Friday, Dhoni and his men needed an unbeaten run in the tournament to maintain their number one status. However, Sanath Jayasuriya and Thilina Kandamby combined with the bat and then Angelo Mathews ignited fire with the ball to take the hosts to the convincing victory. Chasing a formidable 308 for victory India were bowled out for a paltry 168 in 37.2 overs as only six batsmen could manage to reach double figures. Earlier, opting to bat Sri Lanka rode on Jayasuriya's blistering 98 off 79 balls and Kandamby's unbeaten 91 down the order to score 307/6 in their allotted 50 overs. Needing 308 for win, India's makeshift opening duo of Sachin Tendulkar and Dinesh Karthik (16 off 23) started the innings on a positive note adding 32 runs in the first six overs before Sri Lanka pulled back with the wicket of Karthik. Trying to glide a leg side delivery to the fine-leg boundary, the Tamil Nadu wicket-keeper gloved a simple catch to Kumar Sangakkara off left-arm seamer Thilan Thushara's bowling in the sixth over. From there on both Tendulkar and new man in Rahul Dravid found going tough although the master blaster managed to find the fence in between. Tendulkar hit some elegant flicks and glances to score his boundaries before Nuwan Kulasekara got the vital wicket in the 14th over with India scoreboard reading 67. He struck five fours in his short but classy 33-ball 27-run innings. Vice-captain Yuvraj Singh made his arrival in style, clobbering Kulasekara for four over mid-on in the very second ball he faced but thereafter went to a shell as he played and missed Lasith Malinga on several occasions. Boundaries were far and few as Dravid and Yuvraj kept the scoreboard ticking with ones and twos before the right-hander cut loose in the 19th over, hitting a four and a six of Dilshan's consecutive deliveries to pick 13 runs off the over. But Malinga broke the dangerously-looking 38-run fourth wicket stand as Yuvraj edged one to Sangakkara. After that the famed Indian batting line up crumbled like a pack of card as they lost five wickets for mere 25 runs as Angelo Mathews wreaked havoc, picking three six wickets for mere 20 runs in his six overs. Suresh Raina's misery with the bat continued as he made a duck. He gave a catching practice to Sangakkara in the very first ball he faced off Mathews. Dravid was the next to follow, bowled by Mathews as the right-hander went for an extravagant drive. In his next over and innings 28th, Mathews struck twice, first castling skipper Dhoni's stumps and then Yusuf Pathan handed a regulation catch to Sangakkara, thereby dashing India's hopes with the scoreboard reading 130/7. Mathews' rampage continued unabated as he disturbed both Harbhajan Singh and Asish Nehra's timbers. The duo of RP Singh (19 not out) and Ishant Sharma (13) did make a last ditch effort to take India's score to some respectability by adding 29 runs before Ajantha Mendis wrapped up the proceedings. Earlier, Jayasuriya returned to form with a blistering fashion. The 40-year-old left-hander, who had failed to score a half-century in his last eight previous outings, smashed 13 boundaries in his innings. However, after the good start Sri Lanka were struggling at 176/5 at one stage but Kandamby and Chamara Kapugedara (36) rattled up 83 runs for the sixth wicket to pour water on India's hopes. The duo batted sensibly dealing mostly on singles with occasional fours and saved their last for the final power-play. A direct hit by RP Singh separated the pair at the fag end but Kandamby batted with vigour and punished all the Indian bowlers with utter disdain. His 91 came off just 73 balls which included 11 shots to the fence as the last four overs yielded 46 runs. Sri Lanka got off to a flying start with Dilshan (23) and Jayasuriya relishing batting on a good track. Dilshan hit a flashy square cut to fence off Nehra in the first ball of the match and then sent an exquisite straight drive to boundary ropes, to start the proceedings in a brilliant fashion. With Both Nehra and RP Singh not making any impact, Dhoni brought gangling pacer Ishant into the attack as early as in the fifth over of the innings. The lanky bowler soon produced result, dismissing Dilshan, who played a casual drive to give an easy catch to Dhoni behind the wicket. Jayasuriya was unperturbed and severely punished RP Singh, fetching 15 runs from his over, en route to his half-century, which came off just 45 balls. The hosts were cruising comfortably but some exceptional glove work by Dhoni resulted in the fall of Mahela Jayawardene (17) off Yusuf Pathan and then Harbhajan Singh trapped Kumar Sangakkara (5) to make it 102/3. Jayasuriya continued with his aggressive batting as he hit Yuvraj Singh for successive boundaries. He survived a run out chance and together with Angelo Mathews (19) put up 70 runs for the fourth wicket before his heartbreaking dismissal. Mathews too joined him soon when he gave charge to Raina, got foxed by the spin and Dhoni stumped
