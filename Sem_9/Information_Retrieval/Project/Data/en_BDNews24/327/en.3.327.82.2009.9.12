 Dhaka, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)Twelve prominent artists of Bangladesh were under one roof at the Gallery Chitrak on Saturday painting scenes live of the capital's rich and colourful festivals. The painters' workshop "Traditional Festivals of Dhaka City" was arranged to highlight the immense diversity of religion and culture of Bangalee festivals held in the 400 year old capital. "This exhibition gives a glimpse of our traditional festivities, which unfortunately face threat of being wiped with the course of time, globalisation, and western culture," said Qayyum Chowdhury, a participant of the workshop launched in the Gallery Chitrak on Saturday. "Cultural invasion takes place because of economics, but it must not take over our social culture and festivals. Our rich culture must never die," he added. The veteran artist depicted the 'Pahela Boishakh', the Bengali New Year festival, with oils on his canvas. Kanak Chapa Chakma was painting the festivity of 'Buddho Purnima', Buddha's birthday, and welcomed the opportunity, with fellow artists, to highlight the traditional festivals. Foreign secretary Mohammad Mijarul Quayes inaugurated the exhibition while Mamun Rashid, managing director and chief commercial officer of Citi, N.A., also spoke. "Our art and culture is very rich and we should spread it around the world," Quayes said. In a thank you address, Rashid said it was a really rare moment to have the artworks of 12 acclaimed artists in one show. Among others, Rafiqun Nabi focused on 'Marriage Festivities', Hashem Khan portrayed 'Nobanno', or Harvest, Monirul Islam drew 'Kite Festivals' and Md Muniruzzaman sketched 'Nouka Baich' or Boat Races. 'Eid' was painted by Shahid Kabir, 'Mohorrom' by Jamal Ahmed, 'Shab-e-Barat' by Sheikh Afzal, while Nisar Hossain depicted 'Durga Puja', Alokesh Ghose showed 'Janmashtami' and Shamsuddoha showed 'Christmas Day'. The artworks of the day-long workshop, in which the painters made their canvases come alive with the stroke of a brush before viewers' eyes, will be exhibited later and the money will be donated to charity.
