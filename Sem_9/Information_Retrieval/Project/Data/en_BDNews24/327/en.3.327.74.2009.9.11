 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)The World Trade Center catastrophe in New York on Sep 11, 2001 claimed the 2,752 lives, 50 of whom were Bangladeshi nationals. Nurul Haq Miah and Shakila Yasmin Tumpa were the only couple to die. Eight years on, their relatives think the void they left behind can never be filled. Sharif Chowdhury, who lost daughter Tumpa to the tragedy, hasn't been able to get over the morning. "Uncle Sharif pursues social activities with various US charities but he can hardly forget that his sprightly daughter is no more, swooning often over her thought," Tumpa's cousin Chowdhury Touhid Elahi, a resident of Sylhet, told bdnews24.com on Thursday. On that fateful day, 2,752 people died in the Twin Tower catastrophe, of whom 50 were Bangladeshi nationals. Nurul and Tumpa were working in the first of the two towers when the tragedy struck. Miah was on the 93rd floor and his wife Tumpa, on the 97th, working for an audio-visual production company. Miah, who hailed from Trishal in Mymensingh, had migrated to the US in 1985, studied visual media before taking the job. "The house has become so desolate since my nephew died. Almost all of his family members are in the US," Miah's uncle Abul Miah said to bdnews24.com. Originally residents of Ghyasnagar in Srimangal upazila in Moulvibazaar district, Tumpa had migrated in 1990 with her father Sharif Chowdhury and brother Fahim Chowdhury. Prior to starting as a professional, she studied computer engineering at Commonwealth University of Virginia. Elahi, her cousin, said, "Tumpa was a very lively, exuberant person. She was always all smiles." "The 9/11 disaster has virtually wrung the joy of life out from my sister and brother-in-law since, who continue to live out there in Virginia." Tumpa had married Nurul in 2000. bdnews
