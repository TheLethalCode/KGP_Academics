 Moinul Haq Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission is making further changes to law to enroll expatriate Bangladeshis as voters, a commissioner says. It has referred a proposed draft to the law ministry to include two clauses to register overseas Bangladeshis and Bangladeshis with dual citizenship. "The draft proposal was sent to the law ministry with explanation on the two sections on Monday," commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said to bdnews24.com late last week. "I expect the Voter Registration Amendment Act will be passed in the fourth parliamentary session once it gets green signal from the cabinet." The proposed draft amendment says Bangladeshis living abroad temporarily would be considered as the voters of the constituency from where they come. Bangladeshis with dual citizenships would be able to register in line with sub-section (2) of section 8 of the Voter Registration Law 2009. Section 8(2) states that one can register as voter in a single constituency even though they have settlement or property in more than one constituencies. Sohul said they planned to enroll expatriates by June next once the law is passed. An official told bdnews24.com that Bangladesh missions would collect voter applications forms for dual citizenship holders and send them to the EC after preparing a district-wise primary list. The EC would send application forms to the district registration officer for scrutiny. Then eligible voters will fill out the voter registration forms (2) at the embassy. The embassy will send photographs, copies of passport and form (2) to the EC, and the applicants will be registered by the district registration officer. The EC will issue receipt through the embassy. The 2007-08 caretaker government moved to amend the Voter Registration Ordinance with Photographs, 2007 and Voter Registration egulations 2008 but to no avail. EC commissioners Sohul Hussain and M Shakhawat Hossain during their fortnight tour to the UK reviewed feasibility of registration for overseas Bangladeshi expatriates. Parliament passed Voter Registration Ordinance 2009 in the first session and the EC moved further to enroll overseas Bangladeshis as voters in July. Over 65 lakh Bangladeshis stay overseas. Some 8.13 crore were enrolled in the voter lists with photographs for the first time while the work for revised voter lists has been going on since June. bd
