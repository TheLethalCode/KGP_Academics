 NEW DELHI, Sep 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dalai Lama plans to visit soon Arunachal Pradesh, part of which China claims as its territory, after last months Taiwan visit. an aide said on Friday."China expresses strong concern about this information. The visit further reveals the Dalai clique's anti-China and separatist essence," China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said. Chhime Chhoekyapa, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader's aide, told Reuters the Dalai Lama would be in Arunachal Pradesh in the second week of November. "He is going there for teaching. This has nothing to do with politics, there is nothing political about it," Chhoekyapa said. The intended visit has already sparked consternation in China, which claims about 90,000 sq km of Arunachal Pradesh along their border as part of its territory, and could become another irritant in ties already dogged by a border dispute. "China expresses strong concern about this information. The visit further reveals the Dalai clique's anti-China and separatist essence," Jiang Yu, the spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, said in a statement faxed to Reuters. "China's stance on the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' is consistent. We firmly oppose Dalai visiting the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh'," Jiang said. The Dalai Lama's travel plan was announced a week after the completion of his visit to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. China denounced the trip. A visit to Arunachal Pradesh could now draw further attention to China's treatment of Tibetan activists and the Dalai Lama's calls for cultural and religious freedoms and autonomy. China considers the Dalai Lama a "splittist" who seeks to separate nearly a quarter of the land mass of the People's Republic of China. "TIMING SIGNIFICANT" The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, denies the charge and says he seeks greater rights for Tibetans. "The timing of his trip (to Arunachal Pradesh) is significant. It comes while the debate over his visit to Taiwan is still hot," said Bhaskar Roy, a New Delhi-based China expert. "Tibetans are as good at playing these games as the Chinese. They know such a visit will keep up the pressure on China." The trip has ramifications for India-China relations as well. India and China fought a short war in 1962 and, despite burgeoning trade in recent years, mistrust remains. Both sides jostle for resources and influence as they seek a global role. This year, the two countries have faced off at multi-lateral forums, including Chinese objections to a $60 million Asian Development Bank loan for a project in Arunachal Pradesh. Indian media have repeatedly reported "incursions" by Chinese soldiers patrolling the 3,500-km (2,200-mile) border, disputed at various stretches. In response, India has begun modernising its border roads and moved a squadron of strike aircraft close to the China border. Arunachal Governor J.J. Singh said in June up to 30,000 new troops would be deployed in the area. "From India's point of view the Dala Lama's visit will restate Arunachal Pradesh as Indian territory," said Roy. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet through Arunachal Pradesh, which has a substantial Buddhist populat
