<TITLE> Motherhood adds new lease to Clijsters's career </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As Jada Lynch was lovingly lifted on to a horse carriage ride in Central Park by her mother, the toddler collapsed into a fit of giggles. Her blonde-haired mum joined in the laughter as she looked forward to an ordinary day out with her 18-month-old daughter. Except mum in this case was no other than Kim Clijsters -- tennis player extraordinaire. For almost three decades, tennis courts around the world have been the domain of single-minded women who are prepared to eat, breathe and sleep tennis -- day and night, year in and year out. Not anymore. In just 10 days Clijsters has turned the sport on its head as she was perched just two matches away from becoming the first mother to win a grand slam title since 1980. "It's a fantastic story for Kim, it's a fantastic story for women's tennis. It sends an incredible message to working mums that you can have a career and be successful at your profession," WTA Tour chief Stacey Allaster told reporters. What is even more remarkable is that Clijsters's comeback is just 32-days young and that she has bulldozed her way through a field where the women's draw has been decimated. By the time the quarter-finals came around, only Serena Williams had fulfilled her commitment as the world number two. The rest of the famous eight, including world number one Dinara Safina, could not handle the pace in New York and departed early. Alarmingly, it seemed as if they could not wait to get out of Flushing Meadows. NO HOLIDAYS "Just playing, playing, playing, playing, playing... I don't have even time for myself to relax and to calm down," groaned Safina after her third-round exit. Serbian Ana Ivanovic, the 2008 French Open champion, added: "I feel like I constantly keep going and going. It's really hard. I haven't had proper holidays in years." For these young women, crisscrossing the world many times over in pursuit of precious ranking points appears to be taking a toll on their mind and body. If they needed any survival tips, they could seek out Clijsters for some guidance. She had turned professional at 14, climbed to the top of the rankings at 20 and had a body wracked with injuries by 21. By the time she turned 23, she had become disillusioned by the sport and quit -- or so it seemed. "In the past I wanted to win a lot. Sometimes maybe too much even. It was 24/7 tennis," said the 26-year-old, who has been taking her daughter out and about New York on her days off. "Now there's that other life that I have that keeps me away from tennis. It doesn't matter to our daughter or my husband whether I won the day before or not. That's a nice feeling." After a two-year sabbatical to get married and have a baby, Clijsters's love for tennis appears to have been reignited. And nowhere was this more evident than at the US Open where the Belgian scorched five players, including third-ranked Venus Williams, to set up a semi-final showdown with Serena. While many tennis fans are wondering how Clijsters can create such a stir so quickly after her comeback, men's world number one Roger Federer had an easy explanation. RIDING A BIKE "It's like riding a bike; once you know how to ride a bike, you never forget that," said the new father of twins. "That's why I'm not that surprised. I think it's a beautiful story." Despite her break, Clijsters has lost none of the court craft or the speed she was renowned for during what she calls "my first career." In fact if anything, Serena observed: "Seems like she's even faster than what she was before. I was thinking that maybe I should have a baby and then I'll come back faster." It is a concept that has been heard before. After becoming a mother, Valerie Brisco-Hooks became the first sprinter to complete the Olympic 200 and 400m double at the 1984 Los Angeles Games while Evelyn Ashford captured two Olympic relay titles following her daughter's birth in 1985. Ashford even said that being pregnant was "better for you than a store full of vitamins or steroids or anything else" after she successfully combined her track and field career with her role as a mother. Austrian skier Ulrike Maier, who died in 1994 after breaking her neck in a crash during a World Cup Alpine skiing downhill, credited her daughter for her superlative efforts on the slopes. In 1989, Maier won her first super-G world title after learning she was two months pregnant and she repeated the feat two years later when her daughter Melanie was 18 months old. In 1991, Melanie was waiting at the finish line when her mother swept to success in Saalbach, Austria, prompting Maier to joke: "I had her at the finish line so I'd get there faster." It is a sentiment Clijsters could be echoing Saturday should she lift the famed silver cup on Arthur Ashe Stadium.
