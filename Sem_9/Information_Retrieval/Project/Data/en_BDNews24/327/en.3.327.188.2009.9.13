 MILAN, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Martin Caceres scored on his Serie A debut to help Juventus win 2-0 at Lazio on Saturday and maintain their perfect start to the season. The Uruguay right back, on loan from Barcelona, smashed home a loose ball on the edge of the box midway through the second half.

Stuttering Milan must now prepare for their return to the Champions League in the clash at Marseille on Tuesday, when Juve host fellow French side Bordeaux.
