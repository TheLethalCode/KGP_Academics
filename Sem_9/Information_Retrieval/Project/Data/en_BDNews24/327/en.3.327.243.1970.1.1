 Pabna,Sep11(bdnews24.com)--State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku said on Friday that law would take its own course regarding charges of corruption and misuse of power against Tarique Rahman, Arafat Rahman Coco and Giasuddin Al-Mamun. He rejected repeated demands by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) that all charges against BNP leaders including Tarique be withdrawn. The BNP maintains the charges were pressed purely to politically harass its leaders. Mamun is known as a close friend and business partner of Tarique, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's elder son, Coco being the younger one. Tuku told a public meeting at Selanda Bazaar in Sathia Upazila of Pabna on Friday that all cases against common crime suspects would lose merit if charges against the three were withdrawn. Tuku said they allegedly siphoned off thousands of crore of taka from power sector alone during the BNP-Jamaat coalition rule in 2001-2006, and there was no way for the government to withdraw the cases on political consideration. The state minister later held a meeting with police officials about the district's security. The BNP on Friday repeated its demand for withdrawal of all cases against its leaders, including Khaleda and her sons the way it had been done for prime minister Sheikh Hasina and many other ruling Awami League leaders. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told the reporters after a party programme: "The government is adopting dual policy in case of withdrawing political cases. This is unfortunate." Home minister Sahara Khatun told the parliament on Thursday that as many as 494 "politically motivated" cases were on the process of being cancelled. bdnews
