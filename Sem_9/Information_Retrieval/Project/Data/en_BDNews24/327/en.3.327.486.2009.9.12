 SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Jordan, considered by many the greatest basketball player of all time, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on Friday. Jordan joined former San Antonio Spurs centre David Robinson, ex-Utah Jazz guard John Stockton, long-time Jazz coach Jerry Sloan and Rutgers University women's coach C. Vivian Stringer in the new class. Unsurprisingly, Jordan was the centre of attention.

"Yeah, I would have loved to but to say that I'm better than those people is not for me to decide. He said he saw "some resemblance" between himself and current NBA players LeBron James and Kobe Bryant but added: "Don't be in a rush to try to find the next Michael Jordan -- there's not going to be another Michael Jordan."
