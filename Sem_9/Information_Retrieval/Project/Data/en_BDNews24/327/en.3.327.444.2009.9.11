 Dhaka, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com)--The government is not sincere in its efforts to bring the opposition back to parliament, BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has alleged. "Positive environment will have to be created to get us back," he said at the Zia International Airport on Friday, reacting to prime minister Sheikh Hasina's call to opposition chief Khaleda Zia to return to parliament at an Iftar party at Senakunja on Thursday. The main opposition party is not attending parliament from the very first session over a dispute over seats in the front row. "We want an active parliament. We want to assist the government. But the government does not want our assistance," he repeated his allegations after seeing off Khaleda who left for Saudi Arabia to perform Omrah at the invitation of the king of Saudi Arabia. After seeing Khaleda off, BNP leaders, led by Delwar, placed flowers at the grave of party's founder Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, vice-president M K Anwar, joint secretaries Mirza Abbas, Selima Rahman, Nazrul Islam Khan, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, among others,were with Delwar. "The government is discriminating in withdrawing political cases. It is unfortunate. Our demand is to withdraw cases against Khaleda Zia, [son] Tarique Rahman and all BNP leaders the way the political cases against ruling party leaders including prime minister Sheikh Hasina have been withdrawn," said Mosharraf. Khaleda was freed from detention on this day a year ago after being arrested during the military-backed caretaker government on a raft of corruption charges. BNP has announced a two-day programme, including special prayers in mosques, temples, churches and pagodas, to observe the day. bdne
