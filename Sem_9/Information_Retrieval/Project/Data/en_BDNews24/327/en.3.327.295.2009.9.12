 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)Workers of a readymade garment factory in Gulshan took to the streets on Saturday demanding salaries and Eid bonuses, causing traffic chaos. Some 200 workers of Textech, located on Chairman Bari Road, blocked the Airport Road junction for around half an hour at midday causing serious traffic jams in the area, Gulshan Police Station sub-inspector Jahangir Alam told bdnews24.com. Police went to the spot around 12:30pm, talked with the demonstrators and coaxed them back to the factory. Alam said they could not contact the factory owner since he was abroad. Leaders of the industry's main trade body, BGMEA, went to the factory, instead, and were trying to negotiate an agreement by holding a meeting with the factory's workers and managing director, said Alam. Garment workers have been demanding payment of all their dues and bonuses well ahead of Eid. Garments Sramik Trade Union Kendra on Friday repeated their demand that factory owners clear up all dues including Eid bonuses by Sept 16. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association caused controversy last week by demanding a financial package from the government saying it would be impossible for 40 percent of garment industries to pay Eid bonuses to their workers otherwise because business was bad due to the recession. It later withdrew the demand in the face of widespread criticism. b
