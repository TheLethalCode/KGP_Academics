<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)Nazmul Hasan, brother of late great artist Kamrul Hasan, handed dozens of the renowned painter's notebooks to Kamrul's daughter Sumona Hasan Ratna on Saturday. Kamrul, one of Bangladesh's best known artists, left some 40 notebooks full of jottings and sketches in his younger brother's hands before his death two decades ago. Nazmul Hasan handed them over to his niece at a low-key ceremony at his Gulshan home. Director general of Bangla Academy Kamal Lohani and writer Ekhlas Uddin Ahmed were among those present along with family members including Sakhina Rahman, sister of Kamrul and Nazmul. Kamrul began writing in the first of many notebooks on March 8, 1977. He filled his 40th one on March 17, 1986. Handing over the books, Nazmul said, "I have crossed 66 six years of age, so I am giving these precious documents of my brother, a celebrated artist and national figure, to Ratna. I hope she will keep these with care." Daughter Ratna recalled, "I remember my father used to write in these notebooks everyday. They were his journal." "The books, which belonged to my uncle up until now, are full of things to know about my father and rich for research. I need everybody's prayer and good wishes so that I can preserve them well." The 40 journals were handed over with signed documants on stamp pads. All these years the journals were stored in a bank locker. Nazmul and his family used to clean and take care of the pages regularly, said the artist's sister Sakhina. Kamal Lohani said, "We heard before about the journals. I am grateful to see these today. These journals are a heritage." "Artist Kamrul Hasan was a guiding light for us. His contribution is vast." Though Hasan was mostly a figurative painter, Lohani also mentioned the artist's famous cartoon of Yahya Khan in 1971. "That cartoon was an inspiration for us during the liberation war." "He was also a leader in pro-democracy and anti-autocracy movements in the post-independent era of Bangladesh." The famous artist died on Feb 2, 1988, soon after publishing another famous cartoon 'Biswa Behaya' of then military backed president HM Ershad at the biennial National Poetry Festival. bd
