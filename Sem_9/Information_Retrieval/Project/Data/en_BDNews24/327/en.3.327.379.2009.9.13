<TITLE> PREVIEW-Federer and Nadal look to set up dream Open final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dream final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal could become a reality when the world's top two players contest their respective semi-finals at the US Open on Sunday. Federer, bidding for a modern-day record sixth straight title in New York, plays fourth seed Novak Djokovic in a repeat of last year's semi-final. Nadal, chasing his first US Open crown and the completion of a career Grand Slam, takes on in-form Argentine Juan Martin del Potro. By the time Federer out steps out on court for his tussle with Djokovic, it will be three and a half days since his last match after rain washed out Friday's programme and pushed the tournament into a third Monday for the second year running. Federer will be appearing in his 22nd consecutive Grand Slam semi-final and he has not been defeated at Flushing Meadows since 2003. But though he won his last meeting with Djokovic, in Cincinnati last month, he was beaten twice by the Serb earlier in the year. "He's done well against me in the past but I beat him in Cincinnati and I hope I can build on that and try to beat him again here," the Swiss world number one said. Djokovic, runner-up here in 2007, reached his first Grand Slam semi-final in 2009 with victory over Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. "It feels great," Djokovic said. "I haven't done that in the past three Grand Slams this year so mentally it was very important for me to get to the semi-finals. "Now that I've done it I feel kind of a relief and I hope I can continue playing well and challenge Federer." Nadal was the last of the four to reach the semi-finals, finishing off his rain-delayed clash with Chile's Fernando Gonzalez on Saturday to equal his best showing in Flushing Meadows, and in the process reclaimed the number two ranking. The Spaniard has been struggling to shake off an abdominal strain in the past few rounds. But having played only two events since May because of tendinitis in both knees, he feels a lot fresher than 12 months ago when he arrived in New York exhausted following a gruelling three-month spell in which he won the French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic titles. Now he was ready to give it his all against Del Potro, who beat him when the two met in Montreal last month. "Sure, I'm more fresh than last year, 100 percent sure," he said. "We will see how I am physically (against Del Potro). But last year I was totally destroyed mentally. Mentally this year I am perfect." Del Potro is appearing in his second grand slam semi-final of the year, having pushed Federer to five sets at the French Open in June. Nadal said he would have to be at his best if he was to reach the final here for the first time. "I think he's a very complete player," Nadal said. "In the past, he didn't serve like he is now. He has an unbelievable serve right now and from the baseline, he is very so
