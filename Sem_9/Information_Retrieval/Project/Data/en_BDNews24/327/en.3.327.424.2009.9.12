 Dhaka, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)Sramik Karmochari Oikya Parishad issued an ultimatum on Saturday to garment factory owners to clear their employees back pay, salaries and Eid allowances by Sep 16 or face a fresh round of protests. SKOP leaders also voiced their support for a programme to beseige Sram Bhaban, the directorate of labour, by garment workers on Sunday. The Bangladesh Garment Workers Association will submit a memorandum to the chief factory inspector at Srom Bhaban on Sunday. "Garment factory owners want to deprive employees of salaries and allowances ahead of Eid by threatening the government, but the workers will not let this happen," SKOP convener Shahidullah Chowdhury told representatives of BGWA on Saturday at SKOP's Segunbagicha head office. Chowdhury, also the president of Trade Union Kendra, urged all present to make a SKOP rally at Muktangon on Sept 15 (Tuesday) a success. He named several garment houses that had closed their doors in recent days. "Mohakhali's Niboras Nitoy, Martial Knitex of Gazipur-Mouchak, Pubali Knitex of Ashulia, Sydney Fashion of Tejgaon, Life Garments of Rayerbazar have been shut down." "Some other garments are planning to shut down without clearing workers' salaries and bonuses. Still the labour directorate and chief inspector of factories is playing a silent role," he said. The meeting recommended a speedy amendment of labour laws and forming a wage board to fix a minimum wage at Tk 5,000. bdne
