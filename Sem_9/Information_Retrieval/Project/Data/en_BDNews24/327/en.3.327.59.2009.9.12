 Chittagong, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)Footpaths in Chittagong's commercial centre have been 'sold out' ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, with up to Tk 2,000 allegedly changing hands to secure a single spot for the festive period. Illegal leasing of highly sought after locations in the port city, such as Station Road, Amtali, Agrabad and Badamtali reportedly begins at least a month before Ramadan, leaving pedestrians to force their way through the maze of hawkers or risk their lives on the chaotic roads. By the beginning of Ramadan this year, hawker unions had set up thousands of stalls along Chittagong city centre footpaths, with hawkers reportedly shelling out at least Tk 250 a day to various collectors on top of the one-off Eid payment. Hawkers allege union leaders and police have to be paid for the spots. At the reported rates, hawker organisations can realise up to Tk 1 crore (10 million) a month from 2,000 roadside shops occupying a kilometre of footpath in the busiest thoroughfares of the city centre. Masud Rana, the secretary general of Chittagong Combined Hawkers Federation, denied sections of the city's footpaths were illegally leased out by his organisation's members. The federation leader told bdnews24.com last week that rental fees legally collected from the stalls by federation members covered guards' wages, light bulbs and so on. "There is no extortion in the name of police or hawker unions," said Rana. Roadside vendors in the port city, however, allege the pro-ruling-party Hawkers League illegally controls some 100 stalls, while the pro-BNP Metropolitan Hawkers Federation holds sway over 1,200 and the Footpath Hawkers Federation maintains a further 200. The vendors said there are at least another 500 roadside stalls operating semi-independently in the centre of Chittagong. A footpath vendor, not wanting to be named, told bdnews24.com some union leaders were only hawkers in name, and had become millionaires through control of just two or three areas through political backing. Chittagong Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Banaj Kumar Majumder denied any police involvement with illegal 'leasing' of stalls on the city's footpaths. "Police are told not to involve themselves in any kind of toll collection," Majumder told bdnews24.com. bdne
