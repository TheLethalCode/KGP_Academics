 NEW DELHI, Sep 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India could allow monitoring of green projects built with international finance and technology to prove to rich nations its commitment to fight climate change, the environment minister said on Friday. Developing nations are under pressure to be accountable for steps taken to fight climate change, through what the United Nations refers to as "measureable, reportable and verifiable" actions. "Wherever we take on a mitigation project, we will have no problems of subjecting that project to international monitoring where international technology and finance is involved," Jairam Ramesh told an industry lobby meeting. "Having said this, let me also say that India should take on mitigation responsibilities not necessarily dependant on international finance. We have responsibility to our people." He said India could make emissions mitigation offers such as trying to double the share of renewable energy in the country's power basket to about 16 percent by 2030. India says it is taking steps not only to adapt to climate change but also limit and reduce planet-warming emissions, but will not take on any binding targets because it needs to burn energy to lift million from poverty. Global negotiations for a new UN agreement on climate change in Copenhagen in December are stuck on the question of how much cash or technology rich nations will provide to poorer countries to fight climate change. Differences also remain over emissions cuts targets. Ramesh argued countries such as India should be left to fortify their voluntary, unilateral climate action with domestic legislation rather than signing up to internationally binding targets. India has already announced several steps to fight global warming, such as ramping up solar power investment, expanding forest cover and bringing in domestic energy efficiency trad
