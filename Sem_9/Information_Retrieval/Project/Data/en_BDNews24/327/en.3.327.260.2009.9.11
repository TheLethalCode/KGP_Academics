<TITLE> BNP backs Monday's strike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com)--BNP ethically supports the general strike called by the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports for Monday, said secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said. "BNP is against any agreement that goes against the interest of the nation. Because, BNP pursues nationalist politics to protect the interest, independence and sovereignty of the country," he said after seeing off party chairperson Khaleda Zia at the Zia International Airport. Khaleda left for Saudi Arabia to perform Omrah at the invitation of the king of Saudi Arabia. The committee on Thursday declared a half-day hartal from 6 am to protest against the police attack on the demonstrators during their attempt to besiege Petrobangla headquarters on Sept 2 over recent exploration deals with two international companies at Bay that left dozens of people injured. Ruling Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, also local government minister, on Thursday said those who called the hartal on the excuse of protecting the country are instead trying to harm it. bdne
