 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Saturday voiced opposition to foreign minister Dipu Moni's announcement that India would sell Bangladesh 100 megawatts of electricity "on a priority basis" after connecting the power grids of the two countries Delwar said Bangladesh had never received any positive assistance from India and the government was selling the country out to foreign interests. Dipu Moni ended a four-day visit to India on Thursday, where she met prime minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister SM Krishna, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal. India also promised Bangladesh transit through its terrirtory to Nepal and Bhutan, and fresh water sharing agreements, the foreign minister had said on her return. Turning to a separate matter, Delwar blasted the state minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku for a comment suggesting none of the cases against Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco would be dropped. "It is clear from the state minister's comments the government will not withdraw any cases filed against opposition leaders for political harrassment," Delwar told a press briefing at the BNP party headquarters at Naya Paltan in the capital. Tuku said on Friday the law would "take its own course" in graft cases against former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's two sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco. Speaking at a public meeting at Selanda Bazaar in Pabna, Tuku said criminal cases in the country would lose merit if charges against them were dropped. Tuku alleged Rahman, Coco and associates had siphoned off billions of taka from the power sector alone during the BNP-led coalition rule between 2001-06, and there was no way for the government to withdraw the cases on political consideration. Responding to the statement, Delwar said the government was, however, withdrawing hundreds of cases filed against Awami League leaders: "This is not only regrettable but also highly discriminatory." "We will take to the street if all politically motivated cases against Khaleda Zia, her elder son Tarique Rahman and younger son Arafat Coco are not withdrawn," he said. Delwar said the BNP looked for a peaceful solution to the matter, but the government was pushing them into a "confrontation". The veteran BNP leader also said his party's absence from the House since the AL took office was the result of the ruling party's failure to "create a congenial atmosphere in parliament." bdne
