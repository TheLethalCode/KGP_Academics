 HARARE, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe on Saturday told the first top-level European Union delegation to visit Zimbabwe in seven years he hoped for successful talks. "We welcome you with open arms. We hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome," he said. Mugabe's positive tone may suggest he is more willing to cooperate with Western power crucial for Zimbabwe's efforts to secure billions of dollars in aid and foreign investment.
