 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)The National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports asked for public support on Saturday ahead of Monday's half-day hartal in Dhaka, called by the pressure group to protest gas exploration deals with foreign companies in the Bay of Bengal. "The hartal was called to protect present and future generations of Bangladesh," convener of the committee Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah and member secretary Prof Anu Muhammad said in a joint statement. They said the hartal's success would depend on the strike's observance by the general public. The public pressure group's moves marks the first general strike in the capital since the Awami League-led government took office in January this year. The strike was also called to protest an "unwarranted attack" by police on members of the national committee during a demonstration on Sep 2. A national committee rally was intercepted by police at Paltan on Sept 2 and in the ensuing melee police mounted a baton charge that left committee Prof Anu Muhammed and dozens others injured. The demonstrators had intended to besiege Petrobangla headquarters in the city over the recent exploration deals. The home ministry expressed regret over Anu's injury and said they would reprimand any police officers who acted unlawfully during the incident. On Aug 24, Bangladesh approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc in three sea blocks in the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters in the areas. The national committee claims a provision in the off-shore deals allows the foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of extracted gas, which constitutes a threat to the energy security of Bangladesh. Tullow is one of the largest oil and gas exploration companies in Europe, while ConocoPhillips is the third largest company of this kind in the USA. 'Call off strike' Meanwhile, leading businessmen have requested the national committee to withdraw the announced hartal. The Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries, in a statement on Saturday, said the reasons cited for the strike could be resolved through discussions and does not require a strike. The apex business federation said the strike would hamper public life as well as business, and urged its withdrawal to allow normal activities to take place during Ramadan ahead of Eid. Members of the government and ruling Awami League have also asked for a halt to the hartal, while the main opposition BNP voiced their support for the strike on Friday. bdnew
