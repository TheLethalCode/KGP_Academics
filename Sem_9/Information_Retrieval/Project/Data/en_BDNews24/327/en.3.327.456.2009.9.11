<TITLE> Old Trafford to host Bangladesh Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  Test match cricket will return to Old Trafford in 2010 after it was awarded one of the two Tests against Bangladesh, while Lord's will host three Tests in a season for only the second time in history after securing one of the neutral Australia-Pakistan matches with the other going to Headingley, reports Cricinfo. Leeds was originally due to host Bangladesh, but the switch has been made after recommendations from the ECB's independent major match group. Lancashire had also bid for an Australia-Pakistan game, but the return of England to Old Trafford for a Test will be of some consolation after they controversially missed out on hosting an Ashes Test this summer. There is the possibility of one of the Bangladesh Tests - most likely at Lord's - being converted to a day-night game, if the ICC approves the request from the ECB and the Bangladesh board. However, MCC chief executive Keith Bradshaw stressed that day-night Tests were still dependent on a suitable ball being produced. "There has been much talk of a potential day-night Test match being held at Lord's next season between England and Bangladesh," he said. "MCC has made significant strides in the development of a pink ball and we remain hopeful that further match trials will be conducted here in England in the next few weeks and also overseas throughout the winter. I would stress, however, that we would not want to jeopardise the integrity of Test match cricket by using untested or unproven coloured balls." The last time Lord's hosted three Tests in a summer was in 1912 when England, Australia and South Africa contested a tri-series and Bradshaw said it shows MCC's commitment to the five-day game. "MCC supports the view that Test cricket is the pinnacle of the game, which is why we bid competitively to secure all Test matches that were on offer to us," he said. "In particular, I am thrilled that Bangladesh will be visiting the home of cricket and maintaining the tradition of overseas teams playing at Lord's. MCC submitted a high bid for a neutral Test match in order to offer practical assistance to the Pakistan Cricket Board and the ICC. "It will be an honour for MCC to host a neutral Test match between two great cricketing nations, Australia and Pakistan - especially since Pakistan has been deprived of Test cricket in recent years." Giles Clarke, the ECB's chairman, said the decision to award one of the "neutral" Tests to Headingley reflected a "sensible approach  to ensure that the largest number of members of the Pakistani ethnic community across Britain can see the matches as well as ensuring a good geographical spread of the matches." The Pakistan-Australia Twenty20s will both be at Edgbaston while Cardiff will host the two Twenty20 matches between England and Pakistan. In 2011 the Twenty20 match against India will be at Old Trafford and the Twenty20 against Sri Lanka will be at Bri
