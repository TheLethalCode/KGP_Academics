<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Workers at Barapukuria coal mine continued a strike for a second day Saturday and threatened to go for tougher protests if their demands, mainly for better wages, are not met by Sunday noon. Some 1000 Bangladeshi miners began the strike Thursday midnight to press home their 14-point demand including increase in salaries and festival allowances. Rabiul Islam, convener of 'Barapukuria Workers Rights Committee', said Saturday that they do not want to sit with anybody other than officials from the relevant ministry or department. Committee adviser SM Nuruzzaman also made similar statement as they refused to sit with state minister for land Mustafizur Rahman Fizar as he visited the scene Saturday. The committee leaders said they would only sit with petrobangla chairman or energy secretary. Meanwhile, managing director at Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd Mohammad Kamruzzaman confirmed to bdnews24.com that the miners refused to talk to Fizar, also local member of parliament, after he approached them. But, he said, they were still trying to resolve the issue. bdnews
