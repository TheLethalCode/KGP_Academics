 Pabna, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku on Saturday directed law enforcers to tackle runaway crime in southwestern districts "at any cost" , although he said individual cases would "be considered" of criminals who surrendered peacefully to authorities. "The government can consider the matter if they sincerely want to return to normal life by surrendering," Tuku told reporters after a meeting with law enforcers at Pabna deputy commissioner's office conference room. Tuku said the anti-crime drive, which targets troubled Pabna as well as twelve southwest districts, would gain further momentum in the upcoming days. He also denied the existence of widespread extrajudicial killings by law enforcement agencies in the country, euphemistically referred to as 'crossfire' in media reports. "Some deaths have occurred as law enforcers were required to protect themselves as the drive against terrorists continues," said Tuku. RAB officials, also at the meeting, told bdnews24.com the state minister had directed them to continue the drive after Eid, and update lists of suspected extremists available to law enforcement agencies. The four-hour meeting was attended by local MPs as well as senior police and RAB officials. bdnew
