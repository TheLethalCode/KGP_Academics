<TITLE> ANALYSIS Obama faces quandary over Afghanistan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)On the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States, president Barack Obama has emphatically said his administration will not let its guard down until terrorists were completely vanquished. And that goal, analysts say, cannot be achieved unless Afghanistan, thought to be the safe heaven for Al Qaeda, can be stabilized. Although the new Obama administration, following in the footsteps of his predecessors, has not shied away from investing more military and financial resources aimed at securing Afghanistan, the task is proving more elusive in the face of growing strength of the Taliban and Al Qaeda there. To counter the escalating threat, Gen Stanley McCrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, has reportedly sought more troops to complete his mission. According to news reports, President Obama is having a second thought as to whether he should accede to his commander's request for further enhancement of U.S. military strength because of growing opposition from the American people. With the death toll rising, and the Afghan elections tainted by corruption, the most recent ABC News poll shows only 24 percent of Americans favor an increase in troops. Fifty-one U.S. troops died in Afghanistan in August, more than any other month since the U.S. invasion in October 2001. Many Americans also seem to be worried in part because they see the war is not worth fighting at a time when the United States itself is facing serious financial crisis. The opposition to the war is not coming from the American people only. Rather, the big headache for Obama now is that many key members of his own party are publicly voicing their reservations over further troop increase. Already, there are 62,000 American troops and some reports suggest the commander is asking for an increase up to 100,000. One of those key Democrats is Senator Carl Levin, of Michigan, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. On Friday, Levin said the U.S. mission in Afghanistan should focus more on training than fighting and he's proposing a surge of Afghan security forces precede any buildup of U.S. forces. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already indicated there's not much support for sending in additional troops. But the top Republican on Levin's committee, Senator John McCain, says while he agrees that training for the Afghan forces must be stepped up, a "significant" number of additional U.S. combat troops also must be sent to Afghanistan to clear out the Taliban and keep violent extremists from returning. Next week, Congressional leaders are expected to be briefed on the recent review of Afghanistan strategy by Gen McChrystal. Defense Secretary Gates is also in favor of troop increase. The evolving scenario appears to have put Obama in a quandary about Afghanistan, which could force him to delay his decision over further troops build up. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama's final decision will take "many weeks of evaluation and assessment" before he can settle on the issue.
