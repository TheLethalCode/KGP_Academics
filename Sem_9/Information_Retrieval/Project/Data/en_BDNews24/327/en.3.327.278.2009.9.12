 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Businessmen and ruling party leaders among others have urged the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports to withdraw its announcement of a half-day hartal on Monday. The citizens' action group have called the strike to protest recently approved gas exploration deals with foreign companies in the Bay of Bengal. The Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries, in a statement on Saturday, said the reasons cited for the hartal could be resolved through discussions and did not require such action. The apex business federation said the strike would hamper public life as well as business, and urged its withdrawal to allow normal activities to take place during Ramadan ahead of Eid. FBCCI claims that it is on the side of ensuring the highest level of transparency and neutrality in awarding off-shore exploration deals to foreign companies. It hoped that to maintain a stable economic and safeguard business activities, agreement would be reached peacefully over this national issue. Awami League's acting general secretary Mahbub Alam Hanif also called on the national committee on Saturday to cancel the planned hartal. Talking to reporters in AL's Dhanmondi party office, Hanif said he believed the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its three political allies had a role behind the disruptive call for the half-day general strike "in the name of protecting natural resources". He said the BNP-led four-party alliance is trying to recover its popularity "by making non-issues into political ones". He also claimed the protesters were silent during the military-backed caretaker, which initiated the gas exploration bid, but now they are active. Hanif said the protesters should look into details of the deals with US company ConocoPhillips and Ireland's Tullow Oil plc. Members of the government and other ruling Awami League leaders have also asked for a halt to the hartal in recent days, while the main opposition BNP voiced their support for the strike on Friday. Nat'l committee calls for public support Meanwhile, the national committee asked for public support on Saturday ahead of the planned hartal. "It was called to protect present and future generations of Bangladesh," convener of the committee Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah and member secretary Prof Anu Muhammad said in a joint statement. They said the hartal's success would depend on the strike's observance by the general public. The public pressure group's moves marks the first general strike in the capital since the Awami League-led government took office in January this year. The strike was also called to protest an "unwarranted attack" by police on members of the national committee during a demonstration on Sep 2. A national committee rally was intercepted by police at Paltan on Sept 2 and in the ensuing melee police mounted a baton charge that left committee Prof Anu Muhammed and dozens others injured. The demonstrators had intended to besiege Petrobangla headquarters in the city over the recent exploration deals. The home ministry expressed regret over Anu's injury and said they would reprimand any police officers who acted unlawfully during the incident, but the government has condemned the call for hartal. On Aug 24, Bangladesh approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with Conoco and Tullow in three sea blocks of the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters within the blocks. The national committee claims a provision in the off-shore deals allows the foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of extracted gas, which constitutes a threat to the energy security of Bangladesh. bdnews24.co
