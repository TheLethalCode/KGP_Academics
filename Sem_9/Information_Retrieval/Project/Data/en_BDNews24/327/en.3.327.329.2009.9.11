 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)--Opposition chief Khaleda Zia left Dhaka on Friday on an Emirates flight for Saudi Arabia to perform the Omrah. This is the BNP chairperson's first trip abroad since the clampdown of emergency on Jan 11, 2007 and her release from prison on bail on this day a year ago. The last time she performed the Omrah was in end-2006, when she was the prime minister. "The BNP chairperson is setting out for Saudi Arabia to perform the Omrah at the invitation of the Saudi king Abdullah Abdul Aziz Al Saud," Maruf Kamal Khan, her press secretary to bdnews24.com before boarding the flight in the morning. "She will spend days there as the royal guest of the king," he added. "Khaleda Zia's detention ended on Sept 11, 2008. She has conveyed her wishes to all of her countrymen on the anniversary of her release today." "She also sought everybody's blessings. The caretaker government had sent her to jail and pressured her to send her family members abroad, but she was unyielding." Khaleda is scheduled to return to Bangladesh on Sept 19, Khan said. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, standing committee member Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque and others saw the BNP chief off at ZIA at 11am. Her entourage includes her younger brother Shamim Eskander, his wife Kaneez Fatema, Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman's wife Syeda Sharmila Rahman, her daughters Jasia Rahman and Jahia Rahman, former foreign secretary Shamsher Mubin Chowdhury, press secretary Khan, Khaleda's personal assistant Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas, Mahbub Al Amin Dew. b
