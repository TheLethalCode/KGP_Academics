 NEW DELHI, Tue Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India can counter the global slowdown through public spending, particularly on infrastructure, but that alone will not restore the economy to 9 percent growth rate, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Tuesday. The government, which last month won an unexpectedly strong election victory, would focus on its employment, education, rural and agricultural development programmes, he told parliament. "As I said, we cannot spend our way to prosperity, though in the present situation there is considerable scope to increase public expenditure, particularly on infrastructure projects," Singh said. He said higher public spending was the right approach in a slowdown, as it would aid development and lift the country's growth potential without sparking inflationary pressures. "I recognise, though, that fiscal system is under strain. The fiscal deficit has increased," Singh said. "But I do believe that, in the short term, even then we have the manoeuvrability to spend more resources on our flagship programmes," he said, noting the government's strategy would become clearer when its released its budget next month. Singh said five years of strong growth had generated robust revenues for the government to use to support the poor, and it intended to expand programmes such as the rural job scheme and enact a food security law to guarantee cheap grains. Fears the extra spending would widen an already large fiscal deficit and force the government to borrow more from the market than it has projected have rattled the bond market this year and pushed up yields. In February's interim budget, the government projected record gross borrowing of 3.6 trillion rupees in the year ending March 2010. It also forecast the budget deficit would fall to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product. The deficit for 2008/09 widened to 6.2 percent of GDP, more than double the initial estimate of 2.5 percent and higher than February's revised estimate of 6 percent. The deficit has widened on a combination of increased spending and slowing revenues as economic growth slowed from rates of 9 percent to 6.7 percent in 2008/09, the slowest in six years. Singh said with savings rates of up to 35 percent, India was in a position to right itself and return to high growth rates even if the global economy did not pick up. In the current financial year the government expected growth of at least 7 percent, which he said was the best that could be expected in the short term. "Therefore, the ambition that our government has is that notwithstanding developments in the global economy, our country must have the resilence to so manage its affairs that it grows at the annual rate of 8 to 9 percent." The government has front-loaded its borrowing into the first half of 2009/10 so that it can spend more to turn the economy around, and has said it expects growth to pick up from around Septe
