 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam tabled the Public Servants (Marriage with Foreign Nationals) Amendment Bill. If passed, the bill, having similar content to an ordinance of past caretaker government from 2008, will allow members of the foreign service to marry foreign nationals. In the past, all public servants except foreign service officials could marry foreign nationals, subject to the president's permission. The interim government passed an ordinance in 2008 as Bangladesh's permanent representative to the United Nations sought the president's permission to marry a Dutch national. Syed Ashraful Islam, in charge of the cabinet division in parliament, introduced another bill on dismissal of convicted of public servants. The bill was aimed at increasing punishment for public servants with conviction. Both the bills were referred to the parliamentary standing committee on the establishment ministry for further examination of the bills which would send those back for passage through the House. Agriculture minister Begum Matia Chowdhury on Tuesday tabled the National Agriculture Award Fund (Amendment) Bill in parliament to insert the term Bangabandhu into the title of the fund established through an ordinance in 1976. The award will be called "Bangabandhu National Agriculture Award Fund" if the bill is passed. It was sent to parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of agriculture for further scrutiny before passage. State minister for science and technology and information communication technology tabled a bill to amend the ordinance on information and communication technology. The bill also went to the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology and information communication technology for further examinations.
