 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)The government on Tuesday recalled Bangladesh high commissioner to Maldives Prof Selina Mohsin, said foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain. "She has been asked to come back immediately," Hossain told bdnews24.com. The recall means her two-year contract with the government no longer exists, foreign ministry officials have said. Selina Mohsin was appointed high commissioner to Maldives on Sept 7 last year, for a two-year term, by the immediate past caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed. She was formerly an adviser to Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) before being appointed Bangladesh envoy in Male.
