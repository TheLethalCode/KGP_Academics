 Dhaka, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to bring private courier services under the law, while the postal department has been authorised to outsource a number of services. A cabinet meeting presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina Monday provisionally endorsed the Post Office (Amendment) Act 2009, which also afforded legal status to the courier services, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said at a press briefing on Monday. The Jute (Amendment) Act 2009 was also approved in the meeting, Azad added. The Jute Ordinance-1962 was formulated to registrar jute and jute industries and for their development. Later the ordinance was partially amended in 1974 and in 1983. "An inter-ministerial meeting in April decided two amendments, one to measure jute bales by the kilogramme instead of the maund ," said Azad. The other was to include the rope in the measure, he said. Monday's cabinet meeting approved the suggestions. Reports on the participation of Bangladesh at the 42nd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank board of governors and the annual meeting of ESCAP in Bangkok were also presented before the cabinet. "The finance minister led the delegates to the ADB meeting, where he said Bangladesh had survived the first wave of the global financial crunch," Azad said. Bangladesh held discussions with China, the Philippines, Indonesia, UK and India over trade balance and other mutual interest issues at the meeting. The ADB has committed to provide Bangladesh with $200 million in budget aid up to December, said Azad. bdnews24.com/
