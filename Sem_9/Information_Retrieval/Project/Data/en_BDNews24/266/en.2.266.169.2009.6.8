<TEXT>
 LIMA, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuador stayed in the hunt for a third successive World Cup appearance by winning 2-1 at hapless Peru on Sunday. Carlos Tenorio headed the second-half winner after teenager Jefferson Montero had put the visitors ahead. Fiorentina's Juan Vargas briefly brought Peru back into the match by scoring from a free kick in between. Ecuador, who host Argentina on Wednesday, moved up to sixth place in the 10-team group, level on 17 points with fifth-placed Uruguay and one ahead of Venezuela. Peru, who last qualified in 1982, are bottom with seven points. The top four teams qualify directly for South Africa and the fifth play off over two legs for another place. Brazil and Paraguay top the group with 24 points followed by Chile (23) and Argentina (22). All teams have five matches to play. Ecuador were playing their first competitive game since 2000 without either of their stalwart defenders Giovanny Espinoza and Ivan Hurtado. In their absence, Uruguay-born Marcelo Fleitas was given his international debut at the age of 35. Ecuador went ahead eight minutes before halftime with a counter-attack which finished with Tenorio slipping the ball to Montero for the 19-year-old Villarreal player to sidefoot home. Vargas curled in a free kick seven minutes into the second half to level but Ecuador needed only five minutes to regain the lead. Cristian Noboa floated in a cross from the right and the Peru defence stopped to appeal for offside, leaving Tenorio free to score with a powerful header from near the penalty spot
