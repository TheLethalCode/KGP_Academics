 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  RAJUK allotted plots in the capital's Banani, Uttara and Purbachal residential areas to 115 MPs during the past BNP-led government, almost all going to the ruling alliance members, the state minister for housing said on Monday. The MPs included 104 of the then ruling BNP-led four-party alliance, six of the then opposition Awami League and five from Jatiya Party, Abdul Mannan Khan told parliament in reply to AL MP Muhibur Rahman Manik. . Four BNP leaders and non-MPs also received the land allocations in the 'MP category', bringing the total number of the allotted 5- katha and 10- katha plots to 119, he said Ruling AL members said Monday most of the MPs of the previous government already owned land in the capital when they received the plots from city development authority RAJUK. On their concern for now-sitting MPs who owned no land in Dhaka, Khan said plots would be allotted to those who had applied for them in the new Uttara-Purbachal development. They would be offered soon after scrutinising around 165,000 applications, he said. RAJUK's sought after plots, to be had for less than market value, are generally allotted by lottery. In reply to a supplementary query, Khan said specific allegations against illegal allotment will be looked into. On plans to resolve housing problems in the city, the minsiter mentioned "four satellite towns, including the Jhilmil project." He said the government would resolve housing problems at Upazila and district levels with multi-storied apartment buildings. Teachers went abroad, stayed abroad A total of 192 teachers public universities have remained abroad, having failed to return after their sabbaticals ended, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid told parliament in reply to a question Monday. They went to pursue education or research opportunities, and did not return home even after their work ended, he said. Of them, 100 have been terminated and due money extracted from them while steps against the 92 others are being taken under university laws, he also said. In replying to a query from Rashed Khan Menon, MP for Dhaka-10, originally from Barisal, Nahid said a public university will be instituted in the district. Steps for its establishment have already been taken, said the minsiter. In reply to another question, minister said the government plans to supply free books at secondary school level. A totoal of over 8 million schoolchildren will get books for free with this move, he said.
