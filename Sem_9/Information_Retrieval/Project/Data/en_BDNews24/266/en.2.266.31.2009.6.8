 YAOUNDE, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon and Morocco played out a 0-0 draw in their World Cup qualifier on Sunday, leaving the two nations struggling to qualify for next year's World Cup finals in South Africa. The result increased the chances of modest Gabon qualifying for the first time. They head the group with six points from two games after beating Togo in Libreville 3-0 on Saturday. In March, the small Central African country obtained a stunning victory, beating Morocco 1-0 in Casablanca. At the same time, Cameroon also lost to Togo 1-0. Gabon now top the group with six points, followed by Togo on three and Morocco and Cameroon with one point each. "This is a major setback for us, but all is not yet lost. We can still make it to South Africa," said Indomitable Lions interim coach Thomas Nkono. "We'll now need to go back to the drawing board and work a formula to win our next game against Gabon in Libreville. It's not going to be easy but I think we can still win the match.
