<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Tue Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's prime minister was due in Karachi on Tuesday, keen to keep a lid on bloody political rivalry in which 34 people have been killed this month while the government is preoccupied with fighting Taliban in the northwest. Pakistan's biggest city is the country's economic hub, home to its financial markets and main port which is a gateway for many supplies for Western forces battling the Taliban in landlocked Afghanistan. While the violence over the past week has been confined to targeted tit-for-tat shootings, there are fears street clashes could erupt which would batter investor confidence and could cause far-reaching disruption. Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani was due in the city of 16 million people later on Tuesday. "There's no way that the government can afford to open up another front and that's why the prime minister is coming to Karachi in an attempt to resolve this," said a provincial government official. The Pakistani army has been battling Taliban in the Swat valley for more than a month. The militants have responded with a wave of bomb attacks in towns and cities. Gilani will meet police chiefs, security officials and provincial government leaders, a government spokesman said. The violence is between Karachi's dominant political force, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), and a breakaway faction known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, or Haqiqi group, as they vie for influence. Stock market dealers say investors are keeping a wary eye on the violence, with any escalation likely to hurt the fragile market. The main index was up about 2 percent by 0625 GMT. Police said eight political party workers were killed on Monday, taking the toll since the beginning of the month to 34. HISTORY OF VIOLENCE The MQM is part of the federal coalition and governs in Sindh province, of which Karachi is capital. But the MQM, which earned a reputation for violence during vicious street fighting in the 1990s, suspects its enemies are using the breakaway faction to weaken its grip on power. The MQM has also criticised the police for failing to protect its members. Gilani was expected to try to reassure the party and appeal to both sides to end the bloodshed. "He is likely to address the concerns of the government's coalition partners, especially with regards to the performance of the police," said the provincial government official, who declined to be identified. Karachi has a long history of ethnic, religious and sectarian violence. Both factions involved in the violence draw their support from the Urdu-speaking families of people who moved to Pakistan from India upon independence from Britain in 1947. Those people, commonly known as mohajirs, or immigrants, flocked to Karachi where they competed for political and economic power with native Sindhis and later with the many ethnic Pashtun people who have moved into the metropolis. This year, 27 people were killed in clashes between mohajirs and Pashtuns sparked by fear that Taliban militants, who are predominantly Pashtun, were infiltrating the
