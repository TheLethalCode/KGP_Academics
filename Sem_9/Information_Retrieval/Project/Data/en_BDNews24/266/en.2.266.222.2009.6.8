<TITLE> Bangladesh out of World T20 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's hopes of qualifying for the Super Eights of the ICC World Twenty20 were dashed when they suffered a six-wicket defeat to Ireland in their Group A do-or-die match at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on Monday. Ireland, comprising of county cricketers, reached 138-4 with 10 balls to spare after Bangladesh could manage 137-8. Ireland reached the Super Eights along with India, who will face the Irish in a group-deciding encounter on June 10. After going down to defending champions India by 25 runs in the first match, Bangladesh needed to win against Ireland, who also stunned Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Definitely the score Bangladesh put on the board was not enough to defend and captain Mohammad Ashraful's bowling changes were also questionable as he kept spinner Abdur Razzak out of the attack until 11th over and by that time the Irish had recovered from a sluggish start to reach 70-2. Razzak was introduced in the 12th over and proved his worth removing opener William Porterfield for 23 with his second delivery, but the captain did not bother to use Razzak's fourth over. Ashraful even did not consider to use Naeem Islam, who conceded just nine runs in the two overs he bowled. Basically it was the O'Brien brothers who turned the match in Ireland's favour as one-down Niall O'Brien played a hurricane 25-ball 40-run innings, of which he smashed three sixes off Mashrafee in an over. Niall also smashed three fours in his innings. It seemed Bangladesh were in the match till the start of 15th over after Mashrafee removed Gray Wilson in 14.2 overs, and Kevin O'Brien came to the middle to change the scenario. Needing 48 runs from 34 deliveries, Kevin O'Brien smacked two sixes and four fours in his 17-ball 39-run knock to propel Ireland home with 10 balls to spare. John Mooney was not out with 17 off 14 balls. Earlier, Bangladesh recovered from a lacklustre batting display early in the innings as most of the batsmen struggled against some quality Irish bowling to finish on 137-8. It was all Ireland for 19 overs as they kept Bangladesh's run rate below six until that point. Johnston was the star bowler finishing with 3-20 off his four overs rattling the Tigers' top order. But the last over of the innings saved Bangladesh's blushes as Mashrafee Bin Mortaza hit Alex Cusack for 20 runs with two sixes, taking the score past the 135-run mark and giving them something to defend. Mortaza finished with 33 off 16 balls and was their top scorer. The batsmen apparently threw their wickets away despite having made a confident start with Junaed Siddique smashing two successive fours in the opening over from Boyd Rankin to pick up 10 runs. The left-handed opener, Bangladesh's top-scorer against India, also took on Trent Johnston to hitting the first delivery Johnston bowled for a boundary and then went for the big one down the wicket in the next delivery only to see his skier caught by Jeremy Bray, leaving the side at 15-1 in 1.2 overs. When a solid partnership was needed, captain Mohammad Ashraful also threw his wicket away after being dropped on one at first slip by Kevin O'Brien off Johnson, who finally removed the Bangladesh captain for 14 off 10 balls studded with one six and one four. Johnston was the Irish hero after having Shakib Al Hasan caught by Gray Wilson for seven and then Tamim Iqbal was unfortunately run out for 22 and Bangladesh's hopes of piling up huge total was then dashed. Mushfiqur Rahim and Roqibul Hasan made 14 and 13 respectively before Mashrafee's big hitting in the final over. bd
