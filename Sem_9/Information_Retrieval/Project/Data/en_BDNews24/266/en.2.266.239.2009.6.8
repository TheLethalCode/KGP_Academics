 RIO DE JANEIRO, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sport Recife scored four goals in seven minutes as they came from two goals down to beat Flamengo 4-2 on Sunday and give new coach Emerson Leao a winning start. Emerson scored two quick goals to put the visitors 2-0 ahead after only nine minutes of the Brazilian championship match. Durval headed one back for Sport in the 26th minute, then Weldon scored a six-minute hat-trick to put the hosts 4-2 ahead. Both teams boosted their defences after halftime and there was no further scoring. The two clubs share an intense rivalry which goes back to 1987 when Sport were declared Brazilian champions after a prolonged political dispute. Flamengo, who won a breakaway league formed by Brazil's biggest clubs, have always claimed to be the legitimate champions from that year when Leao was also coach of Sport. Leaders Internacional lost their 100 percent record in a rough 1-1 draw at Cruzeiro. Marcao headed Internacional in front after five minutes but the game turned nasty when Cruzeiro forward Kleber and Internacional goalkeeper Lauro were sent off for fighting in the 16th minute. Wellington Paulista equalised at the start of the second half as Internacional stayed top with 13 points from five games, two ahead of Atletico Mineiro. Atletico Paranaense coach Geninho resigned after his team lost 4-0 at home to Atletico Mineiro, leaving them bottom of the table with one point from five games. "I want to apologise to the supporters for these results but it's part of football," said Geninho, who had been in charge since September. Paranaense had Marcinho sent off for a dangerous tackle in the 31st minute when they were already trailing 1-0 to a goal by Junior. Diego Tardelli added a second 10 minutes after the re-start and Eder Luis scored twice more in the last 15 minutes
