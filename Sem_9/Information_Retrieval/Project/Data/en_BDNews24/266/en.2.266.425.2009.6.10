 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)A youth was killed as Sultanganj Union Parishad chairman Monir Hossain shot into a crowd of angry protestors in Kamrangirchar on Tuesday, said local police. "Another man, whom we feared dead after a gunshot to the head, survived but is in critical condition," said deputy police commissioner of Lalbagh Zone Abdul Malek. Malek said the dead youth was as 18 year-old woodworker Muhammad Hasan. Mahfuzur Rahman,a fellow woodshop worker, said Hasan received a bullet in the chest as the chairman opened fire at an angry mob in the middle of a heated dispute. Hasan was rushed to Mitford Hospital around 3pm where the duty doctor declared him dead, said Mahfuz. Two others also received bullet injuries in the incident, said Malek. Police had initially believed two people killed, he added. Witnesses told bdnews24.com that a group of locals, protesting about the expansion of a local road, had laid siege to the UP chairman in his car at Lohar Bridge. The protestors mobbed his car as Monir was trying to drive away, they said. After the shooting, Monir managed to flee, but hundreds of furious locals went on to attack his Ashrafabad residence. The mob set fire to his garage, burning a second vehicle belonging to the chairmanan SUV. Lalbagh Zone fire brigade's senior officer Manikuzzaman said firefighters rushed to the spot to extinguish the blaze, bringing it under control at around 3.30pm. Family members claimed Monir, who is BNP's Kamrangirchar unit president, was "forced to fire" with "a licensed gun" at local Awami League leaders who attacked him. Local Awami League leaders said they had not attacked or provoked him in any way. AL leaders and supporters in the area were gathering at Lohar Bridge at around 1:30pm for a meeting organised the Dhaka City Jubo League, Kamal Hossain Shipon, joint secretary of AL's Kamrangirchar unit, told bdnews24.com. Local Awami League leaders and activists of associated organisations went to the residence of local MP and state minister for law Kamrul Islam on Monday, he said. They had raised various allegations, including embezzlement of relief, against the chairman who was present at the minister's home in person, said Shipon. Shipon said he believed that it was in sequel to Monday's incident that Tuesday's shooting occurred. Sonia Akhtar Maya, wife of the UP chairman's younger brother, said local AL leaders and activists had been pressing Hossain for several days to abet them in illegal land acquisition. But he refused and informed the minister of the issue, she claimed. The aggrieved AL leaders attacked his car on Tuesday, so he shot at them to escape, she said quoting those who had been with the chairman in the car. He fled the scene by car to save his life, she said. bdnews2
