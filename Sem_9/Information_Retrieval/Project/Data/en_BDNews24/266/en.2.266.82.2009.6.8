<TITLE> Gaddafi in historic Italian trip amid investment drive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Mon Jun 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi makes his first trip to former colonial ruler Italy this week in the most open acknowledgement yet that the two nations have put their bitter past behind them to forge deeper investment ties. Italy's $5 billion reparations deal last year for more than 30 years of rule paved the way for the visit, which comes almost a century after Italian ships arrived off Tripoli in 1911 claiming to rescue Libya from Ottoman rule. Libya now is pumping its petrodollars into major Italian companies like UniCredit and Eni, in addition to supplying a quarter of Italy's oil imports and helping curb the inflow of illegal migrants. "This trip is very symbolic, because here is Gaddafi who has been saying for 40 years how badly Italians have treated Libyans and how in the end Libya would win out," said Dirk Vandewalle, a professor at Dartmouth College in the US and Libya expert. "All of that has come to fruition because Italy, like the rest of the world, is courting the regime for obvious economic reasons. It vindicates Gaddafi to Italians and also to Libyans." Gaddafi's message to ordinary Italians takes center-stage in the four-day visit starting on Wednesday, with a spate of public appearances that includes addressing students and 700 Italian women. He also meets Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- who flew to Libya last year to sign the landmark compensation deal -- and senior politicians and business leaders. Italian business will be closely watching to see if the visit boosts Libya's growing tally of Italian investments, as the oil producer's $65 billion sovereign wealth fund weighs a stake in Italian power producer Enel. Libya's investment drive in Italy has only just begun and Italian firms can also hope for lucrative contracts in post-sanctions Libya as among the fruits of warmer political ties, analysts say. For all of Gaddafi's rants against his nation's former colonial master, the two countries maintained economic ties through the years. "Rhetorically, there's always been antagonism between the two countries, but despite all the controversy and the bad relations, it has been business as usual," Vandewalle said. "This trip certainly indicates that the regime is yielding to a lot more pragmatism and finally acknowledging that the relations between the two countries remain important." Gaddafi, who overthrew the monarchy in 1969, will be back in July -- in his role as head of the African Union -- at the G8 summit which U.S. President Barack Obama will also at
