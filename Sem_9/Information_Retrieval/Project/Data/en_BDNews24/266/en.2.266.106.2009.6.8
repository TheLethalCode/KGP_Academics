 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) - The government does not want the opposition in parliament, the BNP chairperson told a visiting European Union delegation on Monday. "We want to go to parliament," said the leader of the opposition and former prime minister. "We are cooperating with the government." "But, the government shows no interest in having us in parliament," said Khaleda, whose party has refused to attend parliament for most of its first session and the current budget session because of an ongoing dispute over front row seats. Khaleda's foreign affairs adviser Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury briefed reporters after her meeting with the visiting EU Troika delegation. Headed by the Czech Republic's deputy minister for foreign affairs Helena Bambasova, the delegation arrived in Dhaka Sunday on a two-day visit. Chowdhury said Khaleda also talked with Troika on bilateral issues. Bambasova told reporters after the meeting that the government and the opposition had to make parliament effective through mutual understanding. "The opposition party should go to parliament. The government also needs to play a role in having them in parliament," she said. The seating dispute between the ruling and opposition parties has been brewing since the new parliament convened in January. On 'extra judicial killings' Asked about the recent concern in Bangladesh over 'extra-judicial killings', she said her delegation had talked with the government about the issue. She said they had been assured the government in no way condoned such killings. At least 10 people have been reported killed, in recent weeks, in 'exchanges of gunfire' involving Rapid Action Battalion and police. Most recently, controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital last week. The 'incidents' in question should be properly investigated through a transparent process, said Bambasov on Monday. The EU delegation chief said good governance, protection of human rights, climate change and education were among the main challenges facing Bangladesh. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and another adviser to the BNP chairperson, Riaz Rahman, also attended the one hour meeting on Monday evening. The EU Troika delegation had earlier met with the foreign minister, finance minister and foreign secretary. b
