 PARIS, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer said he would never again feel any pressure in his career after clinching his first French Open title with a 6-1 7-6 6-4 victory over Swede Robin Soderling on Sunday. "It might be the greatest victory of my career," said the 27-year-old Swiss, who equalled Pete Sampras's record of 14 grand slam titles and became the sixth man to win all four majors.

World number two Federer was presented with the Musketeers' Cup by Andre Agassi, the only man before him to have won the four grand slams on all surfaces.
