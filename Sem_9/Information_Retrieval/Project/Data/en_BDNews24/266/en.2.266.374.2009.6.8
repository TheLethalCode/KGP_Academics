 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The home ministry on Monday stepped up security at court premises after the law ministry had asked for heightened security the previous day over 'possible militant attacks', a ministry official said. "Security has been beefed up at the court premises on the recommendation of the law ministry. The order is being sent to the districts," the home ministry official preferring to remain unnamed told bdnews24.com. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed said on Sunday his ministry had sent a letter to the home on the basis of intelligence reports for measures against any militant threat or action. "We are not apprehending any attack, but we have recommended this as a preventive measure," he said. The home ministry's joint secretary Md Nurun Nabi Talukder told bdnews24.com in the evening, "No doubt, initiatives are being taken to ensure the highest security measures. Letters are being sent to the inspector general of police and the law-enforcing agencies concerned." The home ministry is acting on the recommendation of the law ministry after the Supreme Court wrote to the law ministry, Talukder said. A top official said the home ministry's directives will reach the authorities by Tuesday. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque said, "Security at the Supreme Court has been intensified." He was yet to receive any letter from the home ministry until 7:45pm on Monday. The Dhaka police chief said they will look into any information about militancy or terrorist attack. An intelligence agency recently warned the law ministry, and other relevant authorities, of a possible attack on the Supreme Court, a law ministry official told bdnews24.com Sunday. Quoting government officials, news agency Reuters reported Monday: "Bangladesh has ordered security stepped up at government installations across the country amid fears of possible attacks by Islamists or criminal gangs." "The alert comes as the south Asian country prepares to put on trial later this month dozens of people alleged to have committed war crimes during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence," the news agency said. It also mentioned renewed activities of banned Islamist militant outfit Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh that carried out bomb attacks has been accused of a series of bomb attacks from 2005 onward. Security officials also feared attacks following the recent arrest of four associates of Indian underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. The arrestees confessed to the judicial magistrate's court of having run a clandestine criminal network for Karachi-based Ibrahim, according to media reports. One of them said about 100 of Ibrahim's agents were active in Bangladesh, one newspaper reported. Police and intelligence officials say they have been reorganising themselves since the Awami League-led government assumed office in January. bdnew
