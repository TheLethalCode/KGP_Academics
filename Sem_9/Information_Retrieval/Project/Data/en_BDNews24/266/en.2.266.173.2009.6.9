 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)Deputy attorneys general will be assigned to monitor and run all the cases against the land ministry, including those under Vested Property Act, the land minister said on Tuesday. The decision was taken in consultation with the law ministry, Rezaul Karim Hira told reporters after two separate meetings at the ministry on monitoring various cases and leasing out sandy land. The cases were run in the past by appointing lawyers outside of government payroll but they rarely succeeded, he said. So the government suffered losses in many ways including losing in the cases, Hira said. On the lease of sandy land, he said deputy commissioners have been asked to obey laws in leasing out various 'marked sandy land' so that no installation, dam or river is affected with the move. They were also instructed to coordinate with BIWTA in leasing out the land, he said. A vested quarter took lease of the sandy land during the rule of former BNP-led four-party coalition government, he said and alleged that they would flout rules in taking lease. He suggested land be leased at new prices to increase revenue. On the conflict of the land ministry with the BIWTA and port authorities, he said work was going on over the two outdated laws made in 1908 and 1966. These would be placed soon before the cabinet meeting, the minister said
