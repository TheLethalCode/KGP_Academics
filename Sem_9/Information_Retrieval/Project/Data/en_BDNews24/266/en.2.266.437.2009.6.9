 LONDON, Tue Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two thirds of businesses are unaware they will be able to use their own name in place of domain extensions such as .com, .org, or .net when Internet domains are liberalized next year, according to a survey. The change would let the likes of Nike or Microsoft control their own domain and better exploit their brands, and also counter cyber-squatters who use variations of brands on the 280 or so existing domain extensions.

Smaller businesses will be able to use more specific extensions to match their business sector or geography such as ".london" or ".paris," he said.
