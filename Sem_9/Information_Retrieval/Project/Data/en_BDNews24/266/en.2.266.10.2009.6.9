 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) - The Human Rights Commission Act will be passed in the current session of parliament, the law minister said on Tuesday. The ordinance that was placed as a bill in the last session is now under scrutiny of the standing committee on law. The actions that have been done under the ordinance initiated by the immediate past caretaker government will be validated with the passing of the bill. On rendering parliament effective, Shafiq Ahmed said, "The government and the opposition want to see parliament as the centre of all work and talk." "The opposition has to play an active role as well to make parliament effective." Talking on trying 1971 war crimes, he said the process admitted of no more doubt. The government wants the trial process to be transparent and internationally acceptable, he said. "These cases are not being filed against anyone, nor will they be tried, with a political motive," he said. bd
