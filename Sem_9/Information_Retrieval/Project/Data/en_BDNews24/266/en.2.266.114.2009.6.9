 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)The government has appointed new ambassadors to Malaysia and Vietnam, foreign ministry statements said on Tuesday. AKM Atiqur Rahman, currently serving as Bangladesh ambassador to Bhutan, has been made the next high commissioner to Malaysia. A career diplomat Atiqur Rahman joined the Bangladesh Civil Service (Foreign Affairs) cadre in 1986, the statement said. Rahman served in Rome, Dakar and Hong Kong before becoming ambassador to Bhutan. He will replace Md Khairuzzaman who was recalled to the foreign ministry a few months back to face possible charges in the 'Jail Killings' case of 1975. Khairuzzaman, a former army major, has refused to come back and sought political asylum elsewhere, foreign ministry sources have said. Supradip Chakma, now serving as the director general of Far East wing at the foreign ministry, has been appointed Bangladesh ambassador to Vietnam. He will replace M Maroof Zaman who was appointed ambassador in December last year.
