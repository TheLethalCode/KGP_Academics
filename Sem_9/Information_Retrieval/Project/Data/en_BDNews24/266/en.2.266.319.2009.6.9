<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - So rarely do the British press get an opportunity to mock Australian cricketers that newspapers went into overdrive on Tuesday after the team's shock Twenty20 World Cup exit. Sri Lanka and the West Indies beat Australia within three days to dump Ricky Ponting's side out of the tournament, prompting a press barrage. "What do you call an Aussie at the Twenty20? A spectator," said the Daily Mirror, while its headline read: "Edna Average", in reference to Australian comedian Barry Humphries's stage persona Dame Edna Everage. The Sun wrote: "Even Ireland make the Super 8s but Ricky's boys crash out as wallybies" (Eds: correct). Australian paper The Age chipped in with stern words after Monday's second defeat at Trent Bridge. "This was not what the Australian brains trust had in mind when they plotted to add some Twenty20 silverware to the cabinet that holds the last three 50-over World Cups. "The result has forced a major review of the squad's travel plans. Penance will be served with a six-day camp in Leicester, where members of the Test squad will bunker down until they switch to Ashes mode later in the month." The five-test Ashes series begins in Cardiff on July 8. The tourist board in the Midlands city of Leicester published a list of attractions to keep the Australians amused, ranging from the local zoo to a music festival with Billy Bragg. Last time Australia were in Leicester, 2005 batsman Michael Clarke had his kit bag stolen. Former Australian batsman Mark Waugh told British radio programme Talksport that his compatriots would benefit from the extra warm-up time. "If they had made the final of the Twenty20 then it would have reduced the preparation time for the Test series so I think in a way it will do them good.
