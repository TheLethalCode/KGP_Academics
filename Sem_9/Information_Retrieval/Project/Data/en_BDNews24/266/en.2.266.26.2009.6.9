<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 9 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering to run irrigation pumps in haor (marshland) and coastal areas on solar energy, the prime minister's energy affairs adviser said on Tuesday. "If the technology is not expensive we'll consider it," Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury said at a workshop in the capital. "We've asked the researchers to find out a solution and we're hopeful," he said. As part of implementation of the Awami League's election manifesto on putting more emphasis on renewable energy, the advisor said they have asked the Power Cell to float tender to set up a 50 megawatt wind power plant. "Along with this, we've also asked the meteorology department to prepare a wind map to facilitate the wind power plant," he said. "We've talked with Russia and they said 5-10 megawatt power is possible to produce from small heavy-current rivers." Toufiq said he was expecting an expert team from Russia, which was due in Dhaka last month, to get into the details. The workshop was organised by the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and the US Energy Association. bdn
