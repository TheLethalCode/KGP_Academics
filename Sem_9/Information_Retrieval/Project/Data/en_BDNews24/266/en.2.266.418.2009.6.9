 TOKYO, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan coach Takeshi Okada will have no contact with his staff or players during Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Qatar after he was slapped with a one-match ban for his behaviour during the country's last game. Okada had planned to communicate via walkie-talkie but will leave the radio transceiver in the hands of coaching staff after Japan clinched their spot in the 2010 World Cup finals at the weekend, Japanese officials told Reuters on Tuesday. The 52-year-old was handed the touchline ban by FIFA after being ordered from the bench during Japan's 1-0 victory in Uzbekistan on Saturday, a win that ensured the side advanced to a fourth straight finals. Okada was ordered from the bench after protesting Makoto Hasebe's late sending off and the midfielder will also miss Wednesday's match through suspension. South Korea and Australia have also qualified with one automatic spot remaining for Asian sides. Qatar can still qualify for South Africa via a playoff spot. Okada will return for Japan's final Group One fixture away to Australia on June 17
