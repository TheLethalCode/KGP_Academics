 Dhaka, June 08 (bdnews24.com)The European Union Troika mission has urged Bangladesh and its neighbours in South Asian to work for better regional integration and cooperation to serve mutual interests. "We have been speaking about cooperation of Bangladesh with India, about the relations with Pakistan and Myanmar also and about SAARC and the possible cooperation with ASEAN," the mission head told reporters Monday after meeting foreign minister Dipu Moni. The Troika mission, headed by Czech Republic's deputy minister for foreign affairs Helena Bambasova, arrived in Dhaka Sunday on a two-day visit. "We are encouraging you, that you use benefits of cooperation in all aspects that are of common interest in the region," said Bambasova. She said the integration of the region was "very low", echoing a similar comment by Dipu Moni just days before. "We would recommend that all the countries of the region try to cooperate more and integrate more, but it is for you, your government and other countries to do so," said Bambasova. The visiting mission head said she had talks on Bangladesh-EU trade relations, EU investment and development cooperation. The other mission members are Marek Libricky, deputy director (Asia) of the Czech foreign ministry, Jan Kreuter, deputy head of the Czech embassy in New Delhi. It also includes Stefan Frowein, the European Commission ambassador in Bangladesh, and Genoveva Hernandez Uriz, a director general at the EC in charge of the Bangladesh desk, Morgan McSwiney, an EC policy unit counsellor for South Asia and David Tirr, the EC's head of policy for Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Afghanistan Swedish ambassador in Bangladesh Britt F Hagstrom and the embassy's counsellor (politics and trade) Karin Ohman also joined the team in its meeting with the foreign minister.
