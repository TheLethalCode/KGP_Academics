 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam says BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain is daydreaming about interim polls on dissolution of parliament. "Bangladesh is no 'fools' paradise' that we'll dissolve parliament only five months after the election, when people elected us for a five-year term," Ashraf, the local government minister, told reporters on Tuesday after an AL presidium meeting in the party president's Dhanmondi office. No such issue has surfaced or emergency arisen that called for parliament to be dissolved, he added. In a protest rally organised by BNP on Monday, Delwar claimed the government's popularity has dwindled to 'zero' in the past five months. "To disprove this, we challenge you to dissolve parliament and go for a free and fair election," he had said. "It must be a genuinely free and fair election, not a 'stage-managed' one," Delwar said, referring to the opposition claims that the Dec 29 parliamentary polls were rigged. The local government minister called upon BNP to stop daydreaming and join the budget session of parliament instead. "From my experience and convictions, I can vouch that BNP will come back (to parliament)," said Ashraf. On BNP's parliamentary 'boycott' over a seat row, the ruling party spokesperson said, "It is so silly and ridiculous to discuss such trifles. Everyone can hear everyone sitting at any seat in the House." "I would urge BNP to join the parliament, raise national issues and discuss them. The nation is not bothered about who's sitting where." Asked about the AL holding council, he said, "A decision on the matter will be taken by the presidium within a few days." "In case we fail to hold a council session within the time frame fixed by the Election Commission, a time extension plea will be submitted." He indicated that the joint meeting decided to celebrate the AL's 60th founding anniversary on June 29 in grand manner. To celebrate the anniversary, rallies, discussions and cultural events would be organised, alongside paying tribute to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, he said. "Print media will publish special supplements and special programmes will be broadcast to make the youngsters aware of the genesis and forward march of the Awami League," said Ashraf. "All decisions concerning the observance of the anniversary will be taken after consulting the party president," he added. The presidium meeting was chaired by Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, who is deputy leader of the House. bdn
