 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  After a disappointing campaign in the ICC World Twenty20 in England, a dejected Bangladesh cricket team returned home Wednesday morning. Ireland broke the Tigers' hearts, handing a comprehensive six-wicket defeat to dash their hopes of playing the Super Eights, a place Bangladesh qualified for in the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa. Bangladesh, who also went a 25-run down against reigning champions India in the first match, were the first team to arrive in the host country and the first to catch the return flight home. Most of the squad arrived back at Zia International Airport an hour past their expected arrival time of 8:30am, though minus Australian coach Jamie Siddons, captain Mohammad Ashraful and all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Siddons returned to Australia to accompany girlfriend Kim, who is expected to give birth of their first child next week while Ashraful and Shakib stayed back in England for treatment. Shakib had a pre-appointment with a doctor but Ashraful surprisingly informed the team management that he needed to visit an eye specialist. Vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was left to face the heat from the national media on their return. Asked the reasons behind the defeat against Ireland, Mashrafee's reply was simple. "We went down against Ireland as we could not play better." "The batsmen did not click properly which resulted in a top order slump and the team never recovered from that early pressure," said Mashrafee, adding that they did not take the Irish lightly. Asked to justify sluggish batsman Roqibul Hasan's inclusion, the Bangladesh pace spearhead defended the decision, saying: "Our strategy was to go after the first six overs of power play, which could have included the fall of the early two or three wickets." "That's why we needed a batsman like him, who could hold the innings." The vice captain also backed his skipper's decision to bring on duo off-spinners -- Mahmudullah Riad and Naeem Islam -- after completion of the power play. "At that time both the Irish batsmen were left-handers and the captain thought that the off-spinners would be better against them." When asked about Siddons' comment, that "our boys tend to do things their way a lot and they don't listen that well and it is time some pressure is put on them to listen, from the captain down," Mashrafee said that he had no idea about that. The vice-captain also did not fail to give the usual statement after a disappointing performancehe promised that they would learn from the mistakes and do better next time
