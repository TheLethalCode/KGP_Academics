 NEW DELHI, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India batsman Virender Sehwag has been ruled out of the Twenty20 World Cup with a shoulder injury and will return home, the Indian cricket board said on Tuesday. Indian selectors named wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik as replacement, although the call-up needs to be ratified by the International Cricket Council. Sehwag, 30, was injured in the lead up to the tournament and missed Saturday's opening win over Bangladesh. The holders face Ireland on Wednesday with both teams having already qualified for the Super Eights. The explosive opening batsman, who played in the victorious Twenty20 team in 2007, will consult doctors in England before flying home, the board statement added. Sehwag could also miss the four-game one-day series in West Indies from June 26 to July 5 if the injury persists
