 HALLE, Germany, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich should offer French playmaker Franck Ribery a contract extension or allow him to leave as speculation about a move to Real Madrid is rife, club president Franz Beckenbauer said on Monday. "I only see two solutionsRibery extends his contract to end any talk of a transfer or we offer his release," Beckenbauer told Bild newspaper. Ribery has been linked with several major European clubs despite having a contract with Bayern until 2011 and Spain's Real Madrid are seen as the frontrunners. The Frenchman has said in the past he would like to play for Real at some point but has so far declined to comment on reports a deal was imminent. "I hope he stays and he signs a new contract," said Beckenbauer, a columnist for the newspaper. "I rate him together with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player in the world at the moment. "But if he wants to leave then it will be very hard for us to hang on to him," added Beckenbauer. Newly elected Real Madrid president Florentino Perez told French daily L'Equipe newspaper on Friday he was determined to sign Ribery. "It would be a huge satisfaction to have Ribery with us as soon as next season," Perez said. "But we first have to talk to his club Bayern Munich. I will tell them this player is one of our targets and that I want to discuss his possible move to Real." Bayern have said they will not bother to pick up the phone for any offer below 50 million euros ($69.16 million)
