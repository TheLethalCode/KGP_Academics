 Dhaka, June 08 (bdnews24.com) A ruling coalition MP demanded a statement from the foreign minister in parliament on an "audacious" statement by a senior Pakistan government official who suggested Bangladesh better not press on with war crimes trial. Rashed Khan Menon, also Workers' Party president, stood on a "point of order" in parliament on Monday and said the Pakistan foreign ministry official had "interfered" in Bangladesh's internal affairs by making the statement. An additional secretary Masood Khalid on Sunday told a Bangladeshi media team visiting Islamabad that the Pakistan's relations with Bangladesh would become frosty if Dhaka tried the crimes committed during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. "We hope nothing will be done to create a slow down in our relations," Khalid said and added the process would cast a shadow in ties between the countries. "We should not remain frozen in time but should look forward." Menon said: "This parliament has adopted a resolution unanimously on the trial of war criminals. But an official of the Pakistan government has made an audacious comment that the trial of the war criminals will sour its relations with Bangladesh. "I think this amounts to interference with Bangladesh's internal affairs and with parliament," said Menon, who was elected MP on Awami League ticket. "I demand a statement from the foreign minister," he said. Dipu Moni gestured to speaker Abdul Hamid that she would make a statement later. The parliament on Jan 28 unanimously adopted a resolution on the trial of the war criminals. The main opposition BNP and its ally Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami were absent at the time. Leaders and activists of the Jamaat-e-Islami took up arms against Bangladesh freedom fighters in the war led by the Awami League. They collaborated with the occupation Pakistan forces and had a hand in the killings of three million people in the bloody nine-month war. Foreign minister Dipu Moni earlier urged Pakistan to try its war criminals to meet the international obligation on war crimes.
