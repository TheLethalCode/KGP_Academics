 By Arshad Mahmud. Washington, June 9 (bdnews24.com)A top army officer posted to the Bangladesh embassy in Washington is seeking political asylum in the United States following his recall to Bangladesh last month . Brig Gen Chowdhury Fazlul Bari, defence advisor at the embassy here, was recently recalled after serving little over a year, a person close to Bari, preferring to be unnamed, said. He relinquished his position on May 7 and has never been seen in public since then. Bari was directror at the all-powerful DGFI during the 2007-2008 military-backed caretaker government and is known to have played a key role in the arrest of several top politicians and bureaucrats. In the wake of the Awami League's return to power several top Awami leaders including Abdul Jalil and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir demanded severe curtailing of the influence of the military's intelligence wing in the civilian administration. They alleged that they were harassed and tortured during their incarceration by the people of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence . Although not naming him directly, the politicians' wrath was particularly directed at Brig Bari. It is not clear whether Bari would be granted asylum by the United States immigration authorities. To obtain permission to stay in the United States, the asylum seeker must prove to the authorities that his life would be in danger in his native country
