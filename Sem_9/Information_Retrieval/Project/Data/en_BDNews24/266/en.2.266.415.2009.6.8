<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com)The investigation officer in the BDR mutiny case has said former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu incited rebel border guards to mutiny, encouraged the mutineer's supporters to take part in a procession during the February massacre and helped the mutineers to flee the scene. Pintu's lawyers said in a remand hearing Monday that their client was threatened with "killing by crossfire" if he refused to give a statement confessing his role in the mutiny. IO Abdul Qahhar Akhand, in his prayer for Pintu's fresh remand, replied that the BNP leader instigated the events of Feb 25-26, including the brutal killing of army officers, dumping their bodies into mass graves and drains, looting and arson at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. Metropolitan magistrate Mominul Haq gave CID officer three more days to question Pintu, who was arrested on June 1 only on charges of aiding BDR mutineers to flee the scene during the armed uprising. The BNP leader had just completed a five-day remand, following his very public arrest at the High Court premises. Pintu had been petitioning a High Court bench for a 'no arrest' order fearing he would be 'harrassed' after his name appeared in the government's report on the BDR mutiny, but the bench gave no ruling on the day. The national probe report stated: "Some civilians aided the BDR men to flee ... Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu helped them flee by arranging engine-run boats to cross the river." Thousands of border guards, guilty and innocent among them, fled the Peelkhana compound in the chaos of the mutiny and its aftermath. While most reported back to duty in the days that followed, authorities have spent months rounding up fugitives. bd
