 VIENNA, Tue Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japanese diplomat took a clear lead over four rivals in a straw poll held on Tuesday to identify a frontrunner to succeed UN nuclear agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei. Japan's Yukiya Amano drew almost twice as much support as the next contender. But he again fell short of a two-thirds majority needed for victory, similar to his performance in an inconclusive election three months ago. While giving Amano fresh momentum in the contest to replace Nobel Peace Prize laureate ElBaradei, who leaves office in November, Tuesday's nonbinding poll left no assurance he would emerge triumphant in a second-round election set for July 2. Another stalemate could prolong the race for months and cause disarray in the International Atomic Energy Agency, with the fate of the nuclear non-proliferation regime the UN watchdog is supposed to maintain hanging in the balance. North Korea conducted new nuclear and missile tests last month after kicking out IAEA inspectors and leaving six-party denuclearization talks. Iran is pursuing uranium enrichment of potential use in building atom bombs, restricting IAEA monitoring and shunning new U.S. feelers for negotiations. The straw poll aimed to pinpoint the top two or three contenders before the election and nudge others to pull out. Amano, a veteran IAEA ambassador, took 20 of 35 votes cast by the IAEA's Board of Governors, diplomats told Reuters. South African Ambassador Abdul Samad Minty came second with 11 votes, Spain's Luis Echavarri garnered four, and Belgium's Jean-Pol Poncelet and Slovenia's Ernest Petric came up empty. In March, Amano fell one vote short of a winning margin in a two-way contest with Minty. The three Europeans threw their hats in the ring last month. MOMENTUM NOT DECISIVE "It looks like Amano has regained momentum but that may be only because, being in the race for over six months now, he had locked in commitments from a lot of Western countries," said a senior IAEA diplomat. But if Amano fails to win a 2/3 majority in the first of several scheduled votes, many of his Western backers may withdraw their support. Several two diplomats rated the odds of another stalemate next month at over 50 percent. Petric, a former Slovenian envoy to the IAEA, hinted to reporters he would consider dropping out. Poncelet, a senior executive at French nuclear group Areva, and Echavarri, head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's nuclear arm, did not attend the meeting. The IAEA is one of the world's most security-sensitive agencies since it aims to prevent the covert spread of nuclear weapons capability -- Iran and Syria are under investigation at -- and otherwise promote peaceful uses of the atom. North Korea's actions compounded potential threats that have frayed compliance with the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty. IAEA governors have been searching for a strong consensus candidate who could bridge a political split between industrialised and developing nations over agency priori
