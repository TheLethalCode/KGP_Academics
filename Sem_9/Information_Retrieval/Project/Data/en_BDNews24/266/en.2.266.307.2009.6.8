 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to bring the private courier services under the legal framework. A cabinet meeting presided over by prime minister Sheikh Hasina Monday provisionally endorsed the Post Office (Amendment) Act-2009, which also afforded legal status to the courier services, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said at a press briefing on Monday. The postal department has been authorised to outsource a number of services in exchange for fees, he said. The Jute (Amendment) Act-2009 has also been approved in the meeting, Azad added. Reports delineating the participation of Bangladeshi delegates at the 42nd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank Board of Governors and on the participation of Bangladeshi delegates at the annual meeting of ESCAP in Bangkok were also presented before the ministers. "The finance minister led the delegates to the ADB meeting where he said that Bangladesh has survived the first wave of the global financial crunch," Azad said. The ADB has committed to provide Bangladesh with a $200 million in budget aid up to December. bdnew
