 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, June 08 (bdnws24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has brought further change to the seating arrangement in the opposition bench without adding to their front-row seats. Hamid has seated Moudud Ahmed next to opposition leader Khaleda Zia and moved Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury to the third seat of the opposition bench. The seat Modud has been given is known as the chair of the deputy leader of the opposition. This is a second time Hamid reorganised seating arrangement of the opposition bench on his left. "The speaker has placed Moudud Ahmed in the seat in which Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury used to sit," Shawkat Ali, deputy speaker, told bdnews24.com on Monday at his office. "I came to know about the seating rearrangement on Sunday when I got the seating chart," he said. Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has been placed in the fourth and MK Anwar in the fifth chair. Journalists could not confirm the seating arrangement as the main opposition BNP has yet to join the ongoing budget session. Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque met the speaker twice on Sunday in a bid to persuade him to increase the number of seats for the opposition in the front row. BNP had been holding out for seven front seats, a demand rejected by the ruling Awami League who say this would not be a proportional representation on the front benches as the main opposition party won only 30 of 300 seats in parliament. The party then asked for at least one more front-row seat from the speaker to join the House. The speaker allotted four seats to the BNP in the first session of the ninth parliament. He gave five front-row seats in the opposition bench to the BNP on June 4 but did not remove Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's from the seat next to Khaleda. Chowdhury earlier told media that he wanted to be the deputy leader of the opposition. After his meeting with Farroque, the speaker on Sunday reorganised seating arrangement of the opposition bench. "I don't know about the new seating rearrangement," Farroque told bdnews24.com on Sunday.
