<TITLE> Ponting turns from sackcloth to Ashes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting, a relentless competitor in a fiercely competitive team, appeared untroubled at the weekend after his side had been thrashed by West Indies in the Twenty20 World Cup. Asked what would happen if Australia made a premature departure from the only one-day tournament they have never won, Ponting grinned. "We will have two weeks in Leicester," he said. "That won't be good for anybody." A fortnight in the Midlands city is now a reality for Ponting and his men after Monday's loss to Sri Lanka. This time Ponting made no attempt to hide his frustration and disappointment before turning with typical pragmatism to the next task in hand. Australia, said Ponting, would analyse their failures on Monday night. On Tuesday they would then turn their full attention to their Ashes defence starting in Cardiff on July 8. "Our test cricket has been the shining light in the past few months," he said. "I have never been a big one about believing in success carrying from one series to another, particularly when it is in different forms of the game. "There will be no better place to be than England, caught up in the excitement of the Ashes." SPECIALIST SPINNERS The side Australia fielded during their brief Twenty20 campaign betrayed a reluctance to acknowledge the gulf between test, and even 50 overs, and the newest and shortest form of the game. Although spinners have thrust their way to the forefront of the attack in Twenty20 cricket, Australia omitted their specialist off-spinner Nathan Hauritz from the West Indies match. Recalled against Sri Lanka, he was Australia's most economical bowler. Australia also have no real power hitters now. Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist have retired while Andrew Symonds was sent home in disgrace from England for disciplinary reasons. Ponting, Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke, their three leading batsmen, played only four, three and two games respectively in Australia's six Twenty20 internationals before the tournament. Dirk Nannes, rated by his opponents as the fastest bowler in the Indian Premier League (IPL) this year, was not selected in the Australia squad and opted instead to deploy his talents with the Netherlands. "When the specialist Twenty20 players leave then we do have a real focus on just cricket," Ponting said. "There will be nothing else to think about, nothing else to talk about. That will be my job, to make sure we get over this loss pretty quickly and start focusing on the red balls and the white clothing for the next few months.
