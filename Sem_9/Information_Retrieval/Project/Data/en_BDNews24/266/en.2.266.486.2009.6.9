<TITLE> Padma to be declared new 'Hilsa sanctuary' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 9 (bdnews24.com)Following success in Hilsa preservation in three rivers of the country, the government has decided to include a fresh sanctuary zone for the prized fish in the Padma river. The move will mean that netting fish along 20 kilometres of the Padma, flowing through Shariatpur and Chandpur districts, will be banned from March to April each year to protect young Hilsa known as jatka . The decision came from a fisheries ministry meeting chaired by its secretary Muhammad Shah Alam on Tuesday. Bangladesh imposed the annual ban on catching jatka since 2004 at different points of the rivers Meghna, Tentulia and Andharmanik in Chandpur, Laksmipur, Bhola and Patuakhali districts covering over 300 kilometres. Fisheries officials say since the sanctuary programme has been in place, Hilsa production has been boosted to around 2.90 lakh metric tonnes last year, from 1.99 lakh tonnes five years ago. As one of the Bangladesh's prime commodities, the preservation of jatka has netted an extra Tk 7,680 crore since 2004. As a single species, Hilsa is the most significant resource in the country, amounting to around 12 percent of the country's total fish catch and contributing 1 percent to GDP. Bangladesh meets about 60 percent of the global Hilsa demand, with some 500,000 fishermen directly involved in the catch and around two million people involved in transportation, marketing, processing and export of the valuable fish. Although fishermen are banned from catching the young Hilsa inside the sanctuary areas, they still net them during the ban period outside the preservation areas. The newly declared sanctuary zone will connect the existing zones banning fishing of jatka over a much wider area. Minsitry officials said fishermen in the new sanctuary areas will not face hardship, as they fall under the Vulnerable Group Feeding assistance programme. bdn
