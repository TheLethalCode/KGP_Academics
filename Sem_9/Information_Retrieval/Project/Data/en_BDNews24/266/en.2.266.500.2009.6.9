<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP says it is ready to join parliament on the day budget is placed, given the "right environment". "BNP wants to attend the budget session if the government creates the environment," BNP MP Jamiruddin Sircar told a briefing at the media centre of the parliament building on Tuesday. "Who will criticise the budget if the opposition is not in parliament?" the former speaker said. "The budget will be one-sided in absence of the opposition. So the government should take step to bring back the opposition to parliament," Sircar said. Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farrouque said: "It is two days to budget presentation. If the speaker reconsiders our issues we can attend the session on the day the budget is placed." He said they had the preparation but added that the issue of rejoining would be decided in the parliamentary meeting. The opposition BNP has refrained from attending the session from the first day of the second session demanding more seats in the first row. Farrouque also condemned the withdrawal of facilities of the opposition chief. "The way the government runs the country and parliament seems that we have no alternative other than launching a movement," he said. Sircar said: "The government is depriving the opposition chief of her deserved facilities with a motive and thus harassing her." The BNP leaders later met with speaker Abdul Hamid and informed him of their allegations. The speaker said he would brief the government on the matters. b
