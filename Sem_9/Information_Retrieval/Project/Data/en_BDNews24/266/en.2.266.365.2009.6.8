 RIO DE JANEIRO, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga defended his team's ruthless style of play on Sunday, saying that talent on its own was not enough to win games. Brazil gave a lesson in counter-attacking football when they beat Uruguay 4-0 away in Saturday's World Cup qualifier after being on the defensive for much of the game. Although the win took Brazil top of the South American World Cup qualifying group, critics have complained that Dunga has taken Brazilian football away from its attacking roots. Former striker Tostao on Sunday said Brazil had adopted Italian-style football. "From the moment that Brazil manages to equal other teams in terms of motivation and will to win, our technique will make the difference," Dunga told reporters in Recife, where Brazil face Paraguay on Sunday. "That's why that we say that talent is not enough. Talent is extremely important, but it has to be united with other things to have any effect. History shows this. "On a lot of occasions, Brazil have had players of very high quality but haven't got the results." "Dunga warned that Brazil would need a different approach when they face Paraguay on Wednesday. Only goal difference separates the two teams, who have 24 points from 13 games. "We have a duty to repeat our last performance but we're going to need to have a lot of patience to win this game," said Dunga, whose team have found it more difficult to win at home than away. Dunga said that he did not expect to still be coach in 2014 when Brazil will host the World Cup. "In 2014, we will have to look for a different type of preparation," he said. "But in 2014, there will be another coach. Leave the problem to him.
