 NEW DELHI, June 9 (bdndews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday reached out to Pakistan after months of tension following the Mumbai attacks, saying India would meet its neighbour "more than half way" if Pakistan cracked down on militants. India had put a pause on slow-moving peace talks with Pakistan after a militant strike on the financial hub and it urged Pakistan to do more to crack down on militants operating on its soil. "I wish to assure you we will meet them more than half way," Singh said in an address to the Indian parliament.
