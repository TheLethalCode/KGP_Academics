<TITLE> Written-off Federer reappears in style in Paris </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer had been written off by fans, pundits and former players, and yet, the Swiss lifted the French Open trophy for the first time on Sunday. After losing his Wimbledon crown and his number one spot to Rafael Nadal last year, he suffered another blow when the Spaniard beat him in an epic Australian Open final in January. Federer left Melbourne Park in tears and his confidence in tatters. On Sunday he also left the Roland Garros Centre Court in tears but at least this time he had the Musketeers' Cup tucked safely under his arm after beating Robin Soderling 6-1 7-6 6-4. "People talked a lot about me having lost the grip and stuff. To some degree I guess it's true, because I lost my number one ranking," Federer, who recently got married and is an expectant father, told a news conference. "But I didn't fall out of the top 10 or the top 1,000. I still played very consistent, especially at grand slam level. My record shows it there," added Federer, who has contested 15 of the last 16 grand slam finals. "But important for me was to continue working hard. I had issues last year. We all know what they were. People sometimes don't give you time to actually let them heal or let you figure them out." At the start of the 2008 season, Federer turned up to defend his Australian Open title but had been unaware that he was suffering from the energy-sapping illness, mononucleosis. Despite his problems, he still reached the semi-finals. This year back pains have also caused him trouble. "I'm not the type of guy who's scared of going into sometimes matches not feeling great at all," he said. "I can also decide not to play for three months and then come back very strong again. That's not the road I chose. I'm the guy who likes to face it and see if I'm good enough or not." Federer missed the Dubai Open and Switzerland's Davis Cup first round tie because of his back problems. "All of a sudden my game completely left me for some reason. I didn't know why. Maybe it was because my serve wasn't helping me out, the back was still hurting me," he said. BIG IMPACT It would have taken much more to snap the Swiss's confidence. "I always believed in my chances to win Paris or any grand slam. It's really for those that I tried to keep myself most fit," he explained. "That was also one of the reason why I took six weeks off after the Australian Open. Let everything heal and let everything settle, and then I came back very strong." Losing in the third round of the Monte Carlo Masters in April to compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka did not help the pundits believe he could break his jinx at the French Open, especially since he had lost the last three finals to Nadal. But Soderling got rid of his Spanish nemesis in the fourth round. "I knew I had bigger opportunities than the years before, because records against Nadal are tough for me," said Federer. "Even if I had defeated him in (the) Madrid (final), I knew that if he was no longer in the draw, things would be easier for me. "It didn't make much difference right at that time but for the final it did because I was not playing Nadal but Soderling. "I knew the day Rafa won't be in the finals, I will be there and I will win. I always knew and that I believed in it. That's exactly what happened. It's funny. I didn't hope for it but I believed in it." The absence of Nadal in the final did not make the win any less satisfying for Federer, especially since it took him 11 attempts to finally prevail. "I think it was very hard to accept the first defeat in 2006. I lost in the finals and I was like, Oh, my God. Got to wait one entire year, and then I don't even know if I'll make the final again," he said. "So I think, yes, the waiting and the age definitely has a big impact on how important and how nice this victory actually is. "It's been a long time coming, and I'm happy I got it today. I'm very proud.
