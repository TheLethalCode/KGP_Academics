 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's Brazilian football coach Edson Silva Dido has once again pinned his hopes on fresh faces by picking 10 rookie players as well as axing five seniors for a three-month training. Dido on Monday announced a 30-member preliminary squad that would be the core of the Bangladesh national team for this year's SAFF Championship and the 2010 South Asian Games in Dhaka. The Brazilian coach had also earlier picked five new players before the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers in Bangladesh and all of them were in the final 20-member squad. "For the Challenge Cup qualifiers, I included only five young players because I had very little time for preparation. This time I have more time to prepare them," said Dido, who helped Bangladesh qualify for the finals of the AFC Challenge Cup as the best-runners-up of four groups. "I had spent some time with most of these players at a camp in BKSP and I believe they will boost our national team in future," said the Brazilian, who takes the team into a three-week conditioning camp in Cox's Bazar from June 15. The axe fell on experienced defender M Sujan, midfielders Motiur Rahman Munna, Pranotosh Kumar Das and M Sharif and striker Mohammad Robin, who except Das were in the final for the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. "Three of them have slowed down with age and young ones are not able to follow the instructions in the field," Dido was quoted by bffonline.com, but the fact was that striker Robin hardly got any chance to practice that time and was almost out of practice following his calf muscle injury. Interestingly, Dido recalled defender Ariful Islam, whom he dropped from the AFC Challenge Cup squad citing that the defender failed to impress him during the month-long training. "I am looking forward to the future of Bangladesh and I believe at least six out of ten rookies will represent Bangladesh national team by the end of this year," said the Brazilian, who fielded three fresh players in all three matches against Macau, Cambodia and Myanmar during group-phase matches of the AFC Challenge Cup in Dhaka. "If we can train this squad for three months, we would be able to prepare them for higher level competitions. And it would great if we can play in an international tournament or some practice matches after the training and the federation has promised me that," said the former Brazilian footballer. Dido, however, thought that the squad he picked this time was a good mixture of experienced and youth players. "I believe I have a balance in the team. The experienced ones had earlier showed their worth and positive leadership by helping out the newcomers on and off the field," opinioned the coach. The former Flamingo player has urged all to be patient about the national team as he believed he would be able to develop the team and deliver results in future. Squad: Aminul Haq, Biplob Bhattacharya, Mazharul Islam Himel, Mostaqur Rahman, Nasiur Islam Nasir, Rashedul Islam Rashed, Wali Faisal, Atiqur Rahman Mishu, Rasel Ansari, Rajani Kanta Barman, Mamun Mia, Ariful Islam Arif, Mofazzal Hossain Saikat, Al Amin, Rezaul Karim Reza, M Jahid Hossain, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury, Mobarrak Hossain Bhuiya, Arman Aziz, Mezbabul Haq Manik, Iman Mahmud, Sheikh Alamgir Kabir Rana, Mamunul Islam Mamun, Imtiaz Sultan Jitu, Naeem Hossain, Jahid Hasan Emily, Enamul Haq, Mithun Chowdhury, Sabbir Mahmud Pritom and Abdul Baten Majumdar Komol bd
