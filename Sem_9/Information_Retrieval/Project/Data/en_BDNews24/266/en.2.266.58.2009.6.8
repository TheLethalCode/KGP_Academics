<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The stock market cooled down a little Monday after the previous day's highs, while the DSE chief said investors had no reason to fear that the sudden surge being witnessed ahead of the budget was 'irrational'. "Market ups and downs will follow each other," Dhaka Stock Exchange president Rakibur Rahman told reporters, a day after the prime bourse struck an all-time record in turnover. He advised small investors to minimise their risk by selling off shares as soon as they make a "reasonable profit". "Holding out for 'maximum gain' is risky," he said. "And, if everybody did that, it could interfere with supply and demand and destroy market balance," he added. "We are also trying to modernise and expand the capital market," he added. To facilitate this, more shares must be offloaded from private and government sectors, said the DSE chief. "Especially when the market is this buoyant," he said. "The government can in turn raise funds from the market to improve infrastructure, build more power plants, bridges and roads," he said. "We have to do a lot of work to counter effects of the global recession," he said. "To this end too, the government can raise money from the capital market by offloading shares of its companies," he said. Market cools The DSE's benchmark index DGEN came down 40 points to end on 2750 on Monday. It had soared 107 points on Sunday. Turnover on the DSE also came down, after Sunday's peak, to Tk 636 crore. The country's prime bourse had soared to a record high turnover of over Tk 780 crore on Sunday, with indices also peaking on optimism ahead of the new budget. Market observers have said the surge is being driven by investors chasing quality stocks to gain a good foothold in the market ahead of the coming budget. Investors were "very hopeful," Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Ziaul Haque Khandakar said on Sunday. DSE chief Rakibur Rahman had said investors felt this government was investment and capital market friendly. "They are expecting the budget will have something good for the market," he said. b
