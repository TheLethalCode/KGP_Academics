 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman has urged the industrialists and businessmen to make instead of importing cellular phones. "Our mobile phone sector is almost wholly dependent on imports, which means a good slice of our hard-earned foreign currency is, in the process, siphoned out," he said on Tuesday. He inaugurated the 'Third Dhaka International Telecom Fair-2009' at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "I believe our young engineers and IT experts can play an important role in making cellphone hardware and software." The president, however, called upon all to check the misuse of mobile phones at the same time. Some rogue individuals are creating law and order problems through cell phone, Rahman said. Telecommmunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu said the government decided to cut down BTTB call rates and would charge only Tk 0.30 per minute from July 1. The minister said they would 'soon' take steps to introduce 3G technology to the new generation. "You can very well take initiatives to provide our students with laptop computers at Tk 10,000 apiece," the minister said, addressing the businessmen. Md Nizamuddin Zitu, president, Bangladesh Mobile Phone Businessmen's Association, said manufacturing mobile phone sets at home should be very much possible with government assistance. Former FBCCI president Salman F Rahman and first FBCCI vice president Abul Kashem Ahmed were present. The 10 am-9pm four-day fair has attracted 42 business firms from home and abroad. b
