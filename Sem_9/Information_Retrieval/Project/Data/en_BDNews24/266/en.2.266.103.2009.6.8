<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) - The health ministry has formed a committee to look into incidents of illness among children who reportedly fell ill after a national drive to administer Vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets. "The Vitamin A plus drive, which has been running for over three decades, is an effective and successful one," health minister AFM Ruhal Haque told reporters at the Secretariat on Monday. "It has never created any apprehension of harm to children. Neither have deworming tablets," he said. The five-member committee is headed by Dr ABM Jahangir Alam, a director of primary healthcare services of the health directorate. Of the four others members two are from Dhaka Medical College, one from ICDDR,B and the fourth also from the directorate of health. The committee has been asked to submit its report within one or two days. "The department of health has taken up the issue with urgency, whatever the cause might be, due to the concern among guardians, said the health minister. Whether negligence is involved or panic is being spread with ill motive, the guilty will face severe penalty," said Haque. "No seriously harmful side effects from Vitamin A Plus campaign has been observed till now," he added. "A relatively small number of children fell ill after taking the Vitamin A plus capsules and deworming tablets, but none of them is serious," Around twenty million children between one and five were administered the Vitamin A Plus capsules, and 19 million between two and five were given deworming tablets in Saturday's nationwide drive. Of these millions, between 400 and 1000 children were reported sick throughout the country up to Monday evening. A six year-old child named Priya Akhtar Urmi died at Ballalbari in Munshiganj Sadar on Sunday. The child's family claimed their baby daughter fell ill soon after taking the medicines, even though she was a year above the catchment age. Parents urged to stay calm The health ministry had urged calm on Sunday as the local investigations began over reports of hundreds of children falling ill. Meanwhile, a local probe body in Faridpur made a recommendation for dismissal of health officials at Chabhadrasan after the medicines were administered two days ahead of Saturday's national drive, and the first reports of children falling sick there on Thursday sparked panic in other areas. Director of the National Institute of Nutrition, Prof Parveen Fatema Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that children could suffer symptoms after the deworming medicine, and it was nothing unusual. "Vomiting and loose motion may take place after taking the antihelminthic if there are excess worms in the stomach," she said. The health minister said at the time: "It appears from the study of the overall situation that the children's illness did not occur because of any side effects of medicines." "Along with administration of the medicines, malnutrition, excessive heat and other reasons associated with environment may have contributed to illness." "There is no question over the quality of medicine or its expiry date". Syed Modasser Ali, adviser to the prime minister on health and family welfare, echoed the minister and the National Institute of Nutrition. "Children may suffer some loose motion after taking the combined Vitamin A plus capsules and worming tablets," he told a meeting with health and family welfare officials at Gopalganj on Sunday. "But there is no instance of children's deaths across the globe after taking these medicines," he pointed out. However, he said, an investigation into campaign negligence was on. "Steps will be taken against the guilty." The government will also take steps in future to properly raise awareness about Vitamin A deficiency, worms and the proper administering of the medicines. bd
