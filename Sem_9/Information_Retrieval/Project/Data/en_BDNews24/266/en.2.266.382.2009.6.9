 SRINAGAR, Jun 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least five people were wounded on Monday when police in Kashmir fired to disperse thousands protesting the alleged rape and murder of two Muslim women, police said. The shooting took place near Shopian town, 60 km south of Srinagar -- Kashmir's summer capital and the focus of a 20-year insurgency -- where residents say two young women were abducted, raped and killed by Indian security forces on May 29. Security agencies denied the killings and earlier said the women, aged 17 and 22, drowned in a stream. Police on Monday said medical tests confirmed the rape of the pair whose deaths triggered large anti-India protests across the disputed Himalayan region, in which one protester has died so far and hundreds have been injured. "The interim medical report from the medical team received indicates prima facia cognizable offence has taken place," a police statement said. The statement also said police have started a probe into the rape, but it did not mention the cause of the women's deaths. Authorities deployed thousands of police across the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley on Monday anticipating further clashes. In Srinagar troops patrolled streets, set up barricades and blocked roads leading to Shopian town. Shops, businesses and schools were shut across the Kashmir valley for the eighth day after a separatist strike call. Police on Sunday evening arrested Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a hardline separatist, for encouraging near daily street protests which are giving new life to a splittist movement in the disputed Himalayan region. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Kashmir since an insurgency against Indian rule erupted in 1989. More violence broke out elsewhere on Monday, in the Kupwara area of northern Kashmir, where two Indian soldiers including an army officer and three separatist guerrillas were killed in a fierce gun battle, police said in a statement. Indian security forces fighting Kashmiri separatist militants have been accused in the past of human rights violations, including rape and extrajudicial killings. Authorities deny any systematic violations and say all reports are investigated and the guilty punished
