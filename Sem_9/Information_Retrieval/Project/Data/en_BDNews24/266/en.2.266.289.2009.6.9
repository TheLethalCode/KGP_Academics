 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)The BNP has named convenors and joint convenors for 71 of 75 district-level committees, having dissolved the political units as part of 'grassroots-up' reforms after the main opposition party's debacle in the general election. BNP's office secretary Rizvi Ahmed published the list at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. The four committees yet to be dissolved are of Dhaka metropolitan and Dhaka, Manikganj and Sunamganj districts. High-profile leaders are heading many of the convening committees, including ex-minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury for Chittagong Metropolitan. Golam Akbar Khandakar and Zafrul Islam Chowdhury were made conveners of Chittagong North and Chittagong South committees respectively. Rizvi said the BNP's policymaking standing committee had been working to dissolve the district and metropolitan units as their terms had expired. The standing committee also decided to form a 51-member convening body for districts and metropolitan areas. The conveners and joint conveners have been asked to submit names of their interim teams to the party's central office by June 25. Central leaders will approve the full convening committees by June 30. In addition, 31-strong convening committees at upazila, thana and municipalities will also be formed. Upazila convening committees will form 21-strong union committees by July 30, dissolving all the union committees under the upazila. Similarly, convening committees at thana and municipalities will dissolve their ward committees and make full teams by July 30. Thana and municipal convening committees with dissolve the ward committees under them, and come up with a full convening committee of 11 members by Aug 15. According to the party constitution, the central leadership had ruled out time frames to form party units at different levels, said Rizvi. If the convening committees of district, metropolitan, upazila, thana, municipality, wards, union-ward levels fail to submit their full team to the central office by the deadline, they will be replaced with new convening committees, he added. He also said that recruitment of new party members and renewal of membership will be continue from Aug 16 to Sept 16. The party secretary general was hopeful about the reform from the grassroots up with the combined support of all. Rizvi said the national council may be held this year but that was to be finalised by the policy makers. BNP took interviews in recent months of grassroots leaders through six divisional units in Dhaka and reports were submitted to chairperson Khaleda Zia. The reports were scrutinised by the standing committee for two consecutive weeks and finally the central committee decided to dissolve all the district units of the party for major reform. The party's grassroots led calls for reorganising the BNP after a crushing defeat in the Dec 29 elections in which it failed to win even a tenth of seats.
