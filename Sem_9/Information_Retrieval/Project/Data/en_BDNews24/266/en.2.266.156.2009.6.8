 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will be without central defender Rio Ferdinand and midfielder Gareth Barry for the visit of Andorra on Wednesday but coach Fabio Capello should not be losing any sleep over this lop-sided World Cup qualifier. Coach and players alike have stressed the importance of avoiding complacency against the part-timers from the Pyrenees but whatever 11 English players take to the Wembley turf a seventh consecutive Group Six victory should be a formality. Ferdinand missed the 4-0 win in Kazakhstan on Saturday with a calf injury while Barry, one of the scorers, picked up a yellow card that rules him out for Wednesday. England have a seven-point lead over Croatia and victory over Andorra, who have won just three of 84 internationals and have lost all six qualifiers, would leave them 10 clear and needing just three points to book a place in South Africa next year. It is all a far cry from rollercoaster recent qualifying campaigns, most notably the botched attempt to qualify for Euro 2008. That failure still hurts captain John Terry. "We're taking nothing for granted," Terry told the FA's website (www.thefa.com). "We've got Andorra at home, and they can sit back and make it difficult. If we can get the seventh win out of seven, it will be fantastic." SOME SUCCESS Andorra will park 10 men behind the ball at Wembley in a bid to avoid a thrashing, a game plan they employed to some success in Barcelona last year when they conceded just two goals against the Premier League's finest. "Everyone expects us to turn them over easily," he said. "Sometimes that is not the case. We went to Andorra last year and found it difficult, and teams are getting a lot wiser, knowing how to play against the bigger teams, and making it difficult for us." Andorra coach David Rodrigo said after Saturday's 5-1 defeat in Belarus that the team's passing had been poor and a big improvement was needed against the "powerful" English. "It'll take a lot of effort to put the defeat behind us and confront the match at Wembley," Rodrigo told reporters. "England have players who can cause a lot of damage at set pieces," he said. Probable teams: England 1-Robert Green; 3-Glen Johnson, 4-John Terry, 5-Matthew Upson, 2-Ashley Cole; 9-Theo Walcott, 7-Steven Gerrard, 8-Frank Lampard, 5-Shaun Wright-Phillips; 6-Peter Crouch, 11-Wayne Rooney. Andorra: 1-Jesus Alvarez; 3-Jordi Escura, 4-Oscar Sonejee, 5-Antoni Lima, 6-Ildefons Lima, 2-Josep Ayala; 7-Marc Vales, 10-Sergi Moreno, 8-Marcio Vieira, 16-Victor Moreira; 9-Fernando Silva
