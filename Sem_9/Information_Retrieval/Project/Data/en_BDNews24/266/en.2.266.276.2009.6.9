<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)Health minister AFM Ruhul Huq Tuesday told parliament that no child died of taking vitamin A and de-worming medicine as reported in the media. He termed "baseless" the media reports on the deaths of children after a recent national drive to administer the medicines to 20 million children between one and five years of age. "No child died of taking vitamin A and de-worming medicine. This is wrong. There is no instance in anywhere in the world that children get sick after taking these medicines," Huq told parliament in reply to a question from Jatiya Party MP Salma Islam. He said some children might have suffered some normal side effects of the de-worming medicine. Pointing to conflicting reports in the media, the minister said a newspaper reported that an 11 year-old boy died after taking a Vitamin A plus capsule. "But the parents of the child told another newspaper that their child had not take the medicine." "We have come to know that announcements were made with loud speakers urging parents to feed their children tamarind solution to 'save their children's lives'." "They started vomiting after taking the tamarind solution and were rushed to hospitals," he said.
