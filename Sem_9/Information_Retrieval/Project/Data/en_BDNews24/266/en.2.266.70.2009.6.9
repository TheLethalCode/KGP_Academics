 LONDON, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia will devote the next fortnight to preparing for their Ashes defence against England after they were knocked out of the Twenty20 World Cup on Monday. The world's number one side in both test and 50 overs cricket will play no further part in the tournament after they lost to Sri Lanka by six wickets at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Ireland, a non-test playing nation, secured a place in the Super Eights with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the first of the day's group matches at Trent Bridge. Defending champions India, England, West Indies and South Africa will play off in one group to determine two semi-finalists. Ireland, Sri Lanka and New Zealand are confirmed in the other group with the final place to be decided in the match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at Lord's in London on Tuesday (1230GMT). The final is scheduled for Lord's on June 21 (1400 GMT)
