 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)The visiting European Union team has expressed "strong concern" at the "numerous deaths" of border guards held in custody in connection with the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. Ending a two-day tour of Dhaka, delegation head Helena Bambasova told journalists that such deaths of BDR personnel in custody should be "thoroughly investigated". "The EU supports the government's zero tolerance policy against extra judicial killings, whilst emphasising that this requires convincing investigation of alleged killings and the bringing to justice of perpetrators," she told a press conference at BRAC centre. "The EU is strongly concerned at the numerous deaths of BDR jawans in custody," said the Czech deputy minister for foreign affairs. "It is also imperative that all such deaths be thoroughly investigated and those responsible punished," said Bambasova. She also said, as a Muslim majority country, Bangladesh has a "pivotal role" to play against extremism in South Asia. The Troika delegation arrived in Dhaka on Sunday evening for a two-day visit for talks on governance, trade and development cooperation with Bangladesh. The delagation had meetings with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith and law minister Shafiq Ahmed.
