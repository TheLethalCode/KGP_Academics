 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com)Police will follow the 'money trail' to track members of Indian mafia don Dawood Ibrahim's network in Bangladesh, a Detective Branch official said on Monday. "We will send letters to national banks and western money transfer authorities asking for details of money movements connected to Ibrahim's suspected associates here," said DB assistant commissioner Mahibul Islam Khan. "We are focussing on tracking the foreign accounts from which Dawood Merchant and Zahid Sheikh received money to find out who else received money from those accounts," he said. Detectives have already come to know the names of a number of possible beneficiaries of Ibrahim's criminal network from statements of Merchant, Zahid Sheikh and another suspect Arif Hossain, all Indian felons caught hiding in Bangladesh, and by following up on mobile phone data. "They regularly received money from Ibrahim's organisation." Khan said a man named Fahim Machmach sent money to Zahid and Arif. "Now we are investigating if more money came in from the same person and address." Arif Hossain, arrested two days ago, has named more suspects under interrogation, said the detective. "Now efforts are on to arrest them." Police said the three Indians and a Bangladeshi accomplice Kamal Mia were being sent to the Taskforce for Interrogation on Monday night. Bangladesh police arrested the fugitive Merchant, convicted for the murder of Indian music director Gulshan Kumar, with accomplices Zahid and Kamal last month. They are currently in remand along with Arif arrested on June 6. India's best-known underworld figure, Dawood Ibrahim, now thought to be hiding out in Pakistan, is widely accused of heading a vast organised crime network dealing in arms, narcotics, money laundering and counterfeiting. Thought to have masterminded the 1993 Mumbai bombings, he is classed by the US as a 'global terrorist', and wanted by Interpol, which issued a 'special notice' in 2006 with details of Ibrahim's 11 passports and 16 aliases. Ibrahim came in at No. 4 on the Forbes' World's Top 10 most dreaded criminals list of 2008. bdne
