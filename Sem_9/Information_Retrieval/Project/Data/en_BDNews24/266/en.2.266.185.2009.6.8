<TITLE> Asia gears up for tense World Cup run-in </TITLE>

 BANGKOK, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With an automatic place and two playoffs berths still up for grabs, the race to next year's 2010 World Cup finals is far from over in Asia. Heavyweights South Korea, Australia and Japan have already snapped up automatic places, but six countries still have a chance to advance to South Africa, with complex mathematics likely to determine who goes through. One more side can advance automatically from Group Two, while the two third-placed countries will playoff for the chance to meet Oceania champions New Zealand for a place at the finals. Gulf giants Saudi Arabia have rebounded from a shaky start to the final round and look the most likely to take the last automatic berth, although they will be hoping for an easy ride on Wednesday from a South Korean side already through. That, however, is not likely. South Korea are pushing for a win, and their coach, Huh Jung-moo, has admitted he would prefer to have their neighbours join them in South Africa. "I personally hope that North Korea can qualify with us to the finals," Huh told reporters. "It will be the first time in World Cup history to have this." North Korea and South Korea have never played at the same World Cup finals. The last time the North qualified was in 1966. The Saudis are third on 10 points, one behind North Korea, who do not play on Wednesday. Iran are fourth on seven points. FREAK RESULT Barring a freak result in another match, a draw for Bahrain in Australia should be enough to guarantee them Group One's playoff spot. That will not be easy, however, and Bahrain will be missing key players, striker Aala Hubail and midfielder Abdulla Fatadi. The team from the tiny Gulf island have never qualified for the World Cup and avoiding defeat by the Socceroos on Wednesday will be crucial. A loss in Sydney would mean third place would be decided at Bahrain's final match with Uzbekistan on June 17, which would effectively make the game a playoff, for a playoff. The match would also be a repeat of the acrimonious playoff for the 2006 finals, which had to be replayed because of poor refereeing. The Socceroos have injuries, fitness problems and yellow-carded players keen to avoid suspension, while midfielder Tim Cahill is expected to miss the game. Others seem happy to sit it out. "We've got nothing else to play for, we've qualified," said Italy-based midfielder Mark Bresciano. "I think this is a chance for the coach to experiment." Qatar, fourth on five points in Group One, need a minor miracle to get to the playoffs. They must not only beat Japan in Yokohama on Wednesday, but win by a whopping five goals, and hope Bahrain and Uzbekistan lose. Iran's draw with North Korea was a disappointment for new coach Afshin Ghotbi, who needs two wins, including one away to South Korea, Asia's most successful team. Iran should not be troubled by Wednesday's opponents, the already-eliminated United Arab Emirates, who did not put up much of a fight in their home defeat by South Korea at the weekend
