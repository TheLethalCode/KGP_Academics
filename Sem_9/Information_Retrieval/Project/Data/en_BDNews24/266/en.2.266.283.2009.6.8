<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com)  Food minister Abdur Razzak has said 11,000 tonnes of food grains in government development allocation remained undistributed among constituencies of women MPs that are yet to be demarcated. "Work is going on to demarcate the constituencies," he told reporters after a meeting with Stefan Frowein, the European Commission ambassador in Dhaka. "Besides, changes are being made to the test relief policy at the same time," he added. Razzak said last month's cyclone Aila totally damaged 213 km of mud embankments and 1,128 km partly in the coastal areas. "The survey to measure the damage by a is being finalised and the damage to the embankments has been put at Tk 430 crore. "The government has allocated Tk 116 crore for it and the repair work is ongoing," he said. He said the main reason the embankments were damaged was because pipelines were drawn through them for shrimp-growing ponds. The practice would be stopped with the assistance of the Water Development Board officials, he added. "We did not ask for any international assistance because we asked for it during Sidr just a few days ago. It looks bad for the country if we ask for international help time and again." However, he said, the prime minister will ask for help soon for permanent solution to these problems and to build cyclone shelter centres. Food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman and other members of the representative team were present in the meeting. b
