<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafiq Ahmed has blamed 'joint forces' for harassing politicians during the last caretaker government regime, saying they commandeered the ACC to serve the purposes of the past caretaker government. "The Anticorruption Commission filed cases against politicians at the instruction of joint forces," the minister told reporters at the Secretariat. "It did not work independently." The previous 'military-backed' interim administration used the ACC with a political motive, he said. "The aim of the caretaker government was to obstruct practice of democracy," Shafiq said. "They wanted to prove that democracy is ineffective here." The visiting EU Troika delegation, headed by Czech Republic's deputy minister for foreign affairs Helena Bambasova, had earlier met with the law minister. bdnew
