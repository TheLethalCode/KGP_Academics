 RECIFE, Brazil, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguay, overtaken by Brazil at the top of the South America World Cup qualifying group on Saturday, aim to halt their recent decline when they meet the new leaders in a top-of-the-table clash on Wednesday. Still on course for their fourth successive World Cup finals, Paraguay's lack of strength in depth appears to have caught up with them and they have taken only one point from their last three games. Paraguay, who at one stage had a six-point lead at the top of the 10-team group, dropped to second when they lost 2-0 at home to Chile on Saturday and Brazil won 4-0 in Uruguay. Both teams have 24 points from 13 games but Brazil have the better goal difference. The top four teams qualify directly for South Africa 2010 and the fifth will play off against the fourth team from CONCACAF for a place. Paraguay have emerged as one of South America's top sides despite limited resources but a spate of injuries and suspensions has left them short of replacements. Striker Roque Santa Cruz is still not match fit after a knee injury while German-based striker Nelson Haedo Valdez and Benfica's Oscar Cardozo are suspended, along with Julio Manzur. "If we can win the game, we're practically in South Africa," said Paraguay defender Paulo da Silva, who returns after a one-match suspension." "We all know about Brazil and how dangerous they are if you give them spacebut we believe in our own capabilities." Paraguay beat Brazil earlier in the campaign when Santa Cruz and Salvador Cabanas, who returns from suspension for Wednesday's game, gave them a 2-0 win in Asuncion. They lost 4-1 on their last visit to Brazil four years ago. Brazil, who have adopted a counter-attacking game under coach Dunga, have found home matches tougher than away games and have often been struggled to break down packed defences. They have already been held to goalless draws at home by Bolivia, Colombia and Argentina. Luis Fabiano, their top scorer in the group with seven goals, will be absent after being sent off against Uruguay. Either Nilmar or Alexandre Pato is expected to partner Robinho in attack in his absence. Teams (probable) Brazil: Julio Cesar; Daniel Alves, Lucio, Juan, Kleber; Gilberto Silva, Felipe Melo, Elano, Kaka; Robinho, Alexandre Pato. Paraguay: Justo Villar; Dario Veron, Julio Cesar Caceres, Paulo da Silva, Denis Caniza; Jonathan Santana, Eduardo Ledesma, Victor Caceres, Cristian Riveros; Salvador Cabanas, Dante Lopez Referee: Oscar Ruiz (Colombia)
