<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 08 (bdnews24.com)The third working day of parliament's budget session came to a close on Monday with main opposition BNP continuing to abstain after a series of "unfruitful" meetings between the speaker and opposition chief whip. Speaker Abdul Hamid was chairing the session that began with MPs' questions and answers at 4pm and ended around 6.30pm. Two bills were on the day's agenda, along with a proposal for amending the rules of parliamentary procedure. Meanwhile, opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque had told bdnews24.com on Sunday BNP would not be joining that day's session. Farroque had several rounds of talks with the speaker on the day to try to talk him into allotting BNP two more front-row seats on the left of the speaker. Farroque said the talks were "inconclusive". "They ended without any fruitful result," Farroque told reporters afterwards. "I urged [the speaker] to reconsider his decision and give us a respectable number of seats on the front row, " he said. But he did not define "respectable number". The BNP's parliamentary board will meet sometimes next week to decide if the opposition will join the budget session, said Farroque. "You can assume that we are not going," he said in reply to a question on whether they would stay away from all parliamentary proceedings until that meeting. Speaker Hamid, meanwhile, had already made it clear that he would not be in a position to increase the BNP's front row seats by more than one, to give them five out of nine on the front bench to the left of the speaker's chair. But BNP has been holding out for seven front seats, a demand rejected by the ruling Awami League who say this would not be a proportional representation on the front benches as the main opposition party won only 30 of 300 seats in parliament. The second session, commonly known as the budget session, of the current parliament started on Thursday. The speaker adjourned the House on the same day following a condolence message at the death Sunamganj-1 MP Begum Mamtaj Iqbal. Finance minister AMA Muhith will place the budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year on June 11. The first session of the ninth parliament began on Jan 25. bdnews24.com
