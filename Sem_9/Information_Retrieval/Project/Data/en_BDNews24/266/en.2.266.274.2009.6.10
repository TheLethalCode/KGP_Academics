 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com health correspondent Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque has said reports on children falling ill after taking Vitamin A capsules and de-worming tablets during a government campaign were "propaganda". In an interview with bdnews24.com on Tuesday, Haque said: "Some newspapers reported that panic was deliberately spread in some areas by loudspeakers from mosques, saying children were dying from taking the Vitamin A capsules." Around 20 million children between one and five were administered the Vitamin A Plus capsules, and 19 million between two and five were given de-worming tablets, in last Saturday's nationwide drive. Of them, the media has reported between 400 and 2000 children falling ill and being taken to hospital after being administered the medicines. They also reported two children had died, a six year-old and an 11 year-old. Haque said of the two reported deaths, a newspaper on Tuesday quoted the mother of one as saying her child had died from prolonged illness, not from taking the Vitamin A or de-worming medicine. "The child was 11, an age well beyond the progamme limit," said Haque. "Another child reportedly died in Munshiganj but he was not under the programme either," the minister said. "A relatively small number of children fell sick after taking the Vitamin A plus capsules and deworming tablets, but none of them was seriously ill." Of the children taken to hospital, he said: "In a single day may find that many children may suffer from diarrhoea and vomiting for many different reasons." The minister said, "On June 4, 29 children reportedly fell ill in Faridpur a day after they took capsules and tablets. But there was already an outbreak of diarrhoea in the area." "If any child attacked with diarrhoea takes the capsule or deworming tablet, his health condition may worsen further." "No seriously harmful side effects from the Vitamin A Plus campaign has ever been observed until now," he added. UNICEF had affirmed the safety of the medicine and so there was nothing to be scared of, he added. But, Haque said, an investigation committee had been formed to look into any possibility of negligence in the nationwide drive. "It will work independently of the ministry," he said. The minister said samples of medicine would be sent abroad if any suspicion emerged after being tested here. 'Propaganda' On the alleged propaganda, Haque said some parents were woken up from their sleep and urged to admit their children to the hospital. Quoting newspaper reports, he said, "Shibir activists were allegedly involved in the misinformation from the mosques, and so I believe the propaganda was staged with an ill motive." Islami Chhatra Shibir are a student body backed by Jamaat-e-Islami. He cautioned that the perpetrators would have to face punishment. 'Decades-long success' The minister mentioned the decades-long success of the Vitamin A campaign around the world, adding it was not an "Awami League campaign". "It is a hugely acclaimed programme across the globe." "It has been running not only in our country but in many countries of the world for nearly 30 years, and has proved a very effective remedy for night blindness caused by Vitamin A deficiency." "It is not a programme of the Awami League government alone, previous governments have all run the programme," Haque pointed out. According to health ministry report, night blindness due to malnutrition dropped to 0.04 percent while it was 3.76 percent in 1976. "Our primary health service programmes are also highly admired. We have eliminated polio while India and other neighbouring countries have failed to do so," he said. bd
