<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Robin Soderling was simply content to have achieved the impossible at the French Open following his straight-sets defeat by Roger Federer in Sunday's final. The Swede, who lost 6-1 7-6 6-4 to Federer, was the man to beat four-times champion Rafael Nadal for the first time at Roland Garros. Soderling, seeded 23rd, sent shockwaves through the tennis world when he eliminated the Spanish world number one in four sets in the fourth round. "Of course, beating Nadal was very nice for me," he told a news conference on Sunday. "I think I made what was supposed to be impossible, beat him on clay in best of five, no one else had ever made it." Relying on his big serve and devastating forehand, Soderling knocked out Nadal 6-2 6-7 6-4 7-6 in possibly the greatest shock ever at Roland Garros. But the 24-year-old Swede could simply not live with Federer. "I think the match was what I expected, I played him so many times," said Soderling, who now has lost 10 times to the world number two. "I did not play aggressive enough. Every time I play against him, it's what I end up saying. "Now I am learning that it's not that I play bad, it is that he makes me play bad. "Roger's game does not suit my game at all, he does not let me be aggressive, he made me run a lot today. Instead, all matches against Rafa I dictated the points. "Against Roger, I can't do that." The Swede was upbeat about his future after reaching his first grand slam final. "I always believe in myself but this gives me a lot more confidence," said Soderling, who won his three career titles on hardcourts. "I think I can play well on all surfaces. I don't have a surface that does not suit my game. I had my best results indoors and now I feel very good for the grass.
