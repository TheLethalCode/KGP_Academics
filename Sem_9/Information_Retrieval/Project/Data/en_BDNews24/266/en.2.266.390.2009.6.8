<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)The government made changes to college admissions policy, the education ministry said on Monday. Classes for HSC and equivalents for the current session will start from July 12, said the ministry in a circular. Admissions will be based on SSC exam results only, and no admission test will be offered, it said. The 'disputed' age-based admission to colleges has been scrapped in the new policy, which states that students will be admitted to public and private colleges on the basis of merit and SSC results only. However, children of freedom fighters will be given priority in selection among equally qualified students. SSC results for 2009 were published on May 26. Students who passed the exams will be able to enroll in Class 11 by July 7, without any late fees. The last date of admission, with late fees, is July 20. bd
