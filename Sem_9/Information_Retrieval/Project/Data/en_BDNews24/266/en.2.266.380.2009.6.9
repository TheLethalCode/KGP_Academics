<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni on Tuesday told parliament that the government would not accept any country's interference in the planned war crimes trial. She also said Bangladesh's relations with any country would "not influence" the trial. Dipu Moni said the opinion was with Bangladesh on the question of trying the crimes committed in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Her comments came a day after a ruling coalition MP demanded a statement from the foreign minister on the remarks of a senior Pakistan government official who said trial of the war criminals would sour Dhaka's relations with Islamabad. An additional secretary to Pakistan's foreign ministry, Masood Khalil, on Sunday told a Bangladeshi media team that Pakistan's relations with Bangladesh would be "frosty" if Dhaka went ahead with the trial. "I want to assure this parliament and the people that the world is with us, the world opinion is with us on the question of trying the war criminals. "We are pledged bound to complete the trial of the war criminals with the support from all. I want to make it clear today the trial of the war criminals of 1971 is entirely Bangladesh's internal affair." Bangladesh's relations with any country would in no way influence the process of the trial, the foreign minister declared amid applause from the MPs. "We will not accept anyone's interference into our internal affairs." Dipu Moni said she had already informed international community about the trial and they had extended support to the government. She said the trial was not a new event; such trials had taken place in many countries. The United Nations had been providing technical supports, the foreign minister said. She said obligations to the international laws on crimes against humanity and the people's support for trial of the war criminals had forced Bangladesh to move to hold the much-awaited trial. The minister said the government must act in line with parliament's unanimous resolution adopted on Jan. 29 on the trial.
