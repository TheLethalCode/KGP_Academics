 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed Monday pardoned 14 university students and one employee who had been convicted of having links to the August campus violence. Full Story The latest development came as the nation waits with bated breath as a court delivers a verdict Tuesday in a second August campus rioting case against four Dhaka University teachers and 15 students. In the first case, another Dhaka court Monday cleared the four DU teachers and 11 students of emergency rules breach. Iajuddin pardoned four DU students sentenced to two years in jail, amid signs that long-running tensions over the contentious issue would fade. The president also pardoned 10 other students of Rajshahi University and one employee of the same university, secretary (Public Division) at the President's Office Mohammad Sirajul Islam told bdnew24.com by phone. IG (Prisons) Brigadier General Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com at 6:50pm that the Rajshahi University students had left prison. The four DU and 10 RU students were convicted in two cases of student unrest at Dhaka and Rajshahi Universities which took place in August 2007. The latest move by the president brought relief to the teachers and students who ratcheted up calls for the government to withdraw charges against all the accused people. Earlier, home affairs adviser MA Matin said the government would look into the demand for mercy to four absconding students of Dhaka University. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had made similar comments. "We are close to a solution," he said. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui convicted the four DU students in a judgement, in which he however acquitted four DU teachers and 11 students of the same charges. The acquitted teachers are Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. The students cleared of the charges by the court are Moniruzzaman Sardar Rubel, Rifat Hossain Ziku, Md Nazrul Hossain Russell, Md Shamsul Kabir Rahat, Mitul, Rokonuzzaman Talukdar, Tanzin Chowdhury Lilly, Arpana Pal, Shahnoor Nargis, Mohammad Kamruzzaman and Anwar. Matin said he was happy with the acquittal of the teachers and students. "I am very happy with the verdict. We wanted a respectful solution. The verdict has reflected that," he said. Asked if the verdict meant the government had backed off, Matin said: "This is not a question of failure. We wanted a good solution and we got that. Law has taken its own course." He also asked the university students and teachers to stop their movement and accept the verdict. After the verdict, a group of Dhaka University students, with faces covered in black cloths, took out a procession demanding freedom of the four convicted studentsSaiful Islam Firoz, Hasan Mamun, AH Kamrul Islam Kochi and Aziz Hasan. Hours after the verdict, the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani resumed hearing on similar charges in the second case and is set to deliver a judgement at 11am Tuesday. The case charges the teachers with making inflammatory comments and burning effigies on the campus of the country's premier university during the violence. The chaos began when some army personnel beat a university student during a football match on the university grounds. The melee that later spilled over onto the streets and elsewhere in the country raged on for several days. Prof Md Akhteruzzaman, former general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers' Association, said: "We are waiting for the final decision. Only one decision has been taken." "One more case is left. We want the release of all the teachers and students. Only when they are back among us, we will withdraw all our protest programmes," he told reporters. "The moment we get back our students and teachers we will go back to our professional duties, otherwise the protest will go on." Acting Dean of the social sciences faculty Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique said, "Who will take the responsibility of the teachers and students who have stayed in prison for the last 5 months?" Sub-inspector Rezaul Karim Khan of Shahbagh Police Station filed the cases on Aug 23. The courts indicted the teachers and the students on Dec 11 and Dec 12 for breaching emergency powers rules during days of August violence on the DU campus. Joint forces arrested Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid on the night of Aug 23. Professors Sadrul Amin and Nimchandra Bhowmik surrendered to court later. On Dec 4, a Rajshahi court sentenced Rajshahi University's management teacher Moloy Kumar Bhowmik and mass communication teachers Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun to two years in jail for "inciting student agitation" in late August. bdnews24.com/pb/mk/ra/gna/wz/ehb
