 TEHRAN, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The family of a Kurdish law student in Iran who died in custody is disputing the official version he committed suicide and wants his body to be exhumed to determine the cause of death, their lawyer said on Sunday. Lawyer Saleh Nikbakht said Intelligence Ministry agents detained Ebrahim Lotfollahi on Jan. 6 during a university exam in the western city of Sanandaj. His parents were told on Jan. 15 he was dead, even though he had seemed fine when they visited him a few days after his detention, the lawyer said. When family members went to the city cemetery, they were informed the 27-year-old had already been buried and were not able to see the body. Nikbakht said the family did not believe he had committed suicide and had filed a complaint against prison officials. "The family wants the body exhumed for examination by doctors, including one who should be their trusted doctor," he told Reuters by telephone. Nikbakht, saying he did not know why Lotfallahi had been detained, described him as a civil society activist but said he had not been a member of any Kurdish political group. bdnews24.com/lq/1708hrs Like neighbouring Turkey and Iraq, Iran has a large Kurdish minority and security forces often clash with Kurdish rebels. Judiciary officials had no immediate comment on the case. U.S.-based Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian authorities to investigate the "sudden deaths" of Lotfallahi and of Zahra Bani-Ameri, a 27-year-old female physician, who it said died in October while in custody in the town of Hamedan. In both cases, officials said the cause of death was suicide, it said in a statement on Saturday. "The Iranian authorities must take credible steps to determine what actually happened and hold accountable any officials responsible for these two deaths," said Joe Stork, Middle East deputy director at Human Rights Watch. The rights group said Bani-Ameri and her boyfriend were arrested in a park in Hamedan, west of Tehran, for having an "illegal relationship" and that her family was told the following day she had committed suicide in her cell. "In statements at the time to the Iranian press, Bani-Ameri's brother claimed that she had seemed fine during telephone conversations he had with her, including a call 30 minutes before the time of her reported death," it said. Relationships between men and women who are not married are banned in Iran, an Islamic state which follows sharia law. Iran regularly dismisses Western accusations
