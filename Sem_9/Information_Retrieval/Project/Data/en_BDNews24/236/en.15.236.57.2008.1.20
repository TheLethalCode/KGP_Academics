<TITLE> Jordan hides doubts over Bush's Mideast peace drive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AMMAN, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jordan publicly applauds US President George W Bush's late-term dip into Middle East peacemaking, but many Jordanians, including some officials, voice deep scepticism about prospects for success. The contrast points up Jordan's curious role. It is arguably the best friend the United States and Israel have in the Arab world. Yet its people, many of Palestinian refugee origin, are broadly hostile to US and Israeli policies in the region. Jordanian officials say King Abdullah, along with other Arab leaders, had helped prod Washington last year into reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that had been left to stagnate for the first seven years of Bush's presidency. "There was a feeling that the United States was not paying any attention whatsoever to the Palestinian issue," Royal Court chief Bassem Awadallah told Reuters in an interview. "There was no real effort by anyone in Washington to connect the dots between events in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine." Jordan is anxious to end a conflict it sees as fuel for Islamist militancy and for Iran and its allies to exploit. Awadallah said King Abdullah's efforts to win renewed U.S. engagement had been closely coordinated with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, whose authoritarian rulers are all viewed by Washington as "moderate" Arab allies. Breaking the ice with Damascus, the Jordanian monarch also visited Syria to urge it to attend the U.S.-hosted conference in Annapolis in November that kicked off the new peace drive. Jordan's opposition Islamists, who are close to the Palestinian Hamas movement, are predictably scathing about Bush's chances of achieving his declared goal of clinching a deal on creating a Palestinian state before his term ends. "The peace process is dead and buried," Rohayil Gharaibeh, deputy secretary-general of the Islamic Action Front, the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm in Jordan, told Reuters. "We think Bush represents a U.S. policy of tyranny and aggression against the Arab world." But it is not just the Muslim Brothers who doubt Bush can broker peace as long as U.S. policy is weighted towards Israel. MISTRUST FOR BUSH A senior Jordanian official with no sympathy for Islamists privately predicted disaster unless Bush pressed Israel hard for a deal in line with an Arab initiative that offered full peace with all Arab states in return for Israeli withdrawal to 1967 lines, a Palestinian state and an agreed solution for refugees. The official said Bush had torpedoed this initiative by asking Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to normalise ties with Israel even before Israeli-Palestinian talks had borne fruit. He shared a widespread view in Jordan that the U.S. leader had been more intent on drumming up Arab support against Iran than on achieving peace -- unless it was on Israeli terms. Jordanians were pleased to hear Bush call for an "end to the occupation" that has lasted since the 1967 war, but alarmed at his stress on the Jewish nature of Israel and his mention of compensation, but not return, for Palestinian refugees. They also see no sign yet that the attempt at peace will change realities on the other side of the Jordan river. Since Annapolis, Israel has unveiled new plans to expand settlements in the West Bank, where normal life remains stifled by myriad checkpoints and a barrier that carves into Palestinian land -- measures Israel says are vital for its security. In the Hamas-held Gaza Strip, Israel has intensified strikes aimed at halting rockets fired at its civilians by militants who defy the authority of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The risk that Bush's initiative will falter is clear, not least to Jordan, which made peace with Israel in 1993 and is set to get $663 million in U.S. economic and military aid this year. "We believe the credibility of the process in the eyes of the ordinary people in Palestine will be judged by what happens on the ground," said Awadallah, himself of Palestinian origin. "This is why we need to wait a few months, give it a few weeks at least, in order for us to be able to assess." Jordan was not on Bush's itinerary this month when he made his first trip as president to Israel and the West Bank, along with several Gulf Arab states and Egypt, but Awadallah said his country was heartened by the US leader's personal commitment. The king's adviser argued that Bush still had more time than was left when his predecessor Bill Clinton strove unsuccessfully to crown his term with a Middle East peace deal in 2000. "But we do need the Americans to be engaged ... to help the parties put together a plan for the negotiations and for reaching certain milestones" as the months tick by in 2008. "We see this as an opportunity. We are under no illusions it's going to be easy," he said. "But we can't afford to fai
