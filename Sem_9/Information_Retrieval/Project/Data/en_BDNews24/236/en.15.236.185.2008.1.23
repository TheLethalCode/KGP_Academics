<TITLE> Italian PM fights for survival in confidence votes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi rallied support on Wednesday for two confidence votes that will determine the survival of his centre-left government after the defection of an ally erased his Senate majority. Ordinary Italians, who have seen 61 governments since the end of World War Two, seemed jaded by the prospect of more turmoil which will further delay badly-needed economic reforms, at a time when Italy risks being dragged into a global slowdown. "I just can't see this is anything new," Rome pensioner Luigi Marini said as he read the doom-laden newspapers. "I am of a certain age and these crises happen when governments are unstable. I don't think we need to dramatise events." As Prodi struggled to survive the defection of a former minister's small Catholic party from his coalition, which relies on small parties for its majority, business daily Il Sole 24 Ore lamented the "abysmal distance separating the Italian political world from the economic reality in the rest of the country". Politicians were embroiled in frantic horse-trading before the votes at 1600 GMT on Wednesday in the lower house -- where Prodi has a comfortable majority -- and 1900 GMT on Thursday in the upper house or Senate, where he is against the ropes. "I am sure there are a lot of contacts now taking place in trying to get somebody to change their mind and give their support," Franco Pavoncello, politics professor at John Cabot University in Rome, told Reuters television. Prodi fuelled speculation he might resign by paying a visit to President Giorgio Napolitano. No details came out but it was reminiscent of Prodi's tactical resignation last February to scare his allies into line. On that occasion, Napolitano reinstated him. On Wednesday, a government source said Napolitano had told Prodi to review his decision to hold the vote in the Senate where his chances of success appeared slim. The source said Prodi would make a decision after the vote was held later in the day in the lower house. INTERIM GOVERNMENT Pavoncello said Prodi could still pull off the Senate vote, scheduled for Thursday evening, by luring back Udeur or striking a deal with other centrists. If Prodi does lose, one possible scenario is the appointment of an interim government to overhaul the messy and unpopular electoral system before a new election is held. Conservative former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, beaten by Prodi in 2006 elections, hopes a Senate defeat for Prodi would trigger snap elections under the current rules, which polls suggest his centre-right would win by a clear margin. "In some sectors of the coalition there is a palpable desire to get rid of the 'Professore' (Prodi). The problem is that it is difficult to shelve Prodi without triggering a new Berlusconi era," wrote Corriere della Sera's columnist Massimo Franco. Prodi's fate hangs on whether he can muster enough support in the Senate to compensate for losing the Udeur's three seats, plus two coalition dissidents who have said they will vote 'no'. Prodi's tiny Senate majority of 158 seats versus 156 has now been erased and he relies on seven unelected lifetime senators to survive, as he has in many of the 31 confidence votes he has used to push through legislation in his 1-1/2 years in power. In the Senate, abstention counts as a vote against, absences favour Prodi and a tied result is considered a defeat. By some calculations, Prodi's best hope is to win by a single vote. "I will be there and I will vote my confidence in Prodi," said former president Oscar Scalfaro, a lifetime senator. Giulio Andreotti, a seven-times former prime minister and another honorary senator with full voting rights, said he could see "no alternative at the moment to this government, so I will vote for Prodi tomorrow". But Roberto Maroni, a deputy from the right-wing Northern League, said it would be a "minority dictatorship" if Prodi clung to power on the votes of these unelected elder statesmen: "When a government no longer has a majority it must resig
