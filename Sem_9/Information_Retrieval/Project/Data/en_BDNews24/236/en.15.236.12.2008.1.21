 Manila, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three people were killed and five injured in the Philippine capital after celebrations to mark a religious festival turned bloody, police said on Monday. The annual Santo Nino festival, where people parade small, robed statues of Jesus Christ as a child, is traditionally a wild affair due to drinking bouts after the spectacle in impoverished communities in Manila. "We're still aiming for a violence-free fiesta," Roberto Rosales, Manila's police chief, told reporters, appealing to residents to cut down on alcohol during the merry-making. "We'll be fielding more police officers next year to pre-empt violence." This year's fiesta was more peaceful than last year when 16 people were killed in fights. On Sunday, a police officer was shot in the foot and stomach when he went to check out a gunshot in a crowded neighbourhood in Manila's Tondo district. Four members of a local criminal gang were arrested for shooting the officer, who was not in uniform, mistaking him for a member of a rival gang involved in an earlier melee. Local radio said one resident of Tondo was shot dead, another fatally stabbed and a third mauled to death after he challenged his neighbours to a fight. Thousands of people took part in a fluvial procession on the city's main Pasig river on Sunday, parading an icon of the Child Jesus, known as "Sto. Nino", believed to protect Manila from typhoons, fires and plagues. Spanish colonisers introduced Catholicism to the Philippines in the 16th century but the country's majority Catholics often mix religious holidays with pagan pre-Colonial rituals, such as street dancing to the beat of drums and chants, locally known as "Ati-Atihan". Filipinos also spice their Catholic faith with Oriental mysticism and superstitious beliefs.
