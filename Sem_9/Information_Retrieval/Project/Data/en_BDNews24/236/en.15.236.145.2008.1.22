Judge Amar Kumar Roy fixed the date following arguments from opposing councils Monday. The former power secretary is currently in detention. His wife Nazneen remains on the run. According to case details, Akhter amassed Tk 2.15 crore by misusing his influence and power. It is also alleged that he concealed information on property worth Tk 79.72 lakh in a wealth statement he submitted to the ACC. Akhter's wife allegedly assisted her husband in the crime.
