 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government has approved a proposal to use a PGCB optical fibre cable as an alternative line connecting Dhaka with the landing station of the submarine cable in Cox's Bazar, a ministry official said Tuesday. The post and telecommunication ministry also approved a separate BTTB proposal to reduce the fees for internet bandwidth. Joint secretary of the ministry Gazi Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the government had approved the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board agreement with the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. A proposal to cut BTTB charges on bandwidth for internet use was also approved, he said. The BTTB in mid-November had sent a proposal to the ministry to set up an alternative transmission link between Dhaka and Cox's Bazar, ministry officials have said. The proposal was on the table of the ministry for over two months however. During this period, BTTB had its own transmission line to the submarine cable landing station severed on more than one occasion. Since its inauguration on May 21, 2006, the 437 km optical fibre link between Dhaka and Cox's Bazar has suffered disrupted transmission 23 times. BTTB have blamed "unknown vandals" for eight of the 23 disruptions to service, saying they had severed the cable for "subversive reasons". BTTB officials have told bdnews24.com that it would take at least three months to establish the new connection from the approval date. The reduced charges proposal by BTTB includes lowering the fee for setting up and testing an International Private Lease Circuit with over 2 mbps bandwidth to Tk 75, 000 from Tk 90,000, said BTTB officials. The minimum charge for setting up a leased internet-access above 2 mbps bandwidth will be fall to Tk 20,000 from Tk 30,000. Monthly charge for bandwidth above 2 mbps would be reduced to Tk 32,000-Tk 40,000, from Tk 55,000-Tk 75,000. Individual users would have to pay BTTB Tk 1,000 instead of Tk 1,400 for unlimited internet use. The monthly fee for the 'OfficeMate' package will be reduced to Tk 700 from Tk 1,000 and the 'OfficePack' to Tk 700 from Tk 750. bdnews
