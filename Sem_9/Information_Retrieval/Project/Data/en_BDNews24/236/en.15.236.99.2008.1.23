 MELBOURNE, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Novak Djokovic survived a late bout of nerves to beat Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer 6-0 6-3 7-5 and reach the Australian Open semi-finals on Wednesday. The Serbian third seed missed four match points and was broken when serving for victory but recovered to set up a semi-final against either world number one Roger Federer or American 12th seed James Blake. Ferrer had won three of their previous five meetings but a near flawless Djokovic was in a different class early on, racing through the first two sets and taking a 5-3 lead in the third. As the nerves set in, however, Ferrer saved four match points in the ninth game and broke back for 5-5 but Djokovic broke again and saved a break point before serving out for victory to reach his fourth grand slam semi-final in a row
