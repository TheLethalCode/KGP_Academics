<TITLE> Ecuador government accuses opposition leader of bribery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Quito, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuadorean authorities on Tuesday said they would investigate opposition leader Lucio Gutierrez after accusing him of plotting to bribe a pro-government member of a powerful assembly rewriting the constitution. Gutierrez, a former president who remains popular among poor Ecuadoreans, has been a fierce critic of President Rafael Correa and has vowed to challenge him for the presidency if the assembly calls for early elections later this year. The accusations are the latest exchange between Gutierrez, who was ousted during street protests nearly three years ago, and Correa's government, elected at the end of 2006 promising sweeping reforms in the unstable Andean country. "This shows some groups are trying to create instability in our institutions and government," Interior Minister Fernando Bustamante told reporters. "Lucio Gutierrez... is the alleged head of the plot." Bustamante showed a video in which two men -- former government employee Cao Munoz and government climate institute employee Bolivar Lopez -- are seen offering $3 million to assembly member Gabriel Rivera from Correa's Alianza Pais party in exchange for him rejecting a constitutional draft the assembly will vote on later this year. The video was filmed in secret by the government with the help of the assembly member, and the two suspects were arrested earlier on Tuesday, he said. He said the government needs to gather more evidence to seek legal action against Gutierrez. Gutierrez's party said the former president is not linked to the incident and accused the government of instigating a smear campaign to tarnish his reputation. "This is a new chapter of scandals in a dirty war against Lucio Gutierrez and our party," the Patriotic Society Party said in a statement. Correa, a leftist former economy minister, has increased his control after only one year in office through a series of political victories over a fragmented opposition many Ecuadoreans dismiss as corrupt and inefficient. But his popularity dropped to 57 percent in January, near its record low, due to his perceived confrontational style. Correa, an ally of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, cannot seek re-election when his term ends in 2011. But the government-controlled assembly is expected to seek reforms to allow him to run for a consecutive term. Another opposition leader Alvaro Noboa, the country's richest man and a three-time presidential candidate who lost against Correa, was expelled in January from the assembly for not disclosing his personal wealth
