 SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Major Asian stock markets fell as much as 8 percent as panicky investors feared a US recession could derail global economic growth, and a sharp drop in US stock index futures pointed to heavy selling in New York later on Tuesday. Industrial metals such as zinc and copper plunged and oil fell well below recent record highs as the prospect of slowdown posed a threat to demand. Investors, fearful of a protracted bear market, sought the relative safety of government bonds. European shares are set to extend Monday's savage sell-off, which saw them suffer their biggest one-day slide since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Financial bookmakers in London see Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 notching up opening losses of more than 1 percent. Share markets from Tokyo to Sydney slumped between 4-8 percent, with India's benchmark Sensex crashing more than 11 percent at one point, triggering a trading halt. "It's like a funeral in here," said Ken Masuda, senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities in Tokyo. "No one knows what's going to happen tonight in New York. It's like we've gone blind, you don't know what's coming. "Until we see New York, all we can do is sell," he said. U.S. stock index futures fell around 4.5 percent, signalling a sharp sell-off on Wall Street later. All eyes are on earnings from Bank of America later, anxious to see if there are further writedowns related to exposure to risky mortgages. The sell-off, which has rocked markets since late December, gathered pace sharply on Friday where U.S. equity markets suffered their worst weekly performance since mid-2002, showing a clear lack of confidence in Washington's proposed fiscal stimulus worth up to $150 billion. Wall Street reopens later after a holiday on Monday. Comments from IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn that all developed countries were suffering from the U.S. slowdown entrenched fears that global growth was hitting a wall. Billionaire investor George Soros said the world was facing the worst financial crisis since World War Two and the United States was threatened with recession. STAY CALM The yen hit a 2-1/2-year high against the dollar and was trading at 106.05 yen by 0628 GMT as investors reduced their exposure to risky, higher-yielding assets. The strong yen hit Japanese exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp, Sony Corp and Canon Inc MSCI's All Country World Index fell 1.5 percent to its lowest since October 2006. The MSCI All Country index has dropped about 19 percent since its November 2007 peak. MSCI's Emerging Market index, which on Monday had its worst daily fall since August, shed almost 5 percent. Japanese treasuries surged as alarmed investors sought the relative safety of government debt, with March 10-year futures hitting the highest since September 2005. The widely-followed iTRAXX Asia ex-Japan high-yield index a key measure of risk aversion, widened, and some investors called on central banks to restore confidence. "This has just begun. It's the popping of a credit bubble. We're in chapter 2 of a five chapter story," said a Treasuries trader at a U.S. investment bank in Tokyo. Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram urged investors to stay calm, insisting the fundamentals of the economy remain strong. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates at 0.5 percent as expected and is set to warn of slower growth in an economic review due later. BIGGEST DROP SINCE 9/11 Japan's Nikkei ended down 5.7 percent -- a 28 month low and its biggest one-day loss since the Sept. 11 attacks. The index lost 9 percent so far this week as fears deepened that the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis would drag global financial markets lower. South Korea's technology stocks, heavily dependent on the U.S. export market, were mauled, pushing the main stock index down to its lowest close since May. The slump wiped around 37 trillion won ($39 billion) off the value of the main board. South Korea's national pension fund said it was a net buyer of blue-chip stocks. Hong Kong blue chips spiralled lower, sliding 8.6 percent, with U.S. recession fears dragging bellwether bank HSBC Holdings to lows not seen since October 2003. Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies sank 12 percent. The Hang Seng Index is down about 30 percent since a recent peak in late October and off 19 percent this year. Shanghai's stock index fell 8 percent. The president of China's sixth-largest bank, China Merchants Bank Co, told Reuters on Monday that earnings at Chinese banks will probably be hit this year by the snowballing U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and Beijing's moves to cool the economy. "News like this suggests that damage may be spreading in developing markets including China, and this is worsening the overall sentiment in financial markets," said Toshiyuki Suzuki, a New York-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank. "It appears that these markets, too, will not be able to escape the impact of the wave of worsening international economies." Australia's S&P/ASX 200 share index fell 7 percent, its biggest one-day percentage fall since becoming the benchmark. Mining stocks, sensitive to any economic slowdown, led the decline. BHP Billiton fell almost 7 percent and Rio Tinto tumbled 11.6 percent. Shanghai copper and zinc futures fell by their 4 percent daily limits. Oil deepened losses as global stock markets tanked. London's Brent crude fell more than half a dollar to $86.85 a barrel by 0644 GMT. "This is a meltdown. The weakness is spreading and there is nowhere to hide outside government bonds and, of course, cash," said MF Global analyst Edward Meir.
