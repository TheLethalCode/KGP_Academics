 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The nation waits with bated breath as a court delivers a verdict Tuesday in another August campus rioting case against four Dhaka University teachers and 15 students. Full Story The verdict comes after another Dhaka court has cleared the teachers and 11 students of emergency rules breach in the first case. In a major twist to the fast unfolding events Monday, education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said a move was underway to ensure presidential mercy for 14 convicted students of Dhaka and Rajshahi universities. "The process is nearing completion," Zillur told reporters in a press briefing. President Iajuddin Ahmed on Dec 10 pardoned four Rajshahi University teachers on petitions filed by the wives of the teachers. The court Monday sentenced four fugitive DU students to two years in prison. Earlier, home affairs adviser MA Matin said the government would look into the demand for mercy to the four convicted students. But the students demanded withdrawal of the charges against all accused people. "The government is aware of the demand for mercy. An effort will be made to ensure mercy from the president through a proper channel," Matin told reporters at his ministry. He said he was happy with the acquittal of the teachers and students. "I am very happy with the verdict. We wanted a respectful solution. The verdict has reflected that," he said. Asked if the verdict meant the government had backed off, Matin said: "This is not a question of failure. We wanted a good solution and we got that. Law has taken its own course." He asked the university students and teachers to stop their movement and accept the verdict. After the verdict, a group of Dhaka University students, with faces covered in black cloths, took out a procession demanding freedom of the four convicted studentsSaiful Islam Firoz, Hasan Mamun, AH Kamrul Islam Kochi and Aziz Hasan. The court of Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Md Habibur Rahman Siddiqui handed down the verdict on the first case at 10:45am, which convicted four students and fined each of them Tk 1,000 or another month in jail. Hours after the verdict, the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani resumed hearing on similar charges in the second case and is set to deliver a judgement at 11am Tuesday. The case charges the teachers with making inflammatory comments and burning effigies on the campus of the country's premier university during the violence. The chaos began when some army personnel beat a university student during a football match on the university grounds. The melee that later spilled over onto the streets and elsewhere in the country raged on for several days. The acquitted teachers are Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. The students cleared by the court are Moniruzzaman Sardar Rubel, Rifat Hossain Ziku, Md Nazrul Hossain Russell, Md Shamsul Kabir Rahat, Mitul, Rokonuzzaman Talukdar, Tanzin Chowdhury Lilly, Arpana Pal, Shahnoor Nargis, Mohammad Kamruzzaman and Anwar. Prof Md Akhteruzzaman, former general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers' Association, said: "We are waiting for the final decision. Only one decision has been taken." "One more case is left. We want the release of all the teachers and students. Only when they are back among us, we will withdraw all our protest programmes," he told reporters. "The moment we get back our students and teachers we will go back to our professional duties, otherwise the protest will go on." Dean of the social sciences faculty Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique said, "Who will take the responsibility of the teachers and students who have stayed in prison for the last 5 months?" Sub-inspector Rezaul Karim Khan of Shahbagh Police Station filed the cases on Aug 23. The courts indicted the teachers and the students on Dec 11 and Dec 12 for breaching emergency powers rules during days of August violence on the DU campus. The judgement came after the government Thursday appealed to the court to fast-track the trial. Teachers and students of the university had mounted a series of protest campaigns to demand "unconditional and honourable" release of the detainees for months. The students had also called for a countrywide one-hour class boycott in all educational institutions for Jan 23 to press their demand. Defence counsels had argued that the process was illegal since separate cases could not be filed on the same charges. Joint forces arrested Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid on the night of Aug 23. Professors Sadrul Amin and Nimchandra Bhowmik surrendered to court later. On Dec 4, a Rajshahi court sentenced Rajshahi University's management teacher Moloy Kumar Bhowmik and mass communication teachers Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun to two years in jail for "inciting student agitation" in late August. bdnews24.com/pb/mk/ra/gna/
