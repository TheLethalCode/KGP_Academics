<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Debutant opener Nasir Jamshed scored 61 as five batsmen struck half centuries to help Pakistan amass 347 for five in the first one-day international against Zimbabwe on Monday. Younis Khan (79), Mohammad Yousuf (72), captain Salim Malik (63) and Misbah-ul Haq (55 not out) also scored fifties after Zimbabwe surprisingly elected to bowl first on a flat National Stadium pitch in the day-nighter. Left-handed opener Jamshed gave the innings a flying start, scoring his runs from 48 balls with six fours and three sixes. Timing the ball effortlessly, he hit pacer Elton Chigumbura for a six to mid-wicket to reach his fifty from 40 balls after opener Salman Butt (4) was run out by Chamu Chibhabha from deep mid-wicket. Pakistan also included uncapped left-arm paceman Samiullah Niazi. Jamshed went at the total of 85 in the 15th over but the experienced Younis and Yousuf came together to add 113 runs from only 99 balls. Younis made his 30th one-day fifty and Yousuf reeled out his 61st career half century as both dominated the listless bowling attack until experienced left arm spinner Ray Price had them both caught in the deep playing extravagant shots. However, Malik and Misbah kept up the relentless attack, producing a fourth-wicket stand of 99 from 70 balls. Zimbabwe captain and off-spinner Prosper Utseya went for 46 runs in five overs
