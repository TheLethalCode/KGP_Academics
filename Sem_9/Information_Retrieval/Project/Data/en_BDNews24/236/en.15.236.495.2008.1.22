<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 22 (bdnews24.comReuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas on Tuesday to disperse supporters of President Mwai Kibaki hours before former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan starts mediating in an election standoff that has caused weeks of violent unrest. Riot police scattered about 100 government supporters who had been chanting "Lead on, Kibaki!" in central Nairobi, sending businesspeople scurrying for cover. Police forced the protesters into shops and nearby alleys. "The opposition has to recognise Kibaki is president," trader Julius Kuria said in the panicked crowd. Workers hung out of nearby windows after a teargas canister landed in their office. The east African nation descended into chaos after Kibaki's disputed re-election on Dec. 27 in which opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) cried foul. More than 650 people have been killed since then in ethnic violence and clashes with the security forces. Since the election, police have banned street protests, almost all of which have been by the opposition. In a new sign of damage to east Africa's strongest economy, Kenya's shilling neared an 14-month low versus the dollar and Kenya Airways said it has seen an 18 percent drop in passengers from Europe since the crisis began. Kibaki and Odinga have not met despite pressure from Western powers like the United States, Britain and the European Union. Veteran negotiator Annan is due to meet both sides and push for direct negotiations, a step which eluded Ghanaian President John Kufuor, the head of the African Union, earlier this month. "Short of getting them both in chokehold and banging their heads together, Mr Annan has very little leverage on either President Kibaki and Mr Odinga or their respective entourages of myopic warmongers and sycophants," columnist Macharia Gaitho wrote in the Daily Nation, Kenya's leading newspaper. But diplomats hope Annan, a Nobel Peace laureate whose negotiating experience ranges from Israel to Darfur, can bring Kibaki and Odinga to the same table for the first time since the vote, and possibly into some sort of power-sharing arrangement. TEARGAS AND MACHETES Weeks of bloodletting in a nation long seen as one of east Africa's most stable has undermined its democratic credentials and laid bare tribal sentiments that underpin its politics. Scenes of police firing teargas and live ammunition in Nairobi slums, or of bloodied victims of machete and spear attacks in the picturesque Rift Valley, have damaged Kenya's image as a tourist haven and regional trade and aid hub. An aid agency complained on Wednesday that the government was going to close a Nairobi refugee camp, where victims of violence in the Kibera slum had fled and still need shelter. "We can't tell people whose houses have burnt down in Kibera to go back to their homes. These people have rights," said Gerald Rukunga of the health charity AMREF. ODM chairman Anyang' Nyong'o said the party was filing a complaint with the International Criminal Court in The Hague, charging Kibaki, his cabinet, and police commanders over killings of protesters. "The charges are crimes against humanity," he said. The government has taken out full-page adverts in newspapers accusing Western powers, the international media and rights groups of fanning unrest by questioning the election result. US Ambassador Michael Ranneberger dismissed the adverts as "scurrilous propaganda". Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni also flew into Nairobi on Tuesday to try to mediate, though as one of few African leaders to have congratulated Kibaki on his win, his efforts have already been met with scorn by opposition supporters. The opposition has called more protests from Thursday. But political sources told Reuters the ODM would cancel the protests if Annan asked it to, as a sign of good faith.
