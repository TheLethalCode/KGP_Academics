 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)A move is underway to ensure presidential mercy for 14 convicted students of Dhaka and Rajshahi Universities, education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday. "The process is nearing completion," Zillur told reporters in a press briefing. The four DU and 10 RU students were convicted in two cases of student unrest at Dhaka and Rajshahi Universities which took place in August 2007. The students did not file appeals for mercy. It appears that president Iajuddin Ahmed will exercise his powers to pardon any convict with or without appeals. Earlier, home affairs adviser MA Matin said the government would look into the demand for mercy to four absconding students of Dhaka University who have been handed down two years in jail each for breaking emergency rule during the August campus violence. Metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui delivered the verdict earlier Monday, in which he, however, acquitted four teachers and 11 students of the same charges. But the students demanded withdrawal of the charges against all accused. "The government is aware of the demand for mercy. An effort will be made to seek mercy from the president through a proper channel," Matin told reporters at his ministry. He said he was happy with the acquittal of the teachers and students. "I am very happy with the verdict. We wanted a respectful solution. The verdict has reflected that," he said. Asked if the verdict means the government has backed off, Matin said: "This is not a question of failure. We wanted a good solution and we got that. Law has taken its own course." He asked the university students and teachers to stop their movement and accept the verdict. bdnews24.com
