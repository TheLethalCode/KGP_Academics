 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  B league clubs have given the Bangladesh Football Federation the go-ahead to announce the date for players' transfers. The decision was made Sunday at a meeting between eight B League clubs and the B League committee at BFF House. "We told the committee we have no problem taking part in players' transfer, and they can announce the date as soon as they want," B League clubs coordinator Mustaqur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "We, however, asked them to ensure their promise to assist the clubs financially. They told us they have been working on it," said Rahman, who is also additional general secretary of Mohammedan Sporting Club. On Jan 17, top footballers threatened the BFF with boycotting all competitions, and publicly demonstrating if the football governing body did not announce the transfer date immediately. They also demanded the publication of 2008's calendar. Except for three clubs outside Dhaka, all representatives from Mohammedan, Abahani, Muktijoddha Sangsad, Brothers Union, Arambagh KS, Sheikh Russel KC, Rahmatganj MFS and Farashganj SC were present at the meeting. "The clubs' representatives demanded a calendar for 2008, so they could rope in players in line with the calendar," said Abu Nayeem Shohag, manager of the B League. Shohag said that the BFF would hold an emergency meeting on Jan 24 to finalise the transfer date. Last year the BFF promised all B league clubs financial support, although they failed to keep their promise after securing only Tk 75,000 for the league's sponsorship. The BFF is yet to collect the sponsorship money. bd
