 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bndews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed Monday pardoned 14 university students and one employee who had been convicted of having roles in the August violence, an official of the Bangabhaban said. Full Story IG (prisons) brigadier general Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com at 6:50pm that the Rajshahi University students had already left prison. The president approved mercy for four Dhaka University students who had been sentenced to two years in jail. Iajuddin also pardoned 10 other students of Rajshahi University and one employee of the same university, secretary (Public Division) at the President's Office Mohammad Sirajul Islam told bdnew24.com by phone. The students and the RU employee were convicted in two cases of unrest at Dhaka and Rajshahi universities which took place in August 2007. The latest move by the president came as a relief to the teachers and students who ratcheted up calls for the government to withdraw charges against all the accused people. Earlier in the day, two caretaker government advisers spoke of a plan for the presidential mercy although the convicted students did not apply for clemency. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had earlier said that a move was underway to ensure mercy for the convicted students. Also, home affairs adviser MA Matin said the government would look into the demand for mercy to four absconding students of DU. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui delivered the verdict earlier Monday, in which he, however, acquitted four DU teachers and 11 students of the same charges. A Dhaka court is set to deliver a verdict on the four DU teachers and 15 students in another case that involves charges of making inflammatory comments and burning effigies on the campus during the state of emergency. bdnews24.co
