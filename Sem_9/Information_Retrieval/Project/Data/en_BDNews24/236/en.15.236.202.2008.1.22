 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) The prices of fertiliser, diesel and electricity are to remain unchanged until March to assist farmers through the boro irrigation season, cabinet members said Tuesday. "The country currently has plenty of urea in stock," agriculture adviser CS Karim told reporters following a meeting at the agriculture ministry. The adviser said that fifteen thousand dealers have been assigned to 1.5 crore farmers, up from 4,800 dealers. "Since the extra dealers were appointed, fertiliser has been reaching farmers directly. I visited ten districts recently, and have not seen any scarcity of fertiliser," he added. Karim also said the government is subsidising each 50 kg sack of urea by Tk 1,200. There is an estimated demand of 4.83 lakh tonnes of urea for the month; the government currently has stocks of 4.90 lakh tonnes, say agriculture ministry officials. Special assistant to the CA for energy and power M Tamim told reporters Tuesday that there were no plans to increase the price of diesel or electricity either during the upcoming boro irrigation period. "The coal mine in Boropukuria will produce 210-250 megawatts of electricity," Tamim said after a separate meeting chaired by food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali. "As this plant is connected to the national power grid there should not be any problems with the electricity supply." "If problems do arise, farmers will be given priority. In addition, diesel will be in plentiful supply," Tamim said. bdnews24.com/e
