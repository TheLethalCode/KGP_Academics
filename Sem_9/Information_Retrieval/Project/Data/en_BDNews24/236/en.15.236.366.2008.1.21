<TITLE> Recent tension between Greece and Turkey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis goes to Turkey on Wednesday, the first Greek premier to make an official visit since 1959. There have been periods of high tension between the two since Greece won its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, though they are now NATO allies. They have fought four major wars, the last in 1919-1922 which ended with a largescale exchange of populations. This is a chronology of bilateral tensions in the last 35 years: 1974 - Turkey invades Cyprus and occupies its north in response to a coup in Nicosia, inspired by the military junta then ruling Greece. A Greek-Turkish war is averted but the island's Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities remain divided despite UN reunification efforts. 1987 - Prime Minister George Papandreou orders Greek warships to sink a Turkish ship if it goes ahead with plans to enter Greek waters to conduct an oil survey, highlighting disputes over Aegean waters. 1996 - Washington intervenes to stop Greek and Turkish warships from clashing over a small deserted island, known in Greece as Imia and in Turkey as Kardak, in the eastern Aegean. 1999 - Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan is captured as he leaves the Greek embassy in Nairobi where he was given shelter. Greek-Turkish relations enter a crisis but destructive earthquakes in both countries in the same year unleash a mutual wave of sympathy that improves ties. 2004 - Cyprus joins the European Union after Greek Cypriots reject a UN reunification plan while Turkish Cypriots vote to accept it. Turkish Cypriots therefore enjoy none of the benefits the Greek Cypriots gain with EU accession. The island's division remains a hurdle to Turkey's EU accession hop
