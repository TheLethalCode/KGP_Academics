 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka stocks continued their slide Tuesday despite investors' confidence in power shares. "Investors are changing their priorities on where to put their money, this is reflected on the day's turnover board," said Dhaka Stock Exchange CEO Salahuddin Ahmed. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the DSE to investigate potential cases of unlawful share transfer by brokerage houses, said to a senior SEC official. The request came after the market watchdog recently fined Globe Securities Ltd for violating securities rules by depositing a client's shares as a margin. The market opened with a slight decline in the general index, remaining stable throughout the day's trade, before slumping again towards the close. The benchmark DGEN or general index declined 22.71 points, or 0.77 percent, to end at 2926. The DSI or all share price index closed at 2464.09, down 19.42 points, or 0.78 percent. The blue chip DSE-20 slumped 18.46 points, or 0.77 percent, to end on 2361.44. Turnover totaled Tk 1.43 billion from 6,579,875 traded shares. Of the issues traded, 117 advanced, 95 declined and 18 remained unchanged. The day's turnover was dominated by the power sector, banks, and mutual funds. Almost all bank shares continued their decline from the previous day, while power shares rallied for the second day. Z category scrip UCBL topped the turnover board, closing 6.56 percent lower at Tk 3751.75. AB Bank followed shedding 0.57 percent to end at Tk 2789. Market major BRAC Bank ended at Tk 1504.25, down 2.17 percent. Power heavyweight DESCO advanced 5.07 percent to close at Tk 1112.75. State-run Jamuna Oil continued its decline, closing 11.89 percent lower at Tk 365. Among other scrips on the turnover board, IFIC Bank, Grameen Mutual Fund One and Islami Bank all fell. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and NBL gained. Tulip Dairy & Food, Fine Foods, Wonderland Toys, Dhaka Fisheries and Eastland Insurance were among the major gainers. German Bangla Foods, Jamuna Oil, Dutch Bangla Bank, Meghna petroleum and Bengal Fine Ceramic topped the losers. bdn
