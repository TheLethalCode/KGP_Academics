 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  The police Sunday moved to attach all movable and immovable property of Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar in twin income-tax dodge cases. Ramna police chief Daulat Akbar told bdnews24.com that the police started the operation on the 14-storey building at 11am under the supervision of a magistrate. The building houses Janakantha, a once-popular Bangla-language newspaper. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque issued the attachment order on Jan 9. The tax-dodge cases centres on allegations against Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar and Globe Construction Ltd. The Group's managing director Atiqullah Khan Masud is behind bars. His wife Shamima A Khan, their sons Mishal Atiqullah Khan and Jishal Atiqullah Khan, and chartered accountants of the companies are facing arrest warrants in connection with the cases filed by the National Board of Revenue on Jan 6. Janakantha executive editor Borhan Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "We are not sure if the attachment order applies to the newspaper as well." "The police came and checked documents of the newspaper," he said. bdnew
