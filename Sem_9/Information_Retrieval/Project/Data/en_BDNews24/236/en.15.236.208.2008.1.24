 London, Jan 24 (bdnews24,com/Reuters) - Oil prices fell below $87 a barrel on Wednesday as stock markets declined further, shrugging off a temporary reprieve from Tuesday's steep cut in US interest rates amid persistent fears of a global economic slowdown. US crude fell $2.44 to $86.77 a barrel by 1745 GMT, after hitting a low of $86.11 in the previous session amid a global stock market rout. London Brent crude fell $1.97 to $86.48 a barrel. Some analysts said funds and speculators have been exiting open positions in oil and other commodities to cover margin calls and finance losses in equity markets. "I think a lot of people realise the underlying weakness of the economy is still unfolding ... traders feel that there are lots more losses still waiting to be revealed," said Robert Nunan, manager of Mitsubishi Corp's risk management unit.

Goldman Sachs said that, while oil prices could slide into the low $80s if speculators liquidated their long positions, strong fundamentals would probably prevent funds from selling out completely. US crude oil stocks, which rose last week for the first time in nine weeks, after hitting their lowest since 2004, were believed to have risen by 2.1 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll of analysts found. US government inventory data, due Thursday, a day later than usual due to Monday's US holiday, is also likely to show a rise of 1.4 million barrels in gasoline stocks as refiners begin to build up supplies ahead of summer, the poll showe
