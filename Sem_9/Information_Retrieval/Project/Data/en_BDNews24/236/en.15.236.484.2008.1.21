 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court cleared four Dhaka University teachers and 11 students of charges Monday in one of the cases charging them with emergency rules violation during the August campus rioting on the premises of the country's premier university. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Md Habibur Rahman Siddiqui handed down the verdict in the case at 10:45am. The same verdict sentenced four absconding students in the case to two years in prison and a Tk 1,000 fine each, or another month in jail if they do not pay the fine. However, the acquitted teachers and the students will not be released anytime soon as another case against them is pending. A separate court Monday resumed hearing on the second case against the four teachers and 15 students. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani is presiding over the case filed with Shahbagh Police Station on charges of violating emergency rule. According to case details, the teachers had made inflammatory comments and burnt effigies on the DU campus during the August violence. The judgement in the first case came after the government Thursday submitted a written appeal urging the court to fast-track the trial of the teachers and students. Teachers and students of the university had mounted series of protest campaigns to demand unconditional and honourable release of the detainees for months. The students had also called for a countrywide one-hour class boycott in all educational institutions for Jan 23 to press their release. The acquitted teachers are Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. The students cleared by the court are Moniruzzaman Sardar Rubel, Rifat Hossain Ziku, Md Nazrul Hossain Russell, Md Shamsul Kabir Rahat, Mitul, Rokonuzzaman Talukdar, Tanzin Chowdhury Lilly, Arpana Pal, Shahnoor Nargis, Mohammad Kamruzzaman and Anwar. The students convicted of the charges are Saiful Islam Firoz, Hasan Mamun, AH Kamrul Islam Kochi and Aziz Hasan. Two separate courts indicted the teachers and the students on Dec 11 and Dec 12 of breaching emergency powers rules during days of August violence on the Dhaka University campus. Defense counsels had argued that the process was illegal since separate cases could not be filed on the same charges. Sub-inspector Rezaul Karim Khan of Shahbagh Police Station filed the cases on Aug 23. Joint forces arrested Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid on the same night. Professors Sadrul Amin and Nimchandra Bhowmik surrendered to court later. The chaos began when some army personnel beat a university student during a football match on the university grounds. The melee that later spilled over onto the streets and elsewhere in the country continued for several days. On Dec 4, a Rajshahi court sentenced Rajshahi University's management teacher Moloy Kumar Bhowmik and mass communication teachers Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun to two years in jail for inciting student agitation in late August. President Iajuddin Ahmed on Dec 10 pardoned the four teachers on petitions filed by the wives of the teachers seeking clemency. bdnews24.
