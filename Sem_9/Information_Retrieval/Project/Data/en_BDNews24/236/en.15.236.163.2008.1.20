<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sun Jan 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for greater cooperation with India on combating terrorism as he began a visit to New Delhi on Sunday. Brown wants India to become a member of an international body that counters terrorist financing -- the Financial Action Task Force -- and also wants to help it to acquire sophisticated equipment to detect people carrying weapons or explosives at ports and airports. "There's got to be greater cooperation between the major countries and Britain in the fight against terrorism," he told the BBC in an interview on Sunday. "I want not just China and Pakistan but also India to play their part in cooperating with us so we can root out those who are seeking to use terrorist finance," he said. "That means India should join what's called the Financial Action Task Force -- it's not yet a member -- so it can play its part in working to deal with terrorist structures," Brown said. He also called for a hearts and minds campaign to combat "extremist ideologies". Brown arrived in India from China where he focused on expanding trade and investment and on cooperation against climate change. In India he will hold talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, meet business leaders and give a speech on Monday on reforming international institutions. Brown arrived armed with promises of hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid to combat poverty in India, where 400 million people live on less than $1 a day despite the country's rapid economic growth. Britain said that over the next three years it will give India 825 million pounds ($1.6 billion) in development aid, with more than half spent on health and education. The money will help provide 300,000 more teachers and enable four million more children to go to school by 2011, the British government said. In a sign of the growing economic ties between Britain and India and India's increasing financial clout, Tata Steel Ltd last year bought Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus for 6.2 billion pounds. Ford Motor Co this month chose a sister company, Tata Motors Ltd, as the front-runner to buy famous British vehicle makers Jaguar and Land Rover. Brown is also expected to discuss trade and his ideas for an international early warning system to prevent a recurrence of the U.S. sub-prime lending shock which has led to a global credit crunch and claimed a high-profile casualty in Britain in mortgage lender Northern Rock. Brown called on Saturday for a new drive to reach a global trade agreement. Years of talks on a new trade liberalization pact have made slow progress. (1 pound=$1.9
