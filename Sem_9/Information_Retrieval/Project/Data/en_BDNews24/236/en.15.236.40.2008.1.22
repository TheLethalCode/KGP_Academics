 Zia Shahin bdnews24.com correspondent Bogra, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  A three-day Bangladesh-India border conference concluded in Bogra Tuesday, with both sides reaching a consensus on five points, and swapping lists of suspects. BDR public relations officer Sajjad Haider told reporters that both sides had agreed on exchange of information on terrorists, a day-time ban on gunfire except in self-defence, cooperation over cross-border smuggling of counterfeit currency notes and narcotics, taking action over illegal border crossings and "preventing infiltration". In a joint press conference on the concluding day at Hotel Naz in Bogra, both sides reported swapping lists of suspects thought to be hiding across from their respective borders. BDR deputy director general Brig Gen MA Bari said: "BSF has provided data about suspected secessionists which will be handed over to higher authorities." "India says these secessionists are taking cover inside Bangladesh," Bari told reporters. The deputy director general said that Bangladesh had handed over to BSF a list of 1,626 Bangladeshi criminals thought to be hiding in India. "At the same time, BSF has given us a list of 1,000 suspects." BSF North Bengal Frontier inspector general RA Tewari said BSF had agreed not to open-fire during daylight hours except in self-defence, and to take care over night-time firing. Another border conference is scheduled to be held in Shillong in February, the two agencies announced. Brig Gen MA Bari led a 12-member Bangladesh delegation, including BDR commanders of Rajshahi, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Khulna and Kushtia sectors, and officials of the ministries of home and foreign affairs. BSF North Bengal Frontier inspector general RA Tewari led a 16 member Indian delegation. bdnews2
