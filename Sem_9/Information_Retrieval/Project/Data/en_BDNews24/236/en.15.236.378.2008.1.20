 NAIROBI, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three people were hacked to death with machetes in a slum in Kenya's capital on Sunday in ethnic clashes triggered by President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election last month, witnesses said. Three bodies lay in Nairobi's Huruma neighbourhood, whose name means "mercy" in Swahili, all of them bearing the scars of machete attacks. Armed police chased away youths as some residents started to leave, their belongings on their heads. "I saw three people dead, killed by pangas (machetes), slashed on the head, cuts on the back and a hand chopped off," Samuel Oduor, 22, a freelance cameraman, said. Other witnesses confirmed the death toll from fighting between youths from Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group and the Luo tribe of opposition challenger Raila Odinga. They bring the death toll to at least 31 since the opposition launched three days of anti-government demonstrations on Wednesday. Many were killed by police opening fire on protesters, others by ethnic gangs. "No need to kill somebody because of his tribe, even if he did not vote for me," Odinga told several hundred supporters as he came out of a church service in Nairobi's Kibera slum, its roads blackened with the remains of days of flaming barricades. Odinga said a memorial service would be held at a sports field in central Nairobi on Wednesday for those who had died and repeated a call for more demonstrations from Thursday, despite police orders to prevent rallies. "You can beat our body, but you cannot break our spirit of justice," he told cheering supporters, some holding up banners reading "Raila our solution" or "Kibaki hand over to Raila". TRIBAL TENSIONS More than 650 people have been killed since Kibaki was sworn into office after a disputed Dec. 27 election the opposition says was rigged and observers said was seriously flawed. The violence has tarnished Kenya's image as a stable nation in a troubled region, undermined its democratic credentials and laid bare the underlying tribal sentiments behind its politics. A flyer apparently from the Mungiki, an ethnic Kikuyu gang notorious for its brutal attacks and lucrative protection rackets, was circulated outside the church where Odinga spoke. It warned Luos living in Kibera of reprisals. "It is now known ... that the Luo had predetermined to cause chaos," said the printed flyer, whose authenticity could not immediately be verified. "It is time that their aggression is halted forthwith without delay, therefore Mungiki taking control," it said. Police were noticeable for their absence in Kibera as Odinga left the church after a heavy presence in recent days. But they were deployed in Huruma where the latest killings took place. Residents said there had been sporadic fighting through the night between Kikuyus and Luos in Huruma. Police were not available for comment. "They are beating us. They want to chase us away. They are armed with bows and arrows and they are killing our children," Wangeci Mwangi, 75, said of the gangs. EU aid commissioner Louis Michel, who met Kibaki and Odinga on Saturday, has urged both sides to meet and hold talks to resolve their standoff and end the killing. Human rights groups have voiced concern at heavy-handed police tactics to stop opposition gatherings last week, which included the shooting of some protestors as they tried to flee. The police are investigating television footage which shows officers shooting two unarmed demonstrators at close range. The opposition and government accuse each other of genoci
