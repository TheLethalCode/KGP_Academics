<TITLE> Obama says Bill Clinton's criticism is `troubling` </TITLE>

 Columbia, S.C., Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama said in an interview airing on Monday that former President Bill Clinton's recent criticism of his record and campaign were "troubling" and he was ready to fight back. Obama, an Illinois senator who is dueling Bill Clinton's wife Hillary for the Democratic presidential nomination, said the former president had made statements about him that were untrue. "You know the former president, who I think all of us have a lot of regard for, has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling," Obama said in an ABC interview to air on "Good Morning America." "He continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts -- whether it's about my record of opposition to the war in Iraq or our approach to organizing in Las Vegas," he said. "This has become a habit, and one of the things that we're going to have to do is to directly confront Bill Clinton when he's making statements that are not factually accurate," Obama said. Bill Clinton has been an active presence on the campaign trail for his wife, a New York senator, and has become increasingly critical of Obama as the rivalry between the two senators has intensified. He recently said Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war was a "fairy tale," said putting Obama in the White House would be a roll of the dice and said Obama's union supporters in Nevada were trying to suppress the vote of Clinton backers. Hillary Clinton and Obama are dueling for the Democratic nomination in the November election to succeed President George W. Bush. Obama won Iowa, and Clinton has won the last two contests in New Hampshire and Nevada. Nevada's contest featured accusations by both camps of voters suppression and ended up with Obama claiming one more national convention delegate than Clinton -- even though she won more votes. "I understand him wanting to promote his wife's candidacy. She's got a record that she can run on," Obama said on ABC. "But I think it's important that we try to maintain some -- you know, level of honesty and candor during the course of the campaign. If we don't, then we feed the cynicism that has led so many Americans to be turned off to politics." The Clinton campaign released a statement reiterating the criticisms of Obama and expressing support for Bill Clinton. "We understand Sen. Obama is frustrated by his loss in Nevada but facts are facts. Sen. Obama's allies in Nevada engaged in strong-arm tactics and intimidation against our supporters and his record against the war has been inconsistent," spokesman Phil Singer said. "President Clinton is a huge asset to our campaign and will continue talking to the American people to press the case for Senator Clinton," he said.
