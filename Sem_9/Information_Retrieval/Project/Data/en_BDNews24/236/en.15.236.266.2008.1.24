 La Paz, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivian President Evo Morales replaced four of the 16 government ministers on Wednesday in his first Cabinet shake-up, but he retained the officials holding the major posts of foreign affairs, energy and finance. Morales named a new minister for development planning, who will play an important role in shaping economic policy. He also named a new public works and housing minister, just a day after celebrating his second anniversary in power. A leftist and the country's first indigenous president, Morales also replaced his health and sports minister, and small business and production minister. "We don't want simple public servants ... we want revolutionaries," Morales said. In a televised speech, Morales told his Cabinet, "One of our tasks above all will be to reach January 22, 2009, with greater economic growth than we've had up to now." South America's poorest country grew by nearly 4.3 percent in 2007
