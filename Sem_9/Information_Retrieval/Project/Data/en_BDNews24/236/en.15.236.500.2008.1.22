<TITLE> Caretaker government system lived out its life: Badruddin Omar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Columnist and writer Badruddin Omar has said the caretaker government system is no longer a remedy to any political crisis in the country. In a memorial lecture on the late barrister Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed Monday, Badruddin said such a makeshift system worked for the time being after the autocratic regime of HM Ershad had collapsed. "The idea originated during the anti-Ershad movement in the 1980s. It had surfaced for the political need of the time. But the people, who had raised the issue, did not think of its legal aspects," he said. Badruddin said the Fakhruddin administration, which tends to call itself a military-backed interim government, was born out of the fall of a caretaker government (led by president Iajuddin Ahmed). The memorial lecture was organised to mark the 76th birth anniversary of the late Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, senior advocate of the Supreme Court. The Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed Smriti Parishad organised the discussion at the National Museum auditorium. Former chief justice Mustafa Kamal chaired the meeting. Badruddin said Ishtiaq worked for the separation of the judiciary from the executive but could not see the changes. "But Ishtiaq Ahmed would not have been happy if he had seen the way the judiciary was separated," he said. Former attorney general Mahmudul Islam said Ishtiaq had played a significant role in shaping up the caretaker government system. His thought was linked with an alternative interim system to hold a free and fair election in the country when controversy mounted over Magura elections under the BNP government, Mahmudul said. Ishtiaq was honest not only in his work but in his thought and political ideology, he said. Justice Mustafa Kamal said Ishtiaq was not a politician but was an ideologue for politicians. "Now we have a very few people like him (Ishtiaq)," Kamal said. Publisher of the University Press Limited Mohiuddin Ahmed said Ishtiaq had been successful in performing as an adviser to two caretaker governments. Justice Mustafa Kamal later launched "The Ishtiaq Papers"a collection of his write-ups. Former chief justice KM Hasan, Dr Kamal Hossain, Dr M Zahir, Dr Anisuzzaman, justice Tafazzal Islam, justice MA Matin, barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud, journalist Ataus Samad and Ishtiaq's daughter Dr Raina Fateh also attended the discussion. bdnews24
