 ANKARA, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan's president on Monday rebuffed criticism of Musa Hilal, accused by Washington of coordinating Darfur's marauding militias, following Hilal's promotion to a key government post in Khartoum. Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, on the first day of a visit to EU candidate country Turkey, also accused Europe of backing the violence in Darfur.

Turkey's Gul, who looked uncomfortable during the news conference, said he had urged Bashir during their talks to seek a peaceful end to the conflict in Darfur. Bashir's visit to Ankara and to Istanbul, Turkey's business hub, is expected to boost economic ties, though human rights groups have criticised Turkey for hosting Sudan's leader.
