<TITLE> Argentines go back to beef as economy thrives </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A few years ago, an economic crisis and soaring steak prices made beef a luxury for many Argentines. But beef is back on menus again, raising fears stagnant production will not be able to keep pace with demand. "You can't change the Argentine custom of eating a lot of beef," said William Hayes, president of meat export firm Argentine Beef Packers. "As soon as there's more money, beef is always the No. 1 choice." The world's biggest beef eaters, the average Argentine ate nearly 69 kilograms (152 pounds) of it last year, the highest rate for 13 years, according to the Argentine Beef Promotion Institute (IPCVA). That compares with about 43 kg per person in the United States. At the height of a devastating 2001-02 economic crisis, millions of Argentines were plunged into poverty and beef consumption sank to its lowest level since the institute's records began in 1958. Exports then jumped as the devaluation of the peso currency made them cheaper, driving up domestic prices beyond the reach of many poorer Argentines. But the economy has grown more than 8 percent in each of the last five years, fueling fresh demand for the nation's favorite food. The booming market for beef both at home and abroad has prompted a string of government measures aimed at keeping a lid on prices, including export restrictions, subsidizing feedlots and even promoting pork and chicken as alternatives. "The government, with everything it's done, has managed to put the brakes on prices in a way that hasn't happened with other foods, so beef continues to be cheap," said Marcelo Fielder of the influential Argentine Rural Society (SRA), an independent nonprofit organization representing farmers. "A kilo of chicken, a kilo of fish is more expensive and to put it bluntly, (beef) fills you up more," he added. INFLATION WAR But even if the government's price-fighting policies have helped put beef back on Argentine plates, they have angered ranchers and challenged the country's historic position as the world's No. 3 beef exporter. According to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Argentina had dropped to the world's No. 4 biggest beef exporter in 2006, trailing Brazil, Australia and India, with sales abroad of 556,000 tonnes. Big buyers of cheap Argentine cuts are Russia and Chile, with top quality beef going to European Union countries. Argentina's reduced export role opened the door for neighboring Uruguay, and its sales to Russia and Chile rose during 2006. Critics say the policies are contributing to a steady decline in production, encouraging ranchers to dedicate their Pampas lands to lucrative crops such as soybeans and sell off their herds. "It's not enough to control prices. A series of concrete measures are needed to stimulate production to ensure domestic supply," said the Argentine Rural Confederation (CRA), an umbrella grouping of local farming associations that frequently criticizes the government. Last year, the number of animals sent to slaughter rose roughly 10 percent from a year earlier, according to the latest figures from meat industry chamber CICCRA. Nearly 1.4 million animals were killed in November, the biggest slaughter during any month since 1990. But CICCRA also said far more cows were sent to market than usual, suggesting some ranchers are not keeping them for breeding and are running down their herds. "It's a way to finish off a herd built up over years by the father and the grandfather, so we're in a serious situation. The lack of supply is a serious matter," rancher and analyst Juan Llauro said in an online interview at Agrositio.com. "Production isn't increasing, and that's becoming a more and more serious problem. The farmers are fed up and they're going over to soy or sunflowers," he said. While beef exports have been limited by the government, sales of soy and other crops have surged due to sizzling global prices. In Argentina's main grain port Rosario, soy prices hovered at record levels above $300 per tonne this week, double two years ago, due to increased demand for the oilseed from China and for biofuels. The area planted with the oilseed has jumped from 10.6 million hectares (26.2 million acres) in 2000 to more than 16 million in the South American nation this season. Such trends are changing the face of Argentina's legendary Pampas plains, prompting farmers to shift their herds to northern provinces too hot and dry for most crops. Traditionally grass-fed, cattle are increasingly being fattened in feedlots, with state subsidies for feed encouraging ranchers to switch to the more intensive method, freeing up land for crops. But despite ranchers dire warnings of a supply crunch, few Argentines seem ready to change their eating habits. "Beef is part of the Argentine tradition," said Claudia Valdez, a middle-aged diner at a steakhouse in a middle-class Buenos Aires neighborhood. "I adore it. I can sit for hours in a restaurant eating beef, for me it's a pleasur
