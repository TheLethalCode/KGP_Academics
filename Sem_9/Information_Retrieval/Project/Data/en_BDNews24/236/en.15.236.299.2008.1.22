<TITLE> It's honourable freedom for DU teachers: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Tuesday said the government arranged the release of teachers with honour. "We hope a proper academic atmosphere will now return to the campus," he said in a press briefing at the education ministry, hours after four Dhaka University teachers were freed from jail. Zillur said there were many big challenges, including holding a proper election, and "all need to pay attention to that". Explaining the reason for the "delay" in releasing the teachers, the adviser said: "The government is respectful to the judiciary, which is why the government had to wait for the court verdict." The adviser thanked teachers and students for not taking to street violence. "It proves that nobody wants to take the path of anarchy." The adviser ducked questions on whether the cases were baseless and said: "I am not here to explain the law." "Different people will look at the episode from different angles. I think the matter has to be seen from a holistic approach. Sometimes the government takes decisions in line with people's need." bdnews24.c
