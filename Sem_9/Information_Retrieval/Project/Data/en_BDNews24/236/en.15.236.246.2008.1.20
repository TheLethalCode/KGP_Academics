 Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com Chittagong correspondent Chittagong, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com) - Chittagong police are becoming increasingly concerned about the high incidence of violent crime in the port city. People's attention has been grabbed by what the media have dubbed 'Aggyan Party', or a gang of muggers who knock the victim unconscious before robbing. At least 30 incidents involving a substance which knocked the victim out have been reported since the beginning of the year, despite enhanced surveillance by the police. Chittagong Medical College Hospital and private clinics report a daily intake of victims of violent crime. A tally from CMCH police outpost reveals that up to 40 victims of violent crime have been admitted to the hospital in the last two weeks alone. A youth was admitted on Saturday with a gunshot wound following a mugging. On Friday were admitted two victims knocked unconscious by a gang with a chemical agent. On Thursday Runa Akhter and Babul Haque were rushed to CMCH after being discovered unconscious in the Askar Dighi and Bhaddar Hat areas of the city. Assistant police commissioner of the detective branch Ashiqul Haq Bhuiyan said: "The activities by the so-called Aggyan Parties will not be stopped if people are not aware of police initiatives." "Vagrants get involved with this type of crime to fund their drug habits, or even just to feed themselves." "They are not generally organised as a gang. Around 12 individuals have now been arrested in different areas of the city, but they have no link to one another," Bhuiyan said. The assistant police commissioner said police activity has been stepped up at bus stops and rail stations as well other vulnerable areas in the city. Bhuiyan said police stations in critical areas have been specifically tasked with reducing violent crime in their zones. "Police checks are being conducted at 42 posts throughout the city, in addition to specific units targeting violent crime," said Bhuiyan. "Even after the police's Tiger Force was formed, and increased surveillance on mobile phone hawkers, incidents of mugging and Aggyan Party has not come down," he said. Rapid Action Battalion-7 Commander Lt Col Hasinur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "Muggers are now using CNG autorickshaws in their attacks." "In most cases the muggers employ mobile phone hawkers and unemployed youths as their assistants," he said. The RAB commander said the root of the problem was unemployment: "I urge garment factory owners to employ more male workers to assist in maintaining law and order." Rahman added that plainclothes RAB officers will start checking the paperwork of mobile phone sellers in Reaz Uddin Bazar among other big markets in the city. bdnews
