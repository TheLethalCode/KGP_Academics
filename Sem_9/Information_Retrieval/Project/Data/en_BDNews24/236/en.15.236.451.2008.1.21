<TITLE> Philippines` mining chief keeps faith and focus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Manila, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lito Atienza does not see any contradiction between his job and his faith. The devout Catholic and chairman of the Philippines' pro-life movement is tasked with promoting mining despite scepticism from the Church, which is a powerful player in politics here. "There are very clear passages in the Bible that say creation and the environment have been given to Man to manage and not to disregard and allow to lie idle," the 66-year-old told Reuters in an interview. "The Philippines has vast minerals that should benefit the people." Since his appointment last year as secretary for environment and natural resources, the jovial father of eight has used his political talents to woo foreign mining investors to explore deposits of copper, gold and other metals believed to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while allaying the concerns of the bishops. "My long-time relationship with the Church and the Church leaders and our pro-life movement is a great opening, they know my conviction, they know my thinking." The Catholic establishment is sceptical about large-scale mining due to a history of environmental mishaps and the failure of a minerals boom in the 1970s to improve local livelihoods. Bishops forced President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to agree to a review of an investor-friendly mining law in 2006, tripping up efforts to revive the industry. Priests often take a stand against miners on their patches, and can whip up support from their congregation and activists. A political survivor who cut his teeth as an opponent of dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s and 1980s, Atienza rose to prominence as vice-mayor and later mayor of Manila. His appointment to the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) was seen as Arroyo's reward to a loyal ally who supported her through several impeachment attempts. His relaxed style -- and in particular his penchant for loud Hawaiian shirts -- makes for a marked contrast with predecessor, Angelo Reyes, a strait-laced former military chief. "He's a crowd pleaser. He knows how to pamper the crowd. He makes decisions based on how many people are for him, on the basis of popularity," said Ramon Casiple, executive director for the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms. CLEANSING THE CONSCIENCE As mayor of Manila, Atienza's faith was conspicuous. He banned the distribution of artificial contraception in public clinics in the city, leading to a rise in the rate of abortion, which is illegal in the Philippines and usually carried out in backstreet clinics using unsafe methods. And he ordered aborted foetuses found in the city to be christened and buried in a crypt in Manila's North Cemetery. "Many of our volunteers are mothers who have been victims of the same malpractice. They also experienced abortion and this (collecting the foetuses) was one way of cleansing their conscience." "We have also founded a crisis home for abandoned babies. Our mission is just to save lives, these are the babies found in garbage cans, sidewalk areas, thrown away by the irresponsible mothers." Activists were aghast when Atienza was appointed environment chief. He was dubbed the "butcher of Arroceros" after ordering Arroceros Park in Manila closed in 2003 to make way for building. Atienza said the park's trees were replanted in other parts of the city and insists he is well suited to his current job. "The environment and human life are one and the same God-given creation. You cannot separate one from the other, when you save the environment you save life." He also sees no contradiction between promoting mining and protecting the environment and sees New Zealand as an attractive role model for the Philippines, which has a wealth of wildlife, beaches, coral reefs and tropical forests. "New Zealand is attracting a lot of ecotourism from all over the world at the same time that they have a very strong mining industry. We should learn from these best practices," he said. Atienza expects China to dominate foreign investments into the mining sector this year and forecast foreign inflows of over $1 billion in 2008, a rapid acceleration from last year's $200 million plus. Meeting top level mining executives, however, does not persuade Atienza to don dark business suits. "For me it's ridiculous to be wearing a tie in the Philippines," said Atienza, who was sporting a cornflower blue shirt with beige stripes and blooms. "I feel so concerned about people wearing ties and staying under the sun, I encourage them to wear tropical shirts. I've converted many."
