 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan urged people Monday to unite in a movement against profiteering to protect their consumer rights. He also called on the government to establish a Consumer Rights Act. "Consumer rights cannot be realised without building up resistance against the monster of profiteering," he said Monday, speaking at the national conference of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh. "History shows nobody gives others rights," the RRC chief said, speaking as chief guest at the conference held at the BIAM Auditorium in the capital. "As no government has come forward to protect consumers' rights, year after year, the consumers will have to come forward to realise their own rights." "In the present reality, there is no alternative to a public movement for protecting consumers' rights. The movement has to be spread throughout the country." "However, it must be borne in mind that 'movement' does not mean agitation and ransacking. A united disciplined movement has to be built up," Akbar Ali stressed. "The government will have to give all assistance to such a movement," he added. The RRC chairman advised the government to create a separate market monitoring agency so that essentials prices remain within the buying capacity of all people, as well as a separate agency for protecting consumers' rights. He asked the government to establish a Consumer Rights Act the act as an ordinance as soon as possible, adding it was "very sad for our nation" that no government had done so till now. "It is not possible to solve the spiralling price of consumer goods in the market using law enforcing agencies," Akbar Ali said. "All governments have remained indifferent to protecting consumers' rights," the former finance adviser lamented. In a capitalist business environment the businessmen's aim is to satisfy their greed, he said, adding that businessmen in the country tended to realise excessive profit from consumers in the name of a 'free market'. "But when the greed exceeds limit the consumer suffering mounts." Akbar Ali also mentioned the adulteration of foods by small traders "due to lack of education" among them. "Both the buyers and seller have to be conscious about this." He warned that any movement for realising consumers' rights might face obstacles from the vested quarters, but stressed: "Consumers' rights have to be protected ignoring all obstacles and through a disciplined movement." The RRC chairman announced his solidarity with any such movement. CAB president Borhan Ahmed chaired the conference. USAID country director Denise A Rollins and CAB general secretary Qazi Faruque also spoke. bdnews
