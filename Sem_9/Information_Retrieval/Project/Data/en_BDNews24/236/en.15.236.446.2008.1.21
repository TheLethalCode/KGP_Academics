<TITLE> Late Ibrahimovic double snatches Inter win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A leaders Inter Milan came from behind to beat Parma 3-2 at home on Sunday after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's controversial late double in foggy conditions. Inter, who maintain their seven-point advantage at the halfway stage of the season, were 2-1 down with two minutes to go when Parma defender Fernando Couto was adjudged to have handled an Ibrahimovic shot off the line. Replays were inconclusive and despite Parma protests that he had used his head, Couto was sent off and Ibrahimovic converted the penalty before chesting down and firing in a stoppage-time winner with Parma's defence weakened. "We didn't play very well. A great player has won it for us at the end," Inter coach Roberto Mancini, celebrating his 200th game in charge, told Sky Sport. "It seems to me that the ball touches his head and then his hand," he added when watching a replay of the penalty incident. Second-placed AS Roma had earlier put pressure on Inter with a 2-0 home win over Catania and for a time it looked like the champions would suffer their first league defeat of the season and their lead would be cut to four points. Esteban Cambiasso put Inter ahead on half an hour when he sliced in after Luis Jimenez's deep corner but Parma were always a threat and scored five minutes before the break through Luca Cigarini's superb strike. Inter keeper Julio Cesar then let substitute Andrea Gasbarroni's freekick through his fingers midway through the second half and Parma could have been further ahead but for Couto hitting the post with a header. Ibrahimovic, who also scored twice in last weekend's 3-2 win at Siena, then popped up with his 12th and 13th goals of the season to extend Inter's winning run to eight league games and 13 games in all competitions. SENT OFF Inter handed a debut to loan signing Maniche while Parma, who had coach Domenico Di Carlo sent off for protesting the penalty, brought on new striker Cristiano Lucarelli. Roma's win came courtesy of Ludovic Giuly's eighth-minute strike and Daniele De Rossi blasting home a second-half penalty in the absence of flu victim Francesco Totti. Three Catania fans were injured before kickoff after being stabbed in disturbances, media reported. Juventus, in third, could only draw 0-0 at home to Sampdoria and are now 12 adrift of Inter, whom they meet in an Italian Cup quarter-final first leg at the San Siro on Wednesday. David Trezeguet had a double effort cleared off the line with replays again not proving whether the ball had crossed the line after his second attempt. AC Milan were also heading for a goalless draw until substitute Alberto Gilardino struck in injury time to secure a 1-0 win at fifth-placed Udinese, who lost fourth spot to Fiorentina on Saturday when the Florence side beat Torino 2-1. Carlo Ancelotti again fielded a Brazilian front three with Ronaldo hitting the post in the first half and teenager Pato combining well with Kaka to slip in Gilardino for the winner. Milan, in ninth, have three games in hand with the first at Atalanta on Wednesday
