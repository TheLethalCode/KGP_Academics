 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Wednesday ordered attachment of moveable and immoveable property of former chief whip Abul Hasanat Abdullah in a graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque issued the order. The same judge issued an order on Jan 17 to arrest the Awami League leader. The attachment order came after Dhanmondi police sub-inspector Kazi Mainul Islam filed a report with the court showing Abul Hasanat a fugitive. The judge fixed Jan 29 for the next hearing of the case. The ACC submitted the chargesheet in the case against the AL leader on Jan 16 on an allegation of acquiring wealth beyond his legal income sources and hiding information about assets. ACC assistant director Rahela Khatun filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station on Sept 6, 2007 after tracing Tk 1.7 crore in Abul Hasanat's shady wealth. Abul Hasanat has also been charged with concealing information about the wealth of Tk 52.55 lakh in the statement submitted to the graft watchdog. bd
