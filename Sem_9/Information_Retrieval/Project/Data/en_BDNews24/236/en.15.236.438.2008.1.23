<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  People with only a three-year bachelor's degree will no longer be eligible to apply for civil service jobs, according to an official decision. Candidates must have a masters' degree to apply, but those who have a four-year bachelor's degree will not be required to have a master's. The candidates must obtain 50 percent marks to pass written exams and 40 percent in oral exams. Earlier the pass marks for a written test were 45 percent. The Bangladesh Civil Service (Age, Qualification and Examination for Direct Recruitment) Rules 1982 was amended to make the changes, according to a Jan 17 gazette. The changes will be effective from the 28th BCS examinations. An official with the Public Service Commission said there were more changes in the BCS exams. From now on, applications will be verified in three stages and candidates could view their answer papers after paying charges for it. The PSC invited applications for 1,720 vacancies under the 28th BCS. Of which, 574 vacancies are under the "general cadre" and 1,146 are under "technical and professional cadres". Three boards will work for application verification: the pre-approval board, moderators' board and the final board. The applicants will be asked to sit the preliminary exam once their applications are approved. The examination fee has also been hiked to Tk 500 from Tk 250. bdnews24.com/a
