 LONDON, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid secured a 2-0 win in their Primera Liga derby match against Atletico on Sunday to maintain a handsome seven-point lead over rivals Barcelona. In Italy, Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice in the dying minutes to help leaders Inter come from behind to beat Parma 3-2, and stay seven clear of AS Roma. ITALY Inter Milan maintained their seven-point lead at the top but only after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late double helped the champions come from behind to beat Parma 3-2. His first from the penalty spot was highly controversial with Parma defender Fernando Couto sent off after being adjudged to have handled on the line. Replays were inconclusive but suggested the main point of contact was Couto's head. Second-placed Roma kept the pressure on the leaders with a 2-0 home win over Catania but Juventus are now 12 behind Inter in third after a 0-0 home draw with Sampdoria. Substitute Alberto Gilardino slotted in an injury-time winner from Kaka's clever backheel as AC Milan moved up to ninth with a 1-0 victory at fifth-placed Udinese. SPAIN Real Madrid maintained their seven-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the Primera Liga with a 2-0 win over city rivals Atletico Madrid at the Calderon. Real scored his 11th goal against them in city derbies, steering in at the near post with just over 30 seconds on the clock. Real keeper Iker Casillas produced a succession of brilliant saves before leading striker Ruud van Nistelrooy finished Atletico off with his 12th of the season on the stroke of halftime. Barca needed an opportunist header from Thierry Henry to clinch a flattering 1-0 win over an ambitious Racing Santander at the Nou Camp. The weekend also witnessed the fastest goal in Primera Liga history, Valladolid striker Joseba Llorente scoring after just seven seconds of his side's 2-1 win over Espanyol and then completing a memorable display with another before the break. ENGLAND Manchester United hung on to top spot in the Premier League as England's top three all posted away victories. United needed late goals from Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to subdue Reading in a 2-0 victory that took them to 54 points from 23 matches played. Arsenal are also on 54 points after a convincing 3-0 win at a Fulham side who look destined for the drop. Emmanuel Adebayor scored with two first-half headers and Tomas Rosicky struck after the break. Chelsea ground out a 1-0 win at Birmingham City to stay in touch in third place with 50 points, Claudio Pizzaro netting a late winner with a header. Everton won 2-1 at Wigan Athletic on Sunday to go fourth, three points above Liverpool who play at Aston Villa on Monday, one of their two games in hand. Everton have 42 points. NETHERLANDS The leading three - PSV Eindhoven, Ajax Amsterdam and Feyenoord - dropped points against relegation strugglers. PSV were held to a 1-1 draw by 10-men VVV Venlo. Rachid Ofrany opened the scoring in the second minute with a superb lob but Balazs Dzsudzsak equalised 10 minutes later to keep PSV on top with 40 points after 19 matches. Klaas Jan Huntelaar salvaged a point for Ajax with a 74th-minute strike after Jeremain Lens opened the scoring for NEC Nijmegen. Early goals from Michel van Guldener and Geert den Ouden inspired Excelsior Rotterdam to a stunning 2-1 victory over neighbours Feyenoord, who answered through Danny Buijs. FRANCE Lyon's lead at the top of the Ligue 1 was cut to three points after the French champions crashed 3-0 at Racing Lens who had only five wins under their belt this season. The loss came four days after they lost at Le Mans in the quarter-finals of the French League Cup. Nice defeated Nancy 1-0 in a clash between the two surprise packages of the season. The result prevented Nancy from reclaiming second place from Girondins Bordeaux, who recorded a 2-1 win at Le Mans on Saturday despite playing with 10 men for the entire second half. Nice are a point behind Nancy in fourth
