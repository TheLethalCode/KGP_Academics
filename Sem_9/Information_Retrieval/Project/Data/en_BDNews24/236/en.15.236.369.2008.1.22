 DURBAN, South Africa, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies captain Chris Gayle is flying home from the tour of South Africa to recuperate from his hamstring injury. "Given the most recent prognosis I will require at least another two weeks of recovery before I could even consider picking up a bat again," the opener wrote in his diary on the Cricinfo Web site (www.cricinfo.com). "I have been granted permission by the West Indies Cricket Board to return home to Jamaica to concentrate on getting better." Gayle tore his hamstring during the tour of Zimbabwe which preceded the South African trip. He played in the first test in Port Elizabeth but was hampered by the injury in the second match and missed the third test. Gayle was also forced out of Friday's Twenty20 match and Sunday's first one-dayer. "Chris will go home tonight (Monday) or tomorrow," West Indies media officer Philip Spooner told Reuters. Spooner said Dwayne Bravo, who has stood in for Gayle in his absence, would take over the captaincy for the four remaining one-dayers. The team's management had yet to decide whether to call for a replacement from the Caribbean, said Spooner
