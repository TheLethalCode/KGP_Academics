 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced three Dhaka University teachers to two years' imprisonment. One DU teacher and 15 students were cleared of the charges. The convicted teachers are Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain and social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid. The court acquitted applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. After the verdict, Prof Anwar Hossain told reporters that the judgement went against the "conscience of the nation". Additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani took only one minute to read out the summary of the 36-page verdict. The four teachers of Dhaka University were taken to court at 10:40am amid tight security. Prof Akhteruzzaman, former general secretary of DUTA, said: "Everything was stage-managed. Our protests will continue." In an instant reaction, defence counsel Adv Masud Talukder, said: "It's a mysterious judgement. There were no lawyers for the state in court." Additional public prosecutor Kabir Hossain said: "The teachers had violated emergency rule. In the trial procedure, there was no intervention by the government as the judiciary is free." bdnews24.
