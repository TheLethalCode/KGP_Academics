 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Some banks have reduced the spread between deposit and lending rates, in an apparent response to Bangladesh Bank's concern over the widening interest rate gap. At least nine banks have hiked the rates on deposits by 0.25 and 2.00 percentage points in January responding to the BB's frequent requests to keep the spread within 5 percent. Still the spread remains above 5 percent, according to central bank officials. "We've increased interest rates on deposits to reduce the gap and attract deposits as well," a senior Pubali Bank official told bdnews24.com in a recent interview. Now the interest rate on deposits of Pubali Bank stands at between 9 percent and 11 percent, the official said. Southeast, Premier, Citibank NA, State Bank of India and Al-Arafah banks have also raised the interest rates on deposits in January, officials said. The banks have raised the rates of interest for term-deposits, such as three-month, six-month and one-year schemes. The weighted average spread between lending and deposit rates in the country's banking sector stood at 6.16 percent as of Sept 30, 2007 against 5.93 percent of June 30 a year ago, according to the central bank data. The weighted average rates on lending stood at 12.92 percent while the interest rates on deposits were paid at 6.76 percent by the banks in September last year, the data showed. The finance adviser and the governor of the Bangladesh Bank Monday criticised commercial banks for not adequately reducing the gap between deposit and lending rates. "Banks should reduce their spread to encourage commercial borrowers," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told state-owned Sonali Bank's annual general meeting Monday. Central banker Salehuddin Ahmed said: "The spread must come down." bd
