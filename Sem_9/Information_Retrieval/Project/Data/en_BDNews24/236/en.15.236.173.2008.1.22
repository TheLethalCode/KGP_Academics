 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi workers abroad, who are responsible for sending vast amounts of remittance back to the country every year, are exploited undeservedly by agents and employers, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. Addressing the fourth ministerial consultation of the Colombo Processa regional consultative process on the management of overseas employment and contractual labour for countries of origin in Asiathe adviser urged the international community to set minimum wage standards for foreign workers. "They need legal protection," he told the Abu Dhabi Dialogue attended by ministers from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. "Bangladeshi workers abroad remit a huge sum of money homelast year it was $6 billion," a foreign ministry statement quoted Iftekhar as saying. "But they pay a great cost for it, often it in terms of underserved sufferings such as exploitation by agents and employers." "Language barriers and a lack of understanding of the host country's legal system often make it difficult for our workers to seek legal remedies against unfair labour practices," the foreign adviser said. "A system of minimum wages should be introduced," he suggested, adding that the countries of origin needed to do more to protect the interests of their overseas labour force. The foreign adviser will leave Abu Dhabi early Wednesday to join the entourage of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. bdn
