<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's benchmark Nikkei rebounded from two days of heavy losses with a 2 percent gain on Wednesday as a US rate cut eased economic worries, but nerves about where Wall Street might go next held back the optimism. A higher yen also limited gains, which had taken the benchmark Nikkei share average up nearly 4 percent at one point. Banks such as Mizuho Financial Group were among those to finish off their highs. Market players said the Nikkei, which has lost 16 percent this year, was more than due for a rebound and the US Fed's biggest rate cut in two decades was a suitable spur. "The market knew that something had to be done, so there wasn't that much actual surprise in the Fed move, and it certainly hasn't quenched all the fears about a possible US recession," said Takeshi Osawa, senior fund manager at Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management. "People are waiting to see what will happen today in New York, and this is keeping them from really actively buying." The Nikkei gained 256.01 points to 12,829.06, after a brief spike above 13,000 early in the day. On Tuesday it tumbled to its greatest one-day loss since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The broader TOPIX rose 2.5 percent to 1,249.93 as advancing shares outnumbered declining ones by more than six to one. US stocks fell on Tuesday, the first trading day after a long weekend, but the decline was shallower than feared after the Fed slashed interest rates by 75 basis points. "There's no question that it's had an impact today, but is it really enough for the longer term?" said Takahiko Murai, a general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities. "Financial policy moves alone may not be enough. There may need to be things like injections of public funds into financial institutions." The Nikkei was also whipped around by movements in other Asian markets. It pared gains sharply in the afternoon after Shanghai shares dipped briefly into negative territory but was buoyed by a rebound in Indian shares By 0705 GMT the MSCI index of Asian stocks excluding Japan was up 3.6 percent. EXPORTERS ENERGISED, BANKS BOOSTED Hidenao Miyajima, chief strategist of Japan equity research at Lehman Brothers, said the Nikkei average was trading at about 13 times 2008 earnings, the lowest level since 1979 when the world economy experienced a slowdown fueled by high oil prices. "This signifies a bear bottom. There is a chance for the market to go up," he said, but warned that investors remain skittish about further subprime losses and write-downs. Shares of Toyota Motor Corp and other blue-chip exporters rose on hopes the rate cut would shore up the US economy, a key market for Japanese goods, aided by a halt in the yen's advance against the dollar. The dollar stood around 106.30 yen by midafternoon after rising above 107 yen earlier in the day snuffing out some of the exporter gains. Toyota rose 4.5 percent to 5,100 yen, while Honda Motor Corp gained 3.3 percent to 3,010 yen. Canon Inc rose 2.8 percent to 4,340 yen and Toshiba Corp jumped 5.2 percent to 732 yen. Bank shares, including industry leader Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group also rose after the Fed's move boosted U.S. banks, but ended off their highs. Mitsubishi UFJ jumped 3.9 percent to 897 yen, while No. 2 Mizuho Financial Group climbed 2.6 percent to 437,000 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Japan's third-biggest bank, was up 5.3 percent at 737,000 yen. Trade was active, with 2.52 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, compared with last week's daily average of 2.76 bi
