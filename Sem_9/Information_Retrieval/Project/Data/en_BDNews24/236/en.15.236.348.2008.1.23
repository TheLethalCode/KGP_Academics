<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The garment manufacturers and exporters apex trade body Wednesday requested the finance adviser to provide government rationing for essentials to assist their workers. The move is meant to insulate garment workers from ongoing price hikes, which industry leaders say has led to the recent unrest in the sector. "The rise in the price of essentials and house rent is the main reason for unrest in the industry," said Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, Chowdhury said: "We have requested the finance adviser to provide nationwide subsidies if possible, or rationing for RMG workers only." The BGMEA president also told the adviser that a system similar to vulnerable group feeding could also be given to RMG workers. "The finance adviser has assured us he will do something immediately, he told me they are looking for ways to support the workers," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. The BGMEA president raised two further issues with the adviser: a reduction in bank interest rates and charges, and a waiver for the interest on some 200 failing RMG factory loans. The RMG sector is the country's prime foreign currency earner, with a staggering 76 percent of the country's total exports, amounting to $12.1 billion in the last fiscal year. This year the sector is facing setbacks due to a fall in the price of critical products in importing nations, and the withdrawal of European restrictions on Chinese imports. "Our survival is at risk if unrest among the workers continues," said Chowdhury. "The possibility of duty-free access to the US market through a new trade bill may also be jeopardised by the workers demands," he said. Chowdhury claimed that 99 percent of the RMG factory owners now give their workers the minimum wage. bd
