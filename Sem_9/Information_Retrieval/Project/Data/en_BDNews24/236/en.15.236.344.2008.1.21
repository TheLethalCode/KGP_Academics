 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The bidding firm will have to pay the corporate tax for exploration and extraction of oil and gas, a report on the reviewed draft Production sharing contract (PSC) recommends. Earlier, state-run oil and gas agency Petrobanga would pay the tax for the bidder. The committee that reviewed the conditions in the draft production sharing contract (PSC) on exploration of oil and gas submitted a report to the energy division Monday. Head of the committee energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com the report would be sent to the Cabinet Division by Tuesday. It would be presented before the council of advisers soon, he added. The committee held four meetings and evaluated the proposed PSC. The committee finalised its report in its latest meeting Monday. A member of the committee on condition of anonymity said no fundamental change has been made to the draft PSC. The most notable recommendation is one that proposes to make it mandatory for the bidder to pay the corporate tax. The advisory council committee on finance on Jan 7 formed the committee with a mandate it to further review the draft PSC conditions on oil gas exploration in the deep Bay of Bengal. Representatives of the ministries of finance, law and foreign affairs, the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the planning ministry, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and Bangladesh Navy were included in the committee as members. A Petrobangla official on condition of anonymity told bdnews24.com the PSC contained some conditions to stop any international oil firm selling off their shares at will. The new conditions stipulate the company inform Petrobangla before making such move and take its approval. In case it gets the go-ahead, it would have to pay the revenue earned to Petrobangla. Earlier, some companies sold their shares to other companies at a higher price and Petrobangla did not benefit from such transfers. "The model PSC has mentioned that no work can be done without the approval of Petrobangla. The company's budget will have to be approved by Petrobangla. Otherwise the expenditure would not be calculated in the cost recovery," the Petrobangla official said. "If anything is done on an emergency basis Petrobangla has to be notified about it in 72 hours. A detailed report will have to be submitted in 30 days. A separate article has been included providing for using local manpower." The report has also proposed keeping a fund ready for removal of abandoned installation. The fund has to be raised from the earnings of the firm. If the firm removes the abandoned installation at its own initiative the money would be returned. The first round of international bidding for exploration of oil and gas in the 23 blocks in the country was held in 1993-94. The second round of bidding was held in 1997-98. Though initiative for third round bidding was taken in 2005, it did not take place. bdnews
