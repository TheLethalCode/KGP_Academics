 RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A group of retired Pakistani military officers called on Tuesday for former army chief Pervez Musharraf to step down as president, saying he had become too divisive to lead the nuclear-armed country. The ex-servicemen's call adds to pressure on Musharraf, whose popularity has slumped ahead of a general election next month that his political allies are expected to fare poorly in, analysts say, unless there is heavy rigging. "He has become most controversial and his continuing as head of state is promoting all divisive centrifugal forces. He should resign," retired Lieutenant-General Faiz Ali Chisti told the meeting of dozens of grizzled veterans in a hotel in Rawalpindi. The group, which included former air marshals, admirals, generals and security agency chiefs, said an impartial government should be set up to consult political leaders and hold elections under an independent election commission. Parliamentary elections, postponed from Jan. 8 after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in late December, are due on Feb. 18. Pakistan's Western allies hope the vote will restore stability after months of unrest over Musharraf's manoeuvres to hold on to power amid a surge in militant violence. Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup, secured five more years as president in November after declaring emergency rule and ousting judges who might have annulled his re-election by the outgoing parliament. Musharraf stepped down as army chief in November and lifted emergency rule in mid-December. Bhutto's murder, which the government and the United States said was the work of an al Qaeda-linked militant, inflamed anger against Musharraf, whose support for the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism is opposed by many Pakistanis. Analysts say the army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half the 60 years since its creation, has also lost popularity and the ex-servicemen applauded a call by new army chief General Ashfaq Kayani for the military to stay out of politics. "FIGHTING MY WAR" Some of the old soldiers also called for a halt to army operations against militants on the Afghan border. "We don't agree with that," Chisti said of Musharraf's alliance with the United States. "The main thing is who is he to have that alliance? .... On whose behalf? Who does he represent? "The United States does something which is good for the United States ... the leader of Pakistan should do something which is good for Pakistan." But not everyone agreed that Musharraf should go. Retired servicemen Sayed Shah Bokhari said security was so bad he could not go freely to his mosque and Musharraf was doing the right thing in confronting the militants with U.S. help. "He's fighting my war, he's not fighting America's war," Bokhari said. "Musharraf is the only one who can help us get through this crisis. There's no alternative and we're grateful to the USA." The ex-servicemen, some with grey beards and wearing traditional woollen hats, others clean-shaven and in business suits, said if their call for Musharraf to go was not heeded they would join an opposition campaign against h
