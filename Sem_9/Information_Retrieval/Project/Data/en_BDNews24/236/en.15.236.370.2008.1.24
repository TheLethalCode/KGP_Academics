<TITLE> Asian stocks cheer plan to rescue US bond insurers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most major Asian share markets rose on Thursday, lifted by banks and financials after the US government outlined a plan to rescue battered bond insurers and stave off a fresh round of billion-dollar writedowns. Government bonds retreated from this week's multi-year peaks as investors piled back into stocks, hoping the rescue package could give the banking sector some much needed confidence. The yen pulled back from a 2- year peak against the dollar as appetite for higher yielding assets and currencies returned. Growing expectations that another swinging interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week -- coming on top of this week's emergency 75 basis-point slash -- to stabilize the world's top economy also lent support to markets. The mood remained wary, however, as investors still chewed over the prospect of a US recession. MSCI's All Country World index rose 0.4 percent by 0220 GMT, although the index is still down around 12 percent this month alone. "What the market really needs is steady, long-term measures that will promote overall investment, not just emergency measures," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities. New York's insurance regulator pressed major banks on Wednesday to put up billions of dollars to support ailing bond insurers, but banks are reluctant to open their chequebooks, people briefed on the matter said. The news pushed the Dow industrial average and S&P up more than 2 percent by the close. That marked a sharp turnaround from earlier in the day, when the Dow and the S&P were each down more than 2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei was up 1.4 percent by the midsession, lifted by banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group as fears over further credit-related write downs receded. The index, which suffered its biggest one-day loss since the September 11 attacks on the United States on Tuesday, is still down 15 percent this year and down a quarter in value since its October peak. BANKS RELIEVED Banks like Macquarie Group Ltd. also pushed Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index up more than 2 percent. Seoul's KOSPI was up 1.3 percent and Singapore's Straits Times was 2.6 percent higher but Hong Kong was flat and Shanghai's composite index fell about 1 percent. In currency markets, the yen pulled back from a 2- year high against the dollar as the share rally bolstered demand for higher yielding currencies. Traders said they were still lingering worries about overseas financial institutions' losses from the credit market turmoil stemming from defaults on US subprime mortgages. "The key is whether we will really see anything concrete that eases worries about US banks," a Japanese bank trader said. The dollar was at 106.37 yen. Japanese government bond futures fell, with March 10-year futures slipping 0.33 of a point to 138.38, further off from a 28-month high of 139.15 reached on Tuesday. "The market reaction against a jump in stocks looks as volatile as it was in the Treasuries market overnight, but the optimism that helped stocks is not likely to last long," said Akihiko Yokoyama, chief JGB strategist at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo. "So I don't think the market is facing a real turnaround in the trend of falling yields." Oil prices rebounded after a late surge in US stock indices helped cool simmering fears of a recession in top energy consumer the United States. US crude rose 66 cents to $87.65 a barrel. Gold recovered some recent losses, with spot gold prices at around $889 an ounce. bd
