 MOSCOW, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian prosecutors accused opposition candidate Mikhail Kasyanov on Tuesday of forging signatures for his presidential bid, a step that could lead to his disqualification from the election. An aide to Kasyanov, whom opinion polls credit with only about one percent support, said prosecutors were applying "political pressure" in the build-up to an election likely to be dominated by President Vladimir Putin's choice, Dmitry Medvedev. A former prime minister turned outspoken critic of Putin, Kasyanov had predicted the authorities would try to sabotage his election bid. European democracy watchdogs have urged Russia to ensure the presidential vote, set for March 2, is fair after Western observers accused the Kremlin of meddling in a parliamentary election last year. First Deputy Prime Minister Medvedev's election chances are buoyed by the backing of the popular Putin. Putin is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term but is expected to remain a powerful influence. Prosecutors said they had opened a criminal investigation over the 2 million signatures Kasyanov submitted in order to register as a candidate. Tatyana Chernyshova, a spokeswoman for the Prosecutor- General's office, said prosecutors in two regions had uncovered evidence campaign workers forged thousands of signatures. "A criminal investigation has been opened ... into the falsification of election documents," she told reporters. The investigation focused on the Volga River region of Mariy El, and the Yaroslav region in central Russia. If Kasyanov is taken off the ballot, the field challenging Medvedev will be reduced to three: nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and Andrei Bogdanov, head of the small Democratic Party. INSIDER KNOWLEDGE "This story with Mariy El has been going on for about a week. We believe it is political pressure," Kasyanov aide Yelena Dikun told Reuters. She said she had no information about the other investigation. Kasyanov served as Putin's prime minister until he was sacked in 2004. Analysts say he has no hope of rivalling Medvedev for the presidency. But they say some in the Kremlin resent him for joining the opposition, and fear he could use his insider knowledge to try to discredit them. One said the rules on signatures were being selectively applied to Kasyanov because the Kremlin fears he could use his television airtime as a candidate to reveal awkward details about Putin's team. "They decided not to give him a television platform and the only way to do that is take him off the ballot," independent analyst Dmitry Oreshkin told Reuters. The Central Election Commission will take the final decision on whether to disqualify Kasyanov. It said on Tuesday it had found a significant number of forgeries but was still checking the signatures.
