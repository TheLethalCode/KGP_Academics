 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The much-awaited inter-club transfer of the cricketers for the Premier and First Division Cricket Leagues begins on February 3 for three days at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis (CCDM) made the decision Monday. The committee also decided to hold a Premier Twenty20 Cricket League on or before Feb 13 before the Premier Division Cricket League starts on or before March 1. Each of 12 premier clubs can sign up maximum three players from a 21-player pool list. The meeting also decided to allow the clubs to sign up maximum three foreign players but only one foreign player would be eligible to play in a match in the Premier League. No foreign recruit will, however, be allowed to play in the Twenty20 League. CCDM chairman and cricket operation chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu said they would select a Twenty20 squad for the Indo-Bangla Bangladesh Games, scheduled for last week of Feb, after observing the opponents. Replying to a query, Lipu said the national cricketers are likely to play the league after March 22 and will get at least seven matches to play after the departure of South Africa. South Africa are scheduled to arrive here on February 14 to play three ODIs series and two Tests series before leaving here on March 15. Thereafter, Ireland will visit Bangladesh to play three ODIs and two four-dayers. "The clubs' representatives requested us to keep the national players out of the four-dayer squad so that they can play the national players in their side. We have agreed with them," said Lipu. Lipu said he thought the ODI series against Ireland would end by March 22. The meeting decided to start the First Division Cricket League on or before Feb 15. Pool players are Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Habibul Bashar, Aftab Ahmed, Shahadat Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Khaled Mashud, Javed Omar, Mohammed Rafique, Tushar Imran, Farhad Reza, Enamul Haque Junior, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Rajin Saleh, Mahmudullah Riad, Mohammad Sharif.
