 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  An effective policy must be implemented to survive in today's global market and protect national trade, speakers at a seminar said Wednesday. "Sixty-one developed nations of the world have already implemented effective regulations to protect local industries," Toufiq Ali, Bangladesh's former permanent representative to the WTO in Geneva. "We have to improve the quality of products and implement an effective policy if we want to survive in the global market," he said. "Bangladesh, along with other least developed nations, has yet to set up any regulations regarding the matter," the former envoy said, addressing the "Competitive Regulations and WTO" seminar organised by FBCCI. He suggested that the regulations need not be set up in haste but by consulting the relevant experts. If necessary experts from abroad should be brought in to examine the situation and develop regulations accordingly, he added. Toufiq Ali said that such regulations will make it possible to compete against foreign goods in the domestic market as well as boost the rate of export. Syed Manzur Elahiadministrator of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industrychaired the seminar, where director general of the commerce ministry's WTO cell AKM Fazlur Rahman presented the topic of discussion. Rahman said a country of 150 million people with limited land could not be sustained or develop on agriculture alone. "We need to concentrate on trade in order to aid development," he said. "Regulations concerning trade must be implemented for us to compete in the global market," he also added. bdnews24
