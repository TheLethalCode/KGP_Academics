<TITLE> RMG sector to benefit from rising China costs: market watchers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)The readymade garments industry in Bangladesh is likely to benefit from increased labour costs in China and recent government moves that appreciated the yuan against the dollar. This was the industry outlook from former foreign secretary Farooq Sobhan at a discussion on the South Asian trade body SAFTA at the BRAC centre Wednesday. Many observers fear the domestic readymade garments sector would be severely weakened from Jan 1, as the European Union withdrew certain restrictions on cheap Chinese apparel imports. "Bangladesh will lose less than previously thought, as the costs of Chinese readymade garments have risen due to an increase in labour wages and appreciation of the Chinese currency," Sobhan said. About 53 percent of Bangladeshi garments exports goes to the EU, which has left the sector's businessmen increasingly nervous over the recent easing of EU imports of Chinese garments. "A 30 percent increase in RMG workers' wages would take us out of the international market," former BGMEA president Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com. Annisul said if Bangladesh could achieve 20 percent sustainable growth in the RMG sector, problems such as labour issues would be solved. "Over the last ten years, the production growth staggered between 4 percent and 5 percent a year," he added. bdn
