<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The finance adviser and the governor of the Bangladesh Bank Monday criticised commercial banks for not adequately reducing the gap between deposit and lending rates. "Banks should reduce their spread to encourage commercial borrowers," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told state-owned Sonali Bank's annual general meeting at the Sonargaon Hotel. BB Governor Salehuddin Ahmed said: "The spread has to come down." The interest rate spread is the gap between the interest rate a bank pays on deposits and the higher rate it charges for loans. Salehuddin highlighted the fact that lending rates are not coming down in line with deposit rates. The central bank has been asking commercial banks to reduce unacceptably high differences between deposit and lending rates for a number of years. BB officials said they met with 27 commercial banks to resolve the issue in September, but no progress had been made. According to the central bank, the average gap between the two rates in Bangladesh stands at 6 percent. In India, the average spread is around 3 percent, while in developed countries the average has come down to around one percent. Aminur Rahman, managing director of Sonali Bank, chaired the meeting. The finance adviser and the BB governor both emphasised the need for improving state-owned banks' services. "Customers transfer to private banks if they do not get the services they need," Azizul told the bankers. The finance adviser also criticised Sonali Bank officials for not reducing its classified loans, as well as a failure to boost their business in remittances from Bangladeshi expatriates in 2007. Sonali Bank's operational profit was Tk 601.8 crore in 2007. bdn
