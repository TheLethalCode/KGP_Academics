<TITLE> China tycoon loses appeal against 16 years jail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Shanghai court on Monday upheld a 16-year jail sentence handed down to a corrupt property tycoon once named one of China's richest men, Xinhua news agency said. Zhou Zhengyi, who only completed a three-year jail term in 2006 for stock market fraud and falsifying documents, was found guilty in November of five charges including misappropriation of funds, bribery and forging VAT receipts. The court at the time described the sentence as lenient and said it took into account the fact Zhou, 46, had confessed to some of his crimes and returned much of the embezzled funds. Shanghai Higher People's Court on Monday rejected Zhou's appeal against the sentence. Zhou, a former snack shop owner who rose to become one of China's richest men with a net worth estimated at $320 million, was detained in a crackdown that followed the ousting of Shanghai's former Communist Party boss, Chen Liangyu. Chen himself faces a criminal investigation for his part in a 3.7 billion yuan ($500 million) social security fund scandal. Dozens of other officials and executives have been jailed or investigated in connection with the case.
