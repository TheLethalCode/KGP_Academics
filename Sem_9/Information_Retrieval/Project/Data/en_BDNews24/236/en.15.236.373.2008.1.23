<TITLE> Romney hones economic message in White House race </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Naples, Florida, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A slide on Wall Street gave Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney a chance to play his strongest card on Tuesday and burnish his CEO image in a state that could make or break his bid for the White House. At rallies in Florida, the next battleground in the Republican presidential race, the wealthy former venture capitalist and Massachusetts governor peppered his usual campaign speech with references to falling stock prices and fears of a recession. "There are several challenges we face right now right here at home. A stock market that is kind of turbulent today. People wondering if they are going to get the value out of their homes. Some people wondering if their home will be foreclosed. "It probably would be helpful to have a president who understands what it's like in the private sector because he's actually had a job in the private sector," he said to cheers at an impromptu rally outside the Naples Chamber of Commerce. The event was hastily organized to accommodate a crowd of several hundred who overflowed from inside the Chamber's building, where he was scheduled to speak later. After finishing second in New Hampshire and Iowa, and winning Michigan along with scarcely contested Nevada and Wyoming, Romney has put the economy and his business resume at the heart of his campaign in a tight four-way race in Florida. The state's primary on Jan. 29 is the next test in the state-by-state battles to decide Republican and Democratic candidates who will contest November's presidential election. Two of Romney's top Republican rivals, Sen. John McCain, 71, and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, 63, have put national security at the forefront of their campaigns. DEBT-RIDDEN OLYMPICS While Romney has pledged to be tough on security, vowing to increase military spending by $40 billion and add 100,000 US soldiers, he appears to be betting that anxiety over the economy will trump the Iraq war and other security issues in Florida. He has retooled his campaign to emphasize his nearly 25 years of business experience that includes founding Bain Capital LLC, a successful Boston-based private-equity firm, in 1984. Romney's resume includes a number of prominent successes such as rescuing the debt-ridden Salt Lake City Olympics and helping to set up office supply retail-store chain Staples Inc., which employs about 70,000 people. Some critics, however, question the economic effectiveness of his 2003-2007 term as Massachusetts governor and opponents attacking his credibility point to his shifting positions on issues ranging from abortion to gay rights to gun control. Speaking in an auditorium packed with silver-haired pensioners from Naples, one of Florida's wealthier cities, Romney declared: "I know a few of you have stock that you are living on, so you care about those things a lot." A sign reading "economic turnaround" that is new for his campaign hung overhead as he warned that the United States faced unprecedented economic competition -- a campaign theme that helped him win Michigan last week. But he sharpened the message. "Now we have the Asians coming," he said, describing China's economy as "free enterprise on steroids." Earlier in the day, he said US markets were "distressed" and raised the possibility of a solvency crisis at US banks. "We have to make sure these institutions have sufficient capital," he told Reuters after speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition of Florida where he warned that the US credit crunch could develop into a new crisis. "We were talking about the credit crisis and how bad the credit crisis was and how to make sure the credit crunch is not spread, and someone sent a message back that said the credit crisis is so 2007 -- 2008 is a solvency crisis," he said
