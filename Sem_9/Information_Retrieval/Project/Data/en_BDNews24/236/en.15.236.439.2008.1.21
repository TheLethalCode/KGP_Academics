 MELBOURNE, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Justine Henin meets Maria Sharapova in a blockbuster Australian Open quarter-final on Tuesday, with the world number one admitting she will have to be at her best to beat the Russian. Top seed Henin has won six of their eight meetings but Sharapova pushed her all the way in their last encounter, in Madrid at the end of last year. "(The Madrid match) was a big fight. It was one of the best matches of my career, I think one of the best matches of last year," the Belgian said. "She's back in her best level. I always know to beat her I have to be at my best. She's a real fighter. She never gives up. Very talented. She's a champion. Against her I will have to be a hundred percent all the time." Sharapova, seeded fifth, has breezed through to the last 16, losing just four games per match on average. The Russian said she would fight until the end as she looks to add to her two grand slam titles, won at Wimbledon in 2004 and at the U.S. Open in 2006. "Against someone that's number one in the world, someone who has a lot of confidence, you've got to take your chances and take the opportunities because you won't get many," Sharapova said. Champion Serena Williams will bid to take another step closer to a ninth grand slam crown when she plays third seed Jelena Jankovic in the day's other women's quarter-final. On the men's side, second seed Rafael Nadal faces Finnish 24th seed Jarkko Nieminen in the quarter-finals, and unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga takes on 14th seed Mikhail Youzhny of Russia
