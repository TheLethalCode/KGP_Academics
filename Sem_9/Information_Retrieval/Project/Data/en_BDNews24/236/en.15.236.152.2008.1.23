<TEXT>
 Singapore, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Wednesday with Hong Kong jumping 7 percent after the Federal Reserve's biggest interest rate cut in over two decades tempted investors to beaten-down equities, but recession fears lingered. The dollar extended its losses against the euro in early Asian trade after the Fed's emergency 75 basis-point interest rate cut wiped out the US currency's yield advantage over the euro. Industrial metals, such as copper recovered some lost ground after hefty falls this week on fears a US recession could derail demand, while safe-haven government bonds extended gains to fresh multi-year highs. Stocks around the globe have fallen sharply since the start of the year, triggered by concerns global economic growth was hitting a wall and financial institutions had more subprime-related writedowns to reveal. In an effort to shore up markets, the US central bank slashed rates to 3.5 percent on Tuesday. Some said the Fed's decision -- a week before a scheduled rate meeting -- smelled of panic even though it halted the global market meltdown. "A lot of people see that the Fed's move yesterday was too little," said Hideaki Inoue, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking in Tokyo. "But given that they cut just a week before this month's meeting, it does show that the Fed realises things are bad." But for now, investors were in the mood to seek out bargains, encouraged by the recovery on Wall Street, where benchmarks managed to recover from their lows after a feverish trading session on Tuesday. Australia staged a dramatic comeback, where shares initially raced up 7 percent -- on course for their biggest daily gain in a decade. By 0218 GMT the S&P/ASX 200 index, which had fallen 12 sessions in a row, was up 5.3 percent. Miner BHP Billiton Ltd led the way, soaring 9.7 percent after a strong second-quarter production report. Rival Rio Tinto AX. added 6.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped more than 7 percent at the open, helped by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority cutting its base rate by 75 basis points in line with the Fed move. In Tokyo, the Nikkei rebounded 3.4 percent by the midsession, recovering some of its biggest one-day loss since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States on Tuesday. The index is still down 15 percent just this month alone. Seoul's KOSPI regained its poise following the 2-day sell-off, adding 2 percent to claw back some of the index's 7 percent drop this week. "It's still early in assessing the impact of the (Fed) move, butsurely it was the best possible remedy to soothe panic selling inmarkets," said Lee Kyung-soo, an analyst at Daewoo Securities. "Sometimes, panic selling helps investors see a bottom, and I think we had that yesterday." BEAR BREATHES DOWN NECK Wall Street's benchmark indexes still hover close to bear market territory as the prospect of a US recession looms. The blue-chip Dow average ended down about 1 percent -- way above earlier lows but still 15.5 percent from its October closing high above 14,000. The Nasdaq closed down 19.8 percent from its October 2007 closing high. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned a significant slowdown in 2008 world economic growth appears inevitable, and the restoration of financial markets is expected to be a complex and long-drawn-out task. An IMF spokesman, Masood Ahmed, said the Fed cut was "appropriate and helpful. "The volatile weakening experienced in many equity markets during the past few days has underscored the burden that the current financial market turmoil represents for the global growth outlook," he said in a statement. In currency markets, the euro climbed as much as 0.4 percent to the day's high of $1.4685 and by 0226 GMT was trading at $1.4632. It had risen 1.3 percent on Tuesday, its biggest one-day percentage gain since early 2006. Japanese government bonds gained, pushing the two-year yield below to the Bank of Japan's overnight rate target on mounting expectations for a rate cut later in the year. The two-year yield fell 3.5 basis points to 0.490 percent in morning trade. Oil steadied above $89, with US crude up 9 cents to $89.30 a barrel. "The Fed cuts ... will certainly shore economic sentiment that has been driving prices lower recently, and shift attention back to underlying tight fundamentals," BNP Paribas senior oil analyst Harry Tchilinguirian said in a research note. Gold also recovered, with spot gold prices at around $887 an ounce
