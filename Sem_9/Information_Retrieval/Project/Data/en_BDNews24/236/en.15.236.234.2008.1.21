<TITLE> IMF head urges French voters to punish government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, made an unusual foray back into French politics on Sunday by urging people to vote against President Nicolas Sarkozy's party in local elections. "I'm just one party activist among many," he said after arriving unexpectedly at a Socialist party gathering in Paris. The former Socialist finance minister was appointed head of the Washington-based IMF in September after lobbying from European leaders including conservative rival Sarkozy. Strauss-Kahn said French local elections in March should be used to punish the government, which the Socialist opposition accuses of neglecting promises to boost purchasing power. "There are good reasons for the government to be punished by the French people," Strauss-Kahn said. Strauss-Kahn declined to sit with party elders and placed himself in the middle of the audience with ordinary delegates. His intervention in partisan domestic politics was unusual for the serving head of an international organisation. IMF statutes say the managing director owes allegiance entirely to the fund, but do not specifically say whether this means domestic political activity is frowned on. "The Managing Director and the staff of the Fund, in the discharge of their functions, shall owe their duty entirely to the Fund and to no other authority," says a clause in the IMF's articles of agreement, according to the fund's website. Strauss-Kahn is due to meet Sarkozy on Monday to discuss growing concerns over the global economy.
