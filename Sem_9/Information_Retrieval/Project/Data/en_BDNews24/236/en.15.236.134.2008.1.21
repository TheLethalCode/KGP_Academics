 Manila, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine security forces have apprehended an Islamic militant suspected to have taken part in the beheading of 10 Marines on a southern island last year, the head of the national police said on Monday. Avelino Razon said a team of soldiers and police officers arrested Aramil Sulayman at a Muslim village in Shariff Kabunsuan province, on the southern island of Mindanao, on Saturday. "Our boys never gave him the chance to resist and flee," Razon told a news conference at the main police headquarters in Manila, where Sulayman was brought before the media. Sulayman, wearing an orange prison uniform and in handcuffs, smiled but was prevented from replying when asked whether he was involved in the beheading of soldiers on Basilan island on July 10 last year. Razon said Sulayman, who belongs to the Abu Sayyaf group, was among 128 rebels facing murder charges for the beheadings. He is the first to be arrested, although there were reports some were killed by the military in fighting on Basilan island last year. The smallest of several Muslim rebel groups active in the south of the largely Roman Catholic country, the Abu Sayyaf is blamed for the Philippines' worst militant attack, the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that killed 100 people. But some of those named in the killing of the Marines have links to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest rebel group in the country. The group is finalising a peace deal with the government.
