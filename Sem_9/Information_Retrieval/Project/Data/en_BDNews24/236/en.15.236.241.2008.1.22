<TITLE> Russia poll support climbs for Putin election heir </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's anointed successor Dmitry Medvedev has increased his overwhelming lead in opinion polls ahead of a March 2 election, the latest data published by pollsters VTsIOM showed on Tuesday. Dmitry Medvedev, endorsed by Putin and four separate parties in the March 2 presidential election, now enjoys the support of just over 60 percent of Russian voters, up 8 percent in a week amongst those who intend to vote. Medvedev, who is currently Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister and a long-term confidant of Putin, formally launched his campaign on Monday after his candidacy was registered with Russia's Central Electoral Commission. None of Medvedev's opponents achieved double digit support in the poll of 1,600 people, carried out between Jan. 12 - 13 in 153 locations, which VTsIOM estimated has a 3.4 percent margin of error. In second place, the nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky had 7.5 percent support and the Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov came in third with 6.1 percent. Opposition candidate, Mikhail Kasyanov, who faces an investigation for allegedly forging some of the 2 million signatures he needed to stand in the presidential poll, was supported by less than 1 percent of voters, the poll found. A total of 82 percent of those queried said they were likely to participate in the election. Medvedev's rating has steadily increased since he emerged as Putin's heir, rising from 44.6 percent in mid-December to the current 60.4 percent.
