<TITLE> Bruni says not married to France's Sarkozy ...yet </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Italian singer and former supermodel Carla Bruni said in an interview published on Tuesday she was `not yet' married to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, putting an end to speculation they had tied the knot in secret. Bruni, 40, told left-wing daily Liberation that she and Sarkozy were planning on getting married, but she did not give any further details. The couple's whirlwind romance has sparked intense media interest, and has been blamed in part on a slump in popularity for Sarkozy, with voters unhappy about his ostentatious private life at a time when the economy is struggling. Sarkozy, 52, hinted at a news conference earlier this month that he would marry Bruni and added that the media would probably find out about it after the event. Regional daily L'Est Republicain said last week that they had wed in private. However, Liberation quoted Bruni as saying that she was "not yet married" but she added: "Even if we are planning to." French media have reported that Indian diplomats have been concerned that Bruni might accompany the divorced Sarkozy on his official visit to New Delhi later this week, in what would be a challenge to traditional protocol. But Bruni said she was not planning on making the trip. "I cannot take part in an official visit with the president," she said, adding that she was also due to start recording her next album in February. The newspaper reported, however, that Sarkozy had pushed hard for Bruni to accompany him, delaying planning to the point that the official list of delegates had still not been drawn up by Monday nig
