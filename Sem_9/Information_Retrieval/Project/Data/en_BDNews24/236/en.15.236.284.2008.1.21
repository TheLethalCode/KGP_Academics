 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club will host the first Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Cup Football Tournament, which is scheduled to begin on Jan 26 at Bangabandhu National Stadium. "We have already completed all our preparations and are ready to host the tournament," said tournament committee chairman Zakaria Pintu at a press conference at the Mohammedan SC premises Monday. Dr Akbar Ali, former adviser to the caretaker government and Regulatory Reform Commission chairman will open the eight-team meet. "Members of the Swadhin Bangla Football Team have been dreaming of holding a victory day football tournament since independence," said Pintu, who was also Swadhin Bangla Football team's captain. "This dream is going to come true now Mohammedan SC have come forward to host the event," said Pintu. B League champions Abahani Limited will take on Badda Jagaroni in the opening fixture. The three giants of Dhaka football, Mohammedan, Abahani, Muktijoddha Sangsad will participate in the event along with smaller clubs such as Arambagh KS, Victoria SC, Fakirerpool Youngmens, Dhaka Wanderers Club and Badda Jagaroni.

"We want to restore the pride of football through this tournament," added the tournament committee chairman.
