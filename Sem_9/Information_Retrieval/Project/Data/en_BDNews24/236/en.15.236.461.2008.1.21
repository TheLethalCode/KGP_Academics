 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) DU students "against oppression" demanded the withdrawal of the case and verdict against four absconding students sentenced Monday to two years' rigorous imprisonment.. Four Dhaka University teachers and 11 students were cleared of charges in one of the cases filed against them in connection with the August campus unrest and demonstrations at DU. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Md Habibur Rahman Siddiqui handed down the verdict in the case clearing the charges against them. The same verdict sentenced the four absconding students in the case  Saiful Islam Feroz, Hassan Mamun, HS Kamrul Hassan Kochi, Aziz Hassanto two years' rigorous imprisonment and a Tk 1,000 fine each. Hearing the news, a group of DU students, with faces covered in black cloths, took out a procession demanding freedom of the four. A Dhaka court was set to deliver a verdict Monday on the case after the government Thursday submitted a written appeal urging the court of magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui to fast-track the trial of the teachers and students. The appeal marked a major move by the government to wrap up the controversial cases against the teachers and students who were arrested with ties to the August rioting at Dhaka University. Installing extra security measures for the day, police had set up checkpoints at all entrances to the campus Monday morning. No heavy vehicles were allowed to enter, while students needed to show their ID cards to the police to enter the campus. Meanwhile, a separate Dhaka court also resumed a hearing Monday on the second case against the four Dhaka University teachers and 15 students. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani is presiding over the second case that charges the accused of making inflammatory comments and burning effigies on the DU campus during the August violence. Prof Md Akhteruzzaman, former secretary general of DUTA, said: "We are waiting for the final decision, only one decision is taken." "One more case is left. We want the release of all the teachers and students. When they are back among us we will withdraw all our protest programmes," he told reporters. "The moment we get back our students and teachers we will go back to our professional duties, otherwise the protest will go on". Dean of the social sciences faculty AAMS Arefin Siddique asked: "Who will take the responsibility of the teachers and students who have stayed in prison for the last 5 months?" The teachers that were accused in both cases are Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. Both cases involve breaching the emergency rules during the campus violence in August. Charges were framed in the two cases in two separate courts on Dec 11 and Dec 12. bdnews24
