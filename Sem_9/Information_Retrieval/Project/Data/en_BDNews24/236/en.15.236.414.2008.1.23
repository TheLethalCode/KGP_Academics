<TITLE> Coal woes push China to record power shortage </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China is facing its worst-ever power shortage, equivalent to around a tenth of generating capacity, as tight coal supplies and poor profit margins force plant closures, media and officials said on Wednesday. The government banned shipping of any coal not headed for power plants, as brownouts hit at least 13 provinces and the nationwide shortfall reached nearly 70 gigawatts, state media reported. Coal-fired power plants account for 78 percent of China's generating capacity, but provided around 83 percent of electricity output in 2007. Equivalent to nearly the entire generating capacity of Britain, the shortfall dwarfs the scale of China's worst previous crisis in the summer of 2004 when demand outpaced supply by around 40 GW. That year the problem was due largely to a lack of capacity and a rising amount of power-hungry air-conditioning. This time government price controls have exacerbated the impact of mine closures, and a spate of freezing weather has disrupted transportation. "Rising coal prices, limited transportation capacity and recent natural disasters including snow and sleet all contributed to coal shortages," said an official with the State Electricity Regulatory Commission who asked for anonymity because he is not an authorised spokesman. The official also declined to confirm the sensitive figure for the total power deficit. Beijing keeps a tight cap on electricity prices, and after inflation hit an 11-year high near the end of 2007, pledged to freeze power costs in the near term. But it has relaxed its grip on coal prices, which are rising fast because domestic and international demand is soaring, while Beijing is cutting into production by closing thousands of small and often hazardous coal pits as part of a safety drive. Thermal coal stocks were 40 percent below normal levels and only covered eight days of generation, the China Business News reported, quoting data from the State Grid. "The main reason behind the power shortages this time is rising coal prices," said Henry Li, analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi, adding that power capacity is basically balanced in the country. "I don't expect the government to raise power tariffs in the first half of this year, so the shortages will last till then." An intermittent blackout that started earlier this week in Wuhan, the Yangtze riverside capital of Hubei province, is the city's worst since 1997, according to a report on www.cpnn.com.cn, an industry Web site run by the SERC's newspaper, the China Electric Power News. Other affected areas ranged from the manufacturing hub of Guangdong to poor coal heartland of Shanxi. A drought has also hit hydropower output and worsened the impact of the coal squeeze in provinces including southwestern Yunnan and Guizhou, and central Hubei
