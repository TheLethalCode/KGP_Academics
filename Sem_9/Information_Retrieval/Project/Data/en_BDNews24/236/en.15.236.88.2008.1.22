 LONDON Tue Jan 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares from Sydney to London sank for a second day on Tuesday, dragging commodity prices with them and promising a woeful start for Wall Street as investors dumped assets exposed to the risk of a global economic slowdown. European stocks, while off early lows, were down more than 1 percent after Japan's benchmark Nikkei lost 5.7 percent -- the worst one-day loss since the session after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States -- while MSCI's measure for other Asian stocks tumbled more than 7 percent. "We're in the midst of very bearish sentiment. There's a lot of fear in this street and worldwide," said Tom Hougaard, chief market strategist at City Index Markets.

SAFE HAVEN RUSH But demand for safe-haven bonds soared, pushing the benchmark US 10-year yield to a 4-1/2 year low below 3.5 percent. The 10-year Bund yield slid to 3.8 percent, levels last seen in December 2006. The yen also benefited in this risk-averse environment, hitting a 2-1/2 year high against the dollar and five-month peaks versus the euro before reversing direction. "There is a panicky environment in the equity market ... This is leading to risk aversion increasing and the carry trade is now a thing of the past meaning there is continued strength in the yen," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, European economist at CIBC.
