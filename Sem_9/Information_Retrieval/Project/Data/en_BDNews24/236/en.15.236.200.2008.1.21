 ISLAMABAD, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Broadcasts of Pakistan's private Geo television network resumed in Pakistan on Monday more than two-and-half months after its transmission was blocked following the imposition of a state of emergency. Geo News and its sister sports channel came back on the air at 6 p.m. (1300 GMT), hours after President Pervez Musharraf began a four-country trip to Europe where he expected to face tough questions on media curbs and human rights. "We're cranking up the whole system again," the president of Geo News, Imran Aslam, told Reuters. Geo, Pakistan's most popular television station, was the last channel to come back on the air of several that were blocked when Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3, citing rising militancy and a meddling judiciary. Musharraf lifted the emergency in mid-December but Geo, which made a name for itself with hard-hitting political talk shows, remained blocked on cable channels. Its broadcasts out of Dubai were available on satellite and via the Internet, although authorities in the United Arab Emirates had blocked its satellite broadcasts for several weeks in November and December. Information Minister Nisar Memon said on Sunday the channel's broadcasts had been given the go-ahead after it signed a government code of conduct. But Aslam said the channel had not yet signed the code of conduct, which he described as "draconian", but he said Geo would have to abide by it. "There is a code of conduct and that's what we'll have to adhere to because it's part of the law," he said. Aslam also said he was not aware of any agreement by the channel to keep any of its controversial anchor people off the air. "HUGE LOSS" The media company that owns Geo had been losing $500,000 a day, Aslam said earlier. But on Monday, he said the issue of compensation demands would be left to later. "It's been a huge loss but at the moment we're just happy to be back on the air," he said. The network's two entertainment channels were restored on the cable in Pakistan in the third week of December, but its news and sports channels remained shut until they were restored on Monday. Spurred by new technology and unrestrained by censors, Pakistan's media, in particular television, has flourished over recent years with dozens of new channels springing up. Musharraf, who took power in a 1999 coup, had hailed the liberated media as one of his government's main achievements. But relations between Musharraf and the independent media began to sour in March when he tried to dismiss the country's chief justice, unleashing a storm of protest from lawyers and the pro-democracy opposition. Musharraf has accused some television channels of adding to the political uncertainty that led him to impose emergency rule. But critics said the state of emergency was aimed at neutralising legal challenges to Musharraf's moves to secure a new five-year term as president in an October election by legislators while he was still army chi
