<TITLE> British voting system open to fraud-Europe watchdog </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's voting system is open to fraud and makes it "childishly simple" to register bogus voters, Europe's main human rights body said on Tuesday. Britain introduced new laws in 2006 to combat postal vote fraud after a probe found local members of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party had conducted massive vote-rigging in a local election in Birmingham, Britain's second biggest city. A committee of the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) said that although the British system delivered democratic elections, urgent action was needed to address the remaining weaknesses. It said that the "2006 changes to the postal voting system had enhanced security, but shortcomings remained". "The crucial weakness of the household registration system is that it precludes the registration of personal identifiers," the report said. "This, in combination with the absence of any form of civil registry makes it childishly simple to register bogus voters on the voters' list." "Postal voting then provided the anonymity to carry out fraud without detection," the committee added. The judge heading the 2005 probe that prompted Britain to tighten its voting rules said the scandal over postal voting in Birmingham would "disgrace a banana republic". The European watchdog said Britain should use the electoral system that has been used in Northern Ireland since 2002 and "strongly recommended" that ID checks on all returned postal ballots be mandatory before the next elections. "They also recommended that party activists should no longer be allowed to handle postal ballots," the report said. The watchdog said at this stage there was no need for a full monitoring by the committee but if the flaws were not addressed it "should again be considered".
