<TITLE> EU executive adopts blueprint for climate fight </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's executive adopted landmark proposals on Wednesday that will make the 27-nation bloc a world leader in the fight against climate change, but tradeoffs will include higher energy bills. The European Commission approved detailed plans to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by one-fifth and set each EU state individual targets to produce one-fifth of all power from renewable sources like the wind and sun by 2020. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called the fiercely disputed package "the right policy framework for transformation to an environment-friendly European economy and to continue to lead the international action to protect our planet". Another goal was to ensure the bloc's energy security as remaining fossils fuels become concentrated among fewer nations. "We do not want to be dependent on regimes that are not our friends and want to protect ourselves from them," Barroso told the European Parliament in presenting the plan. The Commission aims to spur talks among industrialised countries for a global climate deal by 2009 to arrest global warming which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts. Environmentalists say the planned cuts are too small to achieve that goal or give a strong lead to the world and urged the EU to cut emissions unilaterally by 30 percent by 2020. Brussels softened its plans at the last minute to placate anxious industry leaders, who fear higher energy costs will tilt competitiveness further in favour of China and India, which have no emissions limits, at a time of record oil prices. The Commission agreed that energy-intensive industries, possibly including steel, aluminium and cement, would get all emissions permits for free. If there were no global deal to curb emissions, succeeding the Kyoto Protocol after 2012, the EU would consider forcing importers to buy permits. EU Enterprise Commissioner Guenter Verheugen, standard-bearer of the interests of heavy industry, told German television: "I am all for setting an example for the rest of the world. But I am against committing economic suicide." SPECIAL PROTECTION The proposals included a major overhaul from 2013 of the EU's flagship Emissions Trading System, to cover more greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide (CO2) and involve all big emitters. The Commission's plans will implement renewable energy and emissions-cutting targets agreed by EU leaders last March, and require approval by member states and the European Parliament. From 2013, power generators will have to buy all permits to emit carbon dioxide. They will pass the extra electricity costs on to consumers, and those costs will rise as the supply of permits is tightened. Until now utilities got most permits for free and derived huge windfall profits. There will be a slower phase-in of auctioning for airlines and oil refineries, EU officials said. Power bills for industry and households will also rise as a result of targets to supply more energy using clean energy technologies which are more costly than fossil fuels. The EU estimated that will add 10 to 15 percent to electricity prices. But Barroso dismissed concern at the cost, telling parliament: "The additional effort needed to realise the proposals would be less than 0.5 percent of GDP by 2020. That amounts to about 3 euros ($4.39) a week for everyone." Resistance is expected over targets for each country to cut greenhouse gases and install renewable energy. The EU executive talked up potential business benefits. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said the plan "gives Europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies." Business has sought to soften the emissions trading reform, with some energy-intensive industries warning that competition from less environmentally regulated nations such as China, India and the United States could force production out of Europe. "If we were to relocate our industries outside Europe we would then have to transport steel to Europe, adding emissions," said Philippe Varin, president of the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries, and chief executive of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, owned by India's Tata Steel. EU officials faced a barrage of last minute lobbying from environmentalists, governments and energy-intensive business. "We have major concerns that the auctioning is being very much diluted due to scaremongering by industry," said Stefan Singer of the WWF environmental campaign gro
