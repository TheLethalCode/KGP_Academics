 GAZA, Mon Jan 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gaza hospitals will run out of drugs and fuel for generators within a few days unless Israel eases the border blockade it imposed on the Hamas-controlled territory, international organizations said on Monday. The European Union, which funds fuel for Gaza's now-idle main power plant, said it understood Israel's need to defend its citizens against cross-border rocket attacks but called the restrictions "collective punishment". Residents of the impoverished territory awoke to nearly traffic-free streets and shuttered shops, with petrol in short supply since Israel closed the Gaza Strip's border crossings on Friday. Palestinian officials have warned Israel's standoff with Gaza militants, who have vowed to continue the rocket fire, could harm US-spurred peace efforts. "There is no fuel, meaning there is no work," said Abu Mahmoud, a fisherman. "We have seen bad times before, but never worse than these days." European Union and United Nations officials said the organizations were pressing Israel to allow in fuel and medicine immediately to the Gaza Strip, where 1.5 million people live. "We hope and expect nothing less than a positive decision today to allow fuel shipments and medicines into Gaza. We want this to happen today," said Richard Miron, spokesman for U.N. Middle East envoy Robert Serry. Michele Mercier, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said Gaza hospitals "still have stocks, but it won't last for more than two or three days". "If no more stocks are available, you can imagine what it means for the treatment of wounded and ... everyday medical care would be affected," Mercier said. EU officials said the hospitals, many now using generators, were running out of fuel to keep the power on. Khaled Radi, spokesman of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said many of the facilities were performing only emergency surgery. Gaza's main power plant shut down on Sunday, plunging much of Gaza City into darkness. While it provides only 30 percent of the territory's electricity, its closure affected a far greater proportion of the population because of the way the power grid system works. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said Israel sought to "maintain a reasonable humanitarian level" in the Gaza Strip while "waging a war against terrorism". "The Palestinian people need to understand that there will be no routine living or normal economic situation as long as Israeli citizens are unable to function normally," she told reporters in Sderot, a southern town frequently hit by rockets. Despite its tough public line, Israel has not cut off its direct supply of electricity to the Gaza Strip. Egypt also provides power, to the southern part of the territory. Voicing his concern, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday to warn him of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA) said. The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip has also stopped UN aid shipments that include food and other humanitarian supplies. But UNRWA, which provides food to refugees, estimated it had two months' worth of supplies stored in Gaza. "There is not a humanitarian crisis. It's not correct. Certainly, Israel will do everything in order to prevent a humanitarian crisis," said Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli Defence Ministry official, accusing Palestinians of waging a propaganda campai
