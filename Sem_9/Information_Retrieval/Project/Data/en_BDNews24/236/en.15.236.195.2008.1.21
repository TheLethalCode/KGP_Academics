 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed leaves for Switzerland Tuesday to attend the annual meeting of World Economic Forum, his press secretary said. For the first time, Bangladesh has been invited at the head of government level to attend the annual gathering of world's top financiers, bankers, industry and commerce leaders, academics, thinkers and politicians. The CA will join about 27 heads of state. The CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters Monday that the delegates including foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury are scheduled to return home on Jan 26. The three-day event will start on Jan 23 in Davos, with the theme of "Power of Collaborative Innovation". "The participation of Dr Fakhruddin Ahmedat the World Economic Forum in Davos will greatly enhance the international image of Bangladesh," Iftekhar said in a statement in Dhaka. "This invitation has been issued because  the World Economic Forum believes that Bangladesh has a good story to tell the global audience, a story of positive social transformation and development reforms and innovative changes through ideas that have evolved domestically," Iftekhar said. Fakhruddin will take part in a plenary discussion at the Davos Congress Centre on Jan 24 on the subject "the quest for peace and stability" along with some key leaders of South and Central Asia. The CA will hold meetings with European, American and Asian political and business leaders, as well as with leaders of some fellow least developed countries (LDCs) mainly from Asia. Fakhruddin is expected to use the occasion to press duty-free, quota-free access for LDC products in world markets and meet international media personalities, and host working lunches and breakfasts for potential investors in Bangladesh. Security in Davos is expected to be tight, with the Swiss army patrolling the skies overhead and up to 5,000 soldiers augmenting police forces on the ground. Pressing economic concerns will be in focus. The impact of a possible recession in the United States, rising oil prices, falling dollar, rocketing food prices and persistent trade imbalances amid pervasive world poverty, terrorism and climate change will be discussed. Other big names include UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates and British prime minister Gordon Brown. The prospect for peace in the Middle East is likely to be a major theme. US Secretary of State and top negotiator Condoleezza Rice is to open the event. Also expected are stars from the world of entertainment, including British actress Emma Thompson and singer and campaigner Bono. The Bangladesh delegation will be joined in Davos by Debapriya Bhattacharya, permanent representative of Bangladesh to Geneva. bdnews2
