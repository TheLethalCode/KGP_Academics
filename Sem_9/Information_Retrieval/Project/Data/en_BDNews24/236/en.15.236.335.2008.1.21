 KARACHI, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan established a new record in crushing Zimbabwe by 104 runs in the first day and night one-day international at National stadium on Monday. Pakistan piled up a total of 347 for five and then restricted the visitors to 243 for seven in 50 overs. It was the first time in 2662 one-day internationals that five batsmen scored half centuries in an innings. Debutant Nasir Jamshed (61), Younis Khan (79), Mohammad Yousuf (72), Shoaib Malik (63) and Misbah-ul-Haq (55 not out) took part in the run glut. Zimbabwe were given a encouraging start by Vusi Sibanda (59) and Hamilton Masakadza (14) who were unruffled by the left-arm pace attack of Sohail Tanvir and debutant Samiullah Niazi, putting on 47 in nine overs. Masakadza was brilliantly taken behind by keeper Kamran Akmal off Tanvir but Sibanda and Chamu Chibhabha put on 56 quick runs. Sibanda scored his 10th fifty in a free-flowing innings of 54 balls with 11 fours. Chibhabha made his sixth half century but in a more laboured effort of 52 from 73 balls. Sibanda's dismissal at 103 when he hit Rao Iftikhar straight to Younis Khan at mid-on derailed the innings with Tatenda Taibu (13) trapped leg before by Shahid Afridi. Afridi also bowled Chibhabha. Captain Malik then picked up three wickets in his spell having Brendan Taylor (2) stumped and Stuart Matsikenyeri (3) leg before. Elton Chigumbura was caught at long on for 15 trying to hit Malik out of the ground. Left-handed Jamshed gave Pakistan a good start after Zimbabwe surprisingly elected to bowl first on a flat wicket. Timing the ball effortlessly, he made his maiden fifty from just 40 balls. Younis and Yousuf added a 113-run stand from only 99 balls. Younis made his 30th one-day fifty and Yousuf reeled out his 61st career half century as both dominated a listless attack. Left-arm spinner, Ray Price had both caught in the deep to extravagant shots. The bowlers were also put to the sword by Malik and Misbah as they produced a fifth wicket stand of 99 from 70 balls
