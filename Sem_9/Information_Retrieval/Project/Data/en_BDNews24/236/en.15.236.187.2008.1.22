<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)Four Dhaka University teachers Tuesday placed wreaths at the Central Shaheed Minar and vowed to continue their protests against what they said was injustice, hours after they had been freed from prison. They thanked all teachers and students for continuing a peaceful movement to help ensure their freedom from jail. Released at 5.45pm, they walked to the campus from jail in Old Dhaka, accompanied by relatives, colleagues and students. The students and teachers garlanded them. Many showered flower petals on them as they walked down the road, amid a surreal mix of smiles and tears. The freed teachers spoke briefly to a curious crowd and expressed gratitude to those who had launched a peaceful programme. Prof Anwar Hossain, one of the three teachers convicted by a Dhaka court and later pardoned by President Iajuddin Ahmed, said: "This verdict is not only against some teachers of Dhaka University. It is against the whole Dhaka University community, the conscience of the nation." "I did not want to come out of jail. Then the jail authorities tried to force me out as per the Jail Code. Later they informed me that all students would be released by tomorrow (Wednesday)." "Nobody can gag the voice of conscience. We will join a teacher-student-guardian solidarity rally at the Aparajeyo Bangla tomorrow." The teacher said he would narrate the picture of alleged torture in custody to the national and international media. "We did not do any injustice. We protested injustice." Prof Anwar thanked the members of the families of detained teachers for standing by them and supporting them with courage and patience. Prof Harun-or-Rashid said: "All teachers and students had their support to our struggle for justice for the long five months. That's why we could come here today." "We stood by the students out of moral conscience. The power of teachers is their moral strength. We upheld the glorious traditions of Dhaka University. We did not agree to a proposal of bail. Let the ill-fate come our way but we will not lower our head." "We will stay the course of justice. We will always speak against injustice and torture." He said, "We want to stand by the students. Many are still detained. We will continue to speak for their freedom." Prof Neemchandra Bhowmick said: "We thank the teachers and students for getting us freed through different programmes. Protests against injustice will continue. We will protest injustice to maintain a peaceful atmosphere on the campus." Prof Sadrul Amin said: "The government assured us of freedom several times but did not implement it sooner. They played a game with us." bdnews24.
