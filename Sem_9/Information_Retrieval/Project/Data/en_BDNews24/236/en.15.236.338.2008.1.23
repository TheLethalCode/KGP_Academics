 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)An Airbus delegation will arrive in Dhaka on Feb 7 with an offer of sales to Biman Bangladesh Airlines, an official said Wednesday. Biman managing director MA Momen said: "We are very eager to see what sort of proposal Airbus has for us." Biman officials said a deal with Airbus first surfaced in 1998, although the national carrier did not pursue the deal at the time. On a previous offer from the European aircraft maker's rival Boeing, Momen said: "Biman has still not taken any decision about an offer from Boeing. The decision should not be hurried." "However, adding new planes to the line is crucial for Biman's future," he added. Sensing a deal on the horizon, a team from Boeing came to Bangladesh on Nov 28 with an offer for 12 planes. Biman provisionally accepted four. Boeing 787 and 777 models were among the 12, both new and old, planes on offer. Boeing claims low fuel consumption for the 787 model in comparison with other similarly sized aircraft. If Biman responds to the offer, the planes can be provided by 2011. The Biman officials said a meeting was called on Nov 28, although no decision regarding the Boeing planes was taken. A final decision on the planes will only be made after discussion with the airplane purchase committee. Biman floated international tenders to buy four aircraft six months ago, although the response did not meet expectations. bdnews24.
