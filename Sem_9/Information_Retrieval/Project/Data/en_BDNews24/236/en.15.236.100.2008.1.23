<TITLE> Stocks wilt as Fed boost fades, bonds favoured </TITLE>

 LONDON, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Persistent worries about a US recession undid the boost that Tuesday's surprise US interest rate cut gave to global markets, sending European stocks lower on Wednesday and lifting safe-haven government bonds. The yen, which tends to rise as investors pare risky trades, also gained ground against the dollar and higher-yielding currencies such as the euro. "There's some nervousness out in the market because although we had the rate cut in the United States, which was a positive start to trying to put things on hold, people think the credit crunch isn't over," said Mark Foulds, a trader at Tradindex. The Federal Reserve on Tuesday slashed its key federal funds rate by 75 basis points -- the largest cut in more than 23 years -- to 3.50 percent a week ahead of its scheduled meeting, underscoring the risks facing the U.S. economy. "The fact the market has come off this morning shows us that there is still a lot of downbeat news to come and that there's a lot of negativity out there," Foulds added. Investors believe a lot more needs to be done by the Fed to shore up the U.S. economy, which some see as on the brink of recession, hit by a slumping housing market and tight credit conditions. Markets have priced in a further 50 basis point rate cut at next week's Fed meeting. After rising as much as 1.6 percent, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares reversed direction to be down 1.1 percent with Germany's DAX falling nearly 2 percent. London's FTSE lost nearly 1 percent in choppy trade after data showed Britain's economy grew slightly faster than expected in the final quarter of 2007. This followed a 2 percent rebound for Japan's benchmark Nikkei and a 4.5 percent rally for MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets. Commodities looked vulnerable on fears that demand will be chipped away by slower global growth. Copper was down slightly on the London Metal Exchange, while U.S. crude fell 93 cents to $88.28 a barrel. MSCI world equity index pared earlier gains to be up a slim 0.3 percent, still off a near 15-month low plumbed a day earlier. It was, however, down about 12 percent this year. BONDS, YEN UP But underlying worries about the global economy kept a bid tone for Euro zone government bonds. The March Bund futures advanced 74 ticks to 116.82. The 10-year Bund yield slipped to 3.92 percent, while the benchmark U.S 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.43 percent, after earlier dipping below 3.4 percent for the first time since mid-2003. In the currency market, the dollar shed 0.5 percent against the yen to 105.95 on the day, while the euro slid 0.9 percent to 154.46 yen. The euro fell 0.3 percent versus the dollar to $1.4580. Earlier, data showed Euro zone services growth slumped significantly to below forecasts to a rate not seen in over 4 years this month, adding to the case for a rate cut by the European Central Bank, analysts say. "January's flash PMI surveys confirm that the slowdown in Euro zone economic activity continues," said Martin Van Vliet, an economist at ING. "The further decline in the composite PMI highlights the need for the ECB governing council to seriously reconsider its baseline view that the euro zone economy will grow broadly in line with its trend potential this year." But ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told legislators the ECB needed to stay focussed on fighting inflation in the face of a very significant market correcti
