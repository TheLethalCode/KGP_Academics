 BELGRADE, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbs voted on Sunday in a close presidential election that could decide future ties with the West after the expected loss of its breakaway Kosovo province. Opinion polls ahead of the first round ballot gave hardline challenger Tomislac Nikolic of the Radical party a slim lead over pro-Western President Boris Tadic, but not enough for outright victory. "I voted for a better future, for Nikolic," said 47-year old Nada Bilandzic, an early voter in a Belgrade suburb. "I am convinced his is the only party that can open factories and restore the economy." Voting stations close at 1900 GMT and preliminary results are expected by 2300 GMT. Polls suggest Nikolic will win 33 percent of the first-round vote and Tadic around 30 percent. To win the Feb. 3 run-off, the two candidates will try to attract third party votes with promises of higher living standards, jobs and the defence of Kosovo, which is heading for independence with Western backing within months. Tadic opposes independence for Kosovo, regarded by Serbs as their historic heartland, but favours signing a first-level agreement with the European Union even if the bloc takes over Kosovo's supervision as a prelude to recognising the territory. Nikolic's Radical Party supported the policies of late autocrat Slobodan Milosevic in the war-torn 1990s and puts his trust in Russia. "There's a risk of the return of the old guard that led Serbia into conflicts and isolation in the 1990s and led people into turmoil and uncertainty," Tadic said of a Nikolic victory. "But I am certain the people will not allow this, they will vote for stability and economic progress, for a better life for their families." UN PROTECTORATE Half of the 6.5 million electorate may stay home, reflecting disappointment with democratic politics seven years after the fall of Milosevic. Nikolic has toned down his rhetoric to appeal to moderates as well as the one third of Serbs who live just over the poverty line. He has rejected accusations of isolationism and war-mongering. "I have not said goodbye to the West," he told a rally this week. "I said we could be with you, and that we can sign whatever you want, but do not touch Serbia. "Serbia has its borders." Kosovo has been a United Nations protectorate since 1999 when NATO expelled Serb troops accused of atrocities against ethnic Albanians there while fighting a guerrilla war. Indications by the US and most EU member states that they will recognise Kosovo as independent within months have irked Serbs who feel the country has paid enough for its role in the wars of the 1990s, and could win nationalists more votes. Three other candidates are expected to win about 6 percent each. They include Cedomir Jovanovic, the only candidate prepared to tell Serbs that Kosovo is lost and their country should move
