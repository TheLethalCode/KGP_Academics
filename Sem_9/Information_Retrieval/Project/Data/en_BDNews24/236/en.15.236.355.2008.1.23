 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)No hurdle whatsoever will deter or defer elections and none will able to question the validity of the voter lists, said the chief election commissioner Wednesday. Registering himself and his wife as voters in Gulshan, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said: "A free and fair election using a flawless voter list is our goal." Asked whether the Election Commission was likely to face troublesome lawsuits over redefining the electoral constituenciesas had happened in the pastHuda said: "We don't believe so." "We have in any case worked out an alternative plan in case lawsuits do crop up in this connection." The CEC, however, did not elaborate on the 'alternative plan'. "This voter list with voters' photographs is going to be a really complete one, allowing no one any scope of raising a question," Huda told reporters. He toured the voter centre set up at Gulshan Model School and College, and inspected the progress of registration there. Chairman of the Regulatory Reforms Commission Akbar Ali Khan was present at the same time Wednesday to register as a voter. He told reporters: "Voter lists with photos are the only method suitable for today." "Using this process, you can ensure an immaculate voter list." Akbar Ali called upon the CEC to hold parliamentary elections as soon as possible. bdnews
