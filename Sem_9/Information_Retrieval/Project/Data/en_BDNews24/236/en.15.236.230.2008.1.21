<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday stayed all proceedings of twin tax-dodge cases against Janakantha editor Atiqullah Khan Masud. The court also asked the government and the National Board of Revenue to explain why the cases are not illegal. A panel of Justice Md Abdur Rashid and Justice Miftahuddin Chowdhury made the rule upon two writ petitions by Masud's brother M Mizanur Rahman Khan. Masud's lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Hossain argued in court that the cases had been filed against his client without following a proper legal course. Masud's wife Shamima A Khan, two sons Mishal Khan and Jishal Khan are also accused in the cases. NBR officials Ayesha Siddiqui Shoily and Syed Zakir Hossain filed the cases on Jan 6. Security officials arrested Masud on March 7 but they failed to arrest his wife and sons. On Jan 9, a Dhaka judge ordered the authorities to attach all moveable and immovable property owned by Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar, a business group of seven companies. On Jan 20, police sealed six floors of the Janakantha Bhaban on New Easkaton Road. bdnew
