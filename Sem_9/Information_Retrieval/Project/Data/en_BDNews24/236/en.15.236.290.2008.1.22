<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese stocks tumbled more than 4 percent to a 28-month low on Tuesday as investors followed others around the world to dump stocks on growing fears that the US economy is heading for recession. The yen hit a 2-1/2-year high against the dollar, sending big exporters Sony Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Corp down more than 5 percent. Bank shares were also hit hard. "It's like a funeral in here," said Ken Masuda, senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities, as the Nikkei share average took its losses to 17 percent so far this year and 30 percent over the last six months. "No one knows what is going to happen tonight in New York. It's like we've gone blind -- you don't know what's coming. Until we see New York, all we can do is sell." US stock index futures sank in holiday-shortened trading in New York on Monday, indicating Wall Street was likely to join the global equity market plunge when trading resumes on Tuesday. The Nikkei was down 4.41 percent at 12,738.31, its lowest since early September 2005, down 587.63 points. It shed 600 points before light bargain-hunting emerged. The broader TOPIX was down 3.98 percent at 1,242.22. "We've been seeing some panic selling, and the Nikkei has fallen one by one through its support levels," said Noritsugu Hirakawa, a strategist at Okasan Securities who said that, according to technicals, the next big support line is at 12,500. Some bargain hunting emerged late in the morning as the dollar recouped some losses against the yen, climbing back above 106 yen and heping the market trim its losses slightly. But market players were warily watching the movements of other Asian markets, with large falls there seen further pressuring the Nikkei amid concerns that developing economies such as China may not be able to escape a slowdown. MSCI's index of Asian shares besides Japan was down 4.5 percent at 0237 GMT. CHINA CONCERNS The president of China's sixth-largest bank told Reuters on Monday that earnings at Chinese banks will probably be hit this year by the snowballing US subprime mortgage crisis and Beijing's moves to cool the economy "News like this suggests that damage may be spreading in developing markets including China, and this is worsening the overall sentiment in financial markets," said Toshiyuki Suzuki, a New York-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank. "It appears that these markets too will not be able to escape the impact of the wave of worsening international economies." Blue-chips were battered, with Sony down 5.1 percent at 5,210 yen, Toyota sliding 5.5 percent to 4,970 yen and Honda down 5.7 percent at 2,925 yen. Banks slid as well, with Mizuho Financial Group slipping 5.4 percent to 439,000 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group down 4.1 percent at 728,000 yen. Mobile phone carriers NTT DoCoMo Inc, KDDI Corp and Softbank Corp dropped after Softbank -- the smallest of the three mobile carriers -- announced a plan to eliminate its 980 yen monthly basic fee for three years to students. KDDI, the second-biggest drag on the Nikkei in terms of index weight, fell 5.1 percent to 739,000 yen. Trade was active, with 1.2 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, compared with last week's morning average of 1.14 billion. Declining shares beat advancing ones by more than 14 to 1
