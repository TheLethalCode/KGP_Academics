 BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend an alliance summit in Bucharest in early April, a NATO spokesman said on Wednesday. If Putin accepts, it will be the first time a Russian leader has attended a NATO summit since the 1992 Rome meeting that launched the existing NATO-Russia partnership format. "It made sense in terms of clearing the air ... there is a lot to discuss," the spokesman told a news conference of the reason for inviting Putin, referring to differences with Moscow on issues ranging from Kosovo to the US missile shield plan. The spokesman said the Kremlin had yet to reply to an invitation letter sent in recent days.
