I came to the court in the morning to hear good news. I demand their freedom. This verdict is conspiratorial. SANJIB HOSSAIN, son of DU professor Anwar Hossain My father has said this verdict is against the conscience of the nation. My father won't seek mercy. My father won't come out of prison as long as any of his colleagues or students remains in jail. AKHTERUZZAMAN, former DUTA general secretary Everything was stage-managed. Our protests will continue. ADVOCATE MASUD TALUKDER, defence counsel It's a mysterious judgement. There were no lawyers for the state in court.
