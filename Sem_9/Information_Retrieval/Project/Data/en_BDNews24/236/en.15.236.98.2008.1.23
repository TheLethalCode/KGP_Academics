 singapor, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil retreated below $89 on Wednesday after making a nervous recovery as an emergency U.S. interest rate cut halted a global financial market sell-off but failed to halt recession fears in the world's top oil consumer. In a rare policy move outside of its ordinary meetings, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 75 basis points to 3.5 percent on Tuesday, its biggest cut in more than 23 years and a move that some traders said smelled of panic. U.S. crude fell 36 cents to $88.85 a barrel by 0555 GMT after falling as low as $86.11 a day ago amid a global stock market rout. London Brent crude shed 40 cents to $88.05 a barrel, about $1 below its close on Friday before the worst of the turmoil hit global markets. Some analysts said traders had been selling oil and other commodities to cover margin calls in other markets. "I think a lot of people realise the underlying weakness of the economy is still unfolding... traders feel that there are lots more losses still waiting to be revealed," said Robert Nunan, manager at Mitsubishi Corp's risk management unit. Oil prices plunged on Monday and Tuesday, as world stock markets momentarily posted their steepest losses since Sept. 11, 2001 amid widespread concerns that the impact from the U.S. credit and housing crisis could trigger a recession, curbing the steady rise in oil demand that has fuelled prices for five years. Major Asian share markets that had been battered a day ago roared back early on Wednesday, before giving up much of their gains, with Hong Kong up 5.3 percent and Australia up over 4 percent, while the euro's further gains to the dollar lent support to the energy complex. OIL STILL STRONG While down almost 12 percent from their all-time peak above $100 a barrel hit Jan. 3, oil prices are still up more than 60 percent from a year ago, supported by tight inventory levels, OPEC output restraints and strong demand from investors seeking higher returns and a possible hedge against inflation. Goldman Sachs said that while oil prices could slide into the low $80s if speculators liquidated their long positions, strong fundamentals would probably prevent funds from selling out completely. US crude oil stocks, which rose for the first time in nine weeks last week after hitting their lowest since 2004, are expected to have risen by another 2.1 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll found. The government inventory data, due out a day later than usual on Thursday due to Monday's US holiday, are also likely to show a 1.4 million-barrel rise in gasoline stocks as refiners begin to build up supplies ahead of summer, the poll showed. Oil's recent slide has relieved pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on a production increase when it meets on Feb. 1. Several OPEC ministers have hinted that it will keep production steady at the meeting. On Tuesday UAE's oil minister Mohammed al-Hamli said the recent price drop was a "positive thin
