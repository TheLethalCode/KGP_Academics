 canberra, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia began rebuilding relations with its tiny Pacific neighbours, strained under the former conservative government, with talks on Wednesday between Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and new Solomon Islands leader Derek Sikua. Rudd met the Solomons prime minister in private in Canberra, during which Sikua offered to help Australia mend fences with neighbouring Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Vanuatu. "There is a sense Australia has been perhaps heavy-handed in its relationships with Pacific island neighbours," Australian MP Duncan Kerr, who will oversee Pacific relations, told Reuters. Australia is a major aid donor to the far-flung Pacific island nations and is the biggest military power in the South Pacific, as well as a travel and business hub. Relations between Australia and the Solomons plummeted in recent years under the former Solomons leader, Manasseh Sogavare, who was critical of Australian troops sent to end ethnic fighting in the Solomons. In turn, Australia accused Sogavare of hindering efforts to end corruption in his island nation. Sogavare expelled Australia's top diplomat for political interference, prompting Canberra to retaliate with visa restrictions on Solomons MPs, infuriating South Pacific leaders with what was seen as bullying tactics by Canberra. "Although short, the meeting between the two prime ministers is likely to enable them to re-commit the trust that once existed between the two governments and their people," a Solomon Islands government spokesman said on Wednesday. STRAINED RELATIONS Australia's ties with other island nations have also been strained in recent years. Canberra blocked visas for Papua New Guinea MPs after the former Solomon Islands Attorney-General Julian Moti, who was wanted in Australia to face child sex charges, was secretly flown out of PNG and back to the Solomons. And Fiji's relations with Canberra were placed in a deep freeze in December 2006 after a military coup there to oust the government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Rudd, whose centre-left Labor government was elected in November, faces a difficult task to rebuild ties after the former government's tough-love approach to the restive region, an approach backed by threats of intervention by troops or police. "It starts with the tonality of the relationship. Much of the effectiveness of our presence in the Pacific depends on being able to have face-to-face contact with people," Kerr said, saying his government aimed for a less blunt version of diplomacy. Rudd has already met Michael Somare, the Papua New Guinean Prime Minister, who was barred from travelling to Australia by former Prime Minister John Howard over the Moti affair. And while travel bans would remain for members of Fiji's military, Kerr said Canberra had made clear that those who participated in democratic reform would not be caught up. Pacific analyst Sinclair Dinnen said Canberra was undergoing a reappraisal of relations with a region that had always struggled economically and politically, and which could also flow on into Australia's relations to the north with Asia. "Mr Howard was at times extremely patronising. Certainly all the early sign on both sides now are that great efforts will be made to build a more constructive relationship," said Dinnen, from the Aust
