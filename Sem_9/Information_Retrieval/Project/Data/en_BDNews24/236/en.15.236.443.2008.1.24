 Anka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis urged Turkey on Wednesday to reopen a Greek Orthodox theological seminary near Istanbul, saying it was one of Ankara's obligations under its European Union accession process. Karamanlis, on the first official visit by a Greek leader to Turkey in nearly half a century, also said Ankara must improve relations with the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus in order to join the EU. "Protection of minority rights are among the most important criteria for joining the European Union," Karamanlis told a joint news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan after stressing the importance of the Halki seminary. Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, is based in Istanbul. An ethnic Greek but Turkish citizen, he says the dwindling Orthodox community could soon die out in Turkey if the seminary is not re-opened.

Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, who led his community into rejecting a U.N. reunification plan in a 2004 referendum, is seeking re-election. "The process after the (Greek Cypriot) elections is very important. We expect an effort from Mr Karamanlis to restart the negotiations," Erdogan said. Both leaders pledged to continue building closer trade, energy and tourism ties between Turkey and Greece, NATO allies but also ancient rivals which came to the brink of war over an uninhabited Aegean island in 1996. Karamanlis's visit to Turkey crowns a decade of steady improvement in relations as the two set aside old disputes over the Aegean and Cyprus and focus on common economic interests. Bilateral trade now stands at $2.8 billion, up from just $200 million in 1995, Greek figures sho
