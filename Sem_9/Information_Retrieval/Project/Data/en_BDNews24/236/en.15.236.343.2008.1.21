 LONDON, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Everton moved into fourth place in the Premier League on Sunday with a scrappy 2-1 victory at lowly Wigan Athletic. First-half goals from Andy Johnson and Joleon Lescott gave Everton a comfortable interval lead before an own goal from defender Phil Jagielka gave Wigan a lifeline in the second half. Manchester City climbed the table to fifth although they were below-par in a 1-1 draw with West Ham United that maintained their unbeaten league record at home this season. Carlton Cole's acrobatic overhead kick gave West Ham an early lead but Darius Vassell equalised before halftime. Everton moved to 42 points, three above city rivals Liverpool who drop to sixth albeit having played two games fewer and face Aston Villa on Monday. City have 40 points. Memories of 2005 when David Moyes guided Everton to a fourth-place finish are beginning to stir as his side again threaten the established big guns in the Premier League. They have only been beaten in the league by Arsenal and Manchester United since mid-October and three consecutive victories have put the pressure on Liverpool in the battle for fourth spot and a Champions League qualifying berth. A churned-up surface at Wigan's JJB Stadium was not ideal for pretty football and Everton were second best for long periods of the first half against a side fighting to stay out of the bottom three. However, a dreadfully scuffed back pass by Wigan's Titus Bramble was seized upon by Johnson after 39 minutes and he raced away to score with ease. Three minutes later Lescott prodded in from close range to put Everton in command. Wigan pulled a goal back after 53 minutes when Jason Koumas's floated delivery into the area caused havoc and the ball bounced into the net off Jagielka. "It was always going to play second fiddle to Wednesday night but it was a terrific result because may be the conditions suited Wigan more than it did us," Moyes told Everton's Web site (www.evertonfc.com) referring to the League Cup semi-final, second leg against Chelsea. Mid-table West Ham could count themselves unlucky not to gain revenge for their FA Cup third-round defeat at City in the week. Vassell's equaliser for City which cancelled out Cole's spectacular opener looked suspiciously offside and the Hammers had several chances after the break, most notably a Mark Noble shot saved by the outstretched leg of City keeper Joe Hart. On Saturday the top three in the Premier League all won, with Manchester United's 2-0 win at Reading keeping them above Arsenal, 3-0 winners at Fulham, on goal difference. Chelsea, who beat Birmingham City, are four points behind on 50 points
