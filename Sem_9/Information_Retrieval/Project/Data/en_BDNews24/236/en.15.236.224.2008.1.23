<TEXT>
 La Paz, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivian President Evo Morales defended his first two years in office on Tuesday, stressing advances in his "democratic and cultural revolution" while largely ignoring a feud with provinces demanding autonomy. The first president of indigenous descent, Morales told Congress on the second anniversary of his taking over that he had fulfilled key promises by nationalizing the energy sector and drafting a constitution giving the Indian majority more power. But the proposed new constitution -- approved by Morales' allies during an opposition boycott last month -- sparked a drive for greater independence in four of Bolivia's nine provinces and a stand-off with the central government. Morales did not address the conflict directly, but said his government's reforms were irreversible. "There's no turning back on the path we started upon two years ago. The past cannot be repeated," Morales said in the televised speech. "There's room for everyone in this revolution. And only if we're united can we make the deep changes that people want." Morales won a December 2005 election with 54 percent of votes, an unprecedented victory since democracy returned to South America's poorest country in 1982. Flying multicolored Aymara flags and playing brass instruments, Morales' supporters crowded a main plaza in La Paz to greet the leader as he walked the half-block between the presidential palace and Congress. In a speech lasting several hours, the president touched on everything from literacy and military helicopters to the importance of raising llama-like animals called vicuna in certain highland communities. He reiterated his government's commitment to an "agrarian revolution," which takes unproductive lands from wealthy estate owners and gives them to small peasant farmers
