<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will seek a court decision to end the stalemate over its dialogue with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the commission's lawyer said Tuesday. Following a meeting with the chief election commissioner, the EC's lawyer Dr Kamal Hossain told reporters that he would file an appeal with the court to settle the matter of electoral reform dialogue between the two parties. Commissioner Sohul Hossain told reporters on Dec 1 that the EC would file an appeal with the Supreme Court before it went on its winter recess. He added that the EC would abide by the court's ruling. Meanwhile, the chief adviser told reporters Monday that the government intends to sit with the political parties as soon as the EC concludes its series of meetings with them. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia filed a writ on Nov 18 with the High Court in connection with the stalled talks. The HC then stayed the EC's invitation to the Hafizuddin Ahmed-led faction of the BNP for two weeks. The court also asked the EC to prove the legality of the invitation. Since Sep 12, the EC has conducted electoral reforms dialogue with 16 political parties. It was initially scheduled to sit with the BNP on Nov 22. bdnew
