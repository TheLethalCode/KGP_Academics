 Asuncion, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguay's ruling party on Monday nominated a former education minister seeking to become Paraguay's first female leader as its presidential candidate, ending a month-long dispute over a primary election result. The Colorado Party's choice of Blanca Ovelar to compete in the April 20 election came after she finished narrowly ahead of former Vice President Luis Castiglioni in a contested primary vote last month. Castiglioni challenged the results, but a party electoral judge ruled on Monday that Ovelar won by 4,020 votes. Ovelar, 50, brushed aside the controversy surrounding her candidacy and urged thousands of party supporters in Asuncion, the capital, to rally behind her. "We're beginning our fight in April and we're going to do it united, without any resentment," she said. Ovelar is backed by President Nicanor Duarte Frutos. But Castiglioni, who resigned to launch his candidacy without the president's support, insisted he would continue to challenge Ovelar's nomination in the courts. "The government has found a criminal way to twist the results by manipulating the process through corrupt judges," he said in a statement. The Colorado Party has held power in Paraguay for 60 years. Ovelar will face Fernando Lugo, a left-leaning former Catholic bishop popular with the poor who left the priesthood to run for president. Also running are retired army general Lino Oviedo, a charismatic center-right leader who was once jailed for leading a coup attempt, and businessman Pedro Fadul. If she wins, Ovelar would be the third woman president in South America, joining Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Michelle Bachelet of Chile
