 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bndews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed Monday pardoned four Dhaka University students sentenced to two years in jail, an official of the Bangabhaban said. The president also pardoned 10 other students of Rajshahi University and one employee of the same university, secretary (Public Division) at the President's Office Mohammad Sirajul Islam told bdnew24.com by phone. The four DU and 10 RU students were convicted in two cases of student unrest at Dhaka and Rajshahi Universities which took place in August 2007. The move by the president was the latest as Monday saw a series of developments over the contentious issues. The move came amid growing calls by students and teachers for the government to withdraw charges against all the accused. Earlier, home affairs adviser MA Matin said the government would look into the demand for mercy to four absconding students of Dhaka University who have been handed down two years in jail each for breaking emergency rule during the August campus violence. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui delivered the verdict earlier Monday, in which he, however, acquitted four Dhaka Unversity teachers and 11 students of the same charges. IG (Prisons) Brigadier General Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com at 6:50 pm that the Rajshahi University students had already walked out of prison. bdnews
