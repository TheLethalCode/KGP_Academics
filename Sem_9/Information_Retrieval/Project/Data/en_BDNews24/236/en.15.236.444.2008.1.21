 NEW DELHI, 21 January (bdnews24.com/AFP)- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Monday was to outline his views on institutional reform in world bodies like the United Nations as he wraps up a two-day visit to India. The speech to business leaders in New Delhi has been billed by his office as an outline of one of Brown's main foreign policy priorities, and an attempt to secure Indian backing for his plan due to its growing clout on the world stage. Britain already supports moves to make India a permanent member of the UN Security Council  a reflection of its status as an emerging economic powerhouse increasingly courted by world leaders. Excerpts of Brown's keynote speech released in advance by his office showed that he believes institutions set up after World War II like the UN, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund no longer reflect the status quo. Reform could help boost both "the new world order" and "the new global society", he was to say. "The task ahead is to agree for our time the rules that can make globalisation a force for hope and progress for people. "I believe that only in this way can globalisation become what it should be: a force for justice on a global scale." Brown arrived in India from China on Sunday. Both countries are among the world's fastest growing economies and like many European countries, Britain is keen to court them in order to boost lucrative trade ties and other links. According to Britain's Foreign Office, relations between the two countries are at their healthiest ever. Brown indicated Sunday that Britain  the former colonial power here until 1947 -- was no longer the dominant partner. Instead he said the relationship was now "a partnership of equals" striving for common goals. Details of Brown's dinner talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Sunday were kept under wraps, but Brown has said he wanted to raise a number of issues including climate change and the need to boost counter-terrorism links. On climate change, Brown has said he would look to secure both India and China's backing for a new global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. India  which with China classes itself as a developing nation  is opposed to binding targets. Brown said he was not dismayed by India's stance and said New Delhi could play a positive role in securing a new agreement. On counter-terrorism he said earlier there was a need for all countries to work more closely to help win "the battle of hearts and minds" and isolate "the extremist ideologues who try to poison young people and the views they have". The situation in military-ruled Myanmar was also to be raised. Brown  who wrote about the imprisoned pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in his 2007 book "Courage"  urged India to use its influence to help moves to democracy. Brown and Singh were to hold further talks on Monday. The British prime minister was also to launch closer sporting and educational ties between the two countries and pay his respects to Mahatma Gandhi, revered here as the father of the Indian nation. Talks with senior government officials and a drop-in with Indian President Prathiba Patil were also planned before Brown heads home late Mond
