 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The government will hold talks with political parties immediately after the Election Commission ends its election reforms talks with them, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Monday. "There's no doubt about the dialogue with the political parties," he told reporters when he signed up as a voter along with wife Neena Ahmed. "The government will do its part immediately after the end of the ongoing dialogue between the Election Commission and the political parties ends." His assurance came less than two weeks after his address to the nation where the interim leader said the government was set to sit with the political parties. The couple went to Gulshan Model School for voter registration when Election Commission officials were present. The chief adviser Monday repeated his administration's pledge that the elections would take place by year-end. "Work on voter enrollment is going on properly. The elections will be held well ahead of the deadline if the work on the voter list ends early," he said. The Election Commission has already held dialogue with 15 political parties, including the Awami League, but could not sit with the BNP yet because of legal tangles. Both factions of the BNP have claimed to be in the mainstream of the party, and the issue is now pending with court. The commission is waiting for the court's decision. bdnews24.com
