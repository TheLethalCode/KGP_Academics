 TBILISI, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili pledged at his inauguration on Sunday to mend Georgia's tattered relationship with Russia after he narrowly won an election which his opponents say was rigged. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov joined foreign envoys and hundreds of ordinary Georgians in front of parliament to watch Saakashvili's swearing-in, the highest-ranking Kremlin official to visit Tbilisi since a 2006 spy row ruined ties. "We extend the hand of partnership to our northern neighbour," said the 40-year-old Saakashvili, winner of a Jan. 5 presidential election, during his 30 minute acceptance speech. "We should be friends, we should be close to each other, we should stand next to each other." Hundreds of soldiers marched past clutching new U.S.-designed rifles, helicopters buzzed overhead and tanks trundled along the main street -- all part of a military in which Saakashvili has invested millions of dollars. Many observers had expected Russia to send a low-ranking official rather than Lavrov because relations between ex-Soviet Georgia and Russia have dipped to such a low. The staunchly pro-U.S. Saakashvili has steered Georgia towards NATO membership since sweeping to power in a peaceful 2003 revolution, angering Russia which cut trade and transport links after Georgia said it uncovered Russian spies in October 2006. Georgia accuses Russia of backing two rebel regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- and stirring revolution and their soldiers have faced each other in tense standoffs across the borders of the breakaway provinces where the Russian soldiers are deployed as peacekeepers. But since winning the election Saakashvili has struck a more conciliatory tone and his aides said he was due to meet Lavrov later in the day. "Our Euro-Atlantic orientation does not contradict the interests of any of our neighbours," he said. Georgia lies at the centre of the Caucasus, a region in which Russia and the United States are battling for influence and which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe. U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez headed the American delegation and presidents from the Baltic states, Romania and Poland attended the ceremony. Saakashvili's popularity has dropped in the last four years and he called the snap election in November after ordering police to crush anti-government protests. Western monitors said the election, which Saakashvili won with 53 percent of the vote, had been competitive despite violations but his opponents called it fixed and have staged street protests attracting tens of thousands of people. And on Sunday, a few kilometres from the ceremony, the opposition prepared to hold another protest against Saakashvili whom they accuse of economic mismanagement, and presiding over a corrupt governme
