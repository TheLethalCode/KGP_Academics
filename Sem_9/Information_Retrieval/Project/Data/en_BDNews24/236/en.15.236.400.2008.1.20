<TEXT>
 Brahmanbaria, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)People living adjacent to the faulty No. 3 Titas gas field well in Brahmanbaria are living in panic as work is underway to seal the leaking well. Local administration officials said that there was no reason for panic. A local Union Parishad member said a number of residents in the area had demanded compensations for continued exposure to the faulty well's emissions. The district administration said anybody affected by the gas leak should be compensated by the well's owner, Bangladesh Gas Fields Company. Fifteen employees from Boots and Coots Company, led by a US expert, have been working to close the well since Jan 10. Residents of the Ghatura area started leaving their homes after remedial work on the well started. Suhilpur Union Parishad member Khasru Mollah told bdnews24.com that authorities at the gas field were using loudspeakers requesting people not to be afraid. "When the process of sealing the well started a huge boom created by gas rushing out of the well frightened many people," said Khasru. General Manager of Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Jahangir Kabir said: "There is nothing to be afraid of. When the well is closed the sound will disappear." Deputy commissioner Md Abdul Hye told bdnews24.com that they are monitoring the situation. "We have requested local people not to be afraid, and asked Petrobangla to advertise in the newspaper regarding the matter," Hye said. "The authorities have now placed newspaper advertisements and are also using mikes to spread the message." "The Sadar Upazila Nirbahi office has also been directed to continue their publicity work." "The work of sealing well No. 3 is progressing well. There is no need to fear an accident," said the deputy commissioner. A gas field official said an 8,400 feet long pipe would be inserted into the well after which it would be sealed using cement and chemicals. So far approximately 6,500 feet of the pipe has already been pushed into the well. The owners of crop land at Laiska Beel are also demanding compensation for damage caused to their land, which they claim is the result of gas emissions at the site. bdnews2
