 Nairobi, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan will hold talks with Kenya's feuding parties on Wednesday to find a rapid solution to a standoff over a disputed election that erupted into a bloody political crisis. The 69-year old African statesman faces a tough challenge resolving the bitter impasse between Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and opposition challenger Raila Odinga that shattered the east African nation's reputation for stability and democracy. "We expect all parties to enter into dialogue in good faith and to seize this opportunity to end the suffering and uncertainty," Annan told reporters after landing in Nairobi late on Tuesday. At Annan's request, the opposition will call off street protests planned for Thursday, two senior sources from the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) said on Wednesday. "Annan has told us he will request no more street protests while he is here, and I can tell you we will not be objecting to that. We will accede," said a senior aide to opposition leader Raila Odinga. A second senior aide confirmed the decision. Earlier protests erupted in bouts of looting and police shootings decried by rights advocates as excessive. The latter prompted the ODM to say it would file a complaint against the government with the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Underscoring the urgency of Annan's mission, one man was found decapitated in Nairobi's Kariobangi slum in the latest of a series of ethnic killings that have not abated, a Reuters reporter said. At least eight others were reported killed in the city and the Rift Valley, local media said. The government accuses the ODM of planning ethnic killings to settle land grievances to be carried out under the cover of an election violence. Clashes between Kibaki and Odinga supporters, ethnic unrest and a brutal crackdown by the security forces have killed at least 650 people over the past month. RAPES DOUBLE The United Nations said on Wednesday that the unrest had doubled the number of reported rape and sexual assaults in areas hit by clashes. "What that tells us is that we have a very serious problem indeed because only a small percentage of rapes and sexual attacks are ever reported in Kenya," Kathleen Cravero, head of the UN Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, said. Annan gave no immediate timetable, but Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said the former UN chief was expected to talk with Odinga and Kibaki on Wednesday. He had held consultations with his fellow African negotiators Benjamin Mkapa, former president of Tanzania, and Graca Machel, the wife of former South African leader Nelson Mandela, the officials said. Odinga says a Dec. 27 poll that returned Kibaki to power was fraudulent. His supporters have taken to the streets and mobs mostly targeting Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe have hacked people to death and burnt homes. There have also been reprisal killings. Early on Wednesday, scores of ODM supporters and relatives gathered outside a Nairobi mortuary with a dozen coffins of people they said were shot by police, ahead of a memorial march. Edward Otieno, a 23-year-old telecommunications student, held the coffin of his cousin and vowed to "keep fighting". "He was trying to hide from the police, but they ran into his compound and shot him in the chest. He was paying for my education. Now who is going to pay my fees?" Otieno said. He and others were expected to march from near Kibera slum to a football field, in one of the few opposition-led gatherings permitted by police since they banned demonstrations after the crisis erupted. Riot police kept a close watch. Odinga and Kibaki have so far refused to speak to each other despite pressure from Western powers like the United States, Britain and the European Unio
