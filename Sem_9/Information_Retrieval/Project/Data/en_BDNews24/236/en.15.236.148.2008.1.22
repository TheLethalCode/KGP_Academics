 GAZA, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel resumed fuel supplies to the Gaza Strip's main power plant on Tuesday, offering limited respite from a blockade that plunged much of the Hamas-ruled territory into darkness and touched off international protests. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she had voiced her concerns to Israel which said it had sealed border crossings because of Palestinian rocket salvoes. "Nobody wants innocent Gazans to suffer and so we have spoken to the Israelis about the importance of not allowing a humanitarian crisis to unfold there," Rice told reporters travelling with her to Berlin for a meeting on Iran. Israel gave the European Union permission to bring a week's worth of EU-fund industrial fuel for the generating plant, which was shut down on Sunday after Israel tightened border restrictions. The plant's director, Derar Abu Sissi, said that one of its two turbines powered back up as the fuel arrived, restoring electricity to some outlying areas of populous Gaza City. Israel said it would also allow in 500,000 litres (132,000 U.S. gallons) of diesel for generators, a supply of cooking gas and 50 trucks of food and medicine, though restrictions on petrol for cars remained. "Our approach now is to assess what is acutely lacking, and permit imports on that basis," Israeli Defence Ministry spokesman Shlomo Dror said. The European Union and international agencies denounced the closure as illegal "collective punishment" against Gaza's 1.5 million residents, many of whom depend on foreign aid. Israel insisted that the Gazan privations were not reaching a crisis point and said its measures were a justified reaction to rocket and mortar attacks by Hamas and other factions. The closure, and accompanying scenes such as the electricity blackout and bread queues, rallied even Palestinians who had been divided by a June civil war in which Hamas seized Gaza from the secular Fatah faction of President Mahmoud Abbas. On Tuesday morning, Palestinian lawmakers in Gaza held a session by candlelight, drawing curtains on windows to keep out sunlight as invited television crews filmed the meeting. Israel has accused Hamas of exaggerating the impact of the blockade. ROCKETS The decision to allow in emergency supplies, Israeli officials said, followed a decline in the number of rocket attacks. Hamas refuses to give up its fight against Israel and opposes peace moves by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose administration condemned the Israeli closure as harmful to diplomacy. Palestinians launched at least one rocket into Israel from Gaza on Tuesday, causing no damage, compared to 45 salvoes on Friday and Saturday, the military said. The Gaza power plant ordinarily provides only 30 percent of the territory's electricity, but its closure affected a far greater proportion of the population because of the way the power grid system works. The bulk of Gaza's electricity, which comes from Israel and Egypt over cables, was not cut off, Israeli officials said. An EU official said Israel gave the bloc approval to provide 2.2 million litres (581,000 gallons) per week for the power plant "until further notice". Dror said he knew of no such open-ended deal, adding "the situation will be reassessed every week". An EU official said between 700,000 litres (185,000 gallons) and 800,000 lit
