<TITLE> Asian stocks dogged by US recession fears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks in Asia resumed their decline on Monday, with Tokyo shedding more than 3 percent after a proposed U.S. stimulus package did little to soothe fears the world's top economy will tip into a recession. Worries about the economy kept the dollar within striking distance of a near three-year low against the yen as investors unwound risky currency carry trades, and Japanese government bond futures rose to a two-year peak as investors sought a safe haven in the face of deteriorating economies and slumping stocks. Stock markets in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia nursed losses of between 1.7 and 2.7 percent, dragged lower by banks and financial companies as the sector continues to suffer the worst fallout of the US subprime mortgage crisis. Last week President George W. Bush called for package of tax cuts and other measures of around $140 billion to $150 billion to shore up the US economy, battered by the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent credit crunch. But the move did little to shore up sentiment in stock markets. "It's clear that investors are still very cautious," said Craig James, chief equities economist with Commsec in Australia. "We'd have to see some strength in Asia today to turn this situationaround. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei was down 2.6 percent by 0350 GMT. The index has shed a quarter of its value since July, when concerns that the US subprime mortgage crisis would permeate global financial markets first reared their head. Banks extended recent losses on fears they will reveal more credit-realted losses, with Mizuho Financial Group down around 2.9 percent. In Seoul worries over the health of the United States -- a top export market -- hit stocks like flat screen maker LG.Philips LCD Co Ltd The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 1.3 percent. "Technology shares, heavily dependent on the US economy and China-related stocks such as shipbuilders will likely continue to be pressured by global credit troubles," said LeeSun-yeop, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index fell 2 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 3 percent and Singapore's FTSE ST index fell 1.4 percent. MSCI's broadest index of shares outside of Japan was down 0.9 percent by 0113 GMT. The MSCI ex-Japan index, which hit an all-time high in November, is down only around 3 percent since July as some investors reckoned emerging markets would emerge from the credit crisis relatively unscathed. But those hopes are fading and the index has lost 10 percent since the start of the year as fears that equity markets are heading for a long bear phase have taken hold. On Wall Street on Friday the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell around 0.5 percent each. DOLLAR DOLDRUMS Japan's yen held gains against the dollar, supported by an unwinding of risky positions as continuing losses in Japanese stocks kepts investors alert to the possibility of a US recession and its potential effect on other economies. "There's no change in the momentum to sell the dollar," said Hideki Amikura, a forex manager at Nomura Trust and Banking. "More Nikkei losses are likely to push the dollar/yen lower." By 0335 GMT the dollar traded at 106.69 yen little changed from late last week, when it fell as low as 105.92 yen, its lowest since May 2005. Both the euro and sterling fell versus the dollar on worries about the European and British economies. Japan's March 10-year futures hit a two-year high with a 0.35 point to 138.48. The five-year yield fell 3.5 basis points to 0.820 percent, the lowest since January 2006. JGB investors are speculating that the Bank of Japan's next policy move may be to cut interest rates if Japan suffers from the troubles abroad. Oil inched towards $91 a barrel, with prices supported by the closure of Mexico's oil export terminals due to bad weather, as well as OPEC's dismissal of calls to raise output. US light crude for February delivery rose 33 cents to $90.87 a barrel in Asian trade. Among metals, gold edged lower as Bush's tax cut plan failed to inspire buying. Spot gold was trading at around $880 an ounce, down from $882 in New York on Friday
