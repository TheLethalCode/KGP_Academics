<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)Two groups of Dhaka University teachers tied to the Awami League and left parties Tuesday rejected the court verdict that sentenced three teachers to two years in jail for breaking emergency rule last year. The teachers called upon the public to stand beside them through the "hard days". Up to 20 DU teachers belonging to the two groups assembled at the Battola on the campus in a midday demonstration to protest the court verdict, reported bdnews24.com correspondents Jannatul Ferdous and Golam Mortuja Antu from the campus. "The judgment has simply wounded us. DU is passing hard days," said Muntasir Mamun, a professor of history. "We'd request all to stand beside us as they did in the pastin 1969, 1971 and in 1990." "Protesting injustice and misrule has been our tradition and heritage through the past century-long life of the university, leading the country and the nation to realising a number of its cherished goals, including independence," Prof Muntasir said. "This military-backed government wants to see us trampled under the military's boots. We'll not allow that to happen. We want our teachers be freed with honour." Professor Mesbah Kamal said: "The teachers and students here are no criminals. They just happened to speak up when the sanctity of the university was violated." "We are here today to protest the verdict as it was not at all an honourable solution to the troubles," he said. "The prestige of DU has been undermined seriously by the mockery of a judgment delivery," Prof Abdus Samad said. "It's the government who is not allowing the law of the country to prevail and we've assembled here to announce that we'll officially vent our protests tomorrow." A 'solidarity mass' will be held at the Battola Wednesday, Prof Samad said. "The DU teachers have not committed any crimes; therefore, the question of showing mercy to them by any quarters is also irrelevant." Acting dean of the social sciences faculty AAMS Arefin Siddique said: " I've heard about the judgment, which showed that the government is ill disposed towards the highest educational institution in the country." "I vehemently protest this inimical attitude." Siddique said the teachers would soon meet to work out a renewed protest programme. A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain and social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid to two-year imprisonment, while acquitting applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik and 15 students. bdnews24.com/gma/
