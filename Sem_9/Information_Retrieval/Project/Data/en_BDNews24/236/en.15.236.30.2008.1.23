Immediately after their release, the students went on foot to the Central Shahid Minar to pay their respects, bdnews24.com correspondents Abu Noman Sajib and Ajit Kumar Mahaldar reported from the scene. Speaking to reporters at the Minar, along with their relatives, they expressed their reaction to the turn of events concerning their detention and bail.

He also demanded the cancellation of all other cases against students. Dolly Dev, Manob's mother, said: "I'm so happy to see my son after five long months."

Eighteen of the 25 persons accused in the case were not charged in the final report. Of the detained students, five were released on bail Wednesday morning and the others will be freed as soon as the court orders their release, jail authorities said Wednesday morning. "Our movement will continue till the government withdraws all cases against the student community," said Deen Islam Angel. Angel also alleged that he and the other students were physically tortured during interrogation in detention. Angel's sister Nargis Aktar had mixed reactions to seeing her brother freed on bail.
