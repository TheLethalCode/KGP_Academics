 BAGHDAD, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi lawmakers have refused to ratify the nation's 2008 budget, the expected passage of which had been praised by Washington as a sign of progress, because of disputes over allocations, officials said on Tuesday. Parliamentary speaker Mahmoud Mashhadani called the heads of Iraq's main political blocs to a meeting in his office late on Monday after they failed to sign off on the $48 billion budget, and urged them to pass it when parliament next sits on Thursday. "The speaker urged all members and heads of blocs who have reservations on the 2008 budget...to hurry and approve the budget in order to provide for the fundamental needs of the Iraqi people," Mashhadani's office said in a statement issued on Tuesday. US officials in Baghdad have praised the budget and this month's passage of a law allowing former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath party to rejoin the government and military as evidence of progress.

In the absence of an accurate census, other lawmakers have argued that Kurdistan should only receive 12 percent of the budget. Several MPs also said Kurdistan should pay for the peshmergas itself. Nassar al-Rubaie, head of a bloc loyal to Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr which walked out of the government last year, also voiced concern about what he said were inadequate allocations for teachers and concerns over food rationing. A representative of Shia Fadhila bloc said his group would not agree to the current form of the budget because of what he described as "unjustifiable allocations". The Iraqi National List led by former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said the government had failed to provide any financial statements for several years. Mashhadani and Finance Minister Bayan Jabor met the leaders of the major blocs late on Monday to explain the government's position, Mashhadani's office sa
