<TITLE> Australia PM to slash spending, fight inflation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Canbera, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Monday promised to slash spending and deliver a May budget surplus of near A$18 billion ($15.8 billion) to help insulate the economy from global financial turmoil and combat rising inflation. In his first major speech of the year, Rudd said a budget surplus of 1.5 percent of national economic output would be the central plank of his centre-left Labor government's first budget, allied with "a hardline approach to fiscal discipline". "Fighting inflation is the central challenge facing our economy today," Rudd told business leaders in Perth. "Our razor gang is currently working to cut wasteful spending and find additional savings over and above the A$10 billion...that we have already identified." Government spending accounts for 23 percent of Australia's gross domestic product. Rising interest rates and inflation, which a private survey last week said picked up to 3.7 percent in December, well over the central bank's 2-3 percent target range, are threatening the popularity of Rudd's new Labor government. Central bank Governor Glenn Stevens said last week in London that while Australia's booming economy should ride out the worst of the global credit squeeze, inflation was likely to remain "uncomfortably high in the near term". Those comments added to expectations of an interest rate hike after the bank's Feb. 5 board meeting, with Stevens underscoring concern about rising fuel and raw material costs. MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS Adding to pressure on the government in a country where home ownership and mortgage repayments are a sensitive political issue, an international survey on Monday showed many Australian cities were among the English-speaking world's least affordable. Australia had 18 cities in the U.S.-based Demographia International survey's top 50 most unaffordable housing markets. To contain the political fallout, Rudd has been anxious to appear in solidarity with voters and on Sunday held a "community cabinet" meeting with around 600 members of the public in Perth, alongside senior ministers, taking questions from the floor. Rudd also outlined a five-point inflation-fighting plan, including A$5 billion in expenditure cuts above those pledged in the election, aiming to reduce infrastructure constraints, encourage private savings and tackle workforce skill shortages. "This will be a tough fight, but unless we engage this fight, the consequences for businesses, employees and families will be very negative indeed," Rudd said. Treasurer Wayne Swan said that, while inflationary pressures were building in the economy, the government would deliver on A$31 billion ($27 billion) in tax cuts promised during the November election that swept aside a decade of conservative rule. "What's inflationary is the federal government's total spend, and that's why we're determined to make savings over and above the A$10 billion we promised during the election," Swan told Australian radio. Heather Ridout, a lobbyist for Australian Industry Group, said it was vital Rudd deliver his promised surplus to keep pressure off interest rates. But Michael Workman, Senior Economist at Commonwealth Bank, said the government plan would take six to 12 months to kick in and was unlikely to influence the central bank soon. "Our view on this is that it looks like there will be another rate rise. I think down the track it's most likely going to be seen as quite positive," he told Reuters. ($1=A$1.14)
