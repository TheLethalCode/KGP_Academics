 FRANKFURT Tue Jan 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Futures on leading US stock market indexes fell before the start of Wall Street trading on Tuesday, signaling that American shares would join the global equities sell-off. Cash equities markets in the world's largest economy, seen by some analysts as teetering on the brink of recession, are due to resume trading at 9:30 a.m. EST having been closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day. "All eyes will be on the US market's performance today," ABN AMRO said in a note. US equities tend to set the pace for many other stock markets. Speculation of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve before the next scheduled Fed meeting appeared to provide a sliver of support, lifting the U.S. stock index futures from early morning lows although they remained deep in the red. At 5:40 a.m. EST, S&P 500 futures were down 5.2 percent, having fallen as much as 5.3 percent earlier. Dow Jones futures fell 4.6 percent and Nasdaq futures dropped 5.5 percent. The indicative Dow Jones index, which tracks how the Dow stocks trade in Frankfurt, was 5.9 percent lower. In a sign of investor risk aversion, the yield on two-year US Treasury bonds briefly fell below 2 percent for the first time in almost four years as fears of a US recession spread throughout global financial markets. S&P 500 companies scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday include bond insurer AMBAC Financial Group, a unit of which lost a crucial triple-A rating on Friday, as well as iPod, iPhone and computer maker Apple, drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, and Fifth Third Bancorp and Bank of America. "People will be looking at company results, especially Bank of America," said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity strategist at Postbank in Germany. "It will be interesting to see what will come out from the banks today," he said, referring to the multi-billion dollar write-downs on risky housing debt securities booked recently by financial industry players in the United States and elsewhere. A survey by Reuters Estimates found that analysts expect S&P 500 companies' first-quarter earnings to grow 4.0 percent year-on-year, down from a growth outlook of 4.5 percent in last week's survey and 11.4 percent in the October 1 survey. Eyes will also be on remarks by US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the economy as well as housing and credit markets at 8:00 a.m. EST. "The key question during the next few weeks remains whether the US economy slides into recession," Germany's DZ Bank said in an equity strategy note. Ireland's Davy Research said recent newsflow on the US economy had been poor. "Perhaps most disturbingly, there is emerging evidence that the US consumer may finally be on the brink of retrenchment," Davy Research said in a note. Swiss bank UBS said the global equities sell-off was a "clear and unified message" from financial markets to central banks and other policy makers that "global economic growth will falter materially and that a concerted effort is required by central banks and others to mitigate the pain." But Postbank's Sonnenschein was not convinced that a Fed interest rate cut before its next ordinary monetary policy meeting at the end of January would help. "If they do it now it could hint that the situation is worse than people thought. We won't see a sharp move up. It won't take the nervousness out of the market," he said, adding that the uncertainty could last for wee
