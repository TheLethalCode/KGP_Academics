 Canberra, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea will close its embassy in Australia because Pyongyang cannot afford the bills to keep it operating, Australia's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. North Korean diplomats informed Australian officials in November that the four-staff embassy, located in a diplomatic quarter of Australia's capital Canberra, would shut in February. "The embassy advised that they plan to continue with non-resident diplomatic accreditation from Jakarta," a foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters. The mission said in a letter it was closing because of "financial reasons". "The DPRK said it would consider reopening should their financial situation improve," the spokesman said, referring to the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Australia is one of few western countries to have diplomatic ties with the reclusive Stalinist state and Pyongyang opened its embassy in May 2002. In September 2006, Australia announced sanctions against 12 companies and one person connected with financing Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme, including a visa ban on North Korean nationals and bar on North Korean shipping
