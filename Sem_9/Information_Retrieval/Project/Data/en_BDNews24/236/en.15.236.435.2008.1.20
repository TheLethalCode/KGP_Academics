 KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 10,000 of Malaysia's ethnic Indians staged a pro-government rally on Sunday, two months after a similar number of Indians defied arrest and tear gas to protest against racial discrimination. In a well-orchestrated event, Indians filled a badminton stadium in the capital to hear the prime minister, from the ethnic Malay majority, promise to work harder to wipe out pockets of hard-core poverty in their community. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi won the biggest cheer when he announced a religious holiday for Wednesday, when Indians celebrate Thaipusam, a festival famous for its procession of devotees who skewer their bodies with metal spikes and hooks. Abdullah, who is expected by political analysts to call an early election by the end of March, also said he would form a special cabinet committee to eradicate extreme poverty by 2010. "We have succeeded in reducing poverty, but there is still a small amount (remaining)," Abdullah told the crowd which was seated in orderly rows. He made no direct reference to November's demonstration, which stunned the government and caused diplomatic tensions with India. But Sunday's event, organised by the main pro-government Indian party, was clearly meant as a reply to that unrest. Around 7 percent of Malaysia's 26 million people are ethnic Indians whose forefathers were brought to the Southeast Asian country as labourers by British colonial rulers. Many complain of racial discrimination and some accuse the government of trying to wipe out their culture by imposing Islamic laws and targeting Hindu temples. Following November's protest in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia arrested five Hindu activists under a tough security law that allows indefinite detention without trial. "The Indian community has to be cautious because certain quarters want to see the community split and not united," Works Minister S. Samy Vellu, whose Malaysian Indian Congress belongs to the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, told Sunday's crowd. Sunday's rally, attended by around 21,000 people according to Vellu spokesman E. Sivabalan, would be the first in a series ahead of the general election, Vellu told the official news agency Bernama. Critics say Vellu, who has been the party leader and a cabinet minister since 1979, is out of touch with poor Indians. Many of those attending Sunday's rally were ferried in by bus. One, who gave his name only as Prabu, a 33-year-old brokerage clerk, said he opposed the November rally because it had threatened to split the Indian community. "We feel the community should not be divided, that's why we think it was wrong and that's why I am here today." Another, factory supervisor Selvaraj Tamilselvan, 44, said unlawful protests such as the November rally were wrong. "I feel there is a proper way of raising these issues and resolving them properl
