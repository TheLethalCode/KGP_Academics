<TITLE> Asian markets cheer US Fed cut, but lose altitude </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's biggest interest rate cut in over two decades, but nagging fears of a US recession prompted many indexes to give up much of their early gains. Demand for safe-haven government bonds remained strong, pushing the two-year Japanese bond yield below to the Bank of Japan's overnight rate target on mounting expectations for a rate cut later in the year. Bonds also got underpinned by a fall in S&P 500 futures pointing to another weak session on Wall Street. The dollar reversed an earlier rally to fall one yen from the day's high. Some said the Fed's decision -- a week before a scheduled rate meeting -- whiffed of panic even though it halted the global market meltdown that has knocked more than 12 percent off MSCI's All Country World index since the start of the year. "It seems like the Fed may be getting a bit anxious, and that may be making people nervous," said a senior trader for a US investment bank in Tokyo. Concerns global economic growth was hitting a wall and financial institutions had more subprime-related writedowns to reveal have haunted markets since the start of the year. In an effort to shore up confidence, the US central bank slashed its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.5 percent on Tuesday. "A lot of people see that the Fed's move yesterday was too little," said Hideaki Inoue, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking in Tokyo. "But given that they cut just a week before this month's meeting, it does show that the Fed realises things are bad." Most stock markets were still in positive territory with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 5.3 percent. But Seoul's KOSPI was up just 1 percent and the Shanghai Composite was flat by 0500 GMT, cutting earlier gains. Taiwan's TAIEX fell 2.5 percent, dragged down by technology shares. US technology shares fell in after hours trade after iPod and iPhone maker, Apple tumbled 12 percent on fears the weak economy would hurt the Macintosh maker. Apple Inc forecast a quarterly profit far below analysts' expectations on Tuesday and posted disappointing holiday-season iPod shipments. BEAR BREATHES DOWN NECK Wall Street's benchmark indexes still hover close to bear market territory as the prospect of a US recession looms. The blue-chip Dow average ended down about 1 percent -- way above earlier lows but still 15.5 percent from its October closing high above 14,000. The Nasdaq closed down 19.8 percent from its October 2007 closing high. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned a significant slowdown in 2008 world economic growth appeared inevitable, and the restoration of financial market stability was set to be a complex and long-drawn-out task. An IMF spokesman, Masood Ahmed, said the Fed cut was "appropriate and helpful. "The volatile weakening experienced in many equity markets during the past few days has underscored the burden that the current financial market turmoil represents for the global growth outlook," he said in a statement. Australia's benchmark shed its initial 7 percent jump and by 0446 GMT the S&P/ASX 200 index, which had fallen 12 sessions in a row, was up 5.3 percent. Miner BHP Billiton Ltd lent support with a 9 percent rally after a strong second-quarter production report. In Tokyo, the Nikkei was up 1.4 percent, recovering some of its biggest one-day loss since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States on Tuesday. The index is still down more than 16 percent just this month alone. In currency markets, the euro climbed as much as 0.4 percent to the day's high of $1.4685 after rising 1.3 percent on Tuesday, its biggest one-day percentage gain since early 2006. Oil fell below $89, with US crude down 54 cents to $88.67 a barrel. Gold also struggled to hold onto gains, with spot gold prices at around $886 an ounce
