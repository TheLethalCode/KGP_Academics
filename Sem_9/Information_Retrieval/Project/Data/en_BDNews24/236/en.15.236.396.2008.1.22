<TEXT>
 Beijing, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China will investigate reports of a cover-up of the deaths of at least 10 workers during the construction of the main stadium for this year's Beijing Olympics, a government minister said on Tuesday. Beijing organisers (BOCOG) on Monday denied report of 10 deaths at the National Stadium but Li Yizhong, Minister of the State Administration of Work Safety, said he had been unaware of the matter. "This is the first time I have heard of such problems," he told a news conference on Tuesday. "I will instruct the Beijing Work Safety Administration to investigate. If there were such (covered up) accidents, serious punishment will be given to those responsible." Sun Weide, the BOCOG spokesman who said the report in Britain's Sunday Times was "not true", referred questions about whether there had been deaths on the project to the 2008 Construction Office. No one at that office was available for comment. Construction of the 91,000-seat stadium, nicknamed the Bird's Nest, began in 2003 and it was the only one of the 36 Olympic venues in China not completed by the end of last year. The 91,000-seat arena, which is scheduled to be finished by the end of March, will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics and soccer at the Aug. 8-24 Games. Sunday's report said the "conservative estimate" of 10 deaths "was reached by comparing numerous accounts of witnesses who worked at the site in different periods". The building of any big stadium without a fatality is unusual and at least one worker has died during the construction of each of the main arenas for the last three Summer Games. Around 17,000 workers, mainly migrants from poorer provinces outside the Chinese capital, were working on Olympic projects at the height of construction
