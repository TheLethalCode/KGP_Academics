<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A row within Spain's conservative opposition party appears to have hurt its chances of winning general elections in March, opinion polls suggested on Sunday. A poll in the left-leaning El Pais daily, conducted two days after a row over whether Madrid's popular mayor should be a parliamentary candidate, showed the governing Socialists had decisively pulled away with a lead of 7.8 percent. A survey in Barcelona's La Vanguardia newspaper, conducted mostly before the PP's highly-publicised bout of infighting, had put the opposition Popular Party (PP) just 2.5 points behind the Socialists -- a similar result to other recent polls. The PP said on Tuesday evening it had turned down a request by Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, Madrid's socially moderate mayor, to run as a candidate on March 9. Some analysts called it a victory for the PP's conservative wing but a possible blow in the party's effort to attract swing voters. The flash Metroscopia poll for El Pais, which quizzed 800 people last Thursday, showed the 34.6 percent would vote Socialist versus 26.8 percent for the Popular Party, although 16.6 percent were still undecided -- a much higher proportion than in other recent polls. A survey by the same pollsters published on Jan. 8 for conservative newspaper ABC showed the Socialists held a mere 0.7 percent advantage. Having irritated centrist voters with its attacks on the government's efforts to end violence in the Basque Country, the PP has switched its focus to Spain's worsening economy, and had cut the Socialists lead in recent months. The poll in La Vanguardia, based on 1,000 interviews by Instituto Noxa from Jan. 11-16, showed the Socialists would gain 42.3 percent of the vote, and the PP 39.8 percent. Noxa's last poll, published on Jan. 2, put the gap at 2.8 percent. The Socialists under Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero won a surprise victory in the 2004 elections after the then PP government bungled its response to radical Islamist train bombings in Madrid. Both polls showed Zapatero had a better image among voters than opposition leader Mariano Raj
