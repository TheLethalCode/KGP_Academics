<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed Tuesday pardoned three Dhaka University teachers in a rushed move in an August rioting case, but there were no appeals for mercy by their families. Secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office Md Kazi Aminul Islam confirmed the news of presidential mercy for the teachers. The government also withdrew all cases against teachers and students involving the August violence, he said. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani, who presided over the case, convicted DUTA president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain and social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid. Rabbani however acquitted applied physics and electronics department chairman Prof Nimchandra Bhowmick, and 15 students of same charges. The three teachers had been jailed for two years on charges of breaking emergency rules and fomenting days of campus violence in August last year. The verdict sparked protests on the campus. A teacher said the verdict was "stage-managed" while another teacher said it was meant to "trample the dignity of Dhaka University". The magistrate took only one minute to read out the summary of the 36-page verdict. The four teachers of Dhaka University were in the dock when the magistrate pronounced the verdict. The lawyers however made competing statements. Defence counsel advocate Masud Talukder, said: "It's a mysterious judgement. There were no lawyers for the state in court." Additional public prosecutor Kabir Hossain said: "The teachers had violated emergency rule. In the trial procedure, there was no intervention by the government as the judiciary is free." bdnews
