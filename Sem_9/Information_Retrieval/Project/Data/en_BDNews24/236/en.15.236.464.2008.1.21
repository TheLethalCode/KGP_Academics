 ABU DHABI, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gulf Arab oil exporter Abu Dhabi plans to spend $15 billion in the first phase of an initiative to develop green energy and build the world's largest hydrogen power plant, it said on Monday. The investment would be part of the Masdar initiative, set up to develop sustainable and clean energy, Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan told the World Future Energy Summit in the emirate.

CCS, an as yet commercially unproven technology, should free up natural gas that is now reinjected to push oil out of oilfields. The UAE needs the gas for power generation to meet rising demand as petrodollars fuel an economic boom. The alternative energy projects also aim to place the UAE at the forefront of the future energy industry after oil. According to a UN Development Programme report issued last year, UAE greenhouse gas emissions were 34.1 tonnes per head in 2004, the third highest in the world after Qatar and Kuwait and well above US per capita emissions of 20.6 tonnes. UAE plans to build a multi-billion-dollar green city in the desert in the first quarter of this year, Masdar's Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber told Reuters last week. The plan, which envisages a zero-carbon, zero waste town of up to 15,000 residents is one of a string of projects that the world's fifth-largest oil exporter is eyei
