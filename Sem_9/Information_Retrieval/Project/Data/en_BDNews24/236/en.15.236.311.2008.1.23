 singapoe, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's biggest interest rate cut in over two decades, but nagging fears of a US recession prompted many indexes to give up some of their early gains. Europe's stock markets were tipped to notch up modest opening gains, with financial bookmaker CMC Markets predicting Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 will rise between 0.2-0.4 percent. As the cloud of a U.S. recession still hung over markets, demand for safe-haven government bonds remained strong, pushing the two-year Japanese bond yield below to the Bank of Japan's overnight rate target on mounting expectations for a rate cut later in the year. Bonds were also underpinned by a drop in S&P 500 futures pointing to another weak session on Wall Street. The dollar reversed an earlier rally to fall one yen from the day's high. Some said the Fed's decision -- a week before a scheduled rate meeting -- smelled of panic even though it halted the global market meltdown that has knocked more than 12 percent off MSCI's All Country World index since the start of the year. "I don't think that's the fix-all for markets. It's a reinstatement of the fact that yes, there's a slowdown," said Bhaskar Laxminarayan, chief investment officer, Asia for Swiss Bank Pictet & Cie in Singapore. "That means lower demand for things. That means lower sales or lower margins, and therefore the way we value companies has to be looked at differently.` Concerns global economic growth was hitting a wall and financial institutions had more subprime-related write-downs to reveal have haunted markets since the start of the year. In an effort to shore up confidence, the US central bank slashed its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.5 percent on Tuesday. Clement Ho, chief investment officer with Hang Seng Investment Management in Hong Kong, said a further cut of 50 basis points would be needed when the Fed meets later this month to boost confidence, and anything less could trigger further stock market falls. HANG SENG LEADS WAY Most stock markets were still in positive territory with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 6.2 percent by 0632 GMT, and the Shanghai Composite recovering from a brief wobble to post a 3 percent gain. But Seoul's KOSPI was up just 1.2 percent, paring initial gains. The benchmark suffered its biggest daily percentage fall in five months to an eight-month closing low on Tuesday. Taiwan's TAIEX fell 2.3 percent, dragged down by technology shares. U.S. technology shares fell in after hours trade after iPod and iPhone maker, Apple tumbled 12 percent on fears the weak economy would hurt the Macintosh maker. Apple Inc forecast a quarterly profit far below analysts' expectations on Tuesday and posted disappointing holiday-season iPod shipments. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 4.4 percent, off an initial 7 percent jump, but halting a 12-day losing streak. Miner BHP Billiton Ltd lent support with a 9 percent rally after a strong second-quarter production report. In Tokyo, the Nikkei ended 2 percent higher, recovering some of its biggest one-day loss since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States on Tuesday. The index is still down more than 16 percent this month alone. BEAR BREATHES DOWN NECK Wall Street's benchmark indexes still hover close to bear market territory as the prospect of a US recession looms. The blue-chip Dow average ended down about 1 percent -- way above earlier lows but still 15.5 percent from its October closing high above 14,000. The Nasdaq closed down 19.8 percent from its October 2007 closing high. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned a significant slowdown in 2008 world economic growth appeared inevitable, and the restoration of financial market stability was set to be a complex and long-drawn-out task. An IMF spokesman, Masood Ahmed, said the Fed cut was "appropriate and helpful. "The volatile weakening experienced in many equity markets during the past few days has underscored the burden that the current financial market turmoil represents for the global growth outlook," he said in a statement. In currency markets, the euro climbed as much as 0.4 percent to the day's high of $1.4685 after rising 1.3 percent on Tuesday, its biggest one-day percentage gain since early 2006. Oil fell below $89, with US crude down 50 cents to $88.71 a barrel. Gold also struggled to hold onto gains, with spot gold prices at around $888 an oun
