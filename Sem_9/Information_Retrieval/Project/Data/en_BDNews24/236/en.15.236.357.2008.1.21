 Washington, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A high-level delegation from Somaliland, a breakaway Somali republic, has met with senior US officials to "further common interests" in regional peace, security, economic development and democratic reform, the US State Department said on Sunday. During an eight-day visit in Washington, the delegation led by Somaliland President Dahir Kahin Rayale met with State Department, Agency for International Development, Defense Department and National Security Council officials, among others, the State Department said. Somaliland, in the northwestern corner bordering Ethiopia, broke away from the rest of Somalia in 1991 and argues it should be given sovereignty since it has held democratic elections and achieved stability that has eluded most of the country. The State Department characterized the visit as "cordial and constructive." The United States does not recognize Somaliland and a State Department spokesman said on Thursday the visit did not signal a change in position. "We are not on the verge of recognizing Somaliland," he said. The delegation left on Saturday, the State Department said.
