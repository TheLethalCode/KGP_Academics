<TEXT>
 Nairobi, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police fired teargas to disperse stone-throwing youths near an opposition funeral on Wednesday, but former UN boss Kofi Annan still managed a positive start to efforts to mediate in Kenya's political crisis. In an early success on his first day in Kenya, Annan persuaded the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) to call off street protests scheduled to resume on Thursday. "On the request of the mediation team, we have called off the activities we had planned for tomorrow," a top ODM official, William Ruto, told reporters after party leaders met Annan. In chaotic scenes at the funeral, several teargas canisters landed in a Nairobi football field where coffins were laid out and opposition leader Raila Odinga was winding up an oration for 28 slum-dwellers he said were shot by police. Pro-opposition youths then set fire to a nearby post office. "This is a war between the people of Kenya and a small clique of very bloodthirsty people who want to cling on to power at all costs," Odinga told the crowd of mourners as violence erupted on a road outside. "Let us stand as one people to liberate our country." Annan's talks were designed to resolve a post-election stalemate that threatens to wreck the east African country's image as a stable democracy. The former UN secretary-general held talks with Odinga after meeting the speaker of parliament and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni -- also trying to mediate -- before planned talks later with President Mwai Kibaki. Adding to a death toll of about 650 since the Dec. 27 election, at least two more people were killed in a Nairobi slum during the morning in the latest ethnic clashes. Odinga says Kibaki stole a narrow victory, which has split the country of 36 million down the middle. Police had eased a ban on public demonstrations, in place since Kibaki's swearing-in on Dec. 30 prompted rioting and looting, to permit a memorial led by the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) for what it called the "freedom fighters" of Kibera slum. CAR OCCUPANTS BEATEN The day began peacefully as hundreds of supporters marched from Kibera, a stronghold of Odinga's Luo tribe. The event turned violent when about a dozen youths on a highway outside stopped some cars, smashed windows and beat occupants who did not belong to their Luo tribe. Police moved in but held fire, witnesses said, as a growing crowd of youths threw rocks at them. They eventually responded with charges and salvoes of teargas, some of which landed in the field, terrifying mourners and scattering ODM leaders. As police pulled back, youths set upon the post office, smashing windows, starting a fire and tearing a wall down. ODM complained afterwards that police had assaulted peaceful mourners. After meeting Annan, the newly elected Parliament Speaker Kenneth Marende said face-to-face discussion between the two Kenyan leaders "is going to be on the table". World powers have called on Kibaki and Odinga to hold urgent talks after more than three weeks of unrest. Illustrating the urgency of Annan's mission, two men were found dead -- one stoned and one decapitated -- in Nairobi's Kariobangi slum. Area police commander Paul Ruto said the fighting was between Luos and Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group. At least eight other people were reported killed in the city and the Rift Valley, local media said. Odinga has demanded Kibaki stand down or face a new election, which some diplomats have cautioned against as having too much potential for further bloodshed. Odinga hinted he might accept the creation of a prime minister's post for him. "We are ready to share power with him. He remains president and we take the position of prime minister," Odinga told Germany's ARD televisio
