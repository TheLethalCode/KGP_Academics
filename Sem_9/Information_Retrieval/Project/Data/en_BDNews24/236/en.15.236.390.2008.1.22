<TITLE> Canada Afghan mission needs more NATO help: panel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OTTAWA, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canada should keep its 2,500-strong military mission in southern Afghanistan beyond the scheduled end-date of February 2009, provided NATO sends more troops to the area and Ottawa buys more helicopters, an independent panel said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Stephen Harper, reacting to growing public unease over military casualties, last October asked the panel to look into what to do with the mission. The recommendations are nonbinding, but Harper has said he will pay close attention. The minority Conservative government could fall over the issue, since Harper has promised that Parliament will have the final say. He wants to keep the troops in Afghanistan until at least 2011, but the three opposition parties are against the idea of the combat mission lasting beyond February 2009. The panel said the troops, based in the city of Kandahar, should stay longer, provided NATO sends reinforcements to southern Afghanistan to allow the Canadian contingent to focus on training the Afghan national army. "If these conditions are not met, the independent panel urges the government to notify Afghan and allied governments that Canada intends to transfer responsibility for security in Kandahar," the panel said in a statement. So far 77 Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan. Polls show most Canadians do not want the combat mission to last beyond early 2009.
