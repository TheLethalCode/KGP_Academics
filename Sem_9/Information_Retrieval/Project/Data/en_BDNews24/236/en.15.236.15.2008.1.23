<TITLE> Bush to sign defense bill addressing Iraq concern </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush plans to sign into law a bill authorizing a range of US military programs, now that Congress approved a provision he sought that would exempt Iraq from lawsuits dating to the regime of executed former President Saddam Hussein. Bush last month had vetoed an earlier version of the bill that had prompted complaints from the Iraq government. Baghdad objected to the legislation because it would have included Iraq in a provision enhancing the ability of U.S. citizens to sue state sponsors of terrorism for damages in US courts. The new bill, which was passed by the House last week and the Senate on Tuesday, waives that provision for Iraq. "The legislation addresses the concerns that were raised by the president when he vetoed the bill last month that would have caused great harm to Iraq and to our relationship with Iraq," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.
