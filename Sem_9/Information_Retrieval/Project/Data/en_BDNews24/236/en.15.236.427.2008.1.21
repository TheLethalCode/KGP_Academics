 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday resumed a hearing on the second case against four Dhaka University teachers and 15 students on charges of violating emergency rule during the August campus unrest. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate M Golam Rabbani is presiding over the case filed with Shahbagh Police Station. According to case details, the teachers had made inflammatory comments and burnt effigies on the DU campus during the August violence. Earlier in the day, another court cleared four Dhaka University teachers and 11 students of charges Monday in another case also charging them with emergency rules violation during the August rioting on the premises of the country's premier university. Metropolitan magistrate Md Habibur Rahman Siddiqui handed down the verdict on the case at 10:45am. The same verdict sentenced the four absconding students in the case to two years in prison and a Tk 1,000 fine each. They will have to serve another month in jail if they did not pay the fine. The acquitted teachers are Dhaka University Teachers Association president Professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary Professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean Professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman Professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. The students cleared by the court are Moniruzzaman Sardar Rubel, Rifat Hossain Ziku, Md Nazrul Hossain Russell, Md Shamsul Kabir Rahat, Mitul, Rokonuzzaman Talukdar, Tanzin Chowdhury Lilly, Arpana Pal, Shahnoor Nargis, Mohammad Kamruzzaman and Anwar. The students convicted of the charges are Saiful Islam Firoz, Hasan Mamun, AH Kamrul Islam Kochi and Aziz Hasan. Two separate courts indicted the teachers and the students on Dec 11 and Dec 12 of breaching emergency powers rules during days of Aug violence on Dhaka University premises. Defense counsels had argued that the process was illegal since separate cases could not be filed on the same charges. Sub-inspector Rezaul Karim Khan of Shahbagh Police Station filed the cases on Aug 23. The joint forces arrested Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid on the same night. Professor Sadrul Amin and Pro Nimchandra Bhowmik surrendered to court later. The chaos began when some army people beat a university student during a football match in the university. The melee that later spilled over onto the streets and elsewhere in the country continued for several days. bdnews24.
