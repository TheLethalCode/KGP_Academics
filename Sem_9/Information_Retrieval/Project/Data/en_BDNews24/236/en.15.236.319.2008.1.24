 Mexico City, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexican police said on Wednesday they have arrested a migrant smuggler accused of running over and killing a US border patrol agent in southern California last week. Police nabbed Jesus Navarro, convicted in the past for smuggling illegal migrants into the United States, in the town of El Yaqui in the state of Sonora.
