 Kathmandu, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepali drivers kept off the roads and employees walked to work in Kathmandu on Wednesday as protests against a hike in kerosene, cooking gas and diesel prices paralysed the capital for a second day. Student activists blocked many of the city's roads with burning logs and tyres, shouted slogans and clapped their hands. They complain that the price hike will hurt Nepal's poor. Similar protests were also organised in other major cities. The state-run Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC), which has a monopoly over oil imports, increased prices by up to 20 percent on Monday to cut its losses and attempt to minimise fuel shortages. It is the second price hike since October. "This is a conspiracy to force the people to take to the streets ahead of the constituent assembly elections," said Lekhnath Neupane, president of a student group that supports Nepal's former Maoist rebels. "The price rise must be rolled back until after the polls." Nepal will elect a constituent assembly on April 10. The assembly is expected to prepare a new constitution, formally declare an end to 240 years of monarchy, and also make the country's laws. Digambar Jha, chief of the NOC, said there was no alternative to the hike. The corporation needs to pay bills worth millions of dollars to India's state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the sole supplier of oil to Nepal. "We have no choice because the government is not giving us a grant and we have no funds to maintain the supply ahead of the elections," Jha told reporters. But consumer groups say the company must cut administrative costs and reduce the commission it pays to private retailers to give relief to Nepalis. Nepal buys about 800,000 tonnes of oil annually, accounting for about 10 percent of its energy needs. But it has faced shortages in recent months because of lack of money to pay for imports
