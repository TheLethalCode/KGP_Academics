<TITLE> India face selection dilemma for fourth Australia test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PERTH, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's thrilling 72-run win over Australia in the third test in Perth has left the tourists facing a tricky selection issue before the series finale in Adelaide. Paceman Irfan Pathan was called into the team at the expense of spinner Harbhajan Singh because of Perth's reputation for favouring seamers. Pathan had been left out of the first two tests but responded to his recall with a brilliant all-round performance, capturing five wickets and scoring 74 runs to win the man of the match award. However, the make-up for the team for Adelaide is still undecided because the traditionally flat pitch is better suited to spin, raising the likelihood that Harbhajan will return. India's other two seamers also performed strongly in Perth, troubling the Australians with their swing and are likely to hold their spots. Rudra Pratap Singh bagged six wickets while impressive teenager Ishant Sharma collected three, including the prize scalp of Ricky Ponting in both innings. Indian captain Anil Kumble, also a spinner, said he wanted to wait until he got to Adelaide before deciding on his bowling line-up. "It'll be a tough decision and we'll have to assess the conditions," he told a news conference. "I don't want to go with any fixed mindset so we'll assess the wicket in Adelaide and based on that we'll make the decision." EMERGING PLAYER Pathan hopes his performance in Perth will mark the rebirth of a career that promised so much but had faded in recent seasons. He made his test debut as a teenager against Australia in 2003 and was named as the ICC's emerging player of the year. He has been touted as India's next great all-rounder but has struggled to succeed with both bat and ball and failed to cement his place in the side. He did score his maiden test hundred against Pakistan last year but his failure with the ball cost him his place in the starting side for the first two tests in Australia. Now 23, Pathan believes he has learnt from his mistakes and his best years are still ahead of him. "If you take any cricketer, who plays the game for ten years, twelve years, then bad times are bound to happen. This is what happened to me and I lost my way," he told a news conference. "You have got to come out of it and that is when the character shows. The way I have handled myself in the last year, I have really worked very hard on my action and my game." Pathan says he still hopes to develop into a top-class all-rounder but his main focus now was to develop his bowling. "I need one or two years to become a good all-rounder but before that I need to cement my place as a bowler," he said. "I am not a fast bowler who bowls quick, I am a medium pace bowler who bowls in the right areas. "Forget about swing, forget about pace, I must do well for my side. "What is important for me is to do the job my captain requires of me and my team require of me.
