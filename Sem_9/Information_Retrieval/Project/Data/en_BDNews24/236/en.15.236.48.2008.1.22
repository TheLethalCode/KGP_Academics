<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Dhaka University rejected the verdict that sentenced three teachers to two years in jail Tuesday on charges of breaching emergency rule. The court, however, acquitted professor Nimchandra Bhowmick and 15 students of the same charges. The students brought out processions on the campus amid tight security to denounce the verdict. Under three banners, the students rallied briefly when they demanded that the government stop "playing a game" with the contentious issues. The students demanded withdrawal of all charges against the students and teachers. The first verdict came Monday in which the court acquitted the teachers and 11 students. Security officials put in place a huge security arrangement in and outside the campus to avoid any violence. A senior police official, who talked to a bdnews24.com correspondent on the scene, preferring not to be named, said they had ordered officials to stay alert. He said they were restricting entry of outsiders to the campus area and let the students and employees in after security checks. bdnews24.c
