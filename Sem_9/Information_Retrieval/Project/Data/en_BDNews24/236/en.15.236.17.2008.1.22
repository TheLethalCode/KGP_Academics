 Singapore, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil deepened losses to a new six-week low on Tuesday, as global stock markets swooned on the growing prospect of a US-led economic recession. London's Brent crude fell 58 cents to $86.93 a barrel by 0536 GMT, while US crude traded at $88.10 a barrel, down 59 cents from late Monday's dealing of $88.69. The NYMEX exchange did not set a settlement price on Monday as the open-outcry trading floor was shut for a public holiday. On Monday Asian and European bourses took a beating on mounting concerns that an economic stimulus proposal by US President George W Bush last week would not be enough to stave off a recession. That drubbing continued on Tuesday with Japan and South Korean markets falling more than 5 percent, Australia plunged 7 percent and Hong Kong by 8 percent. Most of the commodity complex also took a beating as traders feared weaker demand for raw materials across the globe. "The feeling now is the economic fall-out from the sub-prime issue in the United States might spread out to Japan, Europe," said Tobin Gorey, a commodities strategist at Australia's Commonwealth Bank. The negative sentiment that pervaded across financial markets was coupled with selling by traders who were raising cash to cover margin calls in equity markets, traders said. "The sell-off is not just on oil, it's weighing in on everything," Gorey added. Oil has now fallen about 12 percent from a record high of $100.09 hit on Jan. 3, making it increasingly less likely that OPEC would bow to US pressure to raise production when it meets in just over one week's time to discuss policy. On Monday US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman repeated a call for more oil from top exporter Saudi Arabia to try to bring down prices further, but ministers from Latin America said they saw no need to take action. Venezuela's Rafael Ramirez said on Monday he did not believe the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries needed to increase output, a view echoed by Galo Chiriboga from recent OPEC joiner Ecuador. There is already some evidence of weakening demand for refined fuels such as heating oil and gasoline due to milder winter weather and higher prices, leading some refiners in the United States, Europe and Northeast Asia to cut back output. "Due to lacklustre margins, there have been discretionary economic run cuts... In the meantime crude will have to ease for margins to be supported," said Societe Generale in a research note
