 MOSCOW, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The only opposition candidate registered to run in Russia's presidential election may quit the race because it is slanted in favour of Kremlin frontrunner Dmitry Medvedev, his party said on Wednesday. Opinion polls indicate Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov has little chance of winning the March 2 election but if he were to pull out it would create an awkward image problem for the Kremlin by making the contest look one-sided. "The reason is simple -- we do not want to find ourselves in a situation whereby our candidate would serve as window-dressing for an heir's accession to the throne," Ivan Melnikov, Zyuganov's campaign manger, said in a statement sent to Reuters. "The situation when all administrative tools and technologies are used in favour of the Kremlin's choice, this massive information campaign to publicise Dmitry Medvedev, may force us to consider this option," Melnikov said in a statement. Western governments have urged Russia to hold a fair election after observers said a parliamentary vote last year was skewed by Kremlin interference. Officials deny any bias and say they are committed to holding a free and fair election. Some analysts say Zyuganov, 63, is concerned that a weak showing in the presidential election could later leave him vulnerable to a challenge from rivals for the party leadership. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION Russian election chiefs have officially registered three candidates for the election: Medvedev, Zyuganov and nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. He avoids criticism of Putin and his party usually votes with Kremlin loyalists in parliament. Two others, ex-prime minister turned Putin critic Mikhail Kasyanov, and Andrei Bogdanov, the head of the tiny Democratic Party, are waiting to hear if their names will be on the ballot. Prosecutors this week opened a criminal investigation into Kasyanov's campaign, saying some of the signatures he submitted to back his bid were forged. He says the Kremlin is trying to sabotage his campaign. Medvedev, a 42-year-old ally of outgoing President Vladimir Putin, is expected to dominate the election. His campaign has been buoyed by an endorsement from the popular Putin, which makes his victory a near-certainty. An opinion poll published on Wednesday by pollster Levada gave Medvedev 82 percent, though other pollsters have been putting his support at around 60 percent. In the Levada poll, Zyuganov had 9 percent and Zhirinovsky 8 percent. A former party colleague of Zyuganov accused the Communist leader of using the threat of withdrawal from the race to extract guarantees from the Kremlin that he will be allowed to win enough votes to keep his job as party leader. "This is sheer blackmail," Ilya Ponomaryov, once a prominent Communist Party member who crossed over to join the pro-Putin Fair Russia party, told Reuters. Zyuganov lost out to late President Boris Yeltsin in the second round of a presidential election in 1996. He was soundly beaten by Putin four years later. He did not run against Putin in the last presidential vote, in 2004.
