 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) Redrawing constituencies and holding local government elections could derail the election roadmap, said participants at a discussion organised by The Hunger Project Tuesday Speakers at the event said the Election Commission should not deviate from the stated schedule for national elections by December 2008. A point highlighted in the discussion was the possibility that the EC's move to redraw parliamentary constituencies could result in a flood of writ petitions at the High Court, possibly resulting in a delayed election. Concerns were also raised over the government's decision to hold local government elections; some felt this could provide certain parties with an advantage at the grassroots level. "A non-elected government ... can in no way benefit the people," The Hunger Project country director Badiul Alam Majumder said. Badiul said the EC was under a "constitutional obligation" to restore the constituencies to their former status. The country director added that the caretaker government and the EC should hold the local government elections ahead of the national polls. Jatiya Party presidium member GM Quader agreed that the EC should hold the general elections in line with its roadmap. Representatives from Awami League and left-leaning parties, however, opposed local government elections prior to the national polls. "Holding local government elections ahead of the national polls may be an attempt to install an extra-constitutional government in the country," said Abdur Razzaq, former Awami League MP for Tangail. AL lawmaker Faruk Khan feared writ petitions could be filed against the EC for redrawing the constituencies, which could delay the election roadmap. "The only responsibility the caretaker government has is to hold the national polls, not the local government elections," said Khan. Haider Akbar Khan Rono from the Workers Party said: "Redrawing constituencies is a constitutional right of the EC, not a constitutional obligation." "National elections can be held without demarcation. In 1984, Ershad tried to create a political base by holding local government polls," added Haider. bdnews
