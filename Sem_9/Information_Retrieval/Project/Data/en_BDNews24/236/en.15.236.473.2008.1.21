<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will not sit with the government if it is set conditions for talks, acting party president Zillur Rahman said Monday. "We don't want to hold dialogue if terms and conditions are attached with it. We want something open and free," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home after he received donations to the party's relief funds. He demanded the government fast-track the plan for talks with political parties. "If the dialogue process is delayed, doubt will cloud the elections," Zillur said. Zillur criticised the government for not freeing Dhaka University teachers and students "unconditionally". He alleged that the court verdicts that came after the separation of judiciary from the executive reflected that they had been "influenced by the government". "Such influence has created questions about the freedom of the judiciary," he said. Replying to a query, Zillur said: "We are waiting for the invitation to the promised dialogue. But we don't see any progress on the government's side." He however said he was hopeful that the government would hold the dialogue as "two top men" in the government were keen on it. Zillur demanded that the government take quick steps to handle the crisis in the garment sector, the movement by students and teachers, journalists' demand for better wages and the crisis of fertiliser. "We didn't want the government to deal with the things other than the elections. Then again, we would like the government to continue handling the issues since it has already been involved," he said. bdnews
