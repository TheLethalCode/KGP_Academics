<TITLE> New UN sanctions won't solve Iran atom row-official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Iranian official said on Monday a meeting of world powers this week would not help defuse Iran's nuclear row with the West if they continue to push for a new sanctions resolution on Iran, even a weak one. But Ali Aghamohammadi, a representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on a powerful arbitration body, said that the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany can have a constructive meeting if they try to find a new way of interacting with Tehran. Foreign ministers from the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany meet in Berlin on Tuesday to discuss a possible third UN sanctions resolution against Iran for refusing to halt sensitive nuclear work. Russia and China, commercial partners with Iran and long wary of ratcheting up pressure, have been more reluctant to impose further penalties since a US intelligence report in December said Iran halted a nuclear weapons programme in 2003. Some Western diplomats say any fresh resolution may be less harsh than what was in prospect before the report. "If they can find a way to turn the page, then things should be fine," Aghamohammadi, Khamenei's representative on the Expediency Council, a body which mediates between parliament and a watchdog body that must approve laws. "If they want to continue their trend to push for another resolution, even a very weak one, I don't think it can solve anything," he told Reuters in an interview in Tehran. "If they can find a way to turn the page, then things should be fine," he added, without outlining what specific change he wanted the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany to take in Berlin. SANCTIONS WON'T WORK Tehran has repeatedly said two rounds of sanctions will not force it to halt work it insists is only for peaceful purposes. Iran, the world's fourth largest oil producer, says it wants to build a network of atomic power plants. Aghamohammadi, a former senior nuclear negotiator, said sanctions were being used in a "dangerous and inappropriate" way against Iran adding that this would undermine the credibility of the tool when the international community used it in future. Economists say UN and US sanctions, which have included targeting several Iranian state banks, have hurt business by deterring foreign investors and raising costs for Iranian importers. But they said that Iran's petrodollar windfall is providing a cushion. Asked whether sanctions and other pressure would change Iran's course, Aghamohammadi said: "It will take 200 years at least. Then there will be no United States as it is now, just as we don't have a British empire now." He dismissed the possibility of a US or Israeli attack, a prospect analysts say has diminished since the US National Intelligence Estimate report. Washington has said force is still on the table and some analysts say Israel could mount a pre-emptive strike if it felt threatened. "It's not important if we are worried or concerned. We don't want an attack on Iran but we are not going to commit suicide because someone has the power to attack us," he said. Although he and other officials have dismissed US threats of military action, some analysts say Iran may have helped quell violence in Iraq in recent months in part because of concerns that the nuclear row could escalate. But Aghamohammadi denied Iran had made concessions in Iraq in several rounds of talks between the Iranian and US officials in Baghdad. He said Iraq was quieter because the US administration had handed more authority to Iraq's government. "We think that Americans ... understand they can only reach a solution (in Iraq) if they cooperate with Iran," he sa
