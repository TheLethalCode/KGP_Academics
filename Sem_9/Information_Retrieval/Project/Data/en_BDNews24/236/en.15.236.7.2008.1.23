 FRANKFURT, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday, wiping out some of the previous session's gains sparked by a big cut in US interest rates, as worries over earnings and more bad debt write downs at banks took hold. Economic data showing that euro zone services sector growth slipped more than expected in January while manufacturing activity steadied at subdued levels also depressed sentiment. French bank Societe Generale, down 3 percent, was among leading blue-chip decliners in Europe. Lehman Brothers said in a research note it remained "cautious" on the SocGen stock, which it rates "underweight", due to write-downs. Going in the opposite direction, Swiss Re rose 8.5 percent. The company said it would increase its buyback programme after signing a reinsurance contract with US investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which also bought 3 percent of Swiss Re's shares. At 1015 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,299,65 points, having opened clearly higher and later taken a roller-coaster ride in an unusually wide range: from 1,285.07 to 1,324.77 points. "There's some nervousness out in the market because although we had the rate cut in the United States, which was a positive start to trying to put things on hold, people think the credit crunch isn't over," said Mark Foulds, a trader at Tradindex. "The fact the market has come off this morning shows us that there is still a lot of downbeat news to come and that there's a lot of negativity out there," he added. Insurance was the best performing sector, 1.9 percent higher on the DJ Stoxx index. BANKS GAIN AFTER FED MOVE Among banks, which many analysts see as among the leading beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve's 75-basis-point key rate cut on Tuesday, HSBC rose 3.2 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland gained 2.3 percent. Among losers, German chipmaker Infineon fell 5.9 percent after its subsidiary Qimonda almost doubled its operating loss last quarter. Shares in Swiss luxury goods group Richemont fell 5.1 percent after the company narrowly missed market forecasts with an 8 percent rise in third-quarter sales. "The uncertainty about corporate earnings growth in 2008 has risen, not only in the financial sector but also elsewhere. The markets are expecting a flood of profit warnings in the next few months," said Matthias Schellenberg, managing director at ING Investment Management. The RBS/NTC Flash Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers Index fell to 52.0 in January from 53.1 in December, its lowest since August 2003 and well below economists' forecasts of 52.8. The survey also found that the equivalent factory PMI remained at the same level as December's 52.6, considerably above forecasts of a drop to 52.0. "The PMI report confirms that the pace of slowing in the economy is larger than that embedded in the ECB's (European Central Bank) staff forecasts. With further declines in the composite PMI on the cards in the coming months, the pressure on the ECB to ease will continue rising," said Jacques Caillous, head of euro area economics at RBS, which compiled the survey. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told the European Parliament on Wednesday that it was the responsibility of the central bank "to solidly anchor inflation expectations to avoid additional volatility in already highly volatile markets." "Also important is for the central bank to ensure an orderly functioning of the money markets at the level of interest rates required for anchoring the inflation expectations," he said. Around Europe, Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 0.2 percent, the German DAX was down 1 percent and the French CAC 40 lost 0.4 perce
