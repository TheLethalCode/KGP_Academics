<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) - The Prime Bank has changed its previous position by agreeing now in principle to sponsor football, especially the B. League and the National Football League. "We had a successful meeting with them Monday and they have assured us of sponsoring the B. League and the National Football League," Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) acting president Monir Ahmed told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "But, we have to wait for a few days as they need to approve it in a board meeting," said Ahmed. On Jan 15, the Prime Bank officially refused to sponsor football this year due to their involvement in other sports after the National Sports Council and the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) had taken initiatives by asking different banks to come forward to help the sports federations. Many believed the Prime Bank, which was associated with the BFF, retreated after the federation placed a huge budget of 9.5 crore for 21 events in a calendar year. Afterwards, the BOA took another initiative to re-establish the ties between the bank and the football federation and the talk took place Monday. "It was a misunderstanding between us. They thought they would have to sponsor all events we had offered in our proposal. But this time we have offered them to sponsor two major events this year and they have agreed in principle," said Ahmed. Ahmed said they demanded Tk one crore for the sponsorship right of the B. League as the federation will have to patronise the participating teams. The inter-club footballers' transfers for the B. League are likely to start in February and the league may roll into the field in March. The BFF boss also said they have also demanded another one crore taka for the National Football League.
