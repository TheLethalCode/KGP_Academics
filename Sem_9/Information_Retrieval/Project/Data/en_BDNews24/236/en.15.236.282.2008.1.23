 ADELAIDE, Jan 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia remain undecided about the makeup of their bowlers for the fourth and final test against India starting at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he was stuck between retaining the same all-pace attack that lost last week's third test in Perth or ditching express fast bowler Shaun Tait for spinner Brad Hogg. "We've got a few things we want to run through our heads about our makeup and about that wicket," Ponting told a news conference on Wednesday. "The wicket is normally pretty good to bat on here, it looks like it will be that way it's actually quite dry at the moment. "We've just got to toss up in our head whether a spin option is the way to go or if we try to use pace with variable bounce later in the game." The Adelaide Oval is traditionally regarded as one of Australia's most spin-friendly pitches but Ponting said that did not necessarily favour Hogg. Tait is based in Adelaide so knows the pitch well and his extreme pace makes him lethal to bat against on the last day when the wicket starts to play low. "Historically spin has been the preferred option for the Australian team to play in most conditions around the world," Ponting said. "But when you've got a wicket taker like that (Tait) in the wings it gives you lots of options but it makes your decision pretty difficult as well.
