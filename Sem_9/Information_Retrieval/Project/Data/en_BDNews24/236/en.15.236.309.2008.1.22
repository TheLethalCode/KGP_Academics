<TITLE> Couriered parcels are illicit: Akbar Ali </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) -- The Regulatory Reforms Commission said Tuesday there is no legal basis for conducting postal services through couriers in Bangladesh. According to the Post Office Act 1898, a courier service can be fined up to Tk 500 for each letter or document it delivers. After years of legal confusion in the sector the antiquated legislation governing the postal services is set to be modernised. Courier services have seen their businesses flourish, as government-run post offices teeter on the verge of collapse. Finally, chairman of the RRC and former finance adviser to the caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan has initiated an update to the age-old Post Office Act. "We are proposing to remove the barriers courier service providers face under existing laws," Akbar told reporters after a RRC board meeting. "The laws in this regard are full of inconsistencies. The government receives taxes from courier services even though the law does not allow the business." "We will send a proposal to the chief adviser's office in a week," added Akbar. Businessmen started to take advantage of poor standards in the government-run postal services in the 1980s. They quickly captured the market through vastly improved services for their clients. In addition to revising the postal law, the RRC is recommending land registration and records are brought under the land ministry to facilitate foreign investment. The move will empower banks to send investment proposals directly to the Bangladesh Bank, rather than the Board of Investment. Currently recording land is done by the land ministry, while registration is done by the law ministry. The caretaker government formed the RRC in October last year to identify the regulatory problems faced by businesses. It is scheduled to cease operating after a year. bd
