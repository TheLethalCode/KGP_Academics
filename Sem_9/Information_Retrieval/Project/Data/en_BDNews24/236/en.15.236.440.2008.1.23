 GAZA, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian gunmen blew up a section of the border wall between the Gaza Strip and Egypt on Wednesday, witnesses said. Residents of the southern Gaza town of Rafah said a series of explosions created large holes in the concrete wall that separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt. More than a thousand Palestinians crossed freely into Egypt without facing interference from Egyptian policemen, the Rafah residents said. On Tuesday, scores of Palestinian protestors clashed with Egyptian policemen in an attempt to force their way into Egypt. Residents said members of Hamas and the Popular Resistance Committees were among the gunmen who blew up the border wall. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri denied that Hamas was involved, but said: "It was impossible to prevent the bombing of the border" which reflected the huge pressures on Palestinians under closure in Gaza. Israel closed its border crossings with Gaza last week in what it said was a bid to make Palestinian militants stop firing rockets into southern Israel. The Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has been largely sealed off since the Islamist group seized the territory in a brief civil war in June.
