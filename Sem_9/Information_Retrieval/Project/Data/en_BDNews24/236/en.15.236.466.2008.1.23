<TITLE> ADB seeks to redefine itself amid donor disquiet </TITLE>

 Manila, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank is seeking to re-define its role as a lender in the world's fastest growing region but disquiet about governance among western donor nations risks overshadowing the revamp. The agency's commitment to tackling poverty in Asian countries struggling to catch up with faster paced neighbours is also being questioned. Rajat Nag, the ADB's managing director general, told Reuters that a new long-term strategy, set to be unveiled at the end of March, addressed the donor country concerns. "My reading of what our shareholders are asking is not a new generation of reform. What they are saying is consolidate the reforms, get more focus, be more precise in what you are delivering," Nag said in an interview at the bank's HQ in Manila. The ADB, set up in 1966 to alleviate poverty in Asia, has long faced criticism that it is too bureaucratic, too consensus-driven and too slow to react. But the chorus of disapproval has gathered steam over the past 12 months amid concerns the ADB is overly focused on large loans to countries such as India and China, which could tap their own funds or capital markets. In a September letter to ADB president Haruhiko Kuroda, Britain's minister for international development said the UK had decided not to make a supplementary contribution to the bank's lending fund for poorest nations due to the slow pace of reform. "In our view the bank has fallen short of its own expectations and there had been a lack of meaningful corrective action by senior management," Shahid Malik wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters. POVERTY ALLEVIATION Nag, a 21-year veteran of the bank, said the ADB's previous overly broad focus had stymied attempts to cut back on internal bureaucracy and evaluate projects more closely. "Our reform agenda has delivered a lot but also has a long way to go," said the India-born economist. The new long-term strategy seeks to make the ADB more focused on areas such as the environment, the region's financial sector and, of course, infrastructure projects. The ADB's lending has nearly doubled from 2005 to more than $10 billion last year and more than 50 percent of that figure is poured into large-scale infrastructure projects. Non-government organisations (NGO) and some staff are concerned that the ADB is acting more like a bank than a development agency. "They are securing their money, not securing the development of the region," said Hemantha Withanage, executive director of the NGO Forum on ADB. ADB management say its expertise is in infrastructure projects and points to the region's stellar economic progress. "I think everybody agrees, including our shareholders from the West, that ADB has a success story to tell," said Nag. HEAVY HANDED Representatives of Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland and Nordic countries wrote to the ADB's president in November about governance and more generally there is concern that the bank's personnel policies are opaque and sometimes unfair. US executive director Curtis Chin boycotted a board meeting last year over the ADB's failure to recruit externally qualified candidates or to promote more women and told the board: "Management has used a heavy handed, and sometimes deeply flawed, approach to its human resources responsibility," according to a copy of his statement seen by Reuters. About 10 percent of the bank's 850 international staff resigned last year, with some blaming difficult promotions, a depreciating US dollar and general disillusionment. Nag said the number was "not out of line" given higher taxes for some, the falling dollar and demand for financial skills. "We do see the difference that the bank can make," said one senior employee, who declined to be named. "The tragedy is that while they are debating how to get a new set of priorities for the years ahead, they are, as we speak, undermining the ability of the organisation to fulfill its current mandate, let alone an expanded, different one for the future
