 NAIROBI, Mon Jan 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Kenyan government condemned as `sabotage' on Monday a plan by the opposition to widen its protests against President Mwai Kibaki's re-election to a boycott of companies linked to his allies. And in an increasingly militant reaction to criticism from abroad, Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula summoned Britain's High Commissioner Adam Wood to express displeasure at criticism of Kenya's December 27 election made in Britain's parliament. "Our elections don't need a stamp of authority from the House of Commons," Wetangula told reporters in the latest salvo by the government against Western powers doubting the vote. The British mission confirmed the meeting on Monday with Wood, but would not comment further. After a bloody weekend that added to the death toll of around 650 since the vote, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has vowed to continue street rallies from Thursday and also called for economic protests. "Sabotage of companies (is) illegal and an insult to Kenyans," the government said in a statement, adding that political leaders would be held accountable for any damage. In the latest violence, three people were hacked to death in ethnic fighting in a Nairobi slum on Sunday, and local media said another five died in the volatile Rift Valley on Monday. Some 250,000 people have also been displaced in a nation more used to receiving refugees from war-torn neighbors like Sudan and Somalia. The crisis has damaged one of Africa's most promising economies, cut off supplies to neighbors, and tainted Kibaki's reputation as the man who democratized Kenya after the 24-year rule of President Daniel arap Moi. In jittery Kenyan markets, the shilling currency hit a 10-month low against the US dollar on Monday. ECONOMIC PRESSURE The opposition, led by former Kibaki minister and one-time political prisoner Raila Odinga, calculates increased pressure on the president will undermine his hold on power after a vote that most foreign and local observers agree was flawed. It has urged supporters to shun companies owned by Kibaki allies, including Equity Bank, Brookside Dairies and bus companies CityHoppa and Kenya Bus. The boycott call may be more symbolic than real, however, given that many of Kenya's poor use Equity because of its accessibility and low charges, while commuters in long queues may not want to wait even longer by shunning certain buses. Odinga was due later on Monday in the western towns of Kakamega and Kisumu, both opposition strongholds, for funeral services for supporters killed in protests against Kibaki. Residents in Kisumu promised a rapturous welcome for Odinga, whom they call the "People's President", on his first visit to the unofficial opposition capital since the vote. The city has been devastated by riots and protests. "This will be both a funeral service for those shot by the police as well as a homecoming for our President Raila Odinga," said hotel worker Wycliffe Orwa, 26. In the latest international mediation attempt, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan was due to fly into Kenya to start talks with both sides on Tuesday. Diplomats hope he can bring Kibaki and Odinga into some sort of power-sharing arrangement, possibly before a fresh vote in the east African nation. Kenyans, however, are skeptical of such a solution. "It seems every time we vote, we bring a bloodbath upon ourselves," said a Nairobi housewife, Joy, who asked for her surname not to be used. "Why would we want another electio
