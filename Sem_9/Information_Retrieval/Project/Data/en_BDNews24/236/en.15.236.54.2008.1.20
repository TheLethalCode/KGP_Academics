 MUMBAI, India, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is certain of moving up to second spot in the test championship table following their remarkable victory over top-ranked Australia in the third test in Perth on Saturday. An International Cricket Council (ICC) statement on Sunday said India would move ahead of second-placed Sri Lanka regardless of the outcome of the final test in Adelaide next week. India will move two ratings points ahead of Sri Lanka if the final test ends in a draw and by four points if they manage to square the four-test series which they trail 2-1. "Even if Australia wins the match in Adelaide, India will sit above Sri Lanka when ratings points are calculated beyond the decimal point," the statement said. The table is updated at the conclusion of each series. India's 72-run victory brought Australia's world record-equalling 16-match winning run to a stunning end. It was Australia's first test defeat since the fourth Ashes match against England at Trent Bridge in Aug. 2005. The last time Australia lost a test at home was against India at Adelaide in Dec. 2003
