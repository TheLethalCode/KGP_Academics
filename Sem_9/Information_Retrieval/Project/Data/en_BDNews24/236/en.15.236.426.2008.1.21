 Paris, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said on Sunday he was "open for dialogue" with rebels holding scores of hostages in the jungle, after an offer by the Catholic Church to help create a safe haven for talks. He was speaking in Paris after meeting relatives of French-Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt at the start of a tour to discuss European efforts to release the prisoners. Betancourt, a former Colombian presidential candidate who has been held since 2002, is among dozens of hostages in the hands of Marxist rebels the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. After meeting Betancourt's son Lorenzo and ex-husband Fabrice Delloye at the Colombian embassy in Paris, Uribe said he was ready to hold a dialogue with FARC under a framework proposed by the Church with the support of European envoys. "We are open for dialogue in the same way as we have been strict in fighting terrorism," he told journalists. "We fight terror acts and are open for dialogue to give our country a permanent solution." Colombia's neighbour Venezuela this month brokered the release of two female captives who had been held for more than five years in jungle camps by rebels. That release has fuelled hopes that scores of other hostages could be freed. Uribe is due to meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday before visiting Belgium, Spain and Switzerland. The Colombian president has authorised France, Spain and Switzerland to revive efforts to seek an accord with rebels on releasing scores of hostages, including Betancourt. The three European countries had sought previously to broker an agreement between Uribe's government and the FARC on freeing prisoners held in Latin America's oldest rebel insurgency. "A few months ago, we suspended the facilitation efforts by delegates from Switzerland, Spain and France, but two nights ago we reactivated it," Uribe said on Saturday before leaving for Europe.
