 Kathmandu, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's ailing 83-year-old Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was "stable" on Tuesday after complaining of breathing problems on the weekend, his doctors said. "A regular check-up on Tuesday morning showed that the prime minister is in stable condition and is improving," doctor Man Bahadur K.C. said in a statement. "The prime minister is feeling easy, took his breakfast and has been advised to take a few days' rest," the doctor said. In July 2006, Koirala was admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu for treatment for pneumonia. The veteran politician has been in poor health ever since and has been carrying out most of his work from his residence and avoiding many public engagements. Koirala's health has remained a concern in Nepal ahead of watershed elections on April 10 for a special assembly to map the country's political future. Koirala, a consensus choice of seven political parties, including the former Maoist rebels, also underwent prostate surgery in Bangkok in June 2006. Koirala, serving his sixth term as premier, signed a landmark peace deal with former Maoist rebel chief Prachanda in 2006. The pact ended the decade-long insurgency in which more than 13,000 people were killed.
