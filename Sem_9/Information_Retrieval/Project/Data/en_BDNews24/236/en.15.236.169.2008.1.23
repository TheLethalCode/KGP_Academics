 LONDON, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Persistent worries about a US recession undid the boost that Tuesday's surprise US interest rate cut gave to global markets, sending European stocks lower on Wednesday and setting the scene for a fall on Wall Street. Safe-haven government bonds and the yen, which tends to rise as investors pare risky trades, gained ground, while commodities including oil sagged on nagging fears that demand will be hurt by slower global growth. "The recovery in risk appetite after the Fed cut was only temporary," said Niels From, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. "After digesting the news, markets have come to the conclusion that it will not resolve problems in the US economy and this is weighing on the carry trade, supporting funding currencies like the yen." The Federal Reserve on Tuesday slashed its key federal funds rate by 75 basis points -- the largest cut in more than 23 years -- to 3.50 percent a week ahead of its scheduled meeting, underscoring the risks facing the US economy. Investors believe a lot more needs to be done by the Fed to shore up the US economy, which some see on the brink of recession, hit by a slumping housing market and tight credit conditions. Markets have priced in a further 50 basis point rate cut at next week's Fed meeting. After rising as much as 1.6 percent, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares reversed direction to be down 1.7 percent with Germany's DAX falling 2.7 percent. Worries about profits and bad debt write downs were taking a toll on banks such as Societe Generale. London's FTSE lost 1.5 percent in choppy trade after data showed Britain's economy grew slightly faster than expected in the final quarter of 2007. This followed a 2 percent rebound for Japan's benchmark Nikkei and a 4.5 percent rally for MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets. Commodities looked vulnerable with copper down slightly on the London Metal Exchange, while U.S. crude fell about $1 to $88.24 a barrel. "The Fed's move implied that the problems in the system are much worse than we expected," said Eugen Weinberg at Commerzbank in Germany. The MSCI world equity index wiped out almost all of the gains made earlier to be flat. It was still off a near 15-month trough plumbed a day earlier and down nearly 13 percent this year. Suggesting a weak opening for Wall Street, U.S. stock futures were all lower. BONDS, YEN UP Underlying worries about the global economy kept a bid tone for Euro zone government bonds. The March Bund futures advanced 88 ticks to 116.95. The 10-year Bund yield slipped to 3.91 percent, while the benchmark U.S 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.40 percent, after earlier dipping below 3.4 percent for the first time since mid-2003. In the currency market, the dollar shed 0.6 percent against the yen to 105.78 on the day, while the euro slid 1 percent to 154.24 yen. The euro fell 0.3 percent versus the dollar to $1.4582. Earlier, data showed Euro zone services growth slumped significantly to below forecasts to a rate not seen in over 4 years this month, adding to the case for an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank, some analysts say. But ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told legislators the ECB needed to stay focussed on fighting inflation in the face of a very significant market correcti
