 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) - Ansar & VDP Tuesday moved into the final of the Parachute Women's Open Cricket Tournament handing a 21-run defeat to Abahani Limited at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. After being put in to bat first, Ansar & VDP made a modest 125 for nine in 9 overs with Panna and Ayesha scoring identical 25. Shirin (3/31) and Reshma (2/21) shared five wickets to restrict the opponents to a poor total. But, it was enough for Ansar and VDP to defend the total as Chameli (3/12) and Shamima (2/21) wrecked the Abahani innings. Abahani's Lily topscored with 17 followed by Yasmin on 15. Ansar & VDP will play the final Friday against the winners between Abahani and Ispahani Sporting Club.
