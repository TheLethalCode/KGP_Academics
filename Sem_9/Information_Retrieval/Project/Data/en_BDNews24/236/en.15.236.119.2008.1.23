 CAIRO, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian security men detained at least 30 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in dawn raids on Wednesday, accusing them of illegally organising protests against the Israeli blockade of Gaza, security sources said. The arrests were the latest escalation in a crackdown on Egypt's most powerful opposition group and followed the detention of 37 Brotherhood members over the past two days in the northern port city of Alexandria. Security men rounded up the men in raids on their homes in northern Egypt. Those held include the secretary general of the Cairo doctors' syndicate, Saad Zaghloul, security sources said.

The European Union and international agencies have called the closure a collective punishment of Gaza's 1.5 million people. The Muslim Brotherhood, a non-violent group that the Egyptian government considers an illegal organisation, says Egypt should unilaterally open the border with Gaza.

Some 350 members of the group are currently in detenti
