 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  The police Sunday sealed six floors of the 14-storey Janakantha Bhaban in twin income-tax dodge cases. Ramna police chief Daulat Akbar told bdnews24.com that they started the operation on the building at 11am under the supervision of a magistrate. The move came 11 days after a Dhaka court ordered attachment of moveable and immoveable property of Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar and its real estate company Globe Construction. It was not immediately clear if the court order applies to once-popular Bangla-language newspaper Janakantha, housed in the same building. But the newspaper's executive editor Borhan Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "We will continue our publications." "We have decided to do so in consultation with the authorities," Ahmed said. "The police came and checked documents of the newspaper," Ahmed had earlier said. Daulat Akbar said the court would decide Monday on whether to seal the newspaper office. "We need a clarification from the court on the daily Janakantha," he said. bdnews24.com photographer Mustafiz Mamun saw Ramna police sub-inspector Masudur Rahman seal Globe Construction on the eighth floor of the building on New Eskaton Road. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque issued the attachment order on Jan 9 against Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar and Globe Construction. The Group's managing director Atiqullah Khan Masud is behind bars. His wife Shamima A Khan, their sons Mishal Atiqullah Khan and Jishal Atiqullah Khan, and chartered accountants of the companies are facing arrest warrants in connection with the cases filed by the National Board of Revenue on Jan 6. The attached property is owned by Shamima and her two sons, who are evading arrest, according to the police. Globe Janakantha Shilpa Paribar started its journey in early 1969 when its founder Atiqullah Khan Masud was a college student, according to the company's website. The industrial organisation consists of seven companies. bdnew
