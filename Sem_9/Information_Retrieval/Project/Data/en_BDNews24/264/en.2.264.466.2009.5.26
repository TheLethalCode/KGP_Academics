 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)The admission to colleges will be based, as before, on the basis of GPA scores in the SSC exams, the education minister said on Tuesday. Second shifts will be introduced in colleges along with enhancement of seats to resolve admission crisis, Nurul Islam Nahid said at a press conference at the education ministry on the occasion of publication of SSC and equivalent test results. The present admission guidelines say in case the two students have same grading, the elder one will lose out. This policy has been widely criticised. The minister said, "We will consider all criticism with equal importance." Students with good results did not get admission in colleges due to crisis of seats in past years. Ten education board have GPA-5 63,307 achievers, of which 45,934 are in the SSC. But many GPA-5 achievers fear they may not get admitted into the colleges of their choice. "The admission issue is truly a big problem. We have already conferred with college principals about how to enhance seats." "We will again sit with them. If needed, we will operate double shift and enhance seats in colleges," Nahid said. English factor Madrasa board had highest pass rate of 85.85 percent this year among the ten educations boards. It also had the highest pass rate of 82.06 percent last year. Asked about the reason, the minister said it was because madrasa students read less in English. "Madrasa students sit test for only 100 marks in English, but in SCC the test entails 200 marks." "So, madrasa teachers are doing well." Two-hundred marks, instead of 100, have to be made compulsory for madrasa from next year. It will help reduce disparity." All students of a maximum of 2327 Madrasa passed the tests this year. b
