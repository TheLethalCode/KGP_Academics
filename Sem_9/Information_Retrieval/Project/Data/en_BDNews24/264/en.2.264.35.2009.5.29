 ROME, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Serie A (all on Sunday at 1300 GMT): Juventus president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli has said he is willing to sell French striker David Trezeguet ahead of the Turin side's final Serie A match of the season at home to Lazio on Sunday. "Trezeguet is a great champion. We'll see if interesting opportunities arise for him on the transfer market that are favourable for us," Gigli was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport. Both sides only have pride at stake in Turin as second-placed Juve are sure of a berth in next season's Champions League group stage and mid-table Lazio qualified for the Europa League by winning the Italian Cup. However, the result may have a bearing on the battle for Italy's third automatic Champions League slot, which AC Milan will claim even with a defeat by one goal at Fiorentina if Juve win or draw. Milan's Massimo Ambrosini is suspended for the visit to Florence, when a draw will be enough to ensure the third-placed team do not have to face a Champions League qualifier, while fellow midfielder David Beckham is a doubt with an ankle knock. The match will be captain Paolo Maldini's swansong before retirement and it may also be the last game at Milan for coach Carlo Ancelotti, who has been linked to Chelsea. Milan director Leonardo is favourite to take over in the dugout if Ancelotti goes, Italian media say. Alberto Gilardino is confident fourth-placed Fiorentina can claim the victory by two goals that would ensure them a direct place in the Champions League regardless of what Juventus do. "I believe we can pull it off because of our desire, the drive we have and the overwhelming boost of the home crowd," the former Milan forward said. Fiorentina defender Dario Dainelli and midfielder Felipe Melo are suspended. Relegation-threatened Torino visit Roma without seven suspended players, including five who were given bans of between two and four matches for being involved in a brawl at the end of last week's 3-2 defeat by Genoa. Bologna are level with Torino with 34 points but victory at home against Catania will keep them up as they have a better record in the head-to-heads with Torino. Torino will stay up by bettering Bologna's result if their rivals for survival draw or lose. Champions Inter Milan welcome Atalanta to the San Siro in what could be Luis Figo's last competitive game, as the Portuguese midfielder may be about to hang up his boots
