 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The first phase of voter list updating starts from June 15 in 153 upazilas of the country. "The work of updating and publishing draft voter list will be done in four phases within December 31," said Brig Gen Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury, director of the voter list and national ID project, at the Election Commission on Wednesday. Those who came of voting age after Jan 1 this year, those who were left out in the previous list and those who will correct their names and change addresses will come under the updating project, said the director. Updating in Dhaka City Corporation may start from Sept 15, he said, adding that the city corporations would begin in the fourth phase. The second phase will start from July 15, and the third phase from Aug 15. One hundred and sixty one upazilas and 17 surrounding unions of Dhaka will be done in the second phase and 167 upazilas will be done in the third phase. The complete update will take four and a half months adding two to three percent new voters to the existing voter list of 8.10 crore, said Chowdhury. The work of the first phase is expected to be completed within 45 days. Data collectors will go to every house from June 15 to 24 and the data will be verified from June 16 to 25. Voter registration will go on at the server stations at every union and municipality from July 1 to 25. Those who will be left during the process will be registered from July 26 to 27. The work of updating addresses will go on from July 28 to 31. "It won't be possible to provide national ID cards as soon as one is included in the list. They will be delivered," he said. A control cell will be opened at the project office at Agargaon for regular monitoring of the updating work. The phone numbers of the cell are: 9116971, 01730020513, 01730020515.
