<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Football Kheloyar Kalyan Samiti is strongly considering taking to the streets to protest the Bangladesh Cricket Board's intention to hold 2011 World Cup matches at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The then BNP-led four-party alliance government ended the dispute over venues of country's two premium sports football and cricket after allotting the Bangabandhu National Stadium to football and Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium to cricket, but the old dispute has resurfaced again over selection of the BNS for World Cup matches. The government has assured that BNS will only host the opening ceremony of the cricket extravaganza while the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and Narayanganj Osmani Stadium will be used to staging the eight matches allotted for co-hosts Bangladesh. "It is not possible (to host World Cup matches at the BNS). The cricket board has made such an unrealistic demand at a time when football is being revived and it is not acceptable anyway, and we will launch a movement if it is needed," said Bangladesh former captain Alfaz Ahmed. "Where will football go if all stadiums are being used for cricket?" "It is not appreciable to all that there will be no football for two years for hosting the Cricket World Cup and country's conscious people must realise it," said Iqbal Hossain, the president of the Football Kheloyar Kalyan Samiti. Iqbal also hinted that they would go for a movement if the government took a decision against football. "Many are trying to fish in troubled waters and we hope the sports-friendly government will realise it," said Arif Khan Joy, the general secretary of the Kalyan Samiti. Joy also said that they had already discussed the matter and were observing the situation. bdnew
