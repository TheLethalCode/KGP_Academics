 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary probe body has found that chief whip Abdus Shahid, other ex-whips and MPs sifted money from a parliamentary fund, and all of them for 'overseas treatment', said the probe's chief on Thursday. The sub-committee, constituted by a committee investigating former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar's alleged corruption, found out that MPs including former chief and opposition whips had taken money from the MP Club's fund and all of them for alleged heart treatment. Former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the ex-officio head of the club, took the highest amount of Tk 18 lakh over five years, according to the sub-committee chief Shajahan Khan. Delwar, the BNP secretary general, is in hospital now. Delwar's secretary Syed Wahidul Alam, also a BNP whip in the eighth parliament, took Tk 4 lakh. Abdus Shahid, former opposition chief whip in the 8th parliament, took Tk 1 lakh for treatment in Bangkok, said Khan. "The former chief whip drew Tk 18 lakh for his overseas heart treatment from the MP Club's fund. Whip Wahidul Alam got Tk 4 lakh for a similar purpose," Shajahan Khan told reporters after a meeting of the sub-committee in parliament. Khan, however, did not say whether the funds were withdrawn illegally. Shahid said he had taken the money in a fair manner but termed withdrawal of funds by others "unfair". "I applied for the money from the welfare fund for my heart treatment in Bangkok. Many other MPs got support from the fund. I did too," Shahid told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "The amount I received is fair. But is it fair to receive an total of Tk 18 lakh," he said. "The club earned over Tk 64 lakh and entire amount was spent," Mujibul Haq Channu, a member of the sub-committee, told bdnews24.com. "And all of them had heart ailments!" he said. Khan said the money was also given out to the club members and parliament staff of their choice for treatment. The MP Club, formed for five years, earns money by charging for the use of parliament's lunch and dinner hall adjacent to the parliament building. The annual membership fee of the MPs is also another source of income of the club. Speaker Abdul Hamid on Mar 19 formed a panel to investigate the alleged corruption of eighth parliament speaker Sircar. The probe body, headed by Awami League MP Fale Rabbi Mian, formed three sub-committee to examine the activities of Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and Delwar.
