<TITLE> Protester death sparks fresh Kashmir clashes, 25 hurt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SRINAGAR, India, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 25 people were injured in Kashmir's main city on Wednesday when hundreds of stone throwing residents, angered over a young protester's death, clashed with Indian troops, police and witnesses said. Police fired scores of teargas shells to disperse protesters who took to streets for a second day on Wednesday in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, to protest the death of a 20-year-old student. The student was hit on the head by a teargas shell fired by police last week during a protest against Indian rule in the disputed region. He died on Tuesday. Last week's protest rally was the biggest this year in Kashmir which was hit by massive anti-India demonstrations last year. A police official, Abdul Qayum, said the injured included eight security force personnel. "The clashes continue," he said. Tens of thousands have been killed in the disputed Himalayan region since a revolt against Indian rule broke out in 1989. But overall violence has fallen significantly across Kashmir since India and Pakistan began peace talks in 2004, although New Delhi has imposed a "pause" in that dialogue after the Mumbai attack in November.
