 BUENOS AIRES, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors coach Carlos Ischia has agreed to quit when the Argentine season ends next month following a string of poor results, the club said. Ischia's team, the most popular in the country, won the Apertura championship in the first half of the 2008/09 season but have performed dismally in the last few weeks. "The board of directors have unanimously accepted the agreement we have reached with Carlos Ischia over his departure from the club," Boca said in a statement on their website (www.bocajuniors.com.ar). Boca were knocked out of the South American Libertadores Cup last Thursday after losing 1-0 at home to Uruguayan outsiders Defensor Sporting and are a lowly 17th in the Clausura championship. Two championships are year are played in Argentina. Ischia, in charge since the end of 2007 on a contract until next December, became the 24th coach to lose his job in Argentina's first division this season and the second in less than a week. The previous victim was Claudio Vivas who quit Argentinos Juniors on Saturday after only 15 matches in charge. Vivas was immediately replaced by Claudio Borghi, who earlier this season coached Independiente. Argentine media have speculated that Ischia has lost control of the dressing room where there has been a personality clash between mercurial midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme and stalwart striker Martin Palermo
