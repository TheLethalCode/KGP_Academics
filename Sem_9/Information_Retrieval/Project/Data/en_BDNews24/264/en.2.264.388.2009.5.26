<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com) The taxpayers' number will be raised to 10 lakh from seven lakh in the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the finance minister has said. Import duty on luxury goods and products harmful to health will be increased in the next budget, A M A Muhith told reporters after a pre-budget meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicle Importers and Dealers Association at the Secretariat . "Awami League government is a pro-poor administration. In no way will people be saddled with additional tax. But the tax coverage will be widened," he said. He noted that the taxpayers figure was too small in a country of 15 crore people. "Only seven lakh of the 22 lakh people with tax identification number pay taxes. We're planning to make the number 10 lakh in the next budget." The minister said the deficit in the next budget will be around five percent of the GDP, three percent of which will come from the donors. Questioned if cars will get pricier in the upcoming budge, he shot back, "You say whether or not car is a luxury product. If it is a luxury product, then the duty on car import will certainly go up." He skirted a direct answer when asked why car import went before the budget. " In fact, defining car import has been a problem. A long-term plan will be taken in the next budget, if not in the upcoming budget, to remove the complexity ." Barvida president Habibullah Don told reporters car imports went up before every budget. They urged the minister in a written memo to not impose too much tax on the import of reconditioned vehicles. Chottagong port officials and traders said there has been a steep rise in the import of cars on the apprehension that the new budget will levy more tax.
