 ROME, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has declared himself fit for Wednesday's Champions League final against Barcelona (1845 GMT). The England centre back has been troubled by a calf problem and sat out Sunday's 1-0 Premier League win at Hull City despite manager Alex Ferguson saying he wanted him to prove his fitness. "The injury is fine, I've been training for the last couple of days with the team and I feel good," he told a news conference on Tuesday. "I wouldn't start the game if I wasn't 100 percent fit. I wouldn't do that to the team. I don't see any problems from training for two or three days." The 30-year-old was immense in helping United to the trophy last season, especially in their rearguard action away to Barcelona in the semi-finals. That 0-0 draw was followed by a 1-0 home win by United but Ferdinand wants his side to attack on Wednesday rather than starting on the back foot in a one-off final. "Defending so deep against such talented players can be dangerous. But we are capable of doing both. That is the strength we have as a squad and a team," he said. OFTEN QUIET Barca's inspirational playmaker Lionel Messi has often been quiet against English opposition and Ferdinand is confident United's defence can subdue the Argentine again. "It will be difficult whoever plays against him, he is a fantastic player with great control but we've done it before," he added. Ferguson's team will become the first to seal back-to-back European Cups in the Champions League era if they win on Wednesday. Ferdinand, though, was nonplussed by the possible milestone. "We just want to win it and you guys can determine our place in history. We just want to win the competition we are in and there's a big one tomorrow," he said ahead of his team taking their final training session on Rome's Stadio Olimpico pitch. World player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a bullet header at the Olimpico against AS Roma in last season's quarters, was looking forward to playing in Rome again. "To be honest this is a great stadium," the Portuguese said. "It feels very good to play here. In my opinion I've played well here. It's amazing." Ronaldo, who missed a penalty in last season's shootout in the final against Chelsea, said the team had practised spot-kicks a lot this time
