<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has recommended launching a direct passenger shipping route between Dhaka and Kolkata. The parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry at its meeting on Wednesday said such a service would boost tourism between Bangladesh and India. "We have asked the ministry to look whether we can start direct passenger shipping services between Dhaka and Kolkata," committee chairman Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "During the Pakistani era, Dhaka-Kolkata was linked by waterway which was suspended later," he said. "This is a good proposal. We will look into it," Afsarul Amin, the shipping minister, told reporters. The committee chair said the shipping ministry would come up with a report on the possibility of launching such a service. Chowdhury said the Bangladesh Shipping Corporation with its four old ships could start the service as the vessels were in good shape. He added that Bangladesh and India had recently signed a protocol on movement of cargo by waterways between the two neighbours. Dhaka and the West Bengal capital Kolkata are currently connected by direct bus and train services. Chowdhury said if launched, the shipping service would also attract passengers as the route would cross the Sundarbans.
