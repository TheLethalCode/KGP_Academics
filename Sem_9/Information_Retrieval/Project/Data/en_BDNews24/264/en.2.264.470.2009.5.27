 LAHORE, Pakistan, Wed May 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen attacked a police headquarters in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday, setting off a car-bomb that killed at least 24 people in what the government said was revenge for an offensive against the Taliban. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, which wounded nearly 300 people and caused extensive damage.
