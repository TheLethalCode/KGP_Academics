 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has ordered home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder to appear on June 3 to explain why he should not be charged with contempt for stopping former state minister for power Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku going abroad despite court clearance. The court also on Wednesday asked special superintendent of police, immigration, at Zia International Airport Aurangzeb Mahbub and officer in charge, immigration, Azizur Rahman Chowdhury to appear on the same day. The bench of Justice Tariqe-ul-Hakim and Justice Azizul Haq issued the contempt of court rule on the three on a petition by Tuku. Highly-placed government sources say neither the prime minister nor the home minister was aware of such a move in defiance of a High Court order. The court also ordered police chief Nur Mohammad, additional police chief Javed Patwary, the director general of immigrations and passport, and special branch sub-inspector Niazul to explain in a week why they would not be charged with contempt. An opposition BNP leader, Tuku filed the contempt petition on Tuesday against the seven after he was offloaded from a Singapore Airlines plane minutes before it was to take off for Singapore on May 24 despite his having court clearance. He had earlier filed a writ petition with the court, which on May 13 directed the immigration authorities not to prevent him from going abroad. The same bench heard a petition of Tuku on May 11 after he had been barred from flying to Singapore on May 2 and ordered the government to not stop him flying abroad for a checkup and getting back for six months. Tuku alleged in the petition that the OC Chowdhury had forced him to get down from the aircraft. Aziz had told that he was under orders to not let him go. Tuku, now on bail was going to Singapore for medical check-up at Mount Elizabeth Hospital and Singapore General Hospital. The court in a separate rule had also asked authorities to explain the move to prevent Tuku from flying to Singapore on May 2. The rule has yet to be heard. Azmalul Hossain QC argued Tuku's case while deputy attorney general M A Mannan Mohon opposed him. Tuku was jailed for nine years on twin charges of amassing illegal wealth and hiding assets in the wealth statement submitted to the Anticorruption Commission. The High Court later froze proceedings of all the cases. Former police chief Shahudul Haque lost his job on Dec 7, 2004 after he was convicted of contempt of court and fined Tk 2,000 or one month in jail on Jan 27 that year. A public servant, according to the law, loses job for committing offences punishable with death, transportation or imprisonment for a term exceeding six months or with fines exceeding Tk 1,000 or both
