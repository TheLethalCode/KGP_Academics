 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has formed an all-party probe body to investigate the alleged involvement of former adviser MA Matin in awarding a contract, on his last day in office, to a 'novice' company for container handling at Chittagong port. Matin, one of the advisers of the immediate-past military-installed caretaker government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, is the first adviser to face such a probe. The parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry at its meeting on Wednesday alleged that Matin, as shipping adviser, awarded the contract to Isahaq Brothers on Jan 6, the day he left office. "We have formed the probe body as the committee members think that adviser Matin exerted his influence in awarding the contract to a novice company," Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com. Chowdhury said the former adviser processed and awarded the contract within 24 hours. Chowdhury said Matin had earlier scrapped a tender without showing any reason for revoking the process in which lowest bidder Everest Enterprise was selected for the project. According to shipping ministry sources, Matin, a retired major general was the chief coordinator of the past caretaker government's anti-corruption drives, gave the contract to Isahaq Brothers for three years at a cost of Tk 440 per container. Everest Enterprise was the lowest bidder in the earlier tender with a similar offer, they said. Chittagong Port Authority invited the tender as the tenure of the current operator Saif PowerTech is coming to an end. Ruling party MP Md Shah Alam will head the four-member sub-committee. Awami League's Shamsul Haq Chowdhury and Nazrul Islam and the BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha are the other members of the probe body. They are scheduled to submit their findings to the standing committee in one month. "This is our question: why did he scrap the tender and award the contract to another company in 24 hours," says standing committee chairman Chowdhury. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin and other members of the committee also attended Wednesday's meeting.
