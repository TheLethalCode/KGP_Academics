 MOSCOW, Thu May 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has failed to deliver on promises to improve human rights and some violations have worsened since he took office last year, Amnesty International said Thursday. Medvedev, a 43-year-old former lawyer, has scolded officials for breaching human rights, vowed to battle corruption and end what he terms legal nihilism in the court system. Amnesty used a 16-page memorandum to detail a host of abuses on the Kremlin chief's watch, including the murders of reporters, torture of detainees and targeting of civilians during August's war with Georgia.

Medvedev has recently struck a decidedly different tone on political dissent and human rights to that of Putin, who now serves as prime minister. The Kremlin chief used an interview with an opposition newspaper last month to chide the trade-off between prosperity and freedom which critics say was the hallmark of Putin's rule. Amnesty praised Medvedev's efforts this month to review Putin-era restrictions imposed on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in line with his promise to strengthen civil society. But the group said Medvedev needed to follow through on promises. "Concrete actions are needed to prove that he (Medvedev) is doing more than paying lip service to reforms," Amnesty's secretary-general Irene Khan said in a statement. The memorandum to Medvedev was presented alongside the group's annual report, in which it said the global economic crisis is fuelling a rights "time b
