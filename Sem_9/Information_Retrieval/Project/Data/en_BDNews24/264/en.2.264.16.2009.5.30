<TITLE> N.Korea to move intercontinental missile: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul/Singapore, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea is preparing to move an intercontinental ballistic missile from a factory near Pyongyang to a launch site on the east coast, a South Korean newspaper quoted a source in Washington as saying on Saturday. U.S. Secretary of Defence Robert Gates, speaking at a forum in Singapore, warned on Saturday that provocations by the communist state would not go unanswered. "We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us," Gates told a meeting of Asian defence ministers in Singapore. "We will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state." Increasingly belligerent North Korea has warned of war on the Korean peninsula, saying it was no longer bound by an armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War and threatened further provocations in response to U.N. Security Council censure. The factory north of Pyongyang is the same place where the North manufactured the long-range rocket it fired on April 5 before moving it to the east-coast Musudan-ri missile range for assembly and launch, the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said. Regional powers are waiting to see what the North might do next after it conducted a nuclear test on Monday. South Korea is on alert on the assessment Pyongyang may make provocative moves using conventional weapons at their heavily armed border. North Korea has warned of an intercontinental ballistic missile test in anger over U.N. Security Council punishment for what Pyongyang said was a satellite launch on April 5. "Preparations to move an ICBM from the Saneum Weapons Research Centre near Pyongyang by train have been captured by U.S. spy satellites," Dong-a Ilbo quoted a source in Washington knowledgeable about the issue as saying. The research lab is the North's main centre of research and manufacture of long-range missiles, the newspaper said. South Korea's defence ministry could not immediately comment on the report. "REAL PAIN" SANCTIONS NEEDED In New York, the United States and Japan circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution to key members, condemning the claimed nuclear test and demanding strict enforcement of sanctions imposed after the North's first atomic test in October 2006. Gates said North Korea was not a direct military threat now but said sanctions that bring home "real pain" were needed against Pyongyang. "If (the North Koreans) continue on a path they are on, I think the consequences for stability in the region are significant and I think it poses the potential, the potential for some kind of an arms race in this region," Gates said. Western diplomats said permanent Security Council members Russia and China have agreed in principle that North Korea should be sanctioned for its nuclear test, but it was not clear what kind of penalties they would support. Both are generally reluctant to approve sanctions. U.S. officials have urged China to pressure North Korea to step back from nuclear brinkmanship and return to stalled disarmament talks. But many Chinese analysts say Washington overstates Beijing's sway over Pyongyang, as well as their government's willingness to use that influence. North Korea fired a short-range missile on Friday from the Musudan-ri missile base, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted an unnamed government source as saying. The missile appeared to be a modified surface-to-air missile with a range of up to 160 km, Dong-a Ilbo said. The two Koreas have fought two deadly naval clashes on their disputed maritime border in the past 10 years and the North has warned another could happen. A U.S. defence official said the United States had observed "above average activity" in the past 24 hours at a site in North Korea that has previously been used to test fire long-range missiles. South Korea's Defence Ministry said it had seen the number of Chinese fishing boats near the peninsula in the Yellow Sea drop sharply in recent days and is watching the North's activities for indications of aggression. In Singapore, Gates will meet with the defence ministers of South Korea and Japan to discuss responses to North Korea's further provocations, South Korea's defence ministry said.
