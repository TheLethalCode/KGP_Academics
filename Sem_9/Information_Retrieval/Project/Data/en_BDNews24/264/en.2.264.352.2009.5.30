 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Police said Saturday that Indian fugitive Abdur Rouf Merchant, convicted in 2001 for the murder of music mogul Gulshan Kumar and being held by police in Dhaka, came to Bangladesh on the orders of Mumbai 'mafia don' Daud Ibrahim. Dhaka Metropolitan Police in a press conference confirmed they were holding Abdur Rouf, better known as Daud Merchant, after his arrest earlier in the week. They presented Merchant before the media before producing him in court requesting 10 days to interrogate him. Merchant, who police say is an associate of Ibrahim, told the assembled reporters that he had fled his country fearing he would be shot dead in an 'encounter' with Indian law enforcers. He denied any link with Ibrahim. He also claimed he was innocent and had no role in the 1997 murder of Kumar. He said he had been falsely implicated and 'trapped' in the case. DMP commissioner ASM Shahidul Islam told reporters that Ibrahim had sent Merchant to Bangladesh to extend his criminal network out of India. Shahidul also said investigators suspect Ibrahim had links to the notorious 2004 Chittagong arms smuggling case in which ten truckloads of weapons and ammunition were seized in the port city as they were being unloaded from a boat. The commissioner said Merchant was arrested in front of Jhumur Hotel and Restaurant in Brahmanbaria. "He first gave his name as 'Samir Sheikh' but he confessed his real identity in custody," said Shahidul. The commissioner said that they had also arrested two of his associates Zahid Sheikh and Kamal Mian from South Morail, Brahmanbaria after being informed of their whereabouts from Merchant. Police have launched a manhunt for any other Bangladeshi associates of Merchant, who had been serving his sentence in an Indian jail since 2002 but was reported absconding by Indian police after being released on furlough in April to visit his family in Mumbra, a small town about 40 km from Mumbai. . Brahmanbaria police had earlier said a Detective Branch team had arrested Merchant on Tuesday. Bramhanbaria police superintendent Mukhlesur Rahman told reporters that Merchant had recently arrived in the district after crossing illegally into Bangladesh through the Akhaura border, and was staying at the residence of Kamal Mian in Mourail in Bramhanbaria district. Rahman said Merchant had also got his hands on a Bangladeshi passport in order to pass himself off as a local if necessary. Police arrested Kamal Miah for sheltering the Indian fugitive, said the police official. Kamal's wife Ferdousi had told bdnews24.com Merchant had come to stay at their house three to four days ago. "He introduced himself as 'Mujahid' and said he was an auto parts dealer," she claimed. Ferdousi also said her husband came to know him through another man. She claimed they did not know that the man was in fact a wanted criminal. From the call list of Merchant's mobile phone, police suspect that he had regular contact with mafia don Ibrahim while in Bangladesh. Gulshan Kumar, renowned owner of Indian music company T-series, was shot dead on the streets of Mumbai on Aug 12, 1997. He was believed to have been murdered by contract after refusing to pay extortion money to gangsters. bdnews24
