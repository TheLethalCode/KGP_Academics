 TEHRAN, Fri May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion at a prominent Shi'ite Muslim mosque in the southeast Iranian city of Zahedan on Thursday killed 30 people and wounded 60, the semi-official news agency ILNA reported. The agency said the blast was a suicide bombing but no person or group had claimed responsibility. Provincial Governor Ali Mohammad Azad was quoted as saying a "terrorist group" had been arrested but only one person was behind the explosion in the city. "This group intended to use the insecure conditions in Afghanistan and Pakistan as the country prepares to hold its presidential election," he said on the website of state broadcaster IRIB.

A bomb attack in Zahedan in February 2007 which killed 18 Revolutionary Guards was claimed by Jundallah, an insurgent group that says it is fighting for the rights of Iran's Sunni Muslim minority. The presidents of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan met in the capital Tehran for their first summit on Sunday, in an effort to improve cooperation in fighting terrorism and drug trafficking and tackling other regional security problems.
