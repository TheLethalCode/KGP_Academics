 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful and Mahmudullah Riad struck fifties to power Bangladesh to a comprehensive 64-run win over the Netherlands in the second Twenty20 warm-up match in Canterbury Thursday. Chasing a challenging total of 206-6 set by the Tigers, the Netherlands were dismissed for 142 in 16.3 overs after some tight bowling from pacers Rubel Hossain, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan, who together shared eight wickets. Rubel claimed four scalps while Mashrafee and Shakib grabbed two wickets each to wreck the opponents innings. Earlier, two scintillating innings from Ashraful and Mahmudullah Riad helped Bangladesh cross the 200-run after being put in to bat. Ashraful 69 off 44 balls studded with 11 boundaries and Riad 54 off 34 balls with three fours and four sixes as the visitors amassed 128 runs in the last 10 overs after being reduced to 78-3 in 10 overs. Roqibul Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim chipped in with 27 and 24 respectively after opener Tamim Iqbal (2) and Shakib Al Hasan (4) fell cheaply. Junaed Siddique made 17, according to Tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Bangladesh made three changes from Tuesday's first warm-up against New Zealand. Roqibul Hassan came in for Md Mithun, fast bowler Rubel Hossain replaced Syed Rasel while Naeem Islam, who is nursing a sore shoulder, made way for Shamsur Rahman. bd
