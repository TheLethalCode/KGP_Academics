 EI/Tennis PARIS, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holder Ana Ivanovic underlined her credentials for a second French Open title with a 6-0 6-2 demolition of Czech Iveta Benesova in the third round on Friday. The Serbian eighth seed needed just over an hour to set up a meeting with either ninth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus or Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro, seeded 22nd. "I feel physically fit and ready to handle any kind of opponent," said Ivanovic. Even before the start of the second week of these championships, Ivanovic was looking ahead at a possible rematch with world number one Dinara Safina. Twelve months after beating the Russian in the final to claim her maiden grand slam title, Ivanovic could face her Russian rival in the last eight. "Obviously these kind of matches help you for the tough matches over to the second week," said the Serb. "I hope I play her (Safina). I still have another match before playing against her, possibly. I think it's going to be great match and she's playing really well at the moment," added Ivanovic, who looks to have recovered from a knee injury. "I feel my game is coming back and I feel more confident and more comfortable on the court. I just feel content about my fitness level, as well. Just trying to enjoy basically and compete." "Competing" was a bit of a strong word as Ivanovic saw off two break points in the opening game before bulldozing through the first set in 23 minutes. Benesova, seeded 32nd, then picked up her game but Ivanovic was simply too good, wrapping up victory on her first match point with a forehand winner
