 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has asked authorities to stop the activities of ruling Awami League-backed labour wing Sarak Paribahan Sramik League. The parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment ministry on Tuesday also asked authorities to clamp down on thousands of unregistered transport workers' forums involved in extortion across the country. Parliamentary panel came hard on the Sarak Paribahan Sramik League as the organisation with the help of local Jatiya Jubo League, thw routh front of the AL, occupied the office of transport owners' association in Kaliakoir in Gazipur, its chairman said. "Sarak Paribahan Sramik League occupied the office of transport owners' association in Kaliakoir, Gazipur. "Therefore, we have recommended that the relevant ministries must stop the activities of all unregistered labour bodies including Sarak Paribahan Sramik League," Shajahan Khan, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. An Awami League MP, Khan said the government formed a seven-member committee to clear the office in Gzaipur. Thousands of illegal workers' bodies emerged overnight just to collect toll from the road transport operators, Khan added. For instance, the chairman said, he saw a local group in Patuakhali set up a new check post styled "Malik-Sramik Check Post" on the road and collected at least Tk 500 per vehicle. Khan, a mainly a transport workers' leader, said thousands of bodies were involved in extortion all over the country. Collection of toll by different labour and owners' groups is considered one of the main causes of price hike of essentials. He said Bangladesh Road Transport Authority formed a sub-committee to stop extortion in the road sector. "I as a member of the committee will recommend tougher actions on extortion in the road transport sector," Khan said.
