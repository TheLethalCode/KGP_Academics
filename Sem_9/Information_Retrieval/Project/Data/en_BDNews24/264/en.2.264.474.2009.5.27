 ROME, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United will play in an all-white strip when they face Barcelona in the Champions League final on Wednesday, just as they did when they beat them in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup final. United are designated as the "away" team at the Stadio Olimpico which meant Barcelona had first choice of strip and opted to play in their traditional blue and red kit. As United's first strip is red and their second is blue, they decided to play in all-white, the colours of Barcelona's arch-rivals Real Madrid. Ferguson laughed when he was reminded at a news conference on Tuesday that the last time Barcelona faced a team wearing all-white they beat them 6-2the margin of Barcelona's victory over Real on May 2. "That was not a defeat, that was an annihilation," responded Ferguson. "We had to change our strip and our first two strips clashed, but we are very happy to be wearing whitevery happy  and we are better than Madrid," he joked. United wore all-blue when they won the European Cup in 1968 and their traditional red-and-white kit when they won in 1999 and last year. Barcelona wore an all-orange kit when they won in 1992 and their traditional kit when they beat Arsenal in 2006
