 MADRID, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of the final weekend of matches: (All times GMT): There are five clubs, separated by two points, who are playing to avoid the final Primera Liga relegation slot. Recreativo Huelva and Numancia have already gone down. The four matches involving Osasuna, Sporting Gijon, Real Betis, Getafe and Real Valladolid all kick off at 1700 on Sunday, and each club has its future in its own hands. A win guarantees safety. Osasuna coach Jose Antonio Camacho faces his former club Real Madrid at the Reyno de Navarra. Real are distracted by a presidential election, the likely return of Florentino Perez, and non-stop speculation over a new coach and players. "I calculate we will have around five or six signings including the best in the world and the best in Spain," Perez told radio station Cadena Ser. Betis host direct rivals Valladolid. They have had a rough time from their own fans in recent games at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera. "We aren't nervous or feeling the pressure, but are confident that the fans will be with us. We will be 56,000 against 11," Betis's Chilean forward Mark Gonzalez told the club website (www.realbetisbalompie.es). Mid-table Racing Santander will be without 13-goal top scorer Nikola Zigic due to suspension when they host Getafe. "It will be very difficult to match their level of motivation because they come with relegation in play. But the anxiety could work against them," Racing defender Ivan Marcano told the club website (www.realracingclub.es). Sporting Gijon have won two on the trot and have a full squad to choose from at the Molinon, when bottom club Recreativo visit. Fourth-placed Atletico Madrid have a two-point lead over Villarreal in the battle for the last Champions League qualification slot and hold the head-to-head advantage. On Saturday (1900), Atletico are at home to Almeria, who are coached by former player Hugo Sanchez. Villarreal are away to Real Mallorca, who won 3-1 at the Bernabeu last weekend. "We are almost there and a draw is enough," Atletico striker Sergio Aguero told sports daily AS. "We are on a good run of victories and if we continue on the same path it will be impossible for them to beat us.
