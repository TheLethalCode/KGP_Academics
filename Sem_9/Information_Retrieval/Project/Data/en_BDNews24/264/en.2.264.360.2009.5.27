 Singapore, May (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Singapore government on Wednesday confirmed the city-state's first H1N1 flu case, a 22-year-old Singaporean woman who is being quarantined in hospital and is the latest of nearly 13,000 cases worldwide. The government has been warning Singaporeans for weeks to prepare for an inevitable H1N1 outbreak in the city-state, a regional financial and trading centre and the world's busiest port. The woman arrived from New York early on Tuesday on a Singapore Airlines flight, and was not picked up by thermal scanners at the airport as she did not have a fever then, the government said in a statement. She is in a stable condition. The government said it was tracing the flu patient's close contacts and said they would be quarantined and treated with anti-viral medication. It urged those travelling on the same flight to contact the authorities. The government is continuing with screening at border checkpoints and asked people to stay at home if suffering flu symptoms. It also advised caution over travel to affected areas. Singapore financial markets shrugged off the news. Singapore's central bank said in April that the global outbreak of flu clouded the outlook for the country.
