 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League government is yet to revoke the controversial sales of abandoned houses initiated by the previous BNP-led government, according to a housing ministry paper presented to a parliamentary watchdog on Tuesday. Former minister housing minister Mirza Abbas, a former housing secretary and 15 high officials were jailed by the 2007-2008 military-installed interim government for the alleged corruption in the sale of 18 abandoned houses in city's Gulshan area. The paper, prepared by the Public Works Department, says 1213 out of 6868 abandoned houses in Dhaka and Chittagong were in the queue for sale. The paper said 2518 houses have been sold. "We have not started the process of selling the houses. It was the previous government's decision," Abdul Mannan Khan, state minister for housing and public works, told bdnew24.com on Tuesday after the meeting at parliament building. The minister earlier alleged that the BNP-led government resorted to corrupt means in the sale of the abandoned houses. "Of course, we will investigate," he said. Replying to a question on whether his ministry would scrap the process, the minister said, "Let's see." The committee chairman, A B M Fazle Karim Chowdhury, told bdnews24.com that the BNP-led government had allocated 30 plots, reserved for constructing a hospital in Tejagon industrial area, to different people. "The officials could not give us the details about how the hospital land was turned into plots and distributed to individuals," said Chowdhury. "We will, of course, investigate it," he said. "The ministry would give us details at our next meeting."
