 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering merging Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Ltd and Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd, while leaving Teletalk, the state-run mobile-phone operator, as a subsidiary company, the telecoms minister has said. The three companies were formed by splitting Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB), during the military-installed caretaker government's regime. A parliamentary committee would be formed to see if the bribe money paid by German industrial giant Siemens made its way to fund militancy, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu told reporters on Tuesday, emerging from a conference of the Bangladesh Civil Service (Telecom) Association. "We would finalise the details of the committee at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee, scheduled for May 31." A report by David Montero published on May 11 on the website of US-based television channel Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) said in 2004, Siemens paid $5 million in bribes to government officials to secure a telecom deal with the government. The report said that according to court document filed by prosecutors at the US Department of Justice, Siemens had bribed the former telecommunications minister, Aminul Haque. Haque was sentenced to 31 years in prison in 2007 for aiding and abetting the JMB.
