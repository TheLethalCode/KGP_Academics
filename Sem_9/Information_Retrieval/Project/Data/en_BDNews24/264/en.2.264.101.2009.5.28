 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Army has told a parliamentary watchdog that it urgently needs more funds for modernisation and to replace decades-old equipment. Army officials told the parliamentary standing committee on the defence ministry that it was still using weapons and ordnance made in the 1960s and 1980s, the committee chair Idris Ali said Thursday. He also asked the ministry to submit a draft defence policy at the next meeting of the standing committee for discussion. "We have heard the army's problems. And fund crisis is their major problem," Ali told reporters after the meeting. "The committee members have listened, but we have not made any recommendation yet on increasing the army's budget," he said. The chairman said the present defence spending stood at around 3.9 percent of the Tk 99,962 crore national budget. "The army's weapon and equipment are outdated. They were issued in the 1960s and 1980s. They should have modern weapon and equipment," he said. Ali said the committee stressed the need for boosting the capacity of the Bangladesh Ordnance Factory and the Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory to produce better arms and ammunition. "A defence policy is under preparation. Our defence has been running on ad hoc basis," he said. "If the proposed defence policy is approved, the role and duty of armed forces and people's expectation from the forces would be clear." Navy 'ill-equipped' to gather sea border data The panel also discussed maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar and India. "We have come to know that Bangladesh Navy has no capacity to generate necessary data to update Bangladesh's maritime boundary," said the chairman. "Therefore, we have asked the ministry to purchase a modern hydrographic survey vessel," said Idris Ali, a former defence secretary and now a ruling party MP. He said the procurement would cost about Tk 100 crore. Committee members Mujibul Haq, Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun, Mohammad Rafiqul Islam and Monjur Quader Quraishi attended the meeting. Chiefs of the three services were present.
