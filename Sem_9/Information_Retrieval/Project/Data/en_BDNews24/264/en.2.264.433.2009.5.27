 PARIS, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number three Andy Murray survived a mid-match meltdown to beat Italian Potito Starace 6-3 2-6 7-5 6-4 and progress to the third round of the French Open on Wednesday. The Briton, who has never won a title on clay, had comfortably won the first set when the world number 104 hit a tight-angled shot into the net after sprinting to reach a drop shot. Rather than build on the momentum, the Scot crumbled in the second. He failed to get enough depth in his groundstrokes which Starace attacked with gusto, snatching five games in a row and grabbing the set when Murray netted a backhand return. Murray found himself trailing 5-1 in the third and having to save a set point. He saved another at 5-3 while winning six games in a row to take the third set with a cheeky drop shot. The fourth went with serve until the 10th game where Murray unleashed a delightful crosscourt forehand on his third match point
