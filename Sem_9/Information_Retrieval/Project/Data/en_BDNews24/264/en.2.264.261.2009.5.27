 ROME, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona will not be hamstrung by their defensive problems in the Champions League final against Manchester United, goalkeeper Victor Valdes said on Tuesday. Coach Pep Guardiola will be forced to field a makeshift rearguard with full backs Eric Abidal and Dani Alves suspended and central defender Rafael Marquez injured. "We are missing important players in defence but we also have great replacements," Valdes told a news conference. "I completely trust my team mates." Guardiola is expected to switch captain Carles Puyol to the right flank with Yaya Toure at centre back and another converted midfielder, Seydou Keita, taking Abidal's place on the left. Puyol said he was confident that whatever solution his coach chose would work out as Barca bid for a treble after winning the Spanish Cup and the Primera Liga. "The team is in good shape. We have great players and the coach will play them in the right positions," the 31-year-old said. "I am certain that everything is going to be just perfect." Guardiola also seemed relaxed about the situation. "I know we are missing important players but that cannot be an excuse," he said. "If we can't play with a defender at 100 percent we'll just play with more forwards." Puyol stressed, however, that for all their confidence Barca know the defending European champions present a massive challenge. "There is a very good feeling. We know we have an historic opportunity," he said. "We know we are up against a great team. They have a great defence and lots of quality players who can make the difference. We have to look at the team as a whole.
