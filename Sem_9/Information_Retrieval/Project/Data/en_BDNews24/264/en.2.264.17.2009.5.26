 WASHINGTON, Tue May 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama nominated Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the US Supreme Court on Tuesday, selecting a woman who would be the court's first Latino to replace retiring Justice David Souter.

As an appeals court judge, she has often sided with plaintiffs in cases involving race, sex, age and disability discrimination and has ruled against businesses in cases on environmental law and securities litigation. The two business rulings were later reversed by the Supreme Court. Hoping to show a consultative approach, Obama had been meeting with key Democratic and Republican members of the Senate as he weighed a short list of mostly women to replace Souter.
