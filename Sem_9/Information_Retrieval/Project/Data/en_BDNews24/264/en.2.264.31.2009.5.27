 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Wednesday granted bail to chairman of a Islami Oikya Jote splinter group, Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini, in the Lalbagh mob attack case. Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashir Ullah awarded bail on submission of a Tk 50,000 bond, after hearing a petition by Amini against a previous bail rejection by a lower court. On May 17, Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Tofael Hasan refused Amini bail after he had surrendered to the court, facing charges for inciting a mob attack on a pro-Awami League rally in Lalbagh. Ruling Awami League's workers' front Jatiya Sramik League leader Akbar Hossain Khan on May 2 filed a case accusing Amini and nine others by name and another 200-250 unidentified people of launching an attack on Sramik League procession on May 1. In the complaint, Akbar said a procession of Sramik League that was returning from a May Day rally in Paltan Maidan in the capital was attacked at Islambagh by over 100 armed people under the orders of Amini and the other accused. The attackers hurled bombs and stones at the procession, the case statement said. During the previous hearing, lawyers for the accused said the case was false as none of the accused 'had been present' during the May 2 incident that allegedly happened at 7pm, when the accused were saying prayers in a mosque. b
