 PARIS, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal will set a record for the number of successive matches won at the French Open if he beats Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili in the second round on Wednesday. By winning a 30th consecutive match, the Spaniard would eclipse Chris Evert's mark of 29 which the American set between 1974-81. She did not compete at Roland Garros in 1976-78. Nadal, seeking a record fifth successive crown at the claycourt grand slam, is scheduled to play last on Suzanne Lenglen Court while women's number one Dinara Safina opens up the billing on that same showcourt. Safina, hoping to go one better than last year's runner-up spot in her bid for a first grand slam title, meets fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko feeling fairly fresh after her 6-0 6-0 first-round demolition of Briton Anne Keothavong. Her brother Marat, who plays Frenchman Josselin Ouanna later in the day, was confident his younger sister could go all the way this year after coming to Paris on the back of wins on clay in Madrid and Rome. "I think she has a chance here this year. Especially, she's coming with great confidence, final and two times winner in a row. She's playing really well," Safin said. The day's other highlights include third seed Andy Murray opening proceedings on the main Philippe Chatrier Court against Italian Potito Starace with the Briton hoping for a repeat of Sunday's first-round showing when he dropped just five games. "If I played that well in all my matches, I've got a good chance of winning comfortably," he said after knocking out Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela. Women's third seed Venus Williams takes on Czech Lucie Safarova, while last year's champion Ana Ivanovic faces Thailand's Tamarine Tana
