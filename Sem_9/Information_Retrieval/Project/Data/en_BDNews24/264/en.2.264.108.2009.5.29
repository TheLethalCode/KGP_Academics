 CHENNAI, India, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prolific opener Gautam Gambhir has warned against complacency ahead of India's defence of their World Twenty20 crown in England next month. "Twenty20 is a format where there are no favourites," the left-hander told Reuters prior to the team's departure on Friday. "There is no place for tags in this explosive format as any player can change the course of the game in no time. It's down to which team plays better cricket on that day." India have come on leaps and bounds in all three forms of cricket in recent years and have been installed as favourites to lift the second edition of the competition beginning on June 5. Mahendra Singh Dhoni led a young team to a surprise success in South Africa two years ago to ensure the game's most explosive format gained instant popularity in cricket's commercial hub. Wicketkeeper-batsman Dhoni heads another young and vibrant squad into the fray for a second time, raising hopes in cricket-mad India that the team can defend the crown. Batting great Sachin Tendulkar, who does not play Twenty20 internationals, expressed confidence in the team on Thursday, describing their batting and bowling as "the deadliest combination" and one that thrived under pressure. India play Bangladesh and Ireland in Group A of the 12-team tournament. KEY ROLE Gambhir played a key role when India triumphed in the inaugural World Twenty20 and went on to cement his spot as a test and one-day opener through the weight of his runs. "If you stick to the basics, adjusting (to different formats) is not a problem," he said. "I like to score runs and don't look to just survive," the 27-year-old added of his ability to adapt. "I think it has more to do with my mind. I have not made major changes to my technique. "I am confident of my batting. Scoring runs in any format is what keeps me happy and motivated." The Delhi batsman, however, said India should guard against complacency. "As a team we need to focus on playing good cricket and take it one match at a time." India head to England in the middle of a packed itinerary after playing a test and one-day series in New Zealand and the Indian Premier League (IPL) in South Africa. India's dynamic openers Gambhir and Virender Sehwag were subdued in Delhi Daredevils' elimination in the IPL semi-finals, raising concerns of fatigue for the duo. Tendulkar said Sehwag and Gambhir would have to quickly overcome any tiredness if India wanted to mount a strong defence. "We came into the tournament straight from a test series and didn't have time to even practice," Gambhir said. "I scored 286 runs, not far, far away from the toppers. I feel confident of my form.
