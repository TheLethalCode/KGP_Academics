 WASHINGTON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It is in Egypt's interest to show more respect for human rights, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Thursday, hitting a raw nerve in US-Egypt relations ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama. Clinton met representatives of Egyptian pro-democracy groups at the State Department one day after she received Egypt's foreign minister. "It is in Egypt's interest to move more toward democracy and to exhibit more respect for human rights," Clinton told reporters as she was photographed with the activists. Obama is set to deliver what has been billed as a major speech to the Muslim world from Egypt on June 4, a choice that has revived criticism of the country's human rights record. Former US. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice gave a policy speech in Egypt in 2005 and angered her host when she specifically targeted Egypt's human rights record. After meeting Clinton on Wednesday, Egypt's Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the new administration was "very much different" from the previous one, using less rhetoric when it came to discussing issues such as human rights. "They also listen," he said. Asked specifically whether human rights concerns would be raised when Obama visits next week, Clinton said it was always on the agenda. THANKS EGYPT Clinton said she planned soon to send US Undersecretary of State Bill Burns to Cairo to open what she called a comprehensive discussion on a "whole range of issues." Clinton came under heavy criticism during a visit to China in February when she told reporters that human rights could not be allowed to interfere with other concerns such as climate change and the financial crisis. On Thursday, she was at pains to thank Cairo for its role in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and promised strong US backing to promote economic opportunity in Egypt. "We've spent, as you know, many billions of dollars over the last years promoting NGOs, promoting democracy, good governance, rule of law," she said. "I want to stress economic opportunity because out of economic opportunity comes confidence, comes a recognition that people can chart their own future. So this is all part of what we will be discussing," Clinton added. The group Human Rights First said Obama's first official visit to Egypt was a chance to chart a new course in US efforts to improve human rights in the country. "What President Obama says and does while he is in Egypt will be a key indicator of the importance the new administration will accord to human rights promotion globally," said Neil Hicks, international policy advisor for the group. In recent months, Egypt's government has taken steps to win some goodwill from the Obama administration, including the release in February of opposition politician Ayman Nour, whose detention was a longtime irritant in US-Egypt relat
