 Sherpur, May 29 (bdnews24.com)The agriculture minister has warned against negligence by government officials in the farming sector. "Rewards will be there for good job and punishment for bad job," Matia Chowdhury said to agriculture officials at a programme at Nakla Upazila in Sherpur. She launched the programme at the Bangladesh Rural Development Board auditorium to encourage farmers to use urea super granules, locally known as 'guti urea,' and technology. Agri-experts believe Guti urea reduces use of urea fertiliser to substantially raise crop productions, help improve fertility of soil and maintain ecology, bio-diversity and environment, and reduce the risks of pests' attacks on the crop fields. The government, Chowdhury said, was working for peasant farmers and wanted better crop yields and happiness for the farmers. Later, the minister distributed 20 kg urea Guti urea among 100 farmers at the IPM School premises of the Upazila. bdne
