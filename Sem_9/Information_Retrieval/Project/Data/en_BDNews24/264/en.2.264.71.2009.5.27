 PARIS, May 27 (Reuters) - Holder Ana Ivanovic turned in a polished performance to overcome Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-1 6-2 and reach the third round of the French Open on Wednesday. The eighth-seeded Serb, whose first-round match lasted more than two hours, showed more urgency against her 32-year-old opponent, serving out the first set to love after Tamarine hit her forehand return into the net. Ivanovic broke early in the second before allowing the Thai a glimmer of hope with her own break but the Serb soon put her back in her place, wrapping up victory on her second match point with a sizzling forehand that Tamarine swiped wildly. Ivanovic, who beat world number one Dinara Safina in Paris last year for her maiden grand slam title, will face either Czech Iveta Benesova or Russia's Alla Kudryavtseva in the next round
