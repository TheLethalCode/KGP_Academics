 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) - The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in Lahore which killed at least 26 people. BBC reports. A deputy to Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud told the BBC by telephone the attack was in response to the army's ongoing operation in the Swat valley. The caller, who identified himself as Hakimullah Mehsud, threatened similar attacks in other Pakistani cities. "Residents should leave the cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan," he said. More than 200 people were also injured in Wednesday's attack. WARNING: "The fidayeen [suicide] attack which took place in Lahore was not revenge for [the attacks in] North and South Waziristan," Hakimullah Mehsud, Taliban commander for Orakzai and Khyber tribal regions, told the BBC. "The military operation going on in Swat in which many innocent people are being killed and the bombing campaign against the mujahideen [fighters]... this is revenge for these acts," he said. The caller said the Taliban had been preparing to hit Lahore from the day the operation started in Swat. Giving a warning of similar attacks in other Pakistani cities on government installations, he advised citizens to evacuate. "We love the people of Pakistan, and because of this love we politely ask the citizens of Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Multan to please evacuate their cities because we have marked out government targets there against whom we will carry out attacks as have never happened before," he warned. The attack on Wednesday targeted buildings belonging to the police and intelligence agency, the ISI. A group of men shot at police officers before detonating a powerful car bomb.
