 LONDON, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England crushed West Indies by 58 runs in the third and final one-day international at Edgbaston on Tuesday to clinch the series 2-0. Coming after their test series win over the Windies it was the perfect fillip for the forthcoming World Twenty20 and Ashes series, though England will have to work much harder for success in those competitions. The home side piled up 328 for seven after being put in, their third-highest total in a 50-over match and highest against the West Indies, who again looked short on motivation and application. An 81-run opening stand set England on their way with Ravi Bopara hitting a sharp 49 and captain Andrew Strauss 52.

BRIEF FLURRY Dwayne Bravo had a brief flurry but was lbw to Tim Bresnan for 26, leaving Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Denesh Ramdin to plod on as the required run rate spiralling into double figures. Chanderpaul eventually fell for 68, holing out when he finally tried to accelerate in the power play, and Ramdin was caught behind for 45. Two chaotic runouts accounted for Kieron Pollard and Jerome Taylor and, after another late burst of hitting that merely showed up their earlier go-slow tactics, James Anderson finished things off by bowling Sulieman Benn for 31 in the final over. It was the seamer's third wicket as the tourists succumbed for 270. "I thought we were excellent with the bat... it proved too many for the West Indies and provides more momentum for the lads," Strauss told Sky Sports. "We've been working hard and it's good to get the rewards. "We didn't let off at any stage during the tests or the one dayers and that's what you have to do if you want to be a good side. "We need to do more of it but it's a good sta
