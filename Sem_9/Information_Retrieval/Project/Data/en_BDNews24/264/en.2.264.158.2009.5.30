Bangladesh Police in a press conference Saturday confirmed they were holding Abdur Rouf, better known as Daud Merchant, after his arrest earlier in the week. Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Detective Branch presented the Indian fugitive for the media before producing him in court demanding a 10-day remand to interrogate him.

Rahman said Merchant had also got his hands on a Bangladeshi passport in order to pass himself off as a local if necessary. Police arrested Kamal Miah for sheltering the Indian fugitive, said the police official. Kamal's wife Ferdousi had told bdnews24.com Merchant had come to stay at their house three to four days ago. "He introduced himself as 'Mujahid' and said he was an auto parts dealer," she said. Ferdousi also said her husband came to know him through another man named Billal Mian.
