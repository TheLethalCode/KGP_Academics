<TITLE> Asia, EU scold N.Korea, urge Myanmar to free detainees </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HANOI, Tue May 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian and European foreign ministers condemned North Korea's nuclear test on Tuesday, and urged Myanmar to free detainees and lift political restrictions as Aung San Suu Kyi defended herself in a controversial trial. As the two-day meeting ended, several diplomats applauded China for taking a strong position on both issues at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) foreign ministers' conference in Hanoi. Beijing is the closest thing that North Korea has to an ally and a strong backer of the junta that runs the former Burma. In a statement, the ministers said they "strongly urge" North Korea not to conduct further tests and to comply with UN resolutions, and called on Pyongyang to "immediately return" to so-called six-party talks with regional powers aimed at ending its nuclear programme. "Bearing in mind the need to maintain peace and stability in the region and the international non-proliferation regime, ministers condemn the underground nuclear test ... which constitutes a clear violation of the six-party agreements and the relevant UNSC resolutions and decisions," it said. ASEM comprises 44 countries and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) secretariat. North Korea is not a member, but Myanmar is. A separate, more general statement at the end of a two-day meeting said the ministers had discussed the situation in Myanmar "in light of the concern about the recent developments relating to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi". "They called for the early release of those under detention and the lifting of restrictions placed on political parties," it added. Carl Bildt, Foreign Minister of Sweden, said that wording went beyond anything previously endorsed by China or Vietnam. "I think it's a major step forward," he said. "It's a substantial increase on the political pressure on the regime in Burma." Jan Kohout, foreign minister of the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, went a step further in his closing remarks, saying Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, was an "indespensible partner in the dialogue leading to national reconciliation". "She should be released immediately and the Burmese government should engage in an inclusive dialogue with all relevant political and ethnic groups," he said. The statement also called for more humanitarian assistance to Myanmar and the ministers "affirmed their commitments to the sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Myanmar. CHINA'S ROLE Some diplomats sensed that China had adopted a fresh tone on Myanmar and had been constructive on North Korea. "We can certainly say that they have not been pushing on the brake. I'm not saying that they're pushing on the accelerator either, but they are not holding things up," Finland's Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said on Tuesday. He said in discussions on Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi "did mention political prisoners and he did talk about the dangers of the nuclear test in North Korea. So, the message that we got in the meeting room was loud and clear". Another senior European diplomat, who declined to be named, said Yang did not mention Suu Kyi by name, "but he de-facto did". "It was a new tone from China on the question of Burma. That, I think, can be said. There's no question about it," he said. Yang declined to comment specifically on Tuesday. Asked about the statements, Yang told Reuters: "It's a consensus". Last week, after the military junta that rules Myanmar put Suu Kyi on trial, China's foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Myanmar should be left to handle its own affairs. In Beijing on Tuesday he said there had been no change in this position. Myanmar's Foreign Minister Nyan Win declined repeatedly to comment to journalists on the sidelines of the Hanoi meeting, but diplomats said that in bilateral meetings and the larger forum he defended the regime's charges and the trial of Suu Kyi. "If I'm honest, I think the Burmese regime has miscalculated and has been somewhat taken aback by the force of international reaction," said Bill Rammell, Britain's junior foreign minister. The global financial crisis, pandemic flu and climate change were among other issues on the agenda of the two-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), involving 45 member count
