 YANGON, Wed May 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court in Myanmar rejected most of Aung San Suu Kyi's defense witnesses on Wednesday, the latest move critics said was aimed at sabotaging her defense in a trial that could see her jailed for five years. The court allowed only one of four witnesses requested by Suu Kyi's defense team, advocate Kyi Win, who will testify on Thursday when the trial resumes.

Activists say a guilty verdict is inevitable in a country where more than 2,000 political prisoners are behind bars and courts routinely bend the law to the suit the generals. "It has been clear from the beginning that Aung San Suu Kyi would never get a fair trial," Debbie Stothard of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma, said. The court gave no reason for rejecting the three witnesses. "Their testimony would have exposed the lack of logic and rationality in these charges," Stothard said. "SHOW TRIAL" Suu Kyi has denied the charges and, in a written statement to the court on Tuesday, blamed the incident at her home on a breach of security. She noted that no officials were held accountable. "It is a one-side measure to take legal action against me. I hereby submit that I did not commit the offence alleged by the prosecutor," she said in the statement released by her p
