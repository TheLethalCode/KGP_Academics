<TITLE> ICC wants quick end to Pakistan World Cup venue row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A dispute with Pakistan over 2011 one-day World Cup games needs to be resolved as soon as possible, International Cricket Council (ICC) president David Morgan said on Thursday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has taken legal action against the ICC executive board's decision last month to shift 14 games out of the troubled country due to security concerns. The ICC will meet co-hosts India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan in London on June 15 to try and resolve the issue of staging the games. Pakistan stands to lose around $11 million in rights fees if it does not stage its share of matches. "I hope that, through discussion, we will be able to reach a resolution to this matter as soon as possible," Morgan said in a statement. "It is a matter that is diverting resources and energy that could be spent elsewhere as, with less than two years to go before the event, we need to be conscious that time is passing. "The sooner we reach that resolution, the sooner everyone can proceed with the business of concentrating our efforts on working towards a successful event in 2011." ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat dismissed any suggestion the influential Indian board had a hand in shifting the games out of Pakistan. "We know that many of the member countries will not tour Pakistan and the board had to act," Lorgat told a news conference in New Delhi. "As we sit now, we must look through the issues and there is no reason why we should not engage in a dialogue.
