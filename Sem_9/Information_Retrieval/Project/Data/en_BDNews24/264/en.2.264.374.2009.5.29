 CARACAS, Fri May 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened on Thursday to personally take action against an anti-government TV station if the nation's authorities do not punish the channel, which expects to be closed. Separately, prosecutors said the president of the station, Globovision, will be charged for illegally storing new Toyota vehicles after one of his properties was raided by police last week in case he says is politically motivated. Chavez, who has stepped up pressure on private industry and the political opposition in recent weeks, previously said that Globovision's editorial line had to change. "If what has to happen does not happen in the correct institutions then I will have to act like I have had to on previous occasions," Chavez said on state television.

Prosecutors say he was storing the vehicles in a form of price speculation. Zuloaga says the vehicles belong to a legitimate business and that the case against him is politically motivated. Chavez said that Toyota Motor Corp should explain its role in the distribution of vehicles, which has become a political issue in Venezuela because of inflated prices. The socialist president criticized the attorney general and a cabinet minister charged with regulating telecommunications for not having taken swift action against the TV station. Globovision, a small but influential station, has drawn Chavez's ire for various reasons. In one instance it broadcast a chat show in which a guest said Chavez would end his days by being hanged, like Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.
