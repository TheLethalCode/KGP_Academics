 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government is mulling a reduction in fuel price again, said state minister for energy Shamsul Haque Tuku on Wednesday. "The thought came following a policy of the caretaker government on adjusting fuel price in line with the international market," he told reporters. Discussion is going on whether the price cut will be included in the next budget, he added. The allocation for power in the next budget is "just right", said the state minister. Tuku was speaking after a meeting with US ambassador James F Moriarty. He said the ambassador expressed his country's interest in supporting Bangladesh's energy sector. "He spoke of assistance in mining activities after the national coal policy is finalised." "We also sought US assistance in renewable energy, including hydro-electricity, windmills, solar power and kitchen waste," said Tuku. The ambassador said US electricity companies would be persuaded to work in Bangladesh, he added. Asked if there was any raection on the US side on the agreement with Russia on setting up a nuclear power station, the state minister said, "The topic came up in the meeting but there was no negative comment from the US." bdnews2
