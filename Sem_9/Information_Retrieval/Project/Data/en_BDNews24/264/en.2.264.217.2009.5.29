<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)The BNP has asked for making public the army investigation report by arranging camera sessions in parliament and dismissed the report of the national investigation committee on the BDR mutiny as' a joke'. It also demanded an all-party parliamentary probe into the Feb 25-26 bloodbath by the border guards. BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain made the demands on Friday from a media briefing in the main opposition party's official reaction to the government's report. "We are frustrated." The committee could not reveal anything and wasted time and money on such a grave incident as BDR bloodbath, Delwar said. He claimed that the army had not been allowed the freedom to prepare their report though they were the biggest victims. "There were lots of transfer and retirement to hamper the investigation process. Many sensational truths and allegations against the ruling party are there in the report." Delwar said the report says nothing about the meetings between the ministers and leaders of the government and the mutineers. He said the report invented a story on the involvement of BNP leader Nasir Uddin Ahmed Pintu but said nothing about 'instigator Torab Ali of Awami League'. The report of the government-formed committee, headed by Anis-uz-Zaman Khan, was submitted to home minister Sahara Khatun on May 21 and its summary was made public on Wednesday. He also slammed the proposal for changing the name and uniform of BDR. "It is nothing but a bad idea of the government. They are trying to change name without focusing on the real incident." The mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters of the 55,000-strong paramilitary force left around 65 people including 57 army officers killed. BNP standing committee member Dr Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah, joint secretary Mirza Abbas, MP Barkat Ullah Bulu and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were among those present at the press briefing in Dhaka. b
