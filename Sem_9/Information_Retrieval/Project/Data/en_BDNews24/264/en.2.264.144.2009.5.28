 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Navy is ill-equipped to gather crucial data on Bangladesh's maritime boundaries for ongoing sea-border negotiations with India and Myanmar, according to a parliamentary watchdog. The parliamentary standing committee on the defence ministry discussed ongoing maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar and India in a meeting Thursday. "We have come to know that Bangladesh Navy has no capacity to generate necessary data to update Bangladesh's maritime boundary," said committee chairman Idris Ali. "Therefore, we have asked the ministry to purchase a modern hydrographic survey vessel," said Ali, a former defence secretary and now a ruling party MP. He said the procurement would cost about Tk 100 crore. Army seeks to replace 'decades old' gear The meeting also heard requests from the army for more funds to modernise decades old equipment. Army officials told the standing committee it was still using weapons and ordnances made in the 1960s and 1980s, said Ali. "We have heard the army's problems. And fund crisis is their major problem," Ali told reporters after the meeting. "The committee members have listened, but we have not made any recommendation yet on increasing the army's budget," he said. The chairman said the present defence spending stood at around 3.9 percent of the Tk 99,962 crore national budget. "The army's weapon and equipment are outdated. They were issued in the 1960s and 1980s. They should have modern weapon and equipment," he said. Ali said the committee stressed the need for boosting the capacity of the Bangladesh Ordnance Factory and the Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory to produce better arms and ammunition. New defence policy on cards The wathcdog chief also asked the defence ministry to submit a draft defence policy at the next meeting of the standing committee for discussion. "A defence policy is under preparation. Our defence has been running on ad hoc basis," he said. "If the proposed defence policy is approved, the role and duty of armed forces and people's expectation from the forces would be clear." Committee members Mujibul Haq, Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun, Mohammad Rafiqul Islam and Monjur Quader Quraishi attended the meeting. Chiefs of the three services were present.
