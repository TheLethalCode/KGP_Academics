 Subhra Kanti Gupta, Kolkata Kolkata, May 27 (bdnews24.com)--Thousands of angry residents took to the streets of Kolkata and elsewhere in the state to protest against "inadequate cyclone relief" and against the collapse of civic facilities. Led by the Opposition Trinamul Congress, thousands of Calcuttans blocked roads and pelted stones at offices of Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation . West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya admitted that uprooted trees have ripped apart power lines and many areas of Kolkata and its suburbs are without power since Monday when Cyclone Aila struck. "Power cuts have caused huge water crisis throughout Kolkata which is why the people are protesting. The government is useless, they are busy giving statements," Indian railway minister and Trinamul chief Mamata Banerji alleged in a press conference. The Chief Minister said his government " was putting pressure" on the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC) to employ more workers to restore power lines -- but admitted the CESC's performance in crisis "leaves much to be desired." But Trinamul's Banerji shot back, " Why will CESC not listen to the Chief Minister ? Where is his government?" More than 200,000 people have lost their homes in Cyclone Aila , mostly in the North and South 24 Parganas district -- and many like housemaid Malina Gharami say they will not be able to construct a house again. "My income is just around 1000 rupees a month and the house I build with my life savings had cost me 20000 rupees . Now that it has collapsed , I cannot build one again, it is just impossible," said ms Gharami, a single mother in Dakshin Patikhali village in South 24 Parganas. Unless the government helps. But not many of these homeless have much expectations from the government. "They should first give us food and water . That is not happening. For 10000 people in my village, they have send just 50 kilos of Chira (pounded rice) and 5 kilo Gur (Jaggery).That is just not enough," said Kadampani in the worst-hit Namkhana near the Sundarbans delta. Columns of the Army and Border Security Force (BSF) have fanned out in the Sundarbans and other cyclone hit areas, where 273 river embankments have collapsed, causing flash floods . Some of these areas hit by huge tidal waves are still cut off. "Our boats are trying to peneterate these areas ," said the BSF's Vikas Chand. The army was using helicopters to drop supplies to the stranded people. At least 72 bodies have been recovered so far in eight districts of Bengal including the city of Kolkata.
