 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  Health minister AFM Ruhul Haque has cut short his visit to France, returning to the country in the wake of Cyclone Aila. He set out for the cyclone-hit districts of Khulna and Satkhira Thursday after returning to Bangladesh the day before. He was monitoring healthcare activities and distribution of relief among the cyclone victims of Pikegachha in Khulna and Ashashuni in Satkhira on the day. Haque had left Bangladesh earlier in the month to attend the 62nd conference of the World Health Organisation in Geneva from May 18 to 22. The minister told reporters on his arrival back home that the conference emphasised preserving healthcare systems in different countries, especially for the poor, in the face of global recession. The global swine flu situation was also a major issue of the conference, he added. "We are in grave risk since the flu strain has been detected in our neighbouring country but there is no reason to be panicked," he said. "Doctors and health workers are very much aware of the situation and the essential medicines are being made and stored here," said the minister. Community clinics, especially the model community healthcare system at Chougachha in Jessore, were highlighted in the global conference. "World health leaders were urged to visit the model healthcare facility where involvement of a community has made the most effective healthcare system without depending on the money of the government or others," he said. Haque attended the meeting of the WHO executive board on May 23 with a 21-member representative team from Bangladesh. The prime minister's adviser for health affairs Dr Syed Modaccher Ali and health department director Prof Shah Monir Hossain were part of the Bangladesh delegation. Haque also attended the meeting of health ministers of Commonwealth countries on May 17. He had also been scheduled to attend a session on vaccination activities on May 28 and 29 at Paris before his return.
