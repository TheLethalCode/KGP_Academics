 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has announced that a national defence policy will be devised to safeguard the country. She also said her administration will do its best to send more troops to the UN peacekeeping mission. The prime minister made the promises at a programme marking the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in Dhaka on Friday. She was sanguine that the peacekeepers from armed forces and the police would continue serve in different organizations of the United Nations and in diplomatic activities. Hasina, who also heads the defence ministry, said the government would relentlessly strive to raise the quality and skills of the armed forces to prime them for the new century's demands. A minute's silence was observed at the start of the programme, attended by function, attended by diplomats, high civil and military officials and others, elite in honour of the Bangladesh peacekeepers died in the line of duty and the victims of the BDR bloodbath in February. The prime minister distributed gallantry award among the wives of those who were killed and injured in peacekeeping missions. A total of 91 Bangladeshis have died on active UN duty in different war-ravaged countries. Bangladesh is the one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions across the trouble-torn regions and has some 9,500 peacekeepers in 13 missions. The prime minister said appointments, postings, promotions in the armed forces will be based on qualifications, merit, skill and seniority to keep them above controversies. Her administration will take up projects for the members, she said. Hasina reiterated Bangladesh's full support to the United Nations charter on "Maintaining Peace and International Security". She then launched a photo exhibition on Bangladesh peacekeepers. State minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud, army chief General Moeen U Ahmed and UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien also spoke.
