 NEW DELHI, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The loss of Zaheer Khan could diminish India's chances of retaining the Twenty20 World Cup, fellow fast bowler Ishant Sharma said on Wednesday. The 20-year-old Sharma is confident, however, he can help make up for the absence of the injured Zaheer if he misses the tournament in England starting on June 5. India are waiting for word on Zaheer, who injured his left shoulder during the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has stayed in South Africa for treatment. "It is really bad news for the Indian team because he is injured," Sharma told Reuters during a promotional campaign for the Twenty20 tournament. "The way he helps out each and every fast bowler in the team is tremendous. So obviously it is going to harm India's bowling in some way." Ishant sealed his place in India's side after he was chosen for the home test series against Pakistan in late 2007, his pace and control troubling batsmen of the calibre of Australian skipper Ricky Ponting. He has had modest performances in the shortened form of the game, but said: "In Twenty20, you have to be more skilful and should know to use your variations at the right time. It is about bowling in the right areas. SERIES VICTORIES "We're obviously a good side, we're very confident. But things can happen." He said team work and left-arm bowler Rudra Pratap Singh would help bail out the side if Zaheer was ruled out. The 30-year-old Zaheer was in superb form alongside Ishant when they helped India win last year's home test series against Australia and England and away to New Zealand in April. "It is not only me to take responsibility," he said. "RP Singh did quite a lot in the last Twenty20 World Cup. Maybe he can do it this time also." In 2007, the 23-year-old Singh played a key role in India's first test series win in England for 22 years and is familiar with the pitch conditions. He also grabbed 12 wickets during India's triumph in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa the same year. Although India are strong contenders again, Sachin Tendulkar has raised concerns the players could be fatigued after the IPL, but Ishant said he was raring to go. "We are playing quite a lot and he is the most senior guy...Obviously we have to look after all these things," he said. "(But) it is all about playing cricket for your country which means giving your 100 percent every game.
