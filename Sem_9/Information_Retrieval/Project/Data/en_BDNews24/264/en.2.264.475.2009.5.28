 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)The death toll in the wake of Cyclone Aila continues to rise with twelve more bodies being recovered in the worst hit districts of Khulna and Satkhira, and different estimates put the number of deaths at between 147 and 176 on Thursday. Eight bodies were recovered in Koyra upazila, Khulna, and four in Shyamnagar upazila, Satkhira. There are still mixed reports of the exact number of deaths from the cylone that struck the southwest coast on Monday. The food and disaster minister put the figure at 147 in a briefing Thursday, while compilations of local reports put the death toll at 176 by Thursday night. The government said 43 cyclone victims have been reported dead in Khulna. But Khulna locals say besides the 41 deaths in Koyra, nine died in Dakop upazila and one in Batiaghata, bringing the death toll to 51 in the district so far. Local reports from Satkhira put the death toll in the district at 47, while the government says 44. Water was slow to recede from most parts of Koyra and Dakop on Thursday. During low tide in the morning, water levels fell a little but rose again during high tide at 3pm, with little fluctuation in water levels compared to usual tidal differences. Diarrhoea deaths reported in Satkhira in Aila aftermath Meanwhile, at least four people have been reported to have died of diarrhoea in the cyclone affected district of Satkhira on Thursday, said local officials. Union parishad chairmen and local leaders and journalists said diarrhoea and skin disease were breaking out in the area as flood waters became stagnant and polluted. The dead were identified by locals as Abdul Wahab of Mirgang village in Shymnagar upazila, his son Khokan, and Wasek Ali and Mostafa Kazi of Protabnagar village in Ashashuni upazila. However, deputy commissioner Abdus Samad, at a local meeting, said he had received no news of the deaths. Samad said, "Upazila nirbahi officers have been directed to remain alert for outbreaks of diarrhoea and to ensure medical service." Families of dead to get Tk 5000 in cyclone aid The government has allocated Tk 5000 as aid for each family of the 147 people who have been confirmed dead in the wake of cyclone Aila, said food and disaster minister Abdur Razzak on Thursday. The families will receive up to Tk 20,000 in phases, he added. The finance ministry has allotted Tk 20 crore for rehabilitation of damaged households. For food and other immediate aid another Tk 10 crore and five thousand tonnes of rice have also been set aside. "The ministry so far has confirmed the death of 147, and some 10 others are reported missing in Bhola. The list of injured totals 6,708," said the minister in a press briefing. He said 783,283 families in 587 unions of 76 upazilas in 15 districts have been affected by the cyclone that blasted the southwest coast on Monday. "All the related ministries are working together to come up with coordinated details of losses," said Razzak. He added that the ministries will sit together to come up with total figures in a coordination meeting on Monday. The minister said, "Donors, aid agencies and other countries are giving assurance of help. USAID has already started working in the cyclone battered region. World Bank, UNDP and others are preparing to join." "We have initiated the rehabilitation work under local arrangements for now. We will accept the help of international organisations for long-term relief and rehabiliation measures." Razzak said initiatives will be taken to reconstruct the 813 kilometres of flood embankments that were swept away in different places by the cyclone before next monsoon. "We already had talks with the finance ministry about it," he said. bdnews24.com/corr
