<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday stayed for three months a third government notice on opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia to vacate her cantonment house, and asked authorities to explain the legality of the notice within three weeks. A High Court bench of justices of Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury had earlier resumed proceedings on a petition filed by the BNP chairperson regarding the notice to quit the 6 Moinul Road house. Khaleda Zia filed the petition with the High Court on May 3 challenging the executive order. Meanwhile, the authorities last Sunday served a third notice on the former prime minister to leave her Dhaka Cantonment house by June 30. Before the hearing Wednesday, the bench said important constitutional and legal questions were involved with the petition and so it required careful review and examination. The bench issued its three-month stay order after a more than two-hour long hearing. It also directed the defence secretary, cabinet secretary, director of the military lands and cantonments directorate, and the military land administrator to reply within three weeks as to why the notice on Khaleda should not be declared illegal. During the hearing, Khaleda's lawyer Moudud Ahmed said the BNP chief "was in no way involved with the allotment process of the house." "General Ziaur Rahman stayed in the house while he was an army officer, deputy chief of the army, army chief and even president," he said. "Khaleda was allotted the house in line with the proper legal procedure," he said. "Besides, the government cannot disown a person of his property even if it is allotted by mistake by the government," said Moudud, a former law minister. Earlier in the hearing, attorney general Mahbubey Alam recalled the contribution of the independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, four national leaders slain in the 'Jail Killings', and language movement heroes. He questioned "What have the families of those martyrs got for their unique contribution to the nation?" "Khaleda Zia was allotted about eight bighas of land illegally under political influence," said the attorney general. The bench had earlier convened to hear the petition on Tuesday, after postponing proceedings on Monday as Khaleda's lawyer appealed for more time. Khaleda's chief counsel TH Khan had sought one day to submit the latest notice received by the BNP chairperson. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam also appealed for another day to prepare. The directorate of military lands and cantonments served Khaleda the original notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. She then challenged the legality of the Apr 20 notice, filing a writ petition with the High Court on May 3. After being refused by four High Court benches, a fifth bench accepted Khaleda's petition on May 12. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that she violated lease terms. After the murder of army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman, during a military coup in 1981, his widow Khaleda was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the cantonment house the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre cantonment mansion was originally the official home of the deputy army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia, who later became army chief and installed himself as a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the BDR mutiny earlier this year
