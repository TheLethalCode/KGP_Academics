<TITLE> Venus whimpers out, Portuguese deafens fans </TITLE>

 PARIS, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tortured and tormented Venus Williams whimpered out of the French Open on Friday while Portuguese teenager Michelle Larcher de Brito made a very noisy departure from the big stage. After labouring through her first match, surviving a match point in the second, American third seed Williams was finally put out of her misery in the third round when she was tossed out by rising Hungarian Agnes Szavay 6-0 6-4. But the tournament's first real shock could not match the commotion created by a 16-year-old grand slam debutante. Fans scrambled for their earplugs at Roland Garros when the decibel level went up several notches before France's Aravane Rezai finally silenced Larcher de Brito 7-6 6-2. While Larcher de Brito deafened fans, top seed Dinara Safina and Serbs Ana Ivanovic and Novak Djokovic made serene progress. Russian Safina set up a last-16 date with Rezai by thundering past teenage compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2 6-0 and holder Ivanovic pulled off an equally emphatic 6-0 6-2 drubbing of Czech Iveta Benesova. Men's fourth seed Djokovic wasted little time in finishing off Ukrainian qualifier Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-3 6-4 6-1 in their interrupted second round match. EAR SPLITTING None of the big names could grab the spotlight from Larcher de Brito. Standing at just 1.65 metres, Larcher de Brito is petite for a tennis player but she more than makes up for it with a cacophony of ear-splitting shrieks that follows her every groundstroke. So loud is her sonic boom, it lasts long after she has made contact with the ball and fans could have been forgiven for thinking Concorde was once again airborne and making an emergency landing on Philippe Chatrier Court. Rezai certainly thought so as she complained to the umpire several times during the match and even insisted he should consult the grand slam supervisor on the issue. "Please, there is a limit, enough," an angry Rezai shouted. Larcher de Brito fired back: "There are no rules, so there is nothing I can do about it." Larcher de Brito is latest luminary to emerge from the Nick Bollettieri tennis academy in Florida where other grunting graduates include Monica Seles and Maria Sharapova. Williams barely raised a groan as she was hopelessly outclassed by 29th seed Szavay who never lost belief during the 81-minute encounter. In just 30 minutes, Williams saw the first set vanish before her eyes as she suffered her first love set drubbing since July 2007. On that occasion she rebounded to beat Nadia Petrova in the Fed Cup but there were to be no second chances on Friday. The seven-times major winner raised a glimmer of hope when she nosed ahead 4-3 in the second set but surrendered that advantage with a dreadful double fault. From then on, there was going to be only one winner, and a backhand into the net ended the American's dream. As Szavay performed a celebratory jig, Venus could only glance skywards as she made the long walk towards the exit. Former champion Juan Carlos Ferrero also went out following a 6-4 2-6 6-4 6-7 6-3 defeat by Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in the second round. Eighth seed Fernando Verdasco reached the fourth round for the third year running when he won the all-Spanish battle 6-2 7-6 7-6 against Nicolas Almagro
