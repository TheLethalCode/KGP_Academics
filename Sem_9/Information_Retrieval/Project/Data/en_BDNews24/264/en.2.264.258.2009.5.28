<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)BNP chief Khaleda Zia has trashed the government-initiated probe report on BDR carnage out of sheer jealousy, the commerce minister has said. "The BNP-led alliance during their rule either purposely or because of incompetence failed to unearth any of the untoward occurrences or accidents that riddled the tenure," Faruq Khan told reporters in his office.. "That's the plain reason why the BNP chief has not taken the BDR rebellion investigation report graciously." Khan, who is also the chief coordinator of all the probes launched into the BDR tragedy, said, "We believe in transparency and accountability and practice them too." "Khaleda Zia can of course expect a fuller report from us, as the Awami League is a democratic party." Asked if the government will ever publish a fuller version of the report, he said, "In all countries, everywhere, a probe report usually has three versionsopen, secret and top secret." "It is in the best interest as well as the security of the people and the state that the secret matters are usually not made public." Earlier, the Saudi Arabian envoy Abdullah Bin Nasser Al Bushairy met with the commerce minister and discussed bilateral trade issues. Home minister Sahara Khatun on the other hand claimed in public that the government has published the BDR probe report in full. "Khaleda Zia is used to blurting out mindless expressions. When I had gone into the Peelkhana during the BDR rebellion, she had demanded that I should quit," Khatun told reporters at after a meeting held the home ministry. "I wouldn't like to respond to her comments." The BDR probe committee filed the report to the home minister on May 21 and the seven-page report was published on Wednesday. Khaleda on Wednesday demanded that the report be published in its entirety. "The government is scared to publish the report submitted by the committee whose hands and feet had been tied before they even initiated the probe." "The government has published only parts of the report which it considered have met their requirements." bdnew
