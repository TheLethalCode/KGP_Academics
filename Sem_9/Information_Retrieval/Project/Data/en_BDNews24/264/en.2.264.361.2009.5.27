<TITLE> Ruthless Safina not expecting pat on back </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Dinara Safina was not expecting a pat on the back from her coach despite demolishing fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko 6-1 6-1 to storm into the third round of the French Open on Wednesday. Safina, gunning for a maiden grand slam title, will next face compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova after the 27th seed dismissed France's Julie Coin. After whitewashing Britain's Anne Keothavong in the first round, the 2008 runner-up extended her winning-game streak to 17 by bagging the first five games against Diatchenko on Wednesday. Asked whether her coach, Zeljko Krajan, was happy with her performance, Safina responded with a smile: "If one day he's going to be happy, I think I will finish my career. He is never happy. Even today, he is not happy." Top seed Safina, who has lost only once on clay this season, was barely bothered by the blip of dropping two game and wrapped up the win with a forehand winner after 55 minutes. Like her coach, the world number one would not get carried away by her performance. "I think I just played a good game today, good enough to win. She is still young, and I think she respects me too much," she told a news conference. One of the few things that might have annoyed Krajan was when his protegee let Diatchenko, the world number 153, have a break point in the third game of the first set, although Safina shrugged it off with a jaw-dropping backhand winner. The 23-year-old Russian, who dropped serve in the second set, felt her game was clicking after she had sometimes struggled in the early rounds of previous tournaments. "It is always tough at the beginning of the season. Some people, they're playing straight their best tennis," said Safina, who won in Rome and Madrid earlier this month. "I think I just needed a few tournaments and with every tournament I started to feel better and better. Of course, it helped me to win two titles, and I just started to play better and better.
