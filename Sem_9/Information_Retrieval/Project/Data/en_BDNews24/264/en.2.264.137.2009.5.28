 ROME, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lionel Messi was hailed by his coach as the world's best player after he scored Barcelona's second goal in their 2-0 Champions League final victory over Manchester United and ended as the competition's top scorer. The match in Rome had been hyped as a duel between the world's two best players, Argentine Messi and United's Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo.

Messi made 51 passes on the night with a success rate of 84 percent, while Ronaldo made 31 and completed 68 percent.
