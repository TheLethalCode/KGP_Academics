<TITLE> BNP wants technical team at Tipaimukh site </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP has asked the government to send a joint team of technical experts instead of an all-party parliamentary committee to inspect the Tipaimukh dam construction site. "Inspection of all-party parliamentary committee is of no use. They will approve a project against public interest," BNP vice president and Hafiz Uddin Ahmed said at a press briefing at his Banani residence on Thursday. "Besides, since the topic of Tipaimukh dam construction is controversial it is not right for the parliamentary committee to go there," the former water resources minister added. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakrabarty on Wednesday that an all-party parliamentary committee would report on the pros and cons of the proposed barrage in India before the government made a decision on the disputed project. He said construction of Tipaimukh dam will create desert and salinity in the country and reduce the water flow of Meghna, Surma and Kushiara rivers. It will create water-logging in the Haor areas of Sylhet, he said. Ahmed threatened that his party would start an all-out movement if this project was not cancelled. Formal objections, through letters and joint river commission meetings, were raised during the rule of former president Ziaur Rahman, Khaleda Zia and other governments. "But India neither gave any specific reply to those nor provided any data or information on the project. No expert could inspect the area to date." "We are not satisfied the way the Awami League government is treating the matter. We hope they will resolve it through bilateral discussion." The BNP leader said India proposed the dam in 1972 in the meeting of the joint river commission. People of Mizoram and Manipur states of India and the civil society of India are also objecting to the construction, he said. The 'pro-reformist' BNP leader said the BNP submitted the amended party constitution to the Election Commission and that they were all united the leadership of Khaleda. Ahmed was appointed acting secretary general of the reformist faction of BNP under the leadership of Saifur Rahman at a meeting of the standing committee on Oct 29, 2007 during the emergency rules. b
