<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Batting great Sachin Tendulkar believes India will retain the Twenty20 World Cup next month, saying skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team were the world's best in the most explosive form of the game. "India is the most balanced side in the world and there is no doubt we can defend the title," Tendulkar told the DNA newspaper on Thursday. "We have very good cricketers in our side and we have proved that this combination is the deadliest," added the record-breaking batsman, who does not play in Twenty20 internationals. Dhoni led a young Indian team to a surprise success in South Africa two years ago to ensure the game's shortest format gained instant popularity in cricket's commercial hub. Wicketkeeper-batsman Dhoni heads a young, vibrant bunch to the second edition in England starting on June 5. India are in Group A with Bangladesh and Ireland. "The best part is that our team can take any amount of pressure and still perform," Tendulkar added. "Team India actually thrives on pressure. So I would like to put my money on India." India will be carrying a five-man pace attack to exploit the seaming conditions in England, although the wily Zaheer Khan is an injury doubt. "It is on par with the best," Tendulkar said of an attack spearheaded by the pacy Ishant Sharma. "Zaheer, Ishant, Rudra Pratap Singh form a lethal combination, particularly in English conditions. "Our seam attack has a lot of variety and that would come handy in such conditions. On our day, we can demolish any batting side. "We come as a package... (and) I am certain this package is the best in business at the moment. This package has everything which is necessary to make us world champions once again.
