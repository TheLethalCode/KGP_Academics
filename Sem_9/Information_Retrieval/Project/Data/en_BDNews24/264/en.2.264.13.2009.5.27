 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)The national probe body on the BDR mutiny has recommended trying the mutineers under the Army Act for fast trial. The government's probe into the BDR mutiny was finally made public Wednesday, three months after the Feb 25-26 carnage at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. The national enquiry committee, headed by M Anisuzzaman Khan, submitted the report to home minister Sahara Khatun on May 21, . "We've prepared the report objectively based on facts. We've performed the mammoth task despite various limitations," Anisuzzaman told reporters at the time. The government formed the inquiry committee on Feb 26, originally headed by the home minister, but later reformed the committee with the retired civil servant as its chief amid calls for removal of ministers. The re-constituted committee, formed on Mar 2, began work the following day. The first deadline for its report, March 9, was extended by seven working days. On Mar 23, the committee asked for and received another four days. Finally on Mar 30, the committee was allowed 30 more workdays to submit the report for a proper investigation into the bloodbath at the border force's headquarters in Dhaka that left at least 57 army officers dead. bdnew
