 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank has directed banks and other financial institutions not to grant loans for development of industries or housing estates on illegally filled water bodies. The directive came on Wednesday at a meeting of central bank boss Atiur Rahman with the chief executives of the financial institutions, deputy governor Nazrul Huda told reporters. This was the first meeting between Atiur Rahman as Bangladesh Bank chief and heads of banks and non bank financial institutions. He said, "The governor has directed them to grant loans for housing or industries only after proper review and investigation on whether the developers are environment friendly or building on filled up canals and rivers." Huda said the central bank is also mulling raising the capital base of banks and non-bank financial institutions. "Initiatives are being taken to increase minimum paid-up capital of private banks to Tk 400 crore from Tk 200 crore and for NFBIs from Tk 25 crore to Tk 50 crore," he said. Huda said the meeting also expressed concern over the rise in loan defaults by NBFIs. He said out of Tk 10,500 crore disbursed as loan among them, the amount of defaults stood at over Tk 700 crore. bd
