 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)Police in Bangladesh have arrested Indian fugitive Abdur Rouf Merchant, also known as Daud Merchant, convicted of the murder of Mumbai music magnate Gulshan Kumar, officials said Thursday. Merchant, who was serving his sentence in an Indian jail since 2002, was reported absconding by Indian police after being released on furlough in April to visit his family in Mumbra, a small town about 40km from Mumbai. Bangladesh's Detective Branch police picked Merchant up on Tuesday night from the residence of a man named Kamal Miah in Mourail in Bramhanbaria district. Dhaka Metropolitan Police have made no official statement but an assistant commissioner of the DMP's Detective Branch confirmed the arrest. Bramhanbaria police super Mukhlesur Rahman told reporters, quoting Detective Branch officials, that Merchant had recently arrived in the district after crossing illegally into Bangladesh through the Akhaura border. Rahman said he had also procured a Bangladeshi passport in the mean time in order to pass himself off as a local. Police also arrested Kamal Miah for sheltering the Indian fugitive. Kamal's wife Ferdousi told bdnews24.com Merchant came to stay at their house three to four days ago. "He introduced himself as 'Mojahid' and said he was a motor parts dealer," she said. Ferdousi also said her husband came to know him through another man named Billal Miah. She claimed they did not know the man they called 'Mojahid' was in fact a wanted criminal. From the call list of Merchant's mobile phone, police suspect that he also has contacts with notorious underground mafia don Daud Ibrahim. Gulshan Kumar, renowned owner of Indian music company T-series, was shot dead on the streets of Mumbai on Aug 12, 1997, believed to have been murdered by contract after refusing to pay extortion money to gangsters. bdnews24.com
