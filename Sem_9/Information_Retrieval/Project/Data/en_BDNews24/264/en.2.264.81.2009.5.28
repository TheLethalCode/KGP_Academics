 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)The government has launched the National Food Policy Plan of Action aiming to ensure food security for all by 2015. About 40 percent of the country's population suffers from nutritional problem, according to figures from the international development agencies. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury along with food minister Abdur Razzaq launched the action plan on Thursday at the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Center. The document contains detailed objectives to improve food availability, access to food and nutrition. It also chalks out responsibilities of each ministry and recommends standards for measuring success. Motia told the audience that the government was committed to increase the country's farm output and purchasing power of the people. "We are taking steps to continue and even increase subsidies in agricultural inputs as well as strengthening the government's food procurement system in an effort to keep the market stable," she said. Speaking to reporters afterwards, the minister said that the government was also mulling over large-scale reforms in the water management system to facilitate irrigation. "Already, the finance ministry has given Tk 400 crore to the BADC (Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation) for wetland management," she added. Food minister Razzaq stressed diversification of production to ensure maximum possible supply of other staple food items from domestic source. "The real challenge is to sustain per capita availability of rice from domestic production in the wake of rising population, land degradation, climate change and increased disaster frequencies," he added. Emerging from the launching ceremony, the minister told the media that the main problem for efficient food procurement was lack of warehouses. He said that the coming fiscal year would see projects to increase the government's warehouse capacity by almost 2.9 lakh tonnes. US ambassador James Moriarty, head of European Commission delegation Stefan Frowein and FAO representative Ad Spijkers also spoke at the session chaired by food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman. The US government through the USAID and the European Union have provided $ 7 million to fund the Plan of Action, developed under the National Food Policy Capacity Strengthening Program. It will implemented jointly by UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the government. The program aims to enhance government capacity to oversee a comprehensive equitable, gender-sensitive and poverty-targeted food policy.
