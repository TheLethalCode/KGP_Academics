<TITLE> COMMENT Fearing the supermen of Guantanamo </TITLE>

 COLUMN By Bernd Debusmann Washington, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Americans need to be afraid, very afraid. If President Barack Obama has his way, the country will soon be at serious risk of terrorist attacks coordinated by Muslim men held in maximum security prisons from where no-one has ever escaped. These inmates possess superhuman strength and cunning. Even in solitary confinement, they might recruit fellow inmates to the cause of al Qaeda and incite riots. They might succeed where the worst of the worst American criminals failed - break out and disappear, seamlessly blending into the community. Next thing you know  a mushroom cloud. Such scenarios come to mind when one follows the debate over Obama's plan to close the infamous detention center at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base on the eastern tip of Cuba, and move some of the inmates to prisons in the United States. This has prompted expressions of dismay both from the political right and from Obama's fellow Democrats in Congress, and the language used in the debate has taken on a surreal quality. Phrases like "releasing dangerous terrorists into our neighborhoods" and "relocating terrorists to American communities" convey the impression that Guantanamo detainees will wander the streets, shopping for sandals and guns. "To  bring the worst of the worst terrorists inside the United States would be the cause for great danger and regret in the years to come," according to former Vice President Dick Cheney. "We have to make sure that streets and neighborhoods don't think that they're going to be the repository of Guantanamo prisoners," warned Barbara Mikulski, a Democratic Senator. A group of Republican congressmen drafted a "Keep terrorists out of America Act" early in May. America, for the purposes of the act, means American prisons. It is ironic that politicians in the U.S., which holds more people behind bars than any other country, profess to have so little faith in a system that costs billions to run and includes high-security "supermax" institutions where dangerous inmates spend all but four hours a week in their cell. If these fears are more than just political theater, are they justified or are they the security equivalent of other mass psychoses, say the irrational belief that house prices would go up forever? "In terms of escaping, U.S. prisons are extremely secure," says Alan Elsner, a Reuters correspondent and author of Gates of Injustice, a book on the American prison system. "The fears being voiced now are driven entirely by emotion." OBAMA TRIPPED UP And lack of rational reflection. Not to mention a generous dose of NIMBY (not in my back yard) politics and a bad case of mishandling a delicate issue on the part of Obama, who left it too late to explain where the 240 detainees held in Guantanamo would go once the prison there is closed as planned, by next January. His fellow Democrats in the Senate joined Republicans in a 90-6 vote to block $80 million in funds to pay for the closure. Barely noticed in the hubbub: the federal high security prisons in Colorado and Indiana where Guantanamo inmates would probably move already hold convicted terrorists linked to al Qaeda, including Zacarias Moussaoui, found guilty of helping to plot the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the twin towers in Manhattan and the Pentagon, and Ramzi Yousef, who led the first attack on the World Trade Center. How many of the detainees still held in Guantanamo qualify for the "worst of the worst" label is anyone's guess. After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the military rounded up 779 suspected "enemy combatants" and shipped them to Guantanamo. More than 500 were released without being charged. There have been only three prosecutions under a much-criticized military tribunal system authorized by President George W. Bush to try foreign terrorist suspects outside regular civilian or military courts. One defendant pleaded guilty, one was convicted in a contested trial and one after putting up no defense. Where and when the rest of the detainees will be tried is not clear. What is clear is that Obama will try hard to fulfil his pledge, made on his first day in office, to close Guantanamo, whose existence, he says, "created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained." Stalwarts of the Republican party, an organization in deep disarray and looking for an issue that could draw from a bi-partisan well of fear and xenophobia, did not quite see it that way. "In my view, what is driving this issue is a quest for popularity in Europe, more than continuing policies that have demonstrably made America safe since 9/11," said Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican minority in Congress. Cheney echoed that thought in a speech harshly critical of Obama: "The administration has found that it's easy to receive applause in Europe for closing Guantanamo. "But it's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and America's national security." Ah, yes, it's all for those Europeans Obama wants to court.
