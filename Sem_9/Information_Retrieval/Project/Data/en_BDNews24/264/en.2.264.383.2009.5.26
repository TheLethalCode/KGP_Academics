<TITLE> Mel Gibson says girlfriend is pregnant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actor Mel Gibson, who is going through a divorce from his wife of 28 years, said on Monday his Russian girlfriend is expecting their baby. "This is true," Gibson said during an appearance on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" after the host asked him to confirm speculation that musician Oksana Grigorieva was pregnant. Gibson, 53, who already has seven children, gave away few details, replying jokingly, "A human being, I think," when Leno asked about the baby's gender. Celebrity gossip websites said the baby was due in the autumn. Gibson appeared to rule out any marriage plans, saying, "Who would do it twice?" Gibson's wife, Robyn, filed for divorce last month, citing irreconcilable differences with the "Lethal Weapon" star. Gibson, dressed in blue jeans, blue blazer and white dress shirt, appeared philosophical about the divorce, saying, "I did a pretty good hatchet job on my marriage." He said he and his wife split up three years ago, shortly after he was arrested in Malibu for drunken driving and launched into an alcohol-fueled tirade against Jews. He apologized and sought treatment for alcoholism. Gibson told Leno he met Grigorieva, 39, in 2008 after the singer/pianist had been signed to his Icon Records label. They appeared in public together a month ago at a Los Angeles industry screening of "X-Men Wolverine: Origins." Gibson was raised in Australia and was one of the highest- paid and most popular actors in the world in the 1990s, winning best-director and best-picture Oscars for his 1995 movie "Braveheart."
