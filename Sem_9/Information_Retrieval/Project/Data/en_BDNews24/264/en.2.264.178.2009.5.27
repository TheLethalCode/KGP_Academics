 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com) - A powerful bomb went off outside an emergency police service office on Lahore's Mall Road on Wednesday, killing 30 people and wounding 150 others. Intermittent firing was also heard ahead of the blast and following it. NDTV, which had earlier said 40 people died, lowered the count to 30. The BBC put the number of dead at 23, and Reuters at 15. Officials say there is a chance the device had been planted inside a car parked between buildings and offices of intelligence agencies. There are many versions of what really happened on Wednesday morning. One eyewitness says two-three men -- possibly suicide bombers entered "Building 1-5". They came in an ambulance. Shortly after a blast was heard. Some men came out firing and managed to escape. Others say, a red van came towards the police building. It tried to go through the barricade. The blast took place right outside "Building 1-5". The building was completely razed and over 40 vehicles destroyed and road reduced to rubble as a result of the blast. The police commandoes have taken position in nearby buildings. The army has been called in. Two suspects have been arrested, reports say. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. The rescue operations are on. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, on his part, has ordered probe into the blast. Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik says the blast could be result of military operation against the Taliban in Swat valley. PTI adds the attack was apparently aimed at the Punjab province headquarters of the ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency. An explosives-laden vehicle apparently targetting the ISI headquarters went off in crowded Civil Lines area. The vehicle could not reach the ISI building and blew off at a barrier close to the complex. Reports said some suspects picked up in connection with the March 3 terror attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore, were inside the ISI office when the blast took place. The ISI building sustained some damage due to the impact of the explosion that occured before noon, witnesses said. The blast comes less than two months after the attack on the Police academy at Manawan, close to Lahore on March 30 this year, when armed gunmen laid a siege resulting in the killing of 10 people including eight policemen. Lahore was also the scene of an attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team on March 3, in which eight people, including six police officials were killed and six cricketers were injured.
