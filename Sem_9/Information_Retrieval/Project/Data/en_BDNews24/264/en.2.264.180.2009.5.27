 Washington, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama on Tuesday urged Myanmar's ruling generals to release opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi "immediately and unconditionally." "I strongly condemn her house arrest and detention, which have also been condemned around the world," Obama said in a statement. Suu Kyi, a 63-year-old Nobel Peace laureate, has been under house arrest for six years and faces a trial that has been condemned by the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and human rights groups. She is accused of violating the terms of that house arrest by allowing an American intruder to stay in her home in early May. Suu Kyi is widely expected to be found guilty and faces up to five years in prison. "I call on the Burmese government to release National League for Democracy Secretary General and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from detention immediately and unconditionally," said Obama, referring to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Obama, who renewed U.S. sanctions on Myanmar on May 15, called the charges against Suu Kyi spurious and said the trial cast doubt on the Myanmar government's "willingness to be a responsible member of the international community." Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a 1990 election landslide only to be denied power, and she has been in prison or under house arrest for more than half of the last two decades.
