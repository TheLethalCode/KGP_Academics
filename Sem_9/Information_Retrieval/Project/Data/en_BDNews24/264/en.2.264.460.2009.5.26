Its investigators found no evidence that any of the victims were armed or that they had been used as human shields, Nadery said, although provincial officials had told the team that two of the dead were Taliban fighters.

The issue of civilian deaths, particularly from air strikes, has fuelled resentment towards the almost 80,000 foreign troops in the country fighting a growing Taliban insurgency.
