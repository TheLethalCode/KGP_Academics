<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)Too much is being said on the Tipaimukh dam construction by India without having knowledge on the issue, the commerce minister has said. He slammed those environmentalists, experts, and political parties for opposing the dam at Tipaimukh. "Those who are talking about what is happening there is talking with no knowledge (what was really going on)," Faruq Khan told reporters after a seminar on 'Regional Connectivity: Potential for Infrastructure Development and Energy in South Asia' at Hotel Sonargaon on Tuesday. The SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry and FBCCI co-hosted the seminar in the city. The government will send an expert and parliamentary team within some days to visit the dam at Tipaimukh. They will report what was happening there and how much benefit Bangladesh stand to gain from the project, Khan added. It will only support the construction of the dam at Tipaimukh if Bangladesh benefitted, Khan added. The minister e said it was possible to generate thousands megawatts of power if hydro power could be by erecting dam. He stressed regional cooperation in communications and energy sector, including ports and said the government wanted development of people of South Asia region and its people through enhancement of communications systems. "We want to make our ports regional and Asian. We want to bring development to our people through enhancement of communications system in this region," he told the seminar. The many resources in the region could not be utilised in the past because of political reasons, Khan observed. "The blame mostly goes to lack of political will in our region. We could not develop our region together politically." It was also possible to develop agriculture in the region through better irrigation system, he told the seminar. The regional connections can be an effective way to face the current economic crisis in the country. There needs firm political and economic goodwill to realise it. SCCI president Tarique Syed said the issue of road connections with India under the proposed Asian Highway network has to be seen from global point of view. FBCCI president Annisul Huq stressed on enhancement of road connections. "Politicians need to have solutions to Farakka and Kashmir. But , businesses need connections." Despite having shared history, civilisation and proximity of border, a free trade area could not be created on the lack of realisation. bd
