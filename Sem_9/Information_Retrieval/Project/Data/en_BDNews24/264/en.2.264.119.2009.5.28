 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has recommended introduction of identity cards for the fishermen in the coastal areas to facilitate future rehabilitation programmes after natural disasters such as the recent Cyclone Aila. ABM Ashraf Uddin, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the fisheries ministry, after a meeting Thursday, told reporters that the identity cards would help determine the number of genuine fishermen. "We have recommended that the ministry must introduce identity cards for all fishermen, especially of the coastal areas, as early as possible. At present, the ministry has no accurate tally of 'genuine fishermen'," Ashraf told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. He said his committee suggested identity cards while discussing the rehabilitation of the 50,000 fishermen in the coastal belt hit by recent cyclone Aila. He said ID cards would reduce waste and corruption in rehabilitation projects. "Since there is no genuine list of fishermen, many government officials resort to corrupt practices in welfare measures," said Ashraf. He said the identity cards would help the affected fishermen in applying for boats and nets from the government too. Ministry officials told the meeting that cyclone Aila washed away shrimp worth Tk 384 crore in Khulna, Satkhira and Bagerhat districts. Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas, Md Zillul Hakim, Md Mokbul Hossain, Md Elias Uddin Mollah, Monjur Quader Quraishi and Mir Shawkat Ali Badsha attended the meeting. Dhaka Zoo comes under scanner The watchdog also formed a sub-committee, headed by Mir Shawkat Ali Badsha, to unearth alleged corruption in Dhaka Zoo. The three-member body will submit its findings in one month. "The zoo authorities have told us that they buy beef at Tk 170 per kilogramme while the government-fixed rate is Tk 220 for same quantity," said Ashraf. "How it's possible, we have to look into it". He said some officials have collaborated with land grabbers to occupy two acres of land of Dhaka Zoo lake.
