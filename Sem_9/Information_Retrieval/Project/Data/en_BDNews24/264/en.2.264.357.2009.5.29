<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's hopes of retaining the World Twenty20 title next month were boosted on Friday with news that pace bowler Zaheer Khan was expected to recover from injury before the second group game. "Zaheer is most likely to get fit by the second or third game...not exactly sure...He's not 100 percent fit for the first game," captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said. Zaheer, India's leading bowler over the last two seasons, underwent rehabilitation in South Africa after picking up a shoulder injury during the Indian Premier League (IPL). The 30-year-old left-armer was in the Indian team that left on Friday for the tournament with a five-man pace attack to exploit seam-friendly conditions in England. "We have got talent like Praveen Kumar, Rudra Pratap Singh who can really swing the ball, and (Irfan) Pathan," Dhoni told a media conference prior to the team's departure. Dhoni backed his side, who meet Bangladesh and Ireland in Group A of the 12-team tournament, to defend the crown. "I'm blessed with a side that is really talented," wicketkeeper-batsman Dhoni said. "(It's) not only about talent, I think each and every individual has been part of the side since the last T20 World Cup." India's batting runs deep with several all-rounders in the 15-member squad and variety in the bowling attack. Dhoni heads a vibrant bunch amid high expectations in cricket-crazy India after he led a young side with success in the inaugural tournament in South Africa two years ago. "There is no pressure on us," Dhoni said of the tag of defending champions. "The IPL has really helped, we are in the mould of the Twenty20 game.
