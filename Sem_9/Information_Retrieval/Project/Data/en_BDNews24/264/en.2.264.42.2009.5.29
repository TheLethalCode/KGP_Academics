 Dhaka,May29 (bdnews24.com)Police have launched a manhunt for other cohorts of detained Indian fugitive Abdur Rouf Merchant alias Daud Merchant, an official said. The official of Criminal Investigation Department, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com on Friday evening that they had taken along Daud Merchant and two other arrestees, Kamal Mian and Jahid, to apprehend the others. The official added that none had been arrested until evening. Daud Merchant's motive to hide in Bangladesh was being investigated. Police on Thursday said they had detained the Indian criminal, convicted of the murder of Mumbai music magnate Gulshan Kumar. Merchant, who was serving his sentence in an Indian jail since 2002, was reported absconding by Indian police after being released on parole in April to visit his family in Mumbra, a small town about 40 km from Mumbai. The Detective Branch picked Merchant up on Tuesday night from the residence of Kamal Mian in Mourail in Bramhanbaria district. Bramhanbaria police superintendent Mukhlesur Rahman told reporters that Merchant had recently arrived in the district after crossing illegally into Bangladesh through the Akhaura border. Rahman said Merchant had also bought a Bangladeshi passport in order to pass himself off as a local. Police also arrested Kamal Miah for sheltering the Indian fugitive. Kamal's wife Ferdousi told bdnews24.com Merchant had come to stay at their house three to four days ago. "He introduced himself as 'Mujahid' and said he was a auto parts dealer," she said. Ferdousi also said her husband came to know him through another man named Billal Mian. She claimed they did not know that the man was in fact a wanted criminal. From the call list of Merchant's mobile phone, police suspect that he also had contacts with notorious underground mafia don Daud Ibrahim. Gulshan Kumar, renowned owner of Indian music company T-series, was shot dead on the streets of Mumbai on Aug 12, 1997. He was believed to have been murdered by contract after refusing to pay extortion money to gangsters. bdnew
