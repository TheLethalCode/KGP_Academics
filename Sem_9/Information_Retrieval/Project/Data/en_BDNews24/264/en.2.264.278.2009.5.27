 Lahore, Pakistan, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful bomb went off near a police station in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday, wounding several people and damaging buildings, a Reuters witness and police said. There was no claim of responsibility, but the blast comes as the army is battling militants in the Swat region in the northwest of the country in its most concerted action to push back a growing Taliban insurgency. "It was a strong bomb blast. It damaged several buildings and cars and shattered widows," said police spokesman Nayyab Haider. Haider said he had no information about casualties, but a Reuters witness said he saw several wounded people. Gunshots were heard immediately after the blast but it was not clear who was firing, the witness said. A big cloud of white smoke rose over the city after the blast.
