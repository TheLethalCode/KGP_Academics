 PARIS, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maria Sharapova came back from a break down in the decider to book her place in the third round of the French Open with a 6-2 1-6 8-6 victory over fellow Russian and 11th seed Nadia Petrova on Wednesday. Twelve months after competing in Paris as the world number one, Sharapova turned up ranked 102nd as she is on a comeback trail following a nine-month layoff with a career-threatening shoulder injury. Sharapova, who will next take on Kazakh Yaroslava Shvedova, left Court Suzanne Lenglen blowing kisses to the crowd after winning on her first match point at the end of a two-hour 12-minute catfight.
