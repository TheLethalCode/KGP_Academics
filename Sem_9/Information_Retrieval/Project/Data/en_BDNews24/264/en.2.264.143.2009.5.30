 Tehran, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran executed in public three men convicted of involvement in Thursday's deadly mosque bombing in the southeast of the country, the official IRNA news agency reported on Saturday. "Three people convicted of being involved in the recent terrorist bombing in Zahedan were hanged in public on Saturday morning," IRNA said, adding that the execution took place near the mosque where the bombing took place. A provincial official said on Friday that the people behind the bombing were hired by the United States, an accusation Washington rejected.
