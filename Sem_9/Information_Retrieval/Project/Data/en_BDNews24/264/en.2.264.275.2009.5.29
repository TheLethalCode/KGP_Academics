 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has said she met many foreign leaders to mobilise international support for the government move to hold war crimes trial. She said a reluctant Pakistan wanted to hold further talks with Bangladesh on the trial of war criminals of 1971. The minister in the second week of April visited several countries of Asia, Europe and Africa up to May 28 to have talks on many issues including the trial. She had talks with secretaries-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Commonwealth, the UK's secretary of state David Miliband, the foreign ministers of Norway, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Lebanon, Cuba, Sudan, Zambia and Myanmar. The foreign minister on May 24 also met Pakistan's state minister for foreign affairs Nawabzada Malik Ahmad Khan on the sidelines of the OIC foreign ministers' meeting in Damascus and urged Islamabad to try Pakistani war criminals to meet international obligation. "As the trial of war criminals has come to be a big issue now, it is natural there would be campaigns in favour of or against it," she told reporters at a media briefing at the foreign ministry on Friday. "In that case, we think that we should let the international community know about our move. "We must inform the global community about what we want to do, why we want to do it, how we want to do it and what we want to guarantee. "During my visits, of course, I have tried to do it," Dipu Moni told journalists in reply to bdnews24.com question on whether she was on a hectic tour to garner support for the anticipated trial. She said Bangladesh must try the war criminals to meet its international legal obligation against crime against humanity and huge domestic support for the trial. Dipu Moni said no country including the US, China and Saudi Arabiathat had initially refused to recognise Bangladesh's birthwould support the war criminals involved in the genocide, rape, arson and torture in the bloody nine-month war of independence from Pakistan. The minister said it appeared to her from the discussions with the Pakistani junior foreign minister that Islamabad was trying to shelve the issue to avert its relations with Bangladesh going sour. "We want to heal the old scars. We have to stop the culture of impunity. We want to end the chapter. Dipu Moni said the government will guarantee justice and due processes so that it did not turn into a "victor's trial". "Three million people were killed and 400,000 women were raped. Why will the victims not get justice?" she asked, referring to her conversation with Nawabzada Malik Ahmad Khan in Damascus. "I urged him to try their war criminals as international laws on crime against humanity is also obligatory for Pakistan," said Dipu Moni. "Then he told me to have further talks on it and I told him that we have no problem in holding talks." On May 12, she told Pakistan high commissioner Alamgir Babar in Dhaka that Pakistan should make a formal apology for the killings of 30 million people and rape and torture of 300,000 women and children. A Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson later dismissed Dhaka's call. Pakistan has marked about 200 of its people, mainly army officials, as war criminals. Dipu Moni left for Singapore at 1pm, immediately after the press briefing.
