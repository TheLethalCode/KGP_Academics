<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Fri May 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tearful South Koreans lined the country's streets on Friday for a glimpse of a hearse carrying the body of former President Roh Moo-hyun who leapt to his death from a cliff about a week after being snared in a corruption scandal. Roh's body left his southeastern hometown early Friday as a crush of mourners wept and tossed yellow flowers, a colour associated with Roh, as the hearse began a journey to Seoul for a funeral planned for 0200 GMT. There was some scuffling between police and mourners by a Seoul plaza and not far from where hundreds of thousands lined up this week to pay their last repsects to Roh at a memorial. There has been a mass outpouring of grief for Roh, 62, who left office widely regarded by the public as an ineffective president, that has dented the support rate of his successor Lee Myung-bak with many blaming his government for hounding Roh with the corruption probe. Tens of thousands of riot police have been mobilised to head off any protests against Lee's government, but many mourners said this overwhelming presence has only sparked further anger at Lee. Roh's funeral is the first for one of the country's presidents elected after South Korea began open elections in 1987 and will be held at a palace in central Seoul that was home to Korea's rulers for centuries. Former human rights lawyer Roh, whose five-year term ended in February 2008, had become embroiled in a graft inquiry, the result of confessions by a wealthy shoe manufacturer suspected of bribing several political figures and handing over $6 million in bribes to Roh's family. Police said Roh jumped to his death on May 23 from a rock face behind his home in Bongha Village, leaving a note saying: "the rest of my life would only be a burden for others". POLITICAL CHALLENGE The left-leaning Roh won the 2002 presidential election by riding a wave of anti-Americanism and using the Internet to rally his base of supporters of young professionals who fought in the 1980s democracy movement. His victory surprised himself and the pundits. The scandal tainted an image his supporters tried to nurture of being him a "clean" leader. "The outpouring of mourning led by Roh's supporters may pose a political challenge to the administration of Lee Myung-bak, which has found itself vulnerable to public criticism for reinforcing elitism and deepening longstanding Korean social and political divisions," said Scott Snyder, a senior associate of the Asia Foundation. A self-taught lawyer whose formal education ended at high school, Roh's most celebrated moment came when he went to Pyongyang in 2007 for a summit with Kim Jong-il in what was only the second meeting of leaders of the divided peninsula. In his final year in office, only about one in seven South Koreans said they supported Roh, saying they saw his government as fumbling economic policy. Analysts gave him credit for cleaning up elections and making the presidency more open. President Lee, who won a by a landslide in a December 2007 election on pledges to undo Roh's economic policies and end unconditional handouts to North Korea, faces a difficult task of soothing rancour over Roh's death that threatens his policy reforms. Political fighting in parliament has delayed most of Lee's reforms designed to reshape Asia's fourth-largest economy and steer it through the global financial crisis through tax cuts, labour law reforms and privatisation. Adding to Lee's concerns are North Korea's nuclear test on Monday and subsequent threat to attack its wealthy neigh
