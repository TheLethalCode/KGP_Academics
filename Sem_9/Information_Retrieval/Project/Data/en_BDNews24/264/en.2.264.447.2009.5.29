 KARACHI, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lifted bans on batsman Mohammad Yousuf and allrounder Abdul Razzaq on Friday after their resignations from the unauthorized Indian Cricket League (ICL). "Their resignations have been accepted by the ICL and both players will now be available for Pakistan team selection," the PCB said in a statement. Yousuf, who has played 79 tests and 269 one-day internationals, was rated as Pakistan's top batsman before he joined the ICL last year. "It's a big relief to hear this from the board because I have been dying to play for my country again," Yousuf told Reuters. "I just hope that the rest of the ICL players who also want to play for Pakistan again are given the same consideration by the board." Nineteen Pakistani players joined the ICL which was launched in 2007. Razzaq, who has played in 46 tests and 239 one-dayers, was one of the first to be signed up. "I think when we left to join the ICL the situation was different. We were treated well by them. But now I want to play for my country again and return to international action," he said. The PCB set a May 31st deadline for all Pakistani players who had contracts with the ICL to sever their ties with the league and make themselves available for national selection again
