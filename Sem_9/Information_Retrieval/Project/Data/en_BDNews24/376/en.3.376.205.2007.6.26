<TEXT>
 CAPE TOWN, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A regional branch of South Africa's main trades union said on Tuesday it was suspending participation in a crippling public service strike, a further sign that the three-week stoppage could soon be over. Cracks emerged in the strike on Monday after two unions representing some 160,000 members withdrew from one of the largest mass actions in post apartheid South Africa. The head of the Western Cape wing of the powerful Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) said in a statement that COSATU and independent unions in the region would announce their withdrawal from the strike on Tuesday. Divisions between unions, due to resume talks with the government on ending the strike on Wednesday, may ease pressure on President Thabo Mbeki whose ruling African National Congress (ANC) holds a crucial policy conference the same day. "From experience we know that this means an end to the strike is near. This will strengthen the ANC and give the impression that it is in control in South Africa as it holds the policy meeting," said Susan Booysen, a political analyst at the University of Witwatersrand. Labour has accused Mbeki of promoting big business over the poor. Hundreds of thousands of workers have taken part in the strike that has highlighted deep divisions between the ANC and its powerful trades union allies. Unions, which collectively represent about 60 percent of the country's nearly one million public servants, have lowered their demands to a nine percent pay rise. The government, which fears a dramatic wage hike would crowd out other spending, has tabled a final proposal of 7.5 percent and told unions to take it or leave it. INFLATION FEARS South Africa's central bank has warned a large wage increase would further fuel inflation and raise the prospect of more interest rate hikes. Although the ANC is meant to focus on policies in the meeting which starts on Wednesday, analysts say it is likely to be dominated by a bitter leadership battle that has plunged the party into turmoil. Mbeki and his controversial rival Jacob Zuma are expected to be the frontrunners in the contest. Zuma enjoys wide support from unions and the ANC rank and file despite several scandals and corruption allegations that have tarnished him. Economists say it is difficult to count the lost productivity in Africa's biggest economy, but some estimate it may be as high as 3 billion rand ($418 millio
