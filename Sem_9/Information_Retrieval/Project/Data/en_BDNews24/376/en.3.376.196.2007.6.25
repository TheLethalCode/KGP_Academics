 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  Specials courts designed to hear corruption cases deferred dates for framing charges against Huda couple and two others Monday. Former communications minister Nazmul Huda, wife Sigma Huda, Awami Swechchashebak League general secretary Pankaj Debnath and wife Monica Debnath, and BTTB CBA president Firoz Miah and his wife Rowshan Ara are facing corruption charges pressed by the Anticorruption Commission. Special judges courts housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban changed the dates for framing charges in each case on appeals from defence lawyers. Judge Amar Kumar Roy fixed Sunday for framing charges against Huda and Sigma. Judge Md Firoz Alam fixed Tuesday for framing charges against Pankaj Debnath and Monica. Their lawyers claimed that they did not receive a certified copy of the case. Debnath was present in court, but his wife's whereabouts are unknown. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain shifted the date for charge framing against Firoz Miah and Rowshan Ara to Sunday due to Rowshan's ill health. bdnews24.co
