 JERUSALEM, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration expects Western powers to agree to name Tony Blair as their Middle East envoy soon after he steps down as British prime minister on Wednesday, diplomats said. The Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- would give Blair the job of working with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on building up institutions needed for a future state.
