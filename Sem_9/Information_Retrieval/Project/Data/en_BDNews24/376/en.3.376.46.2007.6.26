 SINGAPORE, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Singapore Telecommunications is likely to buy a 30 percent stake in Warid Telecom in a deal that would value Pakistan's third-largest mobile phone operator at $1 billion, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. Citing unidentified people familiar with the situation, the FT said the Singapore firm had emerged as a strong favourite to buy the stake ahead of rivals MTN of South Africa and Britain's Vodafone. "A deal between SingTel and Warid could be signed as early as next month," the newspaper quoted one of its sources as saying. Warid is owned by the private Abu Dhabi Group, which is one of the largest foreign investor groups in Pakistan and owns Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Wateen Telecom. Industry sources told Reuters last month that Warid had been approached by several international telecommunications firms and that an agreement could be reached in July or August. SingTel has repeatedly said it was interested in Pakistan's fast-growing mobile phone sector.
