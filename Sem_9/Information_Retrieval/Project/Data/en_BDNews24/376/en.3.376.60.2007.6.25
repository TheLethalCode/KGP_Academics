 Chittagong, June 25 (bdnews24.com) - Authorities Monday sent former BNP lawmaker Sarwar Jamal Nizam into one-month detention, a jail official said. Chittagong jail superintendent Bazlur Rashid told bdnews24.com that the detention took effect from Monday. The home ministry proposed the detention order, which was approved by the additional district magistrate, and jail authorities executed the directive after they got a copy of it. A team of Rapid Action Battalion used emergency powers to arrest Nizam early Friday while he was leaving Chittagong Club. The battalion officials seized Nizam's vehicle and three bottles of foreign wine and five cans of beer. A case was filed against Nizam and his driver Mamunur Rashid for possessing alcohol. A Chittagong court Friday ordered him into jail. Nizam's arrest created sensation in the port city, as he was allegedly involved in the abduction and subsequent murder of another BNP leader, Jamaluddin. Jamaluddin's family has long been accusing Nizam of masterminding the kidnap and the murder that occurred during the rule of the latest political government, led by former prime minister Khaleda Zia. bdnews2
