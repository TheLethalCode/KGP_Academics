 NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - US stocks rose on Tuesday as European companies made takeover offers for US companies in the health-care and chemicals sectors and bond yields dipped, sending rate-sensitive stocks higher. Utility stocks dominated the top percentage gainers on the S&P 500 as the yield on the 10-year Treasury held near 5.08 percent. Hefty dividend-paying utilities are seen as more attractive when bond yields are falling. Shares of Allegheny Energy were up 3.3 percent to $52.34, while Edison International rose 2.7 percent to $55.26. Ventana Medical Systems Inc., a tissue-based diagnostics specialist, received a hostile takeover offer from Swiss drug maker Roche late on Monday, sending Ventana shares up nearly 50 percent to $76.91. Dutch chemical firm Basell said it had agreed to buy U.S. chemicals firm Huntsman Corp.. Huntsman shares were up 28.1 percent to $24.22 For details, see ID:nWEN8975. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.65 points, or 0.40 percent, at 13,405.70. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 6.49 points, or 0.43 percent, at 1,504.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 13.33 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,590.41. Data on new home sales, which is expected to show a decline in May, will be widely watched in the wake of disappointing results from Lennar Corp., the No. 2 U.S. home builder. The Commerce Department data on home sales is due at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT). Economists on average expect sales to slip to 925,000 at annual rate from 981,000 at annual rate the previous month. Apple Inc. was the top lift for Nasdaq after the company launched details of its service plans for its iPhone. Brokerage RBC initiated coverage of Apple with an "outperform" rating. Apple shares rose 1.1 percent to $123.72. A June reading of consumer confidence will be released at the same time as the new home sales data. Consumer confidence likely dipped to 105.5 from 108 this month, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Reuter
