<TITLE> NATO chief chides Russia over missile threat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's threat to aim its missiles at targets in Europe is out of step with the spirit of NATO-Russian partnership, the alliance's chief said on Tuesday after talks with President Vladimir Putin. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised all sides to "lower the volume" of rhetoric over differences between Russia and the West over issues including missile defence and the future of Serbia's Kosovo province. Putin has said Russia would return to its Cold War stance of targeting its missiles at sites in Europe if Washington goes ahead with a plan -- backed by NATO -- to station parts of a missile defence shield near Russia's Western borders. "The NATO-Russia relationship is one of partnership, and in the framework of the partnership these remarks about targeting missiles do not fit, and they do not have a place in these discussions," de Hoop Scheffer told a news conference. "I do think that in this already fairly complicated discussion it is advisable to lower the volume a bit of the public comments made by the one or the other." "As it is with your iPod, if you put the volume too high it will in the long run damage your ears ... There is no reason to speak with megaphones," he said. The NATO chief stressed though that this warning did not apply to his Kremlin meeting with Putin, which he said was frank and constructive. On Kosovo, de Hoop Scheffer said he had appealed to Putin to allow a vote on the province's future in the United Nations Security Council "as soon as possible." Russia, which holds a veto in the Council, opposes a Western-backed proposal to set Kosovo on the path to independence from Serbia and has urged other members of the council to delay a vote on the issue. NATO is still viewed with great suspicion in Russia, where officials say expansion eastwards shows the alliance is being used by the United States and top European powers to counter Russian influence. Washington wants to station radar and interceptor missiles in Poland and the Czech Republic to form part of a missile shield it says will guard against attack from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. But the plan has driven a wedge between Russia and NATO members. Russia says the scheme will upset the post-Cold War strategic balance and is really aimed at its military capability, not Iran and North Korea. Russia earlier this year provoked NATO concern by suspending its compliance with the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, a move the Kremlin linked in part to the U.S. shield. Speaking earlier as he met the NATO chief, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov acknowledged Russia and the alliance were split on a number of issues. "The positions of Russia and the countries of NATO are still not very close -- the problem of anti-missile defence, the problem of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and the problem of Kosovo," Lavrov told reporters. In his opening remarks at his meeting with Putin, de Hoop Scheffer urged Russia to engage more closely with the alliance to bridge their differences. "As far as the relationship is concerned, Mr President, I see two key words, and those words are investment and engagement," Scheffer told Putin. "Investment in the relationship because I think we can do better than we have done ... Engagement because I strongly believe there is no alternative to a good, healthy NATO-Russia relationship." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 5-Zimbabwe may localise foreign banks, mining (Adds bank comment, paragraphs 11-12) By Nelson Banya HARARE, June 26 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will transfer control of all companies, including foreign-owned banks and some mining operations, to locals if a planned empowerment bill is passed, a government minister said on Tuesday. The move is likely to deepen the country's economic turmoil and could give President Robert Mugabe an opportunity to enrich his supporters and consolidate ranks ahead of general elections next year, analysts say. "The bill refers to both public and private companies and yes, this includes mining companies and banks, which will be impacted like everyone else," Minister of State for Indigenisation and Empowerment Paul Mangwana told Reuters. Foreign banks with operations in Zimbabwe include units of Britain's Barclays and Standard Chartered and South Africa's Standard Bank. Analysts said the new law was unlikely to have a major impact outside the mining sector, as most of Zimbabwe's economy was already in local hands and many foreign companies, which once operated in the country, have already left. But they said the remaining foreign firms were instrumental in transferring new technology to Zimbabwe and had kept foreign currency trickling in from parent companies after donors such as the International Monetary Fund stopped lending to Harare. Zimbabwe has seen a sharp fall in investor confidence as the country struggles with the world's highest inflation rate, a recession now in its eighth year and Mugabe's controversial economic policies which critics blame for severe shortages of food, fuel and foreign currency. The economic crisis and alleged human rights abuses have heightened political tensions and drawn international criticism of the 83-year-old leader. But he remains defiant, denying he is at fault and accusing the opposition and Western nations of plotting to oust him. ECONOMIC DEATH KNELL? Parliament is expected to approve the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Bill, which stipulates that no company restructuring, merger or acquisition would be approved unless 51 percent of the business goes to indigenous Zimbabweans. The bill defines indigenous Zimbabweans as anyone who was disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of race before the former white-ruled Rhodesia won independence in 1980. Standard Chartered said it had no comment on the bill, while Barclays said it was assessing the situation. "It is early days and the proposed law may not become law or may alter in part. It would therefore be premature for Barclays to comment further at this stage," Barclays spokeswoman Laura Vergani said in London. Analysts have said the bill is likely to unsettle investors and hurt the economy, still wounded from Mugabe's earlier move to seize white-owned farms to give to landless blacks. "This is another move that sends negative signals to potential and existing investors, particularly in sectors, like mining, where investment decisions are made over a long horizon," said Best Doroh, principal economist at banking group ZB Financial Holdings. Fund manager Sheunesu Juru warned that the proposed localisation of ownership could take a similar course as the land seizure drive, which critics say has largely benefited Mugabe's allies and hurt agricultural productivity. bdnews24.com/lq2124hrs "That could be the death knell for the economy," Juru said. "It does appear as though certain influential individuals have targeted particular firms, especially in the mining sector." Although the empowerment bill includes mining companies, Mines Minister Amos Midzi said earlier this month that special consideration may be given to miners already operating in the country, such as Impala Platinum and Rio Tinto. Mugabe has said there are nearly 300 British companies and several South African businesses operating in Zimbabwe, a regional breadbasket before Mugabe's drive to seize land from whites t
