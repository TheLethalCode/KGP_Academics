 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com) - Maruf Mallick, staff correspondent of bdnews24.com, has been hospitalised since Monday following a head injury. Maruf, in his early thirties, suffered multiple fractures to his skull after he had fallen on the floor at the Lab Aid Cardiac Hospital soon after removal of stitches of an earlier injury in his lower lip Monday evening. According to doctors, Maruf suffered from vertigo (temporary blackout) and fell to the ground in an unconscious state that lasted a few minutes. Soon after, he was admitted to the Hi-care unit of Lab Aid Specialised Hospital Monday night where his condition did not improve. Although the surgeon concerned had assessed his condition and said that the patient would probably require opening of the skull bone for surgery Tuesday, Maruf was immediately shifted to Apollo Hospitals, Dhaka for better treatment on an emergency basis. He was shifted to Apollo Hospitals early Tuesday, accompanied by bdnews24.com colleagues and relatives. According to Professor Syed Sayed Ahmed, consultant neurosurgeon of Apollo Hospitals, Maruf suffered multiple clots in his brain that might require surgery to remove. Until Tuesday evening, Maruf's condition was stated to be stable and he was conscious. His guardians and colleagues have sought prayers for his early recovery. bd
