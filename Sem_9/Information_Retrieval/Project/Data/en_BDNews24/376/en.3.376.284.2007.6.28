 PHILADELPHIA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A long-lost manuscript of the 1932 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel 'The Good Earth' by Pearl S Buck has been recovered, federal officials said on Wednesday. The 400-page, typewritten manuscript of the novel, widely regarded as an American classic, was given to the Freeman auction house in Philadelphia by the daughter of Buck's now-deceased secretary to establish its authenticity, said Patrick Meehan, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

With the exception of the front page, which is yellowed and slightly torn at the edges, the document is in 'excellent' condition, said Robert Wittman, senior investigator in the FBI's art crime team brought in to assess the document. Wittman said it was hard to place a value on the document but it would likely fetch at least $150,000 if it was sold at auction. The document will soon be subject to negotiations between the Connecticut-based Pearl S Buck Family Trust and Pearl S. Buck International, an organization near Doylestown, Pennsylvania, that is dedicated to commemorating the writer's work. Her daughter Janice Walsh said at the news conference she had for years used the typewriter on which her mother had written the book, and that recently was used to authenticate the docume
