 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  It is not Microsoft's new operating system but the emerging markets that are driving the global PC sales, announced IT research company Gartner Wednesday. Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner predicts 257.1 million units of PC sales in 2007, which is an 11.1 percent increase from 2006 shipments of 231.5 million units. "Without a 'killer application' to drive new PC sales, manufacturers are leveraging emerging markets to boost global PC sales in 2007." Much of the growth in emerging markets is being driven by new PC penetration (not replacement purchases). Approximately 55 percent of PC shipments to emerging markets reflect new PC penetration. Gartner analysts expect emerging markets to contribute approximately 128 million new PC placements to unit shipment growth during the next two years (77 million desk-based PCs and 51 million mobile PCs). This will constitute about 25 percent of all PC units expected to be shipped globally in 2007 and 2008. Analysis also said Microsoft Windows Vista operating system that was launched in January had minimal impact on PC sales growth. "Our market data suggest Vista has had very limited impact on PC demand or replacement activity," said Gartner's director George Shiffler. "We don't see Vista having a significant effect on these going forward unless Microsoft becomes much more aggressive in its marketing efforts." Although PC manufacturers are finding growth opportunities in emerging markets, they are facing mounting challenges in more-established markets. "Vendors continue to face a thorny mix of select growth opportunities and serious challenges in mature markets," Shiffler commented. "Continuing strong demand for mobile PCs, especially among consumers, offer vendors tremendous growth opportunities. But, generally weak desktop PC replacement activity and narrowing penetration opportunities, especially among larger businesses, pose some serious challenges." Worldwide mobile PC shipments are forecast to total 103.2 million units in 2007, a 27.1 percent increase from 2006. Meanwhile, desktop PC shipments are on pace to total 153.9 million units in 2007, up 2.4 percent from last year. "Consumer mobile PCs remain the PC market's principal growth driver, thanks to falling average selling prices (ASP), increasing performance, and the continuing spread of wireless access," said Gartner's principal analyst Mikako Kitagawa. Globally the ASP of mobile PC has fallen below US$1,100, but buyers in many parts of the world have an impressive range of choices below $1,000, Kitagawa remarked. bdn
