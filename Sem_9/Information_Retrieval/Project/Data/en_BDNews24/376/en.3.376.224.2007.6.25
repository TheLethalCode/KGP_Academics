Patuakhali went down by one goal in the ninth minute, but bounced back to restore the parity three minutes later and went for a breather with a comfortable 3-1 lead. After the lemon break, the boys of Patuakhali added another two goals to their first-half lead and left the field with a smiling face. In the other match of the day, Mymensingh edged Bangladesh Air Force past 2-0 after playing a goalless first half at the same venue.
