<TITLE> Gudjohnsen keen to fight for place at Barcelona </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iceland striker Eidur Gudjohnsen has no plans to leave Barcelona despite a disappointing first season in the Primera Liga. The 28-year-old has been linked with a move back to England in the Spanish media after only managing five league goals since moving from Chelsea on a four-year, 12 million euro ($16 million) deal last June. "There is a lot of speculation but I haven't spoken to anyone and am only thinking of continuing here," Gudjohnsen told sports daily Mundo Deportivo on Monday. The imminent arrival of French striker Thierry Henry is set to make Gudjohnsen's life even harder next year, though Argentina's Javier Saviola is leaving. Henry will bolster a forward line that already boasts Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o, Brazil's Ronaldinho and Argentina's Lionel Messi. But Gudjohnsen remained positive about his prospects. "There were high expectations when I arrived and it's normal that when a striker doesn't score many goals people expect more of you. I also expect more from myself," he added. "But after last season I will be more settled. I know how the club works, the language, and I will only have to focus on my game. When I am in top form it will be easier to change people's opinions of me. "I know that after not winning anything everyone is thinking of making lots of changes, but I want to stay." Barca missed out on their third consecutive Primera Liga title on the final day just over a week ago, finishing second behind arch-rivals Real Madrid because of an inferior head-to-head record
