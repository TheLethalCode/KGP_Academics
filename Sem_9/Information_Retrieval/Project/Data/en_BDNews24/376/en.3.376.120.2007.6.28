 TRIPOLI, Lebanon, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese troops clashed with gunmen in the northern city of Qalamoun early on Thursday, witnesses and security sources said. They said the army launched a raid at about 1 a.m. (2200 GMT) in Qalamoun, which is on the Mediterranean coast south of Tripoli, and a firefight ensued involving assault rifles and grenades. Army helicopters hovered over the area. The fighting appeared to ease later. There was no immediate information on casualties and the army could not be immediately reached for comment. The identity of the gunmen was not immediately clear. A similar clash erupted last week in Tripoli after Lebanese troops stormed a militant hideout killing seven, mostly foreigners.

At least 194 people have been killed in the fighting since May
