 ZAGREB, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged on Sunday to help develop a Black Sea energy hub as the battle to control Europe's energy markets and supply routes moves to the Balkans. At a Balkan energy summit held in Croatia, Putin said Russia, which supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, wanted to play a key role in all facets of energy supply and generation to the region, stressing Moscow's close cultural and historical ties. The conference comes as the Balkans' importance as an energy transit hub is on the rise. The European Union is looking to modernise the Balkans creaking transit system and use it as a route for natural gas from Central Asia to western Europe. But Putin, looking to prevent such a move since it would give Europe an alternative to Russian natural gas and likely reduce Moscow's political and economic clout, said Russia is ready to help develop an energy hub in the Black Sea area. "The strategic goal of our work together is to establish the availability and guarantee of energy supplies to all countries in this region," he said. "In doing so we take into account the desire of Balkan states to participate in European integration and we are ready to build our relations in cooperation with the European Union." He said Russian companies also wanted to build underground gas storage facilities in the Balkans, help to improve power stations in the region and link electricity grids. High world oil prices have allowed Russia to play an increasingly active role in the delivery as well as production of hydrocarbons and Moscow is keen to take financial stakes in pipelines that deliver its oil and gas to Europe. Recent disruptions of gas and oil supplies in disputes between Moscow and Ukraine and Belarus affected flows to Western Europe and have caused worries in the EU over energy security. Putin said, though, that Russia was a trustworthy supplier. "I'd note that during four decades and despite serious and global changes in the world, Russia has never broken a single contractual obligation. Never!" he said. Trapped in the middle, conference host Croatia and its Balkans neighbours lie on an increasingly important transit route for oil and gas. Croatian President Stjepan Mesic told the conference that all countries needed to agree that "one's own energy interests will not be realised by force, and that accessibility of energy sources will not be used as a means of political pressure". "Make no mistake about it: this refers both to transit countries and to producing and consuming nations," he added. Moscow has plans to divert its pipelines away from what Putin has called "parasite" transit states, accusing Ukraine and Belarus of siphoning off gas meant for western Europe. It is seeking to bolster its status as the custodian of oil and gas in transit from Central Asia after agreeing with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to a gas pipeline deal. In a nod to EU concerns over Russia's strong footing in the sector, new member state Bulgaria's president, Georgi Parvanov, said that the development of the region's energy policy must be in line with the EU's energy strate
