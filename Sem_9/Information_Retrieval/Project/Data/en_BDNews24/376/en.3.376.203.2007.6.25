<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  Civil aviation adviser MA Matin Monday said the government would not be able to turn Biman Bangladesh Airlines into a public limited company by June 30. He said the government needed more time to amend the related law, which is vital for the overhaul of Biman. "It's impossible to turn Biman into a public limited company by the June 30 deadline," Matin told reporters after a meeting at the civil aviation ministry. "It's because more time will be required to amend the law. I hope Biman will become a PLC by July." "Biman will see good days again and will turn into a profitable company," he said of the loss-making national flag carrier. A meeting of the advisory council approved the draft of Bangladesh Biman Corporation (amendment) Ordinance 2007 Saturday to make Biman a public limited company. The meeting asked the civil aviation ministry to submit the proposed drafts of the "memorandum of association" and "articles of association" for Bangladesh Airlines Limited to a cabinet meeting after further scrutiny. bdnews24.c
