<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Tarique Rahman's wife and mother-in-law Tuesday sought a few more days to turn in back-up documents on Tarique's wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. ACC officials asking not to be named said the commission on Sunday asked Tarique's wife Dr Jobaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu to appear before the ACC investigation officer Tuesday with documents in support of the wealth statement submitted. Investigation officer, ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda told reporters in the afternoon that a representative of Dr Jobaida and Iqbalmand asked the commission for more time. Huda said they might be given some more time. The officials said Tarique's family had sought permission to present documents through their lawyers, but the ACC insisted that the two turn in the papers themselves. The ACC investigators have secured the nod of jail authorities to interrogate Tarique about his wealth once his wife and mother-in-law submit the supporting papers. The interrogation team would comprise Huda, an army major, an official of the National Board of Revenue (NBR), a member of the taskforce and an assistant police super ASP of CID. In the wealth statement submitted on June 10, Tarique claimed his mother-in-law gifted most of the assets to him and his wife. Sources said the investigators would ask him how his mother-in law made so much wealth and why she would heap all gifts only one daughter and son-in-law. bdnew
