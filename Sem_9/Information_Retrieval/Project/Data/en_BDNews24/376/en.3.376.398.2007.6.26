 Comilla, June 26 (bdnews26) -- A Comilla court Tuesday sent former health minister and BNP standing committee member Dr Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain into a further two-day remand. Mosharraf faces charges of extortion, ransacking and looting. The case involves 38 people as well as Mosharraf. On April 9 2001 the accused, under the direction of Mosharraf, attacked a shop owned by Daudkandi businessman Abdus Sattar, it is alleged. The shop was then allegedly ransacked and looted of Tk 90,000 in cash. Mosharraf appeared to Comilla Cognizance Court Tuesday after a case was filed by Mehedi Hasan Babu of Goalmari village in Daudkandi on March 12 this year. Police appealed for a remand of 10 days, but magistrate Ataul Gani granted the police two days to interrogate Mosharraf. Three cases against Mosharraf are now ongoing in Comilla. bdnews2
