 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission is open to talks with political parties on electoral reform, despite the ban on indoor politics, election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain said Wednesday. "The door for discussion is open to all. Political parties may send representatives for talks," Sakhawat Hossain told reporters in his office. But he said the EC is not inviting individual political parties for official talks at present. Commenting on reforms within political parties, the he said: "We see any sort of reform as positive. And the reforms we have suggested for registration of political parties are entirely election-oriented. Our proposals are meant to help the parties." Sakhawat also said the EC's pilot project in Sripur was successful. "Many women came to the voter registration camp. Physically-challenged people are also being made voters for the first time. They will cast their votes under special arrangements." More than 46,000 voters in Sripur are being given national identity cards, the commissioner said. The EC will also start final work on the electoral roll in Rajshahi next month, he added. bdnews
