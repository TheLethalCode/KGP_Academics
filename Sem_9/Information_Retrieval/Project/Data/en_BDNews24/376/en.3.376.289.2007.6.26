<TITLE> Aaqib's accent on quality pacers, leg spinners </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Former Pakistan paceman Aaqib Javed Tuesday said Bangladesh focus on producing qualify pace bowlers and leg spinners to compete fiercely in international cricket. "You need to produce fast bowlers and good leg spinners. Because, if you want to take 20 wickets on different surfaces, then you will need to have fast bowlers and the spinners," Aaqib said at a news conference at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP). The former Pakistan speedster arrived here Monday on a four-day visit to give tips to 14 selected pacers of the Grameenphone Pacer Hunt (third phase) programme. Bangladesh National Cricket Academy operations manager and former captain Khaled Mahmud, grameenphone additional general manager of marketing Naubat Ali, senior coaches Golam Faruk Suru and Dipu Roy Chowdhury were present at the conference. "Two types of talent hunt you need at the divisional level. If you want to test any batsman's technique, I think it should be mostly against the fast bowlers and if you want to judge a wicketkeeper it should be against the spinners," said Aaqib. The Pakistan Cricket Academy coach stressed the need for building cricket academy at divisional level to train up budding cricketers at the grassroots level. "You have six divisions. You should make six divisional academies and there should be six different talent hunt scouts. "Give people the opportunity to find talents. They should be trained there for two or three months and afterwards there should be a competition in between and then the boys should come into your national academy. "If you want to progress, if you want to improve, you'll have to start from the grassroots level," said Aaqib, a member of Pakistan's World Cup winning team in 1992. The 34-year old pacer is now working with the boys' speed and will later look into their techniques. "I think it will not work if anything is below 80mph. If you can touch 84 to 85 then I think you can force a batsman to the back foot. "My aim is to increase the speed from whatever they are having at the moment to two to five miles," said Aaqib, who has 58 wickets in 22 Tests and 182 ODI scalps in 163 matches. He, however, believes three or four days are not enough to improve anyone's speed and techniques. He said he would be in touch with other coaches of the programme to deliver tips.
