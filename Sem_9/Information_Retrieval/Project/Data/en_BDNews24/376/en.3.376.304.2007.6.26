 HARARE, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe will transfer control of all companies, including foreign-owned banks and mining operations, to locals if a planned empowerment bill is passed, a government minister said on Tuesday. The move is likely to deepen the country's economic turmoil and could give President Robert Mugabe an opportunity to enrich his supporters and consolidate ranks ahead of general elections next year, analysts say. "The bill refers to both public and private companies and yes, this includes mining companies and banks, which will be impacted like everyone else," Minister of State for Indigenisation and Empowerment Paul Mangwana told Reuters. Foreign banks with operations in Zimbabwe include units of Britain's Barclays and Standard Chartered and South Africa's Standard Bank. Analysts said the new law was unlikely to have a major impact outside the mining sector, as most of Zimbabwe's economy was already in local hands and many foreign companies, which once operated in the country, have already left. But they said the remaining foreign firms were instrumental in transferring new technology to Zimbabwe and had kept foreign currency trickling in from parent companies after donors such as the International Monetary Fund, stopped lending to Harare. Zimbabwe has seen a sharp fall in investor confidence as the country struggles with the world's highest inflation rate, a recession now in its eighth year and Mugabe's controversial economic policies which critics blame for severe shortages of food, fuel and foreign currency. The economic crisis and alleged human rights abuses have heightened political tensions and drawn international criticism of the 83-year-old leader. But he remains defiant, denying he is at fault and accusing the opposition and Western nations of plotting to oust him. ECONOMIC DEATH KNELL? Parliament is expected to approve the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Bill, which stipulates that no company restructuring, merger or acquisition would be approved unless 51 percent of the business goes to indigenous Zimbabweans. The bill defines indigenous Zimbabweans as anyone who was disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of race before the former white-ruled Rhodesia won independence in 1980. Analysts have said the bill is likely to unsettle investors and hurt the economy, still wounded from Mugabe's earlier move to seize white-owned farms to give to landless blacks. "We seem not to have learnt from the mistakes of the land exercise," said Best Doroh, principal economist at banking group ZB Financial Holdings. "This is another move that sends negative signals to potential and existing investors, particularly in sectors, like mining, where investment decisions are made over a long horizon," he added. Fund manager Sheunesu Juru warned that the proposed localisation of ownership could take a similar course as the land seizure drive, which critics say has largely benefited Mugabe's allies and hurt agricultural productivity. "That could be the death knell for the economy," Juru said. "It does appear as though certain influential individuals have targeted particular firms, especially in the mining sector." Although the empowerment bill includes mining companies, Mines Minister Amos Midzi said earlier this month that special consideration may be given to miners already operating in the country, such as Impala Platinum and Rio Tinto. Mugabe has said there are nearly 300 British companies and several South African businesses operating in Zimbabwe, a regional breadbasket before Mugabe's drive to seize land from whites to resettle landless blac
