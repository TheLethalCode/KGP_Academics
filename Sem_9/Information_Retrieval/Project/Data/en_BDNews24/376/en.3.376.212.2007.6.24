 TOKYO, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan Derby winner Vodka was outshone by third favourite Admire Moon, who finished strongly in pouring rain to win the Takarazuka Kinen on Sunday. Vodka, who became the first filly to triumph at the Japan Derby in 64 years last month, faded over the latter stages of the Grade One race, finishing a disappointing eighth. Top Japanese jockey Yasunari Iwata led Admire Moon to an impressive second G-1 victory by half a length over last year's Derby winner Meisho Samson. "I didn't push him too hard in the first half of the race because he tends to run out of steam when he hits the front too early," Iwata told reporters. "I had to concentrate hard on that balance but I trusted in the horse's power and it's really great to have won." Pop Rock was third a further two lengths back in a high-quality field of 18 in the spring season finale at Hanshin Racecourse in western Japan. Admire Moon entered the race in decent form, having won the Dubai Duty Free race in March and finishing third in April's Queen Elizabeth II Cup in Hong Kong. The four-year-old colt won the 2,200-metre race in a time of two minutes 12.4 seconds to give trainer Hiroshi Matsuda his first big race win in Japan. "I'd given up on winning a G-1 race in Japan," beamed Matsuda. "He ran a great race. Iwata showed wonderful patience. It's fantastic." Vodka struggled with the heavy going, and her performance will raise questions about her chances of running at this year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Par
