 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will no longer accept policies imposed by foreigners, but will take help if need be, an adviser of the interim government said Sunday. "We won't accept any policy or technology that donors impose," agriculture, fisheries and livestock adviser CS Karim said at a symposium on organic safe agriculture in Bangladesh. "We must build up a system of protection for our own bio-diversity. We must consider carefully before accepting new species and GM (genetically modified) food," he said. However, Dr Karim conceded that Bangladesh does need technological assistance to ensure diversification of crops, adding that climate change might pose a serious threat to the agriculture. He also expressed concerns about bio-safety: "We must ensure bio-safety to ensure food security. Avian flu is a reality, it cannot be ignored. Approximately two lakh poultry livestock have been culled and the cause for the spread of avian flu is being sought. The poultry industry must be saved." The adviser said bio-safety is of particular importance in a densely populated country such as Bangladesh. Agricultural researcher Farhad Mazhar echoed Karim, saying that foreign money should never be used for formulating national policy. "National policy is a matter of national security, so no foreign agencies should be involved. But few policies have been formulated in the past without the aid of foreign money and consultancy." He added that the large sums involved in foreign assistance funds were a major source of corruption. Mazhar went on to say that the Food and Agriculture Organisation was partly responsible for flawed policy damaging the agriculture sector in Bangladesh. Senior policy officer of FAO Dr Saifullah Syed presented the keynote paper at the symposium, co-organised by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies and FAO. bdnews24.c
