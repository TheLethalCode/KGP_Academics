 MOSCOW, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian bank has received $25 million of unblocked North Korean funds, news agencies quoted Russian Finance Ministry officials as saying on Saturday. "The funds intended for North Korea are in accounts at the Khabarovsk-based Dalkombank," one official told Interfax news agency. The transfer of the funds was part of a deal allowing senior United Nations inspectors to return to the Communist state to resume monitoring of its atomic programme.
