 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  A team of the Rapid Action Battalion Wednesday arrested the editor of a backstreet newspaper and its reporter on charges of attempted extortion in Dhaka. Abdul Malek Moni, 56, of Bangla-language daily Rupali Desh, and its reporter Mahbubur Rahman Khokon, 36, face allegations of demanding Tk 1 lakh from a woman. Khokon doubled up for Aparadhchitra, a weekly magazine, as its correspondent, as his identity card shows. The duo threatened Rashida Prodhan from Narsinghdi with posting "nude pictures" of her and two daughters on the interneta charge both Moni and Khokon denied during a brief meet-the-press session in a RAB camp in Mohammadpur. "It's a handiwork of RAB," an angry Malek said. RAB-2 officer Mohammad Qumruzzaman told bdnews24.com that Malek and Khokon had been arrested together in the act of taking Tk 2,000 from Rashida. The 45-year-old woman who was present at the night-time meet-the-press session Wednesday told bdnews24.com that she got in touch with the two 'journalists' one and a half years ago when Khokon covered a robbery on her family in Raypura upazila of Narsinghdi for his newspaper. At the time, Khokon also took pictures of her family and some of them were printed in the newspaper as part of the coverage, Rashida said. Much later on June 25, Malek and Khokon demanded Tk 1 lakh on the phone when she came to Dhaka for medical treatment of her husband, Asaduzzaman Bhuiyan. "Malek and Khokon had also threatened to spoil the marriage of one of my daughters," Rashida alleged. The same day, Rashida continued, she met Malek at Maranchand Hotel in Chowdhury Complex in Purana Paltan. He set her a deadline to pay the money by Monday afternoon. She alleged that Malek had pestered her with threatening phone calls for the money after she failed the deadline. Rashida broke the incident to her relatives and made up her mind to log a general diary with Mohammadpur Police Station. But an officer of the police station advised her to contact the elite force, RAB, for fast action. At 5:30pm Wednesday, Rashida rushed to the office of Rupali Desh in Purana Desh with a plainclothes team of RAB. Rashida went into the room of Malek with a plainclothes officer and gave him part of the demanded moneyTk 2,000. Other RAB officers, who were waiting outside, rushed in and caught Malek taking the sum. The woman filed an extortion case with Mohammadpur Police Station. RAB officer Mohammad Quamruzzaman told bdnews24.com that Malek and Khokon would be handed over to the police Thursday morning. bdn
