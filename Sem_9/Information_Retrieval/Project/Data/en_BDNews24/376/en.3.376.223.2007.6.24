 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Looming threats of rain play on the mind of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as they head to the first Test in the Sinhalese Sports Club ground (SSC), Colombo Monday. Sudden heavy showers are common at this time of the year, which have interrupted preparations of both sides for the first of the three-match series, with more rain forecasts for the entire week. The teams have often had to practice indoors over the last few days while Bangladesh's lone three-day warm-up match against Sri Lanka A lasted just 140 overs before rain forced it to end in a drab draw. "There is little one can do about the weather but we should get enough play because the ground dries up very fast," Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was quoted by cricinfo.com as saying. Before leaving here for Sri Lanka, newly-installed captain Mohammad Ashraful hoped to take all three Tests to the fifth day to improve on Bangladesh's record against the islanders. In the seven Test matches at home and away, Bangladesh conceded defeats inside three days in four matches and three of them ended in the morning of the fourth day as the Sri Lankan bowling attack, led by Muttiah Muralitharan, blew Bangladeshis away. "This series is a big challenge for us and we are determined to do well. We want to improve every day and the results don't really matter to us," Ashraful said to The Associated Press. "For us batting will be the key. Earlier we have not adjusted sufficiently in Test matches and got into trouble by playing too many shots too early and we have been working on that aspect," he was quoted by cricinfo as saying. However, the Tigers will face the daunting task of having to first deal with Lankan pace duo of Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga before Muralitharan. Muralitharan, 35 wickets away from retired Shane Warne's World-record of 708 Test scalps, caused the damage every time to Bangladesh as the off-spin wizard grabbed 50 wickets in just six matches against the latest Test nation. Besides, Bangladesh have to negotiate with a formidable side that has proved its worth at home over the last few years to win seven of last 10 matches with two draws and just one loss against Pakistan at home. Bangladesh's hopes of providing good fight hinges on no one other than Ashraful, who stood up to the Lankans in the past, scoring 475 runs in seven matches with two hundreds and a fifty at an average of 39.58. Jayawardene is not taking Bangladesh for granted in the Test series, though. "There is no question of taking Bangladesh lightly. They have done well in one-day cricket and look determined to improve their Test record," The hosts are in a spot of bother with their opening combination after opener Upal Tharanga was ruled out due to broken toe in right foot and former captain Marvan Atapattu skipped the series citing personal reasons. They now have to make do with makeshift openers and have Michael Vandort to open with uncapped left-handed opener Milinda Warnapuara. "It is disappointing not to have a full-strength team but it gives a chance to the others to stand up and prove themselves," Jayawardene told AFP. Bangladesh have kept Syed Rasel, Mohammad Sharif and Mushfiqur Rahim outside the 12 for the first Test. However, the team management is a bit worried over opener Javed Omar, who is suffering from virus. "Omar is coming through well and we hope he will be fit for the Test. Mehrab Hossain has been named as standby in the twelve just in case Omar fails to pull through," Bangladesh coach Shaun Williams told cricinfo. Bangladesh 12 : Mohammed Ashraful (captain), Mashrafa Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, Khaled Mashud, Mohammad Rafique, Rajin Saleh, Shahadat Hossain, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain.
