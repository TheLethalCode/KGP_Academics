<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Food writer Steven Raichlen is ready to walk away from his barbecue grill for awhile after finishing a series of cookbooks on the oldest form of cooking in the world. The author and cooking teacher is completing 'Planet Barbecue,' which is likely to be the last book of his best-selling 'Barbecue Bible' cookbook series. "By the time I've written 'Planet Barbecue' I would feel that I have covered the subject in depth," said Raichlen. The former French literature major began his exploration of barbecue with 'The Barbecue Bible' when it came out in 1998. 'Planet Barbecue,' which is due in 2009, brings Raichlen full circle. "My overall goal is to celebrate the culture of barbecuing and grilling, to teach people the technical know-how and to share with people recipes that will excite and stretch the imagination," Raichlen said. He spoke to Reuters about the best ways to barbecue. Q: What are some of best barbecue experiences you've had? A: "In Tokyo there is a restaurant called Inakaya which is a robatayaki grill. Robatayaki is a style of grilling that's very theatrical and there's a vast array of ingredients. The food is served with great ceremony. Certainly the most expensive barbecue meal I've ever eaten. It has the Japanese cardinal virtue of ingredients that incredibly tasty and pristine and a cooking style that is amazing simple." Q: What is most common mistake that people make with they are grilling? A: "Right on top of the list is overcrowding the grill. There is a tendency among men to cover the whole grill with food. I work with something call the '30-percent rule,' which is at any given time I will have 30 percent of the grill with no food on it. So if I get a flare up or a hot spot where food begins to burn or catches fire, I have maneuvering room." Q: When do you use a rub? a marinade? A: "Fatty cuts of meat like ribs, certain kinds of kabobs, certain steaks tend to do well with rubs because rubs are dry so you have dry versus fatty. Lean cuts of meat like shrimps which are almost pure protein or many kinds of fish and even some lean cuts of pork like pork tenderloin tend to do well with marinade because the marinade has a moisturizing effect." Q: What kind of tips do you have to hold down the costs of a summer barbecue? A: "True barbecuing is cooking over low heat over a long period of time -- 'low and slow' with the presence of a lot of wood smoke. Traditionally, that was practiced by slaves or people at the bottom of the economic ladder and it was practiced with inexpensive cuts of meat like briskets, spare ribs, baby-back ribs and pork shoulders - tough cuts of meat - that historically cost less and took more care to make them tasty. Briskets and spare ribs cost a lot less than filet mignon or prime ribs. Q: What do you cook for yourself when you are alone? A: "We tend to grill most of the time. We tend to eat very simply. We live on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts in the summer. A typical meal at our house would be grilled swordfish steaks, maybe a very simple tomato vinaigrette or salsa or caper butter. Grilled corn we do a lot. We may have grilled flatbread." Chicken Grilled Under Bricks - Serves 4 Ingredients 2 large, whole, boneless, skinless chicken breasts (12 to 16 ounces each) or 4 half breasts (each half 6 to 8 ounces) 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns 1/2 to 1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary Juice of 1 lemon 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil You'll need: 4 bricks, each wrapped in aluminum foil. Oak chunks for building the fire, or 2 cups wood chips (preferably oak), soaked for 1 hour in cold water to cover, then drained. 1. If using whole breasts, cut each in half. Trim any sinews or excess fat off the chicken breasts and discard. Rinse the breasts under cold running water, then drain and blot dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the breasts on both sides with the salt, cracked black pepper, and hot red pepper flakes. Sprinkle the breasts with the garlic and rosemary, patting them on with your fingers. Arrange the breasts in a non-reactive baking dish. Pour the lemon juice and oil over them and let marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning several times. 2. Set up the grill and preheat to high. In the best of all worlds, you'd build your fire with oak chunks. Alternatively, use gas or charcoal, plus soaked wood chips for smoke. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and preheat until you see smoke. 3. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. If using a charcoal grill, toss the wood chips on the coals. Arrange the chicken breasts on the hot grate, all facing the same direction, at a 45 degree angle to the bars of the grate. Place a brick on top of each. Grill the breasts until cooked, 4 to 6 minutes per side, rotating the breasts 90 degrees after 2 minutes on each side to create an attractive crosshatch of grill marks. To test if done, poke a breast in the thickest part with your finger. It should feel firm to the touch. Transfer the breasts to plates or a platter and serve at on
