<TITLE> Middle East mediators near deal on Blair as envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, June 25 (Reuters) - Tony Blair could be named to a top post in Middle East peacemaking as early as Tuesday, diplomats said before a meeting in Jerusalem between US and other international officials to discuss the appointment. Blair steps down as British prime minister on Wednesday and officials are working to define the role he would play as envoy for the Quartet of international peace brokers -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia. His appointment is expected to top the agenda in talks on Tuesday in Jerusalem between officials representing US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. "There are consultations going on between members of the Quartet and the UK about appointing Tony Blair as Quartet envoy to the Palestinians," a European diplomat said. "I cannot say whether there is a result, but I expect a result possibly on Tuesday when the Quartet envoys meet, perhaps even sooner." Other sources said an announcement on Tuesday was likely, although Blair may not start work immediately. Diplomats close to the negotiations said Blair, who steps down after 10 years in power, appeared ready to take the job and to have overcome some resistance within the Quartet. Negotiators were now trying to iron out details about the envoy's mandate. Some in Russia and Europe have questioned his ability to win Arab support after taking a leading role in the Iraq war with US President George W. Bush. Many Arabs believe Bush is biased in Israel's favour. Diplomats said Blair would mainly be charged with helping Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah faction build up the institutions of a future Palestinian state. The Bush administration first floated the idea of appointing Blair as Quartet envoy earlier this year, long before Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip more than a week ago. Abbas responded to Gaza's takeover by sacking the Hamas-led government and forming an emergency cabinet in the West Bank, backed by the Quartet and key Arab allies. That has divided the Palestinian territories into two separate fiefdoms -- a Hamas-controlled Gaza and a larger, Fatah-dominated West Bank. As part of a strategy to counter Hamas, Israel and the United States want to isolate the Islamists in the Gaza Strip, while bolstering the emergency government set up by Abbas. The Bush administration hopes to spur negotiations between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who meet in Egypt on Monday, as well as promote an Arab land-for-peace initiative. Olmert supports Blair taking on an expanded role in the region after he steps down, aides said. Blair's office and the White House would neither confirm nor deny that the outgoing premier is a candidate for the post. The Quartet's previous envoy, former World Bank president James Wolfensohn, focused largely on economic issues. He resigned in frustration, in large part over Israel's unwillingness to comply with U.S.-brokered agreemen
