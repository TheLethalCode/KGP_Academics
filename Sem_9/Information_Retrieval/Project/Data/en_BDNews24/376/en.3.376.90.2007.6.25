 MARJAYOUN, Lebanon, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN peacekeepers will pursue their mission in south Lebanon despite a car bomb attack that killed six members of a Spanish battalion, the UNIFIL force's commander said on Monday. The blast that hit a UNIFIL patrol on Sunday was the first deadly attack on the U.N. force since it was expanded after last year's war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas. "It's not an attack against Lebanon and UNIFIL only, but against the stability of the region. This attack has made UNIFIL more committed to fulfil its mission in southern Lebanon," Major-General Claudio Graziano, who commands the 13,000-strong U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, said in a statement. The bombing presents another challenge to the Western-backed Beirut government, locked in a paralysing political conflict with the Hezbollah-led opposition and shaken by a series of bombings, as well as battles with al Qaeda-inspired militants. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's anti-Syrian cabinet decided to ask the U.N. Security Council to prolong UNIFIL's mandate, which expires in August, for another 12 months. In a report to the council this month, UN envoy Terje Roed-Larsen expressed alarm at reports by the Lebanese government and others about weapons smuggling across the Syrian border. Damascus has denied any systematic transfers. A U.N. mission to assess monitoring the Syrian-Lebanese border is due to report at the end of June. Spanish Defence Minister Jose Antonio Alonso flew to Lebanon to collect the bodies of the soldiers killed by the bomb that blew up on a road between the towns of Khiyam and Marjayoun. The Lebanese army kept the road closed on Monday as UNIFIL troops with sniffer dogs combed nearby fields and investigators searched for clues. There were conflicting reports as to whether the bomb was detonated by remote control or by a suicide driver. Witnesses said UNIFIL had reduced its patrols in the south. Alonso attended a religious ceremony for the slain soldiers at the Spanish base in Marjayoun. His helicopter earlier circled three times over the bomb scene, witnesses said. Lebanese army commander General Michel Suleiman also inspected the site. The bombing, which Hezbollah condemned, occurred even though UNIFIL had gone on higher alert after the Lebanese army began fighting Sunni Islamist militants in the north last month. No group has claimed responsibility, but the Fatah al-Islam group battling the army in the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr al-Bared had previously accused UNIFIL of bombarding the camp. "We are working on the theory of a terrorist attack," Alonso said in Madrid before he left for Beirut. UNIFIL, operating alongside about 15,000 Lebanese troops sent to the south after the July-August war ended, has reported few problems with Hezbollah, which keeps its arms out of sight. The peacekeepers have focused more on the potential threat from Sunni militants. Last year, al Qaeda's deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for attacks on UNIFIL. UNIFIL has now suffered 266 fatalities since it was set up after a 1978 Israeli invasi
