 MANCHESTER, England, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's incoming prime minister, Gordon Brown, vowed on Sunday to run a disciplined but inclusive government as he readied to take the helm of the ruling Labour Party. Brown will be named Labour leader at a party meeting in Manchester later on Sunday, ending an agonising 13-year wait. He will succeed Tony Blair as prime minister on Wednesday. "There will have to be discipline in the government that I lead," Finance Minister Brown told BBC Television. Labour's last decade was dominated by the often acrimonious rivalry between the charismatic Blair, who has led the party since 1994, and the more cerebral but no less ambitious Brown. Brown inherits a party and a country divided by the Iraq war, disenchanted after a decade of Blair government and eager for change. But he received a boost on Sunday with a poll that showed Labour ahead of the opposition Conservative Party for the first time in eight months. Brown, 56, will tell the Labour gathering how he plans to relaunch a party and a government damaged by Iraq and charges of sleaze in order to secure a fourth straight term for Labour at an election due by 2010 but expected in 2009. He is expected to tell Labour he will listen more to the party and the public and run a more inclusive administration. "All decisions that we make will have to be built from an understanding of grassroots opinion. People will be more engaged in decision making," Brown told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Sunday. Brown faces the challenge of distancing himself from the Blair government while not appearing to backtrack on policies he has supported for a decade. BROWN BOUNCE Aides also hope Brown's more serious manner will woo back voters who have grown disenchanted with what one Labour lawmaker called Blair's "glitz and razzmattazz", his closeness to celebrity and his courting of millionaire donors. "We've got to show we've got the confidence, the understanding, the wisdom and the maturity to learn some lessons," Ed Balls, a Labour minister and Brown ally, told a fringe meeting at the conference in Manchester, northern England. Public disillusionment after a decade of Blair and anger over the Iraq war have meant Labour has lagged the Conservatives -- revived under youthful leader David Cameron, 40 -- in polls since last October. Political analysts saw the Conservatives on track to at least force a hung parliament in the next election. But the new poll, in The Observer newspaper, put support for Labour at 39 percent and the Conservatives at 36 percent. Forty percent of voters believed Brown would make a more capable prime minister, compared to just 22 percent who prefer Cameron, the poll said. Both parties had expected a "Brown bounce" for Labour in the polls, but overtaking the Conservatives before actually taking office this week was good news for Brown. Brown will find out on Sunday whom the party has elected to be deputy Labour leader. He is expected to unveil his cabinet on Thursday, ushering in new faces while including familiar names from the Blair years like former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Trade and Industry Secretary Alistair Darling, who is tipped as finance minist
