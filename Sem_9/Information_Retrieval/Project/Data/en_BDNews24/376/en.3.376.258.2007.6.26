 MANILA, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least nine people were killed and dozens injured when Philippine security forces clashed with dozens of slum dwellers resisting the tearing down of their homes in a northern province, a police commander said on Tuesday. Raul Gonzales, police chief in the northern Cordillera area, said soldiers and police officers traded gunfire with dozens of people illegally occupying private land in Kalinga province on Monday. "Our boys were ambushed on their way to the community to be demolished for squatting," said Gonzales, adding the security forces only defended themselves after residents dug foxholes and opened fire with automatic rifles. "Nine people were killed and dozens were wounded, including 10 police officers, during almost 10 hours of fighting. We even had to evacuate some of our officers who needed surgery to get the bullets from their bodies." The security forces said they abided with the rules of engagement, asking the civilians to lay down their weapons but were forced to fire back when the people continued shooting. Security forces seized assault rifles, shotguns, grenades and ammunition from the squatters after fighting stopped, Gonzales added. The security forces were sent to guard a demolition crew ordered to tear down the houses by a local court.
