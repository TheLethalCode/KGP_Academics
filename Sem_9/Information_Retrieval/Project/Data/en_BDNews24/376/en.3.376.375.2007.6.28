<TEXT>
 London,Thursday June 28,(bdnews24.com/AFP) PM New British Prime Minister Gordon Brown assembled his cabinet team Thursday on his first day in office after taking over from Tony Blair vowing to lead a government of change. But Brown again found Blair, the British leader for the past decade, dominating world headlines through his nomination as a Middle East peace envoy. The new prime minister was set to make sweeping cabinet changes by naming new finance, foreign, health and interior ministers. "This will be a new government with new priorities," Brown said after taking over. But British media highlighted the challenges facing the new government, including Iraq, the European Union and trying to avoid the accusations of too much "spin" that were made against Blair's administration. According to several newspapers, the high-profile post of foreign secretary was set to go to David Miliband, environment secretary in Blair's final cabinet. Miliband was reportedly urged by several Labour MPs to mount a leadership campaign against Brown. Trade and Industry Secretary Alistair Darling, a Brown ally, is believed to be Brown's replacement as chancellor of the exchequer, or finance minister. The Times newspaper published a full-page profile, describing him as "the new Chancellor". Brown's leadership campaign manager Jack Straw -- former foreign and home secretary -- was reported to be the favourite for the posts of justice minister and deputy prime minister. Alan Johnson, who was narrowly defeated to the post of Labour's deputy leader over the weekend, was meanwhile reported to be Patricia Hewitt's successor as health secretary. One paper also said that Ed Miliband, younger brother of the environment secretary, would likely be a cabinet member, making them the first pair of brothers in the cabinet since the 1920s. Newspapers said that Brown wanted to name figures from outside the Labour Party to increase his government's appeal. According to the conservative Daily Telegraph, Brown faces "a tricky challenge" as prime minister. "In order to convince the electorate that he leads a 'new' government, he has to distance himself from the very administration in which he was the second most powerful figure," the paper's editorial said. The right wing Daily Mail and centre-left The Independent both called on Brown to do away with what they described as the culture of "spin" that prevailed in the Blair years. For the Mail, Brown would have to restore "integrity, transparency and honesty to public life and rebuilding the mechanisms of democracy... So no more dumbing-down exams, distorting crime statistics or lying about hospital waiting lists." Brown took over from Blair as Labour Party leader on Sunday and has until May 2010 at the latest to call a general election, although opposition parties want him to call one immediately. The man dubbed the "Iron Chancellor" stewarded Britain through record economic expansion. But his serious style is a marked contrast to Blair's eloquent and easy, media-friendly persona. Rows between the two have dominated the media here amid claims that Brown repeatedly accused Blair of reneging on a deal to stand down sooner. But Blair still grabbed his fair share of headlines with the announcement that he would be the Middle East envoy for the Quartet -- the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia. Though some have questioned his credibility in the region, following his decision to back the US-led coalition that invaded Iraq in 2003, supporters have pointed to his success in Northern Ireland as an example of his mediating skills. Earlier this year, Blair was described as instrumental for getting rival groups in the troubled British province to agree to a power-sharing framework, bringing hope for an end to 30 years of sometimes violent clashes. On Wednesday, Brown praised Blair as "exceptionally well placed" to take on the Middle East role, saying he was "delighted" that he had been named to the po
