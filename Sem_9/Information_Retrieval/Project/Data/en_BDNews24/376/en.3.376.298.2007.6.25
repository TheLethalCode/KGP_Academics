 TOKYO, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweating, panting and some groaning, 400 Japanese worked out on Sunday with US fitness guru Billy Blanks, whose military-style exercises have become a huge hit in a country where waistlines are bulging. Overweight adults are far rarer in Japan than in the United States, but the government says millions of Japanese now suffer from metabolic syndrome -- a condition characterized by excess fat around the abdomen, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

"I've tried a lot of exercises, but I think the tempo and the feeling that everyone's doing it appeals to Japanese," said Reiko Munakata, 46, who works for a health food company. While television programs have played up the large number of Japanese who have quit the workout complaining of its high intensity, Osamu Ito, 34, said he still exercises with it two to three times a week.
