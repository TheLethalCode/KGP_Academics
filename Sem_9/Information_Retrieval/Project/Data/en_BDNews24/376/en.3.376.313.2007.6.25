 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police were questioning 14 teenagers on Monday over the murder of a boy who they suspect was stabbed to death during a fight between two gangs in London. Officers found the victim, believed to be 16, suffering serious injuries after they were called to a street fight in Beckenham, south London. The boy, who has not yet been identified, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Detectives said they had arrested 14 people, all in their mid-teens, who are being held at police stations in south London. The murder is the latest in a series of violent deaths involving teenagers in the capital this year, provoking intense debate about violent crime and gang culture. In February, three teenagers were shot dead in separate incidents in south London. Three more teenage boys were stabbed to death in the capital within weeks of the shootings.
