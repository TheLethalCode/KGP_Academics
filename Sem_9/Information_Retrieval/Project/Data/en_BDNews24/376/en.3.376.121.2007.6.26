 Chittagong, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong City Corporation's acting mayor M Manzur Alam Tuesday declared a Tk 396.79 crore corporation budget for fiscal 2007-08. He intends to achieve the spending target without levying new tax. Alam made his proposal at a meeting at the CCC. The budget declared an income of Tk 218.47 crore from CCC resources in addition to a forecasted Tk 151 crore government grant. A further Tk 26.82 crore income is earmarked to come from other sources, which were not explained. The 2006-07 budget was revised down to Tk 242.27 crore, from the original figure of Tk 390.81 crore. In the current budget, Tk 67 crore has been allocated for pay and allowances and Tk 142.30 crore for operations and maintenance. Development receives Tk 86 crore. The acting mayor called upon all citizens and private organisations to contribute more conscientiously to the huge municipal and holding tax deficit. Municipal and holding taxes are the major income source for CCC. In the next fiscal an amount of Tk 112 crore as well as an outstanding Tk 64 crore will be realised in this way, according to Alam. Alam referred to six large development projects that have already submitted their plans to the relevant ministries for approval and fund allocation. The projects include a Tk 132 crore urban infrastructure, environment and sanitation development project and a Tk 169 crore urban transport development project. Underdeveloped city wards should benefit from a Tk 100 crore road development project. The acting mayor also declared a raise in daily allowances for third- and fourth-class CCC employees. The increase will be Tk 30 and Tk 40 respectively for the next fiscal year. Special allocations have been made for addressing the city's drainage problems and hill ecosystem management, Alam said. On the two CCC housing projects under construction, which have forced hill cutting, he said: 'The corporation has always been law-abiding in this respect." Under the projects people have booked 500 out of the 722 plots. However the mayor mentioned nothing about ending the projects or refunding advances paid by applicants. bdnews24.
