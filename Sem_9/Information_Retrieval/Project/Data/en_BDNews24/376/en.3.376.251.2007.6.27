<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Liberal Democratic Party executive president Oli Ahmed Tuesday claimed that AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury had decided to quit the party. The exit of the stalwart from the relatively new political stripe is thought to be deepening the crisis within. Some leaders, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that the LDP had hurtled into near-collapse within eight months of its formation. Oli told a press conference that the party president, Badruddoza, decided to leave the party. Badruddoza is expected to talk to the press Wednesday to make his position clear on the LDP row. "Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury doesn't want to see him anymore with the LDP," Oli told reporters after a meeting at LDP presidium member Mohammad Ali Zinnah's home in Gulshan. The meeting was attended by LDP leaders Sheikh Razzak Ali, Zinnah, Redwan Ahmed, Prof Zahanara Begum, Anwarul Kabir Talukder, Alamgir Kabir, Abu Yusuf Mohammad Khalilur Rahman, Moni Swapon Dewan and Barrister Ziaur Rahman. Oli claimed that all members except for Badruddoza and retired major Abdul Mannan had signed the party's draft constitution, which has been designed to bring reforms in. "Badruddoza doesn't want to stay in LDP politics," presidium member Alamgir Kabir told bdnews24.com Tuesday night. LDP was formed on Oct 26, 2006 by Badruddoza, Oli Ahmed and 24 other former MPs and ministers of BNP. The party was formed after abolishing Bikolpo Dhara (Alternative Path), launched by the former president and son Mahi B Chowdhury. Within two months of LDP's formation, the party was threatened with a split by some senior leaders who were against the decision of the party forming a coalition with the Awami League to launch a collective movement against the BNP. With the BNP winning parliamentary elections in 2001, Badruddoza became foreign minister. He became president in November 2001, but his political success faded in less than a year. Badruddoza resigned as president under pressure from party leaders on June 21, 2002, for allegedly disrespecting the BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman by not visiting his grave on the anniversary of his death. bdnew
