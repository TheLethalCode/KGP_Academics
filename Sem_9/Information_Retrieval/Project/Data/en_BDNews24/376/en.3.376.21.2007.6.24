<TITLE> Tigers can't wait for the first Test: Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh cannot wait to play the first of the three-match Test series against hosts Sri Lanka starting June 25 in Colombo, captain Mohammad Ashraful said Saturday. "Everyone is waiting to play the first Test against Sri Lanka," Ahsraful told bdnews24.com by telephone on his way back to hotel in Colombo after a practice session at the Singhalese Sports Club ground. The Tigers Saturday had a tough workout after rains ruined their lone warm-up three-day match against Sri Lanka A in the Colts Cricket Stadium in Colombo. "There was cloud in the sky but no sign of rains. We toiled hard in the training," said Ashraful, the youngest Test centurion. The skipper believes his side would have gained more had they played longer in the rain-marred warm-up. "Though the better part of the warm-up match went down the drain due to rain, but the game helped us a lot in that everyone at least had some sort of match practice, something we needed," said the 22-year old middle-order batsman. bdnew
