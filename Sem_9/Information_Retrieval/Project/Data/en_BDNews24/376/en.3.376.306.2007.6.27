 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com) - Private sector investment declined significantly in the outgoing fiscal year, according to the Bangladesh Economic Review for 2007. Registration of private sector investment projects at the Board of Investment (BoI) reduced by 24 percent, from the previous fiscal year, 2006-07. "The drop was mainly due to major reductions in foreign and joint venture investments, local investments however have increased by 37.7 percent," according to the Review, a government document published annually. During the July-February period, of the outgoing fiscal year, some 1,516 projects worth Tk 25,239 crore were registered with the BoI. Of them, local investors registered 1,386 projects worth Tk 15,853 crore. Foreign investors registered the other 130 projects worth a total of Tk 9,385. During FY 2005-06 some 1,889-investment projects worth Tk 43,356 crore were registered with the BoI. Of them Tk 24,986 crore were made by foreign investors and Tk 18,370 crore by local investors. The private sector downturn was primarily due to a fall in foreign investments. There was a reduction of Tk 15,601 crore, for the first eight months, of the outgoing fiscal compared to the same period the previous year. The government has identified political uncertainty in the later half of last year and hesitancy in adopting big foreign investment proposals for the decline. Breakdowns of domestic private sector investment proposals for the July-February period of 2006-07 were supplied by the Review; textile sector stood at 70.23 percent, followed by 8.01 percent in chemicals and 7.73 percent in the service sector. The foreign investment breakdown stood at a staggering 85.65 percent in the service sector and 7.89 percent for the textile sector. A senior BoI official told bdnews24.com that they expect a surge in investment as the situation has improved significantly since January. "During registration, an entrepreneur submits an investment proposal to the BoI. This should be implemented within a specified period. Thus registration means only an investment commitment, not an actual investment," the official added. bd
