 MUMBAI, India, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Shane Watson will start a 12-day camp under Dennis Lillee at Chennai's "Pace Foundation" this week in a bid to combat injury. A member of the one-day side that won a third consecutive World Cup in the Caribbean recently, the 26-year-old all-rounder has suffered stress-related injuries to his back, hamstring and calves. "He is coming here to straighten his technique and work with Lillee," Foundation coach T.A. Sekhar told Reuters on Tuesday. "Most of the time, injuries occur because of faulty technique," added Sekhar, a former India fast bowler and national selector. Pace great Lillee periodically visits the foundation where he is chief coach. Australia's left-arm fast-medium bowler Mitchell Johnson will also attend the camp along with the team's fast-bowling coach Troy Cooley, Sekhar said
