 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The emergency cabinet Saturday approved in principle a proposal for making an independent Election Commission Secretariat, the government said in a statement. The weekly meeting of the council of advisers directed the law ministry to place a draft of an ordinance on the issue to execute the decision, the statement of the Press Information Department said. Various political parties, nongovernmental think-tanks and media have long been demanding such an independent body to propel democratic practice in the country. With the latest decision, the interim government is going to design the ordinance to complete the process since chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has repeated his pledges over the past few months to establish an independent secretariat free from the influence of the Prime Minister's Office. Under the constitution, the EC Secretariat works under the Prime Minister's Office, a provision that often hinders its normal activities, experts say. Law adviser Mainul Hosein said the decision came after a thorough discussion in the meeting. "The law ministry will prepare the draft of the ordinance. We'll then place it before the cabinet very soon," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. Chaired by the chief adviser, Saturday's meeting also approved a draft law for turning the cash-strapped, trouble-ridden Biman Bangladesh Airlines into a public limited company. The meeting also gave the green light to the draft Bangladesh Biman Corporation (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 to make it a PLC. It will steer the government's effort for Biman's "corporatisation". It will also help cut mismanagement and reorganise the manpower of Biman, according to the statement. The troubled airline will be renamed Bangladesh Airlines Limited. The meeting asked for a scrutiny of the draft of the airline's Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association before placing them before the cabinet. bdnews24.com/eh
