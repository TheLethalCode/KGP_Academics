 LONDON, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday as banks and mining stocks bore the brunt of investor concern about the impact of the troubled US mortgage market on the broader economy. British mortgage bank Northern Rock was the top loser in Europe, shedding about 9 percent after cutting its 2007 profit forecast. Shares in Spanish construction company Sacyr Vallehermoso shed over 6 percent after French regulators ruled the company should sweeten its takeover offer for rival Eiffage, whose shares rose 0.1 percent. At 1049 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares had fallen 0.4 percent at 1,581.25 points. Almost every bank stock within the FTSEurofirst was in negative territory by midday, led by Northern Rock, as investors fretted about the wider repercussions of the deterioration in the U.S. subprime lending sector. "We're not looking at anything systemic and this represents something of an overreaction, but there is an element of "don't know"," said Jonathan Lawlor, Fox-Pitt Kelton head of research.

In other European markets, Britain's FTSE 100 benchmark fell 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX fell 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 0.3 percent.

"People are looking for clarity, and they've flipped into the other mode, looking for reasons to sell," said HSBC strategist Patrik Schowitz. "The consumer numbers would have scared them, and people are thinking that they should start thinking about rate cuts again," he said. Consumer confidence in the United States hit a 10-month low in June, reflecting worries about jobs and the business climate, adding to jitters in the financial markets about the health of the US banking sector after Bear Stearns said last week it would bail out one of two hedge funds it manages that has invested in debt backed by less creditworthy mortgages. The FTSEurofirst has shed nearly 2 percent in June, putting it on track for its worst monthly performance since February, when a sudden drop in Chinese stock markets rattled equity investors worldwide. The uncertainty over the outlook for economic growth stripped 0.3 percent off copper prices, which hit mining stocks. Rio Tinto fell 2.3 percent, while Anglo American dropped 2.5 percent, Kazakhmys fell 3.5 percent and BHP Billiton fell nearly 3 percent. Among gainers, was Gaz de France rose nearly 3 percent following a newspaper report that its merger with Suez was to be completed soon. Suez rallied 1 percent.
