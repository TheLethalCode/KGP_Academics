 Belfast, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- South Africa captain Jacques Kallis hit an unbeaten 91 to ease South Africa to a four-wicket win over India in their first one-dayer in the Future Cup in Belfast on Tuesday. India made 242 for eight, helped by 99 from Sachin Tendulkar and 74 by Rahul Dravid. But Kallis and all-rounder Vernon Philander (17 not out) put on an unbeaten 55 for the seventh wicket as South Africa reached 245-6 and victory with three balls to spare. South Africa lead the three-match series 1-0 with the next game on Friday. Both teams previously beat Ireland in one-dayers. Earlier, Tendulkar and Dravid put on 158 in 32 overs as India totalled 242-8 in Stormont. Tendulkar was run out for 99, yards short as he attempted a second run to take him to his 42nd century in ODIs. Proteas paceman Andre Nel (3-47) picked up two wickets with the new ball before yorking a tired Dravid for 74. India, whose squad has been depleted by flu, struggled to accelerate significantly over the closing overs. But in the 48th over, wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik at least hit two fours and a six off Charl Langeveldt before being bowled by Andrew Hall (2-40). Tendulkar, who opened the batting with Sourav Ganguly, hit 12 fours off the 143 balls he faced before losing his wicket in the 46th over. bdn
