 TEHRAN, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran next week will start rationing its heavily subsidised gasoline for three months, the head of parliament's energy commission said in comments published on Monday. Iranian lawmakers have made several statements in recent days on when the delayed scheme to ration fuel in OPEC's number two exporter may be implemented, but the government has yet to announce the exact timing. Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hameneh said on Thursday the final decision will be taken this week.

Analysts say that puts a big strain on state coffers and encourages waste. The imports are seen as sensitive when world powers are threatening to ratchet up United Nations sanctions on Iran for failing to heed U.N. demands to limit its atomic work. Daneshyar added that the quota of fuel for each car will be 100 litres per month The first phase of gasoline rationing started on June 14, limiting fuel that drivers of state-owned cars can buy. Some Iranians have been stocking up gasoline in recent weeks, local media has said. Drivers must also produce electronic "smart" cards to buy any fuel, and there have also been media reports of problems in their distribution. The United States, which is leading efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear plans, has said Iran's gasoline imports are a point of "leverage." Washington accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran deni
