<TITLE> NBR to run Tk 1,800 crore revenue deficit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) - The National Board of Revenue (NBR) will face a Tk 1,800 crore shortfall in revenue receipts for the outgoing fiscal year, NBR chairman Badiur Rahman said Sunday. NBR's revised target was set at Tk 37,479 crore for the outgoing fiscal year 2006-07, which ends on June 30. The NBR's original revenue target was Tk 41,055 crore. The target for the coming fiscal 2007-08 is set at Tk 43,850 crore. Failure to earn the revised target was blamed on a drop in submission of bill of entries at the import level, according to the NBR chairman. "We set a target to earn Tk 5,500 crore in June to attain the revised target, however this may not be achieved," Rahman told reporters at the finance ministry. "The ultimate shortfall may stand at Tk 1,800 crore at the end of the fiscal year," he said. The proposed budget for the coming fiscal differs from the previous one in that proposed tax measures would be implemented from 1st July. "In previous budgets, tax proposals have been implemented by statutory regulatory orders, soon after the announcement of the budget. Perhaps importers are waiting for July 01 to submit bill of entries against their imports, to see the changes in the proposed budget," Rahman told reporters. Replying to a query the NBR chairman said some Tk 54 lakh has been taxed so far under the provision of legalising undisclosed money. Under this policy a 5 percent penalty charge has been attached to existing rates. This facility was extended on June 5 and will continue until July 31. "People are making queries, but they are not taking advantage of the opportunity," he said. He admitted people might be fearful of taking any chances. In another question, Rahman said a universal self-assessment system for taxation would come into being from July 01, in order to avoid the alleged harassment of taxpayers by officials. "Under the system, tax officials are bound to receive statements submitted by the taxpayers," he said. Rahman added that in suspicious cases, the NBR would audit the files rather than officials at the related zones. bd
