 SEOUL, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea may have fired a short-range missile off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. The possible launch came as UN nuclear inspectors visited the reclusive communist state to discuss shutting down a reactor at the heart of its atomic arms programmes under a disarmament deal reached in February. "We have signs that North Korea fired a short-range missile into the East Sea (Sea of Japan) off the coast of South Hamgyong province at around 11:30 this morning (0230 GMT) and we're running a close analysis on that," Yonhap quoted a government source as saying. The type of missile was not known but the launch was believed to be part of regular drills, the source said. The Defence Ministry could not confirm the report. North Korea fired at least two short-range missiles over the past month. Officials in Seoul and one North Korean official played down the launches, saying they were part of regular military drills. North Korea raised security concerns in July 2006 when it defied international warnings and test-fired a barrage of ballistic missiles, including its long-range Taepodong
