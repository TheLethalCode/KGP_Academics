 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Politicians Saturday stressed strengthening the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) to rein in prices of daily essentials. They suggested an alternative market system, creating opportunities for small businessmen to destroy the syndicate and tighten monitoring. At a seminar at the National Press Club, the speakers said only political leadership could take the burden of soaring prices off people. They demanded immediate enactment of a law to protect consumer rights. "Without political leadership, people won't feel relieved. Not the politics with bad elements, but only those who proved their worth in the past in leading the country successfully can bring relief to people," Awami League organising secretary Mahmudur Rahman Manna said. Manna said businessmen exploited opportunities from the interim government but the condition of market remained unchanged. He said the AL during its rule had been successful to control soaring market prices. Retired colonel Faruk Khan, Awami League industry and commerce secretary, said the past BNP-led government had made the country dependent on import and the alliance leaders hiked prices with the help of a syndicate. Faruk Khan said it was not BDR's job to sell things. "Their duty is to guard the border." TCB must be strong to rein in the prices of essentials, he said. Former Jatiya Party MP GM Quader said he did not see any change in the prices of essentials during the interim government. "Previous governments pointed finger at the international market when asked about the price hike. The interim government is no exception," he added. The Citizen Rights Movement, a human rights organisation, organised the seminar. bdnews
