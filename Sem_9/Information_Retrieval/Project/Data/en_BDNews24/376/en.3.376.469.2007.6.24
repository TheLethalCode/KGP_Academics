 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Joint forces Sunday evening raided the Dhanmondi home of the late rear admiral Mahbub Ali Khan, the father-in-law of Tarique Rahman. But the joint forces did not seize anything from the house, it has been learnt. Habibur Rahman, caretaker for Mahbub Bhaban on Dhanmondi Road No. 5, confirmed the news of the raid to bdnews24.com. "Three plainclothes officers talked to madam (Tarique's mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu) and left," he said. The officers quizzed Tarique's brother-in-law Shafiuzzaman, a former naval officer. Rahman said he had seen a vehicle of the joint forces parked at the gate. Jahangir Alam, an employee of Pia Fashion close to Mahbub Bhaban, told bdnews24.com: "Three cars came in. Some officers entered the house and stayed there for about half an hour." It has been learnt that the joint forces drove to Mahbub Bhaban at 6.30pm. Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain said he was not aware of the raid. bdnews
