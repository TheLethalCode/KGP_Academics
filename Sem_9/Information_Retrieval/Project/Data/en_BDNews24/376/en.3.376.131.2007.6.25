 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British media firm Chrysalis Group Plc plans to sell its radio business for 170 million pounds ($340 million) to a private equity firm chaired by former ITV Chief Executive Charles Allen. Chrysalis, which will be left as a pure music company, expects to return up to 100 million pounds to its shareholders as a result of the sale, it said on Monday. The deal marks the end of Chrysalis's review of its radio arm, which includes the popular Heart 106.2 station and which the it started building from scratch in 1994. Chrysalis expects a profit on disposal of 95 million pounds. "We are absolutely happy with the sale and price and as you can see we made a very successful return on our investment," Chief Executive Richard Huntingford told Reuters on Monday. The new home of radio stations Heart, Galaxy and LBC is investment vehicle Global Radio, which has been set up to specifically invest in UK radio. Its chairman, Charles Allen, stepped down from the board of ITV last October, after the group lost advertisers and viewers, receiving a 4.2 million pound payoff. The selling price comes in at the bottom of analysts' forecast range of 170 to 180 million pounds, but Bridgwell's Patric Yau valued the deal favourably as it represented 17 times the core earnings he expects for 2007, he said in a note. Chrysalis plans to return the profit -- between 90 million pounds and 100 million -- to shareholders by early autumn once it has been approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting, Huntingford said. The disposal leaves Chrysalis as a pure music company. "Our music publishing business has been performing extremely well," Huntingford said, adding it would continue its strategy of signing up-and-coming writers as well as established ones. The business benefited from releases of hit albums from Gnarls Barkley and the Dixie Chicks in 2006 and has recently signed deals with artists such as Daman Albarn, know for his work with Blur and Gorillaz. Huntingford did not, however, rule out the possibility that that Chrysalis would cease to exist as a listed company. "Obviously, it (the Chrysalis music business) has been operating in an industry that has seen a lot of change and consolidation and the Chrysalis board will therefore continue to monitor its positioning." Bridgewell analysts see little logic in Chrysalis remaining a listed company in the longer term and estimate an enterprise value of around 140 million pounds for the music business. Shares in Chrysalis were unchanged at 128 pence, valuing the firm at 214.8 million poun
