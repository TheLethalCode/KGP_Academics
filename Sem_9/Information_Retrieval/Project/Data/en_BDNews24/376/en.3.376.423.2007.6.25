 Paris, June-25 (bdnews24.com/reuters)--US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said the world has failed the people of Darfur, ahead of talks in Paris on the troubled Sudanese region. I do not think that the international community has really lived up to its responsibilities here," Ms Rice said. Some 200,000 people have died and 2.4m fled the violence in Darfur since 2003. Representatives from the US, France, China and Egypt will be at the conference, but not from Sudan nor the rebel factions. Much of the violence has been linked to clashes between pro-government Janjaweed militias and Darfur's rebel groups. Massacres Having described the killing in Darfur as genocide, the Bush administration wants to be seen taking a lead in solving the crisis in Monday's summit, says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington.

Our correspondent says in contrast, China, a close ally of Khartoum, sees the conference as an opportunity to turn attention on those rebel groups that have not signed up to a peace agreement. Ms Rice will be joined at the summit by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner - a recent appointee by new President Nicolas Sarkozy. For the last four years Gallic interest in Darfur has largely been limited to watching from an air base in neighbouring Chad, says the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Paris. But with a new leader and Socialist foreign minister, there has come a new commitment to get involved, he says. At a joint news conference on Sunday, Ms Rice and Mr Kouchner said there was a need for decisive action. "If in fact the Sudanese are prepared to accept the hybrid force, they need to accept it once and for all and stop the process of trying to scale it back," Ms Rice was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying. Mr Kouchner said there was still time to end the killing. "I know that it has been going on for years. So what? Is that a reason to not be interested and let the massacres go on forever? Even if the massacres were bigger, they must be stopped," Reuters news agency quoted Mr Kouchner as saying. However, our correspondent in Paris says France's sudden enthusiasm has not been well received by everyone - Sudan was not invited and AU peacekeepers have refused to attend. Sudan's government denies backing the Arab Janjaweed militias accused of the worst atrocities against Darfur's black African population. Khartoum says the scale of the problems has been exaggerated for politi
