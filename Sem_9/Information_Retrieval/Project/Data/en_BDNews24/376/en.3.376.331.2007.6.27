<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina Tuesday asked the interim government to end the emergency and lift embargo on indoor politics, accusing it of duplicity. "On the one hand there is a ban on politics and on the other, reform proposals are being made. Some are doing politics. Why is this duplicity?" the Awami League president asked. "Why is that some will do politics and others would not, some would be allowed to, some would not? In that case, [the government] had better end the state of emergency and lift the embargo on parlour politics." The former prime minister spoke to journalists when she went to see member of the advisory council of Dhaka City AL Dr Moazzem Hossain at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. "Let's not deprive the people of their right to vote, let it be only the people to choose their leaders," Hasina said. On the reforms in her party, she said, "It is I who proposed reforms first. Reforms are being done in the Awami League in tune with time. "But everything would be clear about who needs how much reform if the constitutions of the Awami League and the BNP are compared. "The powers of president in my party are very limited," Hasina said. She said electoral reforms were snailing. Five months have gone by since the interim government took office but the Election Commission has yet to come up with transparent ballot boxes. The army showed the EC three samples of transparent ballot boxes and the EC needs to pick one of them to be manufactured at the machine tools factory, the AL chief said. bdnews2
