<TITLE> Upazila election task will shift to EC: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided in principle to give the Election Commission the responsibility to conduct the upazila elections. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal Tuesday said, "After amendments to upazila election rules and finalisation of the voter list, the EC will formally take over upazila election duties." Expenses for national and upazila elections doubled, the adviser said, if held separately. The government would send the EC a proposal on the chances of the two elections being held together, the adviser added. "Once the voter listing is done, government will conduct city corporation elections in addition to those for some municipalities. The EC has already been notified about it," he said. On the appointment of Zila Parishad administrators, Iqbal said, "There is no bar to it in the Zila Parishad act. However, the government has not yet taken any decision in this regard." On a question relating to the cooperative organisation Milk Vita, he said, "Papers that smack of corruption are sent to the Anticorruption Commission. The commission will take necessary action after proper investigation." bdnews24
