 PARIS, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saying "silence kills", French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged delegates to a Darfur meeting on Monday to find a way to stop the violence that has ravaged Sudan's vast west for more than four years. France gathered senior officials from 18 countries at a Paris meeting aimed at galvanizing international efforts to stabilise the western Sudanese region, where the United States has declared genocide has taken place. "As human beings, and as politicians, we must resolve the crisis in Darfur," Sarkozy told the officials gathered at France's Elysee presidential palace. "Silence kills," he added. "We want to mobilize the international community to say 'enough is enough'. Delegations from the world's top aid donors, members of the Group of Eight industrialised nations and powerful Sudan ally China met to help find a political solution to the conflict and provide cash for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid. Several delegates, however, said they did not expect a large package of immediate measures to be agreed, though some countries could pledge troops and funds for a planned "hybrid" United Nations and African Union peacekeeping force. Sudan, which did not attend the meeting, agreed earlier this month to the combined U.N.-AU force of more than 20,000 troops and police but many diplomats doubt it will keep its word. The aim of the force is to stop the violence in Darfur, where international experts estimate 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been expelled from their homes in more than four years of strife. Sudan says 9,000 people have died. Sarkozy said the existing force of 7,000 AU troops, which is widely seen as ineffective and is to be reinforced by the proposed hybrid force, must get more funding. He said France was willing to contribute roughly 10 million euros ($13.46 million). The European Union pledged an extra 31 million euros of humanitarian funds for "the coming months". France has shown greater interest in Darfur since Sarkozy took office and has proposed sending an international force to neighbouring Chad to provide stability for refugee camps there, which house tens of thousands of people who have fled Darfur. French financial aid to Darfur remains low compared with other European powers. It gave 3.9 million euros in 2006, with 2.5 million euros this year, UN figures show. The Darfur problem dates to early 2003 when non-Arab rebels took up arms, accusing the government of not heeding their plight in the remote, arid region. Khartoum mobilised Arab militia to quell the revolt. Some militia members, known locally as Janjaweed, embarked on a campaign of killing, pillage and rape. Sudan denies it supported the Janjaweed, and calls them outlaws. Rebels in Darfur, who have split into more than a dozen groups since a 2006 peace deal signed by only one of three rebel factions, have been blamed in recent months for attacks on civilians, including aid workers. An AU-U.N. mediation initiative hopes to have all factions in the dispute ready to begin talks around August, and China said Khartoum was prepared to take part. "I met with president al-Bashir in Sudan. He told me that the Sudanese government actually is ready to come to the negotiating table, at any time, in any place," China's special envoy Liu Guijin special envoy Liu Guijin told reporte
