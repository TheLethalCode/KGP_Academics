<TITLE> Poor nations face new health challenges: World Bank </TITLE>

 Washington, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cancer, diabetes, obesity and heart disease, already common in rich countries, are a growing problem in the developing world, where they are likely to become the main causes of death by 2015, the World Bank said on Wednesday. A new World Bank report warned that such health problems will put tight health-care budgets in developing nations under further strain. It urged governments to encourage healthier living patterns among people. Rising life expectancy, lower fertility rates and changing lifestyles, with more smoking, bad diets and lack of exercise, were factors contributing to the increasing rates of the diseases, the report said. Such health problems not only affect the elderly but also afflicted people between the ages of 15 and 69, when they are their most productive, the report said. "Many studies tend to underestimate the real cost of non-communicable diseases to individual people and their families, which can cause a household to slip below the poverty line," says Joy Phumaphi, vice president of the bank's Human Development Network and a former health minister of Botswana. "When a family member falls sick with a chronic illness, families in developing countries often tap into their meager savings, or sell what they own to cover the costs of care and lost wages," she added. The report cautioned that social and economic costs of dealing with the problem would be expensive. It said treating heart disease costs between 1 and 3 percent of gross domestic product in most developed countries. The annual per capita burden of heart disease is about $4 to $8 in China and India, $15 to $30 in Brazil and South Africa, and about $70 to $90 in Russia. The report also said the direct costs of diabetes are between 2.5 to 15.0 percent of annual health-care budgets, depending on local prevalence and treatments. Among low and middle-income countries, total diabetes-related costs were highest in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the economic burden of diabetes has been estimated at $65 billion annually, or typically between 2 and 4 percent of GDP in most countries, the report said. It suggested that countries focus on encouraging healthy aging and to adapt their health systems to cope with the growing number of elderly people who will need long-term care and expensive treatments. In Indonesia, for example, private health-care spending is projected to more than double by 2020, compared to 2005, as its elderly population grows in size, and needs treatment for chronic diseases, the World Bank said. The report said countries could discourage tobacco use, obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure by enforcing legislation such as cigarette taxes or mandatory nutrition labeling. Countries could also push for screening for the diseases during normal check-ups and providing timely treatment.
