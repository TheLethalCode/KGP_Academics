 LONDON, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British mortgage bank Northern Rock cut 2007 profit forecasts on Wednesday, blaming a rise in funding costs following a series of interest rate rises, sending its shares tumbling over 10 percent. The interest rate impact overshadowed news the bank had won its best ever share of mortgages and that it would "noticeably" increase its dividend in the future. Northern Rock, Britain's eighth-biggest listed bank and fifth-largest mortgage provider, said higher funding costs and other factors would hit income by 180 million to 200 million pounds ($359-399 million) this year. "We get squeezed when rates rise, and we've now had rising rates for a year, and the expectations for interest rates have changed notably since the first quarter," Adam Applegarth, Northern Rock CEO, told Reuters in an interview. Britain's housing market has also cooled after the rises, and the number of mortgage approvals in May was down 4 percent from a year ago, official data showed on Wednesday. Northern Rock said its underlying attributable profits are likely to rise 15 percent this year, to about 422 million pounds, below analysts' average forecast of 17 percent growth. "What have we assumed behind the 15 percent profit forecast? Rising interest rates," Applegarth said, adding that he expected two more rate rises this year. Analysts polled by Reuters expect on average another 50 basis points on the base rate this year. By 0900 GMT Northern Rock shares were down 8.9 percent at 863 pence, after hitting 832p, their lowest level since November 2005, and cutting the bank's value to 3.6 billion pounds. The shares have slumped by a quarter this year, hit by fears about the impact of rate rises and a slower housing market. Analysts at ABN AMRO and Collins Stewart both cut their ratings on the shares to "hold" and other analysts cut earnings forecasts. The impact spilled over to rival mortgage providers, and shares in HBOS, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley were all down over 2.5 percent. Housebuilders Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey also warned on Wednesday that the UK housing market was running out of steam. Northern Rock also said it would shift strategy following a move to Basel II capital requirement reforms and would not keep higher risk lending -- such as unsecured loans, lower quality mortgages and commercial loans -- on its own balance sheet. "What it will mean is where we have excess capital once we implement the strategy, you'll see our dividend go up noticeably ... and you'll see our share buybacks step up," Applegarth said, declining to comment on the scale of either rise. Analysts at Merrill Lynch said they expected around 200 million pounds of buybacks over the next year. Applegarth said he was confident the changes would put the bank "on a much more sustainable footing than five years ago". Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note: "This (earnings guidance change) reflects period-specific strain in 2007 and does not indicate the business model is not working." Northern Rock said its gross mortgage market share in the first five months of this year was around 10 percent, above a year earlier, and its net share of lending jumped to 19 percent, a record for the bank and up from 13 percent in 2006. The bank's traditional mortgage share is 8 perce
