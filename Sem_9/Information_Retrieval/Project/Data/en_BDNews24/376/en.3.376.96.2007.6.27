 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks fell across the board Wednesday as investors locked in gains in most sectors following a 10-day rally. Indices rallied in the morning session, but continued declining until trading ended. Some mutual funds and life insurance stocks, however, moved up amid buying pressure. "The market looks a little overheated. Prices of most issues have risen across the board without any particular reason. It's quite irrational," said Saiful Islam, chief of Equity Partners Securities. "Small investors should be cautious and keep booking the profit," he suggested. The benchmark DGEN or general index finished at 2131.79, down 17.47 points or 0.81 percent. The DSI or all-share price index shed 17.06 points or 0.96 percent to 1753.29. The DSE-20 blue chip index plunged 8.77 points or 0.99 percent to 1872.79. Losers surpassed gainers 103 to 66. A total of 30 issues held steady on the Dhaka Stock Exchange. Turnover also dropped to Tk 1.58 billion from the historic high of Tk 2.34 billion Tuesday. "It's good to see a break in the consistent rise. Such a rally is a not a healthy sign for any market," said Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of Imtiyaz Husain Securities. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange ended downbeat amid decline in turnover. Turnover reached Tk 285 million from Tuesday's Tk 454.83 million- a new high in CSE history. Losers also dominated gainers on the bourse as 63 issues fell, 28 advanced and 13 closed unchanged. On the DSE, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, leader in turnover at Tk 105.93 million, ended 0.72 percent lower at Tk 582.75. Southeast Bank, BRAC Bank, Shahjalal Bank and Pubali Bank were next to Power Grid. Southeast Bank, BRAC Bank and Shahjalal Bank fell due to profit taking. Pubali Bank, however, added after it claimed to have received a treasury bond worth Tk. 336.5 million from the government against its classified amounts to Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC). Southeast Bank dropped 0.91 percent to Tk 485.75. BRAC Bank slumped 1.95 percent to Tk 751.75. Shahjalal Bank closed at Tk 235.25, down 0.10 percent. Pubali Bank added 2.17 percent to Tk 763.
