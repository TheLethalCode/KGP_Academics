 BEIJING, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Communist Party chief Hu Jintao pledged in a speech published on Tuesday to cautiously pursue political reform and deepen inner-party democracy, setting the tone for a key meeting in the autumn. Internal policy debates have intensified in the run-up to the 17th party congress, where Hu is expected to further consolidate power through a leadership reshuffle and unveil the country's agenda for the next five years. In his speech on Monday, Hu elevated his political doctrines -- harmonious society and scientific development -- to the same political status as that of his predecessors in a move analysts said would pave for the way for him to join the country's pantheon of socialist greats. "Reform and opening-up is an inevitable path to realise the Chinese nation's great rejuvenation ... and should be pushed forward unswervingly," the People's Daily, the party organ, quoted Hu as saying. But "our country's political reforms must adhere to a correct political direction ... and adhere to the party's leadership", Hu said in an indication the Communist Party, which has monopolised power since the 1949 revolution, is not about to embrace Western-style democracy. The People's Daily and other newspapers splashed on their front pages Hu's speech to the party's elite 198-member Central Committee, the top brass and provincial leaders at the Central Party School which trains political rising stars. Hu, who took over the top party job from Jiang Zemin in 2002, also pledged to "perfect inner-party democracy to expand the party's democratic awareness". He did not elaborate, but sources with ties to the leadership said inner-party democracy is likely to be deepened at the 17th congress. "In the previous congress, the number of Central Committee candidates was 5 percent more than the number of seats. It'll be expanded at the 17th congress," one source told Reuters, requesting anonymity. Market reforms introduced in the late 1970s ended decades of political turmoil and have transformed China from an economic backwater into the world's fourth-largest economy. But political reforms have virtually stalled since 1989 when People's Liberation Army troops and tanks crushed student-led demonstrations for democracy centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed. Hu emphasised the necessity of his political campaign to promote a "harmonious society", Communist jargon for easing social tensions spawned by a widening wealth gap, as well as rising medical and education costs. He called for "scientific development", his catchphrase for sustainable, energy-efficient economic development instead of breakneck growth at the expense of the environment. Hu said socialist democracy was a long-term goal of the party, which has made "active and safe" efforts toward this end, adding that grassroots democracy should be developed. But "expanding citizens' political participation must be orderly" and the party's leading role must be ensured, Hu said. He said fighting corruption was "long-term, difficult and complicated" wo
