 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) - The proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08 will be approved through a presidential ordinance on June 28, senior government officials said Sunday. Acting finance secretary Dr Mohammad Tareq and National Board of Revenue Chairman Badiur Rahman disclosed after a meeting with President Prof Iajuddin Ahmed at Bangabhaban. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam led the delegation. "We went to Bangabhaban to brief the President on the proposed budget before taking his final approval through an ordinance. This system informs the President prior to his final approval of the financial bill," Tareq said. After amendments, if needed, the council of advisers must approve the proposed budget before it is finalised by a presidential ordinance on June 28, Badiur said. Regarding changes in the proposed budget, Badiur said, "We'll do whatever is of benefit to people." However he declined to discuss any specific changes, including an anticipated change in tariffs on computers, raw materials and capital machinery. Azizul announced a Tk 87,137 crore budget for FY 2007-08 on June 7. The finance adviser also proposed to restructure three-tier import duty slabs at 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent from 5 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent respectively. Businessmen fear this will hit domestic industry. bd
