The loss followed Saturday's nine-wicket defeat by India in another one-dayer. As rain disrupted play for a second day, South Africa made 173-4 in 31 overs and then bowled Ireland out for 131 in 30.5 overs with one-day debutant Vernon Philander taking four for 12 in 5.5 overs. Ireland captain Trent Johnston said his side's amateur status meant they were struggling to rediscover the form that saw the newcomers to top-level cricket beat Pakistan and Bangladesh at the World Cup. "In the World Cup, when we were 24/7 cricket, we were a different side," Johnston was quoted as saying by the BBC following Saturday's India game when Ireland were bowled out for 193 in 50 overs. India responded after rain delayed play by reaching a revised target of 171 from 39 overs with 4.1 overs to spare and with the loss of one wicket.
