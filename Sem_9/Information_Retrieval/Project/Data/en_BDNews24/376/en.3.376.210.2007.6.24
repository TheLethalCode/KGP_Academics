 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday remanded BNP leader Mosaddak Ali Falu in custody for five more days for the investigators to grill him in a relief embezzlement case. Dhaka district first class magistrate Salma Siddiqa Mahtab issued the order at about 4pm after the investigation officer Md Abdus Salam appealed for seven days to interrogate him. Ashulia police sub-inspector Ismail Hossain filed the case on February 10 after the police seized 650 corrugated iron sheets from Shanghai Bangla Ceramic Industries that Falu, also chairman of private TV station ntv, owns. Falu's lawyer Advocate Sanaullah Mia opposed the remand appeal in court. At about 3pm, metropolitan magistrate Jagannath Das Khokon ordered him into jail in line with an appeal of investigation officer Salam, also an assistant director of the Anticorruption Commission. Falu was taken to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka after interrogation in another case filed with Tejgaon Police Station for misappropriating relief materials. He was interrogated for 11 days in the case. bdnew
