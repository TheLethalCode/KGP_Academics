 TEHRAN, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's state broadcaster will launch a 24-hour English-language satellite news channel next week to rival dominant Western services, a senior official said on Tuesday. Tehran-based PRESS TV starts broadcasting from Tehran on Monday staffed by both Iranians and foreigners, and will seek to compete against the likes of CNN and BBC World, Nader Rad, head of live programming, told Reuters. "The news is mostly covered by the Western media. We would like to have a say in this," he said. "They (Western outlets) don't usually cover the whole story ... The news about Iraq does not cover all perspectives. The news about Palestine and Beirut is also like this," he said.

The Iranian channel faces an increasingly crowded field of English-language satellite channels after last year's launch of Al Jazeera International by the Qatar-based broadcaster and France 24, which promised a "French vision".

Officially ordinary Iranians cannot see any of these channels at home because satellite dishes are banned. In practice, the ban is only sporadically enforced and such dishes are plainly visible on rooftops in Tehran and elsewhere. Rad said PRESS TV would carry news bulletins, talk shows and documentaries, some of which would be bought from abroad. "It is a state-owned channel but it is not managed by the state. It has its own guidelines," Rad said but would not give further details about editorial poli
