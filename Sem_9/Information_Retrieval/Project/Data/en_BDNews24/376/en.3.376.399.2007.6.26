 SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Tue Jun 26,California (Reuters) - Firefighters had a wildfire near California's popular Lake Tahoe resort 40 percent contained on Monday after it engulfed 2,500 acres and destroyed or damaged more than 200 homes. About 700 firefighters battled the blaze, which had been fanned by high winds, and finally succeeded in bringing much of it under control, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Yvonne Jones told reporters.

As the winds eased firefighters were hoping they could keep the blaze in check. The Lake Tahoe fire came as California braced for a tough fire season after an unusually dry winter. As fire crews battled the Lake Tahoe blaze, a 6,000-acre (2,500-hectare) fire 80 miles north of Los Angeles forced evacuation of some residents of Rosamond, California.
