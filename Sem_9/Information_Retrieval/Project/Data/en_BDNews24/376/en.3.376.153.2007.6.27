<TEXT>
 London, June-27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/BBC)--Labour leader Gordon Brown is the UK's new prime minister after being asked to form a government by the Queen. He takes over from Tony Blair who stood down earlier after 10 years in the job, following warm tributes from MPs. It is the first time in 17 years a UK prime minister has entered office without a general election. Mr Brown, who was the longest serving chancellor in modern times, is heading to Downing Street where he will enter No 10 as PM for the first time. He is thought likely to begin a Cabinet reshuffle by naming the next chancellor and home secretary, with a fuller shake-up expected on Thursday. Mr Brown, 56, has been seen as the unofficial prime-minister-in-waiting for the past decade - finally getting his chance when Mr Blair announced he would stand down after three terms. He became Labour leader unopposed on Sunday after potential rivals had failed to gain enough support to mount a challenge. Mr Blair is now expected to take up a new role as a Middle East peace envoy with the so-called "quartet" of Russia, the EU, America and the UN. Earlier, as they left Downing Street the Blair family - including their four children - posed for the gathered world media. Mr Blair said nothing to the press as they got in the car, but wife Cherie smiled and waved at the press and said she would not "miss" them. In his final prime minister's questions in the Commons Mr Blair received a standing ovation from MPs on all sides, in unprecedented scenes. Tributes Mr Blair admitted he had "never pretended to be a great House of Commons man" but he paid tribute to the "noble" work of MPs and - in his final words to Parliament - said: "I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that is that, the end." I am truly sorry for the dangers they face today Tony Blair plays tribute to British soldiers Mr Blair, who was being watched from the public gallery by his family, also paid tribute to troops killed in Iraq, saying he was "truly sorry about the dangers they face today". Conservative leader David Cameron hailed Mr Blair's "remarkable achievement" in being prime minister for 10 years, praising peace in Northern Ireland and Mr Blair's work in the developing world which he said will "endure". He wished Mr Blair "every success for whatever he does in the future". Mr Blair thanked Mr Cameron for his tributes and said although he could not wish the Tory leader well politically, "personally I wish both him and his family very well indeed". Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said that, despite their political disagreements, Mr Blair had been "unfailingly courteous" and extended his party's best wishes to the outgoing prime minister and his family. Mr Blair returned the compliment, saying Sir Menzies had a "generosity of spirit and courtesy". Brown priorities Mr Brown has singled out education and affordable housing as two of his key concerns on taking over as prime minister, but says the NHS is his "immediate priority". He has also admitted that Iraq is "a divisive issue for our party and our country" and pledged to "learn lessons that need to be learned". What do I want Brown to do? Call an election and see if he gets a proper mandate to be PM Annie, Aberdeenshire Once he leaves office, Mr Blair is expected to travel to his Sedgefield constituency, in the north east of England, on Wednesday evening to announce he is standing down as an MP after 24 years. John Prescott is also stepping down from frontline politics after 10 years as deputy prime minister. It is not certain whether Mr Brown will appoint a replaceme
