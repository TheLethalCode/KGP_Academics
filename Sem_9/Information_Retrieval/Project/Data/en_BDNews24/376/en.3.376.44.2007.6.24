 AMMAN, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah said on Sunday that a regional summit this week must push for a quick resumption of peace talks with Israel after Hamas's takeover of Gaza that dealt a strong blow to Palestinian unity. The pro-Western monarch assured Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas he still backed him as the "legitimate authority" after the rival Islamist movement Hamas seized the Gaza Strip on June 14 from Abbas's Fatah forces..

"We expect the summit to discuss ways to support the Palestinians, especially lifting the siege on the Palestinians," the monarch was quoted as saying. Israel, which withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, is letting nothing but essential humanitarian supplies through its security cordon around the coastal enclave. Jordan, which hosts the largest number of Palestinians outside the West Bank and Gaza, wants accelerated peace talks.
