 June 25, 2007 The President Liberal Democratic Party Mr. President, Surely, you will remember the time when I persuaded you to think of a political platform which would provide alternative politics to the nation. I described to you my vision of Notundhara, where clean and honest people having knowledge and expertise would be the driving force for a new political party of this nature. The new party will be a peoples party reaching out to honest and hard working people in the country and unite them to reshape the society for greater good based on the values of fairness, solidarity, tolerance and respect. Mr. President, together we formed Bikolpodhara and together we struggled under the most hostile of conditions and circumstances to establish the rights of the people. Alongside us stood dedicated and clean leaders and workers. We all embarked on a mission, to change the way politics was being done and the way political parties conducted themselves. We believed in democracy and the democratic conduct of our party where decisions would be taken collectively. Mr. President, you committed to the people of Bangladesh and propagated politics without the influence of black money, terrorism, and nepotism. We committed to the people that in new politics there is no room for hatred and confrontation. We believed in "taking responsibility" and not "assuming power". We believed in nominating clean and talented candidates. We believed in playing a meaningful role in parliament  be it in the opposition with only a handful of seats. Mr. President, unfortunately, in a mad rush for power you sacrificed all the principles that we stood for and all your commitments went down the drain when you joined with Col Oli and formed the Liberal Democratic Party. This was done without debating & discussing in the party forum, again ignoring our principles of democratic decision making in the party. You and your son alone have put the final nail in the coffin of Bikolpodhara and the principles it stood for. Again in a crazy dash to get on the train to power, you joined hands with questionable leaders and embraced corrupt and terrorist people. And even in the party nomination you compromised our publicly announced principles by nominating questionable people, who were not even primary members of the party. The party leaders have accused us of non-transparency, shady and unethical deals. Mr. President, your sheer desire for absolute power did not stop there. The battle for the party mantle intensified Post 1/11. You, your son together with some sycophants traded accusation with the Executive President and entered into mud slinging, totally disregarding the image of the party and dividing the leaders and the workers. Unfortunately, those who stood for the unity of the party, raised voice about democracy and reforms in the party, and did not side with any one of you were either show caused or unilaterally expelled. Mr. President, today I realize why you and your son, since the very beginning deliberately held up the publication of the party constitution which was dully adopted by the NEC, from seeing the light of the day. Mr. President you violated each and every principle you said you stood for. You dishonored the trust of each and every dedicated party men and women who stood by you. You violated the belief that the people of this country was beginning to put on you and all of us in Bikolpodhara. Mr. President, at this critical juncture in our national politics, we could have fulfilled the aspirations of the people who wanted change in the way the country was being run and politics was practiced, but unfortunately that was not to be. Mr. President, you, your son and the secretary general along with the executive president, have betrayed the party and the nation. Under the circumstances, and with utter disgust, I hereby severe all my relationship with the Liberal Democratic Party. Fero
