<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)More than three lakh Bangladeshis living in 92 'enclaves' inside India will be listed as voters for the first time, election commissioner Shakhawat Hossain said Sunday. After a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar A Chowdhury, the election commissioner told reporters that the enclave residents are citizens of Bangladesh and that the EC will include them in the digital voter list, providing them with nationality IDs. "The EC is seeking the foreign adviser's assistance with this," said Shakhawat. The foreign adviser has been asked by the EC to notify the Indian government in a forthcoming bilateral secretary-level meeting about the decision to enlist the enclave residents, according to the commissioner. "This will also involve meetings with Bangladesh Rifles and the Indian Border Security Force," he said. The foreign adviser was also urged to lend a helping hand to the EC proposal for opening desks in embassies abroad to enlist more than one crore non-resident Bangladeshis as voters. "We would like to list the NRBs for the first time to give them a sense of belonging," the election commissioner said. bdne
