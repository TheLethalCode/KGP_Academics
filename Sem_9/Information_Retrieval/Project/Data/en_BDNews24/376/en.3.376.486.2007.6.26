 PARIS, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new French parliament expected to drive through President Nicolas Sarkozy's overhaul of tax, education and justice met for the first time on Tuesday ahead of a frenetic summer of reform. Sarkozy's centre-right UMP party and its allies enjoy a commanding majority of 345 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after elections this month, meaning the packet of measures should have an easy passage. The main event scheduled for Tuesday was the election of Bernard Accoyer, the former head of the UMP parliamentary group as speaker of the National Assembly.

The government is still finalising the details of a proposed reform of higher education but the broad outlines of the plan, that would give universities more financial and operational autonomy, have been long announced. A separate law, tightening conditions on immigration, will be held over until September because of time constraints. The Socialist opposition will have little chance to alter the package during the debates given the size of the ruling majority. They can disrupt bills and in the past have tabled thousands of amendments to hold up the government. Sarkozy says he wants to develop more constructive relations with the opposition and has pledged to support a Socialist as head of the influential parli
