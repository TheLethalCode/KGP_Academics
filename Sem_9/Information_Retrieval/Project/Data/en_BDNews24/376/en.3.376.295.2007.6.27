 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Wednesday sent former state minister Redwan Ahmed into a four-day remand. Joint forces arrested Redwan Ahmed, LDP presidium member and former state minister for liberation war affairs, in Gulshan Tuesday on his way back home to Uttara. Redwan was taken to court at about 3pm and magistrate Shafique Anwar approved a police prayer for remand. Investigating officer Syed Nazrul Islam, officer-in-charge of Uttara Police Station, appealed to court seeking 10 days' time to grill him. Redwan's lawyers Abdullah Mahmud Hasan and ABM Waliur Rahman Khan opposed the remand for more than two days. In the remand appeal, the investigating officer said Redwan amassed huge wealth through unfair means during the BNP-led government that had tainted the image of the country abroad and harmed the economy. Redwan is also accused of having ties to "conspirators against the present government". Redwan had earlier received bail in two cases out of three against him. bdnew
