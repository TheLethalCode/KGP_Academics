 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Joint forces early Wednesday initiated a raid into the Uttara home of LDP presidium member Redwan Ahmed who they had led away Tuesday evening, the police confirmed. "We are concerned about the drive," Mokarram Hossain, the duty-officer at the Uttara police station said to bdnews24.com. "It is still going on. They (joint forces) have started the raid late 12 midnight," said Moslem Uddin, a security guard at Redwan's residence. He said Redwan's daughter and daughter-in-law were in the house but his son was away during the raid. Redwan's house is at Road 6-A of Sector 4 of Uttara. It was not immediately clear why the former state minister for liberation war affairs was taken away when he was returning home from a presidium meeting in Gulshan. The chief of the media cell of the Liberal Democratic Party, Jahangir Alam, confirmed the news to bdnews24.com Tuesday night. Approached by phone, a woman who identified herself as daughter of Redwan told bdnews24.com: "Yes I got the sad news." But she declined to give her name for some reason she would not explain. bdnews24.com
