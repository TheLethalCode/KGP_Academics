 ROME Tue Jun 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Egyptian cleric who says he was kidnapped by the CIA in Italy and flown to Egypt for torture is considering a political career in his home country thanks to the fame the case has brought him. Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, announced his political intentions in a wide-ranging interview with La Stampa newspaper in Italy, where 26 Americans are being tried in absentia for kidnapping him in 2003.

In the interview, Nasr said al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden "has money but little brains." "With money he created al Qaeda, he grouped together all of the mujahideen but it was a catastrophe for the Muslims," he said, pointing to the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq. He said his heroes included Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto "Che" Guevara, and compared women to jewelry "to be protected" instead of working in politics. Asked about his political platform as a candidate, Nasr said he would focus on international relations. "I know the West. I lived in Italy. The Egyptians know I am an enemy of the United States. The Muslims respect me and dialogue with me," he sa
