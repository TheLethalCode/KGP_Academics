 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was further frustrated, as AL leaders were denied entry to Sudha Sadan Wednesday during her meeting with Indian foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon, an aide said. After Menon's departure from Sudha Sadan, Hasina's personal assistant Hasan Mahmud told reporters: "We wanted all AL presidium members to join the meeting. Our leader felt she was affronted, as they were not allowed to enter. This was humiliating not only for Sheikh Hasina, but for the whole nation." Menon along with Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty arrived at Sudha Sadan at 10:45am, when only AL presidium member Sajeda Chowdhury was allowed in. Sajeda had to say she was Hasina's aunt before she was granted entry. As Menon came out of Sudha Sadan after the 45-minute discussion, police brushed reporters aside when they tried to speak to the Indian foreign secretary. Hasan Mahmud said Hasina and Menon discussed bilateral issues and ways of bolstering the existing friendly relations between the two countries. "They also had a very brief one-to-one meeting," Hasan said. AL leader Motia Chowdhury arrived at Sudha Sadan at 9:45am, shortly followed by office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan. Police let neither of them in. AL acting general secretary Mukul Bose arrived at 10.30am, but was denied entry and left. Motia told reporters, "Our neighbouring country has witnessed how the AL chief is being mentally tortured in her own country. The minimum gesture of courtesy was missing." Commenting on adviser MA Matin's recent statement on allowing political party councils to facilitate reforms while still upholding the ban on politics, Motia said: "How can you have a party council without political discussions? We can't hold a council without the executive decision of the party. The ban on indoor politics should be lifted." Dhanmondi police chief Monowar Hossain declined to comment when reporters asked him why the AL leaders had not been allowed entry to Hasina's home. bdnews24.com/sum/ra/
