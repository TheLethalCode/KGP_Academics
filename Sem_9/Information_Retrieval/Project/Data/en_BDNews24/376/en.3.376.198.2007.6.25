 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  Late strikes from Thomas Wangira Biketi and Iddi Badambuze helped hosts Arambagh KS beat Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra 2-0 in the second-leg encounter of B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday. With the sixth win in 14 matches, Arambagh claimed to the third position in the 11-team point table with 19 points, three points behind second-placed Brothers Union, who collected 22 from 13 outings. Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club, Muktijoddha Sangsad KS, Sheikh Russel KC and Dhaka Abahani Limited are at the top of the table with 26 points each. The latter, however, played a match less than trio's 14. Khulna Abahnai, who lost to Arambagh KS 3-1 in the first leg, stuck to 11 points with nine losses in 14 matches. After the barren first half, Kenyan defender Thomas converted the penalty to give Arambagh a 85-minute lead while Ugandan midfielder Iddi doubled the margin just before the final whistle.
