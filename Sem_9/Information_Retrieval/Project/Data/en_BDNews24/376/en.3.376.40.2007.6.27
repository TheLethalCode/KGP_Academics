<TITLE> Collingwood to turn England pack loose on West Indies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's new one-day captain Paul Collingwood says his men are relishing the chance to prove themselves in Thursday's Twenty/20 game against West Indies. Collingwood, who replaced Michael Vaughan last Friday, leads a re-shuffled team who are anxious to turn the page on England's disappointing World Cup. "We've done a lot of talking as a team -- where we want to go and what we've done well in the past," the Durham batsman told a news conference at the Oval on Wednesday. "We want to move forward now and we're looking forward to being on the park. "The word 'intent' is a massive thing for our team. 'Intent as a team', 'hunting in packs'...these are the big buzz words in the dressing room at the moment. There's been a lot of good talk but we have to put that on to the pitch. "What you want out there is 11 leaders, that when it gets feisty you've got 11 people going for each other." YOUNGER MEMBERS Collingwood is putting his faith in the younger members of the England squad as they look to re-build after a series of setbacks over the years. "We've got young guys coming through who can go out there and perform well for England, learning their trade out in the middle, playing against international sides. "It's not going to happen overnight but hopefully we can become a very good one-day side. "Hopefully, next time we come to a World Cup we'll have that consistency and real belief behind us that we can go out there and beat the best sides in the world." As for Thursday, Collingwood was optimistic about the fitness of South African-born batsman Jonathan Trott following a hand injury on Tuesday. "He's practised this morning...he's had a net, a few throw-downs, done some fielding -- he's done everything he needs to do for selection tomorrow," Collingwood said. It was too early, though, for a verdict on fellow batsman Ian Bell, who suffered a groin injury on Monday and was due to do gym work later on Wednesday. England have another Twenty/20 game on Friday against West Indies and the first of three one-dayers against them on Sunday
