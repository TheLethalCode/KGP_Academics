 HAVANA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cuba has adopted a series of measures to improve the tourism industry's competitive position in the Caribbean and reverse a two-year slide in visitors, state-media reported on Wednesday. "Today the ministry is working on new investments and repairing hotels of historic interest in the cities," Minister Manuel Marrero told parliament deputies on Tuesday, the Communist Party newspaper Granma reported. "Another main objective ... is to add new services and make our offer more competitive in general," he said.

The number of tourists dropped 7 percent in January and 13 percent in February compared with the same period in 2006, the Tourism Ministry reported, before ending publication of monthly figures for the first time in years. Minister Marrero blamed the "complicated international scene" for his sector's woes, Granma said, in particular "high oil prices, wars, terrorism and climate change." Cuban and foreign hotel managers said US travel restrictions and the embargo had also hurt, but they insisted the government could do far more to compensate. "It still takes months to purchase a compressor for an air conditioner and there has been little money spent in recent years to maintain and improve service," one foreign hotel manager sa
