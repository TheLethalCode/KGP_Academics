 KARACHI Mon Jun 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Workers in the Pakistani city of Karachi struggled on Monday to clear roads of fallen trees and wreckage and to restore electricity after a weekend wind and rain storm killed more than 200 people. In India, authorities prepared to evacuate tens of thousands threatened by flooding as the death toll in havoc wrecked by the arrival of the rainy season topped 150. More rain was forecast for much of the region on Monday. "It was a catastrophe. The wind was so strong. Such a thing has never happened in Karachi," said the mayor of Pakistan's biggest city, Syed Mustafa Kamal. "The rain didn't do much of the damage, it was the wind. Roofs and walls of many houses collapsed, especially in the slums," he said. Falling sign boards also killed people while some were electrocuted when power cables fell into flooded streets. Provincial Health Minister Sardar Ahmed said 228 people had been killed. The city's main ambulance and mortuary service, the Edhi Trust private welfare organisation, said its toll was about 200 dead. But Kamal had a lower toll. He said authorities in each district across the city were accounting for each fatality and had so far come up with a total of 66. Power supplies in Karachi are patchy at the best of time and long-suffering residents hurled stones at cars and power company vehicles on Sunday and burned tyres in protest at the blackouts across most of the country's commercial hub. Many areas of Karachi were still without electricity on Monday and the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation said teams were out doing their best to restore power. Electricity cables had been brought down in more than 700 places, Kamal said. Police said they were escorting workers trying to fix them. "The situation is normal today but there were incidents of violence in some areas last night," said city police chief Azhar Farooqui. "We've provided protection to the KESC people. Our men are accompanying their vehicles to the affected areas." In India, thunderstorms and overflowing rivers have left thousands of villages without basic services since Friday and hundreds of miles of roads and rail tracks were under water in the worst-hit Andhra Pradesh. At least 38 people have died in the state and seven road labourers were missing, officials said. But there was some respite for the badly hit district town of Kurnool, sandwiched between two rivers, as waters began receding on Sunday. "I have never seen flooding in both rivers for over half-a-century," said Chandrasekhar Kalkura, who owns a hotel in the town of about 200,000 people. Indian weather officials forecast more heavy rain on the east and west coast, with a storm in the Bay of Bengal forecast to hit Andhra Pradesh by Wednesday morning. In Karnataka, at least 29 people were killed over the weekend after being swept away in floods, struck by lightning or buried under collapsed houses. Further north, two people were killed on Sunday in a landslide in a slum in Mumbai. TV stations have reported more than 50 deaths in Maharashtra. Media reports said 38 people had been killed in the Kerala, visited by thousands of foreign tourists each year. Hundreds of people are killed each year, and hundreds of thousands are forced from their homes, in the South Asian rainy season. Though deadly, the rains are vital for agricultu
