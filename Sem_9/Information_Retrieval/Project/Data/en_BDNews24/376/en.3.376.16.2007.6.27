<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Wednesday granted bail to Asian City Development managing director Nazrul Islam and two colleagues in an arms case. The bail order by magistrate Md Helal Uddin of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court sparked sharp reactions among lawyers. A group of lawyers rushed to the magistrate seeking explanations about his bail order. Helal Uddin asked advocate Prokash Biswas to be quiet about it. "Let the matter be confidential. It's not necessary to publish any report before action is taken against the guilty. You can write later." Prokash Biswas is also bdnews24.com's legal affairs correspondent. The two others who were granted bail are manager (administration) AKM Hannan and SM Abdur Rahman of Asian City Development. The three were arrested 11 days ago. In the bail order, Helal Uddin said: "Only the persons found possessing arms should be the accused. But this case was filed by the owner of the house where police had seized the arms." "It's not related to the Arms Act. It's but a process to take revenge. Involvement of the three with the arms was not found. It seems the case should be supervised by higher authorities and they deserve bail." On June 15, police seized a revolver from the house of Majibar Rahman in Dakkhinkhan. Majibar filed an arms case against the three Asian City Development officials. Sub-inspector of Dakkhinkhan Police Station Ali Hossain was assigned to investigate the case. Advocate MN Zaman defended the accused in court. Asked by lawyers to show documents of the case, Zaman said he would not. bdnew
