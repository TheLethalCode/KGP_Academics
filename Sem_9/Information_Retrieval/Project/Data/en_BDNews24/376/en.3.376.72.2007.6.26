 BRUSSELS, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany raised with Ankara on Tuesday the case of a German youth held in a Turkish jail on charges of sexually abusing a 13-year-old British girl, but was told by Turkey's government it could not interfere with courts. The case of the 17-year-old highlights sensitivities over Turkish efforts to establish an independent judiciary in pursuit of European Union membership. Critics in the EU and rights groups say Turkey must speed up such reforms. German media said the boy had been detained for several weeks in a cell with 30 other suspected criminals after the mother of the girl reported him to the police. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier raised the case at talks on Monday on Turkey's EU accession bid but was reminded by Turkish officials that EU standards on the independence of the judiciary forbid government intervention. "As government ... we do not want to interfere with the proceedings, and of course this is an important criteria also for Europe," Turkish Economy Minister and chief negotiator Ali Babacan told a news conference after the talks. The EU has made human rights and judicial reform a key part of Turkey's accession process. In an interview with Turkish daily Hurriyet, the German boy said he did not have sexual intercourse with the British girl, though they kissed and engaged in 'heavy petting'. Steinmeier said he had asked Babacan and the Turkish Foreign Minister to do their utmost to free the boy and had raised the issue of his detention conditions. "The point of our discussion is all Turkish authorities have to be aware of this case and try to find a solution so that this young man can return to his parents in Germany as soon as possible," Steinmeier told the same news conference. He said Germany fully respected the autonomy of the Turkish judicial system. Babacan said the boy was allowed visits by his family and said a hearing was scheduled for July 6. "We will do our utmost to handle the trial fairly," he said. Some in Europe see Turkey's accession as a strategic necessity while others argue the large, relatively poor and mostly Muslim nation has no place in the 27-nation bloc. France prevented the EU starting negotiations with Ankara on economic and monetary policy this week to underline new President Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition to the goal of eventual membership for the EU's largest candidate count
