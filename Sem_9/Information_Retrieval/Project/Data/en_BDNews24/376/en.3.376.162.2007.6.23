<TITLE> Sri Lanka ready for life without Moody </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka take on Bangladesh on Monday at the start of their first test series since the departure of Australian coach Tom Moody. Sri Lanka improved steadily under the guidance of Moody, who left to coach Western Australia in May, but captain Mahela Jayawardene insists his team will not be looking back. "Tom [Moody] was great for us over the past two years but he made a decision to leave and we have to move on now and start building for the future," Jayawardene told reporters. "We have been putting in lots of hard work to prepare for this Bangladesh series and we know the brand of cricket that we have to play if we are going to be successful. "Bangladesh are a vastly improved team and we cannot afford to take them lightly. We expect them to put up a real fight and we must produce some really tough and disciplined cricket." Sri Lanka are without batsman Sanath Jayasuriya, who is being rested, and former captain Marvan Atapattu, who pulled out of the three-test series for personal reasons. The team's preparations were hampered further when Upul Tharanga suffered a hairline fracture in his left heel after he was hit by a yorker from team mate Lasith Malinga. "We would love our top players to be playing all the time but these are things that you cannot control and there is now an opportunity for a couple of youngsters to stake their claims," Jayawardene said. Malinda Warnapura will make his debut and open the innings with left-hander Michael Vandort, back for the first time since last year's tour of England. Sri Lanka's bowling, however, will be a full strength, with spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and experienced paceman Chaminda Vaas joining the squad last week after stints in English county cricket. Vaas will be partnered by Malinga and either Dilhara Fernando or all-rounder Farveez Maharoof. Bangladesh also start the series with a new coach after the departure of Australian Dav Whatmore at the end of a four-year term. Australian Shaun Williams, Bangladesh's director of cricket for the past few years, has taken over as coach on a temporary basis. Mohammad Ashraful, 22, begins his tenure as captain following Habibul Bashar's resignation after the World Cup. Bangladesh's preparations for the series were hampered by wet weather in Colombo. Only 140 overs were possible in their three-day game against Sri Lanka A. Bashar was top scorer with 63 as the match petered out in a draw. More rain is expected during the first test at the Sinhalese Sports Club. Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene, Michael Vandort, Kumar Sangakkara, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Farveez Maharoof, Muttiah Muralitharan, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Malinga Bandara, Malinda Warnapura, Sujeewa de Silva. Bangladesh squad: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafe Mortaza, Habibul Bashar, Javed Omer, Mehrab Hossain jnr, Shahriar Nafees, Rajin Saleh, Shakib Al Hasan, Khaled Mashud, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mohammed Rafique, Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Sharif, Mushfiqur Rahim
