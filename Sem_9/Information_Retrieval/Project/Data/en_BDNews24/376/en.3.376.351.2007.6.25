 MOSCOW, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian bank completed on Monday a transfer of $25 million to North Korea, the bank said in a statement, funds which are part of a nuclear deal and which had been frozen in a Macau bank account. "...on June 25 the funds were transferred to the Bank of Foreign Trade of Korean Democratic Republic. Therefore the problem of the funds transfer has been solved," Dalkombank, a bank based in Russia's Far East, said on its Webs site. Authorities in Macau had frozen the funds after a US Treasury investigation into money laundering. North Korea demanded the money be released before it would implement a nuclear disarmament deal. The chief inspector of the United Nation's nuclear watchdog Olli Heinonen arrived in China on Monday on his way to North Korea, where he hopes to arrange the return of an IAEA team to monitor Pyongyang's promised reactor shutdown.
