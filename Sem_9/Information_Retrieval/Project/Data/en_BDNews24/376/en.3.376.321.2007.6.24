 LISBON, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Saturday he was optimistic about his impending nuclear talks with Iran, but expected no major developments. "I am optimistic, although I do not think great results will take place," Solana told Reuters before starting another round of exploratory talks with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, in Lisbon. The United States, Britain, Russia, France, Germany and China are discussing a third set of UN sanctions against Iran over concerns it is covertly trying to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies the charge, saying it needs nuclear technology to satisfy booming demand for electricity. Increasing the pressure on Tehran, a British draft of a new UN sanctions resolution proposed that Iran's airlines and ships could be denied landing and transit rights and two or more of its banks could have their assets frozen. Larijani said such measures would be fruitless. "Such resolutions will have no results," he told reporters. The UN Security Council has imposed two rounds of sanctions on Iran after Tehran's failure to heed a UN demand to halt uranium enrichment. Since February, Iran has rapidly expanded a centrifuge operation at its underground Natanz enrichment facility in a bid for "industrial-scale" fuel production. After a two-hour meeting in Vienna, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Mohamed ElBaradei said on Friday he and Larijani had agreed to draw up a "plan of action" within two months on how to remove outstanding concerns about Iran's disputed nuclear work. Tehran says its nuclear case must first return to the Vienna-based IAEA, which would end UN sanctions pressure -- a nonstarter for Western powers. The last Larijani-Solana meeting in Madrid in May could not resolve the enrichment dispute and the latest exploratory talks were not expected to make much headway.
