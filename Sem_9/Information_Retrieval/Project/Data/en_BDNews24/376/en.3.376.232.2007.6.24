 MADRID, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France striker Thierry Henry will fly into Barcelona on Sunday evening prior to signing a four-year deal with the Primera Liga club. Barcelona said the 29-year-old would arrive at the city airport in a private jet and have a medical on Monday morning. If he passes the medical he will put pen to paper on his contract with the Catalan club and be presented to fans and the media at the Nou Camp at 1500 GMT. Sources at the club have said Barcelona will pay 24 million euros ($32.29 million) for the striker who has been at Arsenal since 1999. If the deal goes through Henry will compete with Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Ronaldinho for a place in one of the most feared forward lines in world football. Barca are also reported to be close to signing Romanian centre-back Cristian Chivu from Roma and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure from Monaco as they bid to strengthen their side after losing out to arch-rivals Real Madrid in the title race
