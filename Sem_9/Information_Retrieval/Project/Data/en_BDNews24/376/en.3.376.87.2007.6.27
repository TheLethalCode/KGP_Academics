<TEXT>
 MILAN, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nobel Prize-winning author VS Naipaul said writing has got harder as he has grown older but inspiration still comes easily. Although he has one book, `A Writer's People', coming out in September and another one planned, the 74-year-old author told Reuters on Tuesday he sometimes writes only half an hour a day. "It's harder now, because the energy is limited. One sleeps a lot more, one gets tired, so days become shorter," Naipaul said after a roundtable discussion at the Milanesiana cultural festival in the northern Italian city. "Whereas before, I would get up, try to start working at 9 and I'd work certainly all morning and I'd divide the day into three or four pieces, and I'd work a lot. It does become harder physically."

Naipaul, who sometimes needed assistance in walking at the event, told Reuters he had no favourites among current writers. "I stopped reading contemporary writing with the last generation of writers, you know, the Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene kind of generation," he said. Naipaul laughed when asked about former British health secretary Frank Dobson's suggestion that Prime Minister Tony Blair be given his 'A House For Mr Biswas' as a going-away present since it dealt in part with disappointed expectations. "He wouldn't get on with it, he wouldn't get on with it, no. It requires attention, and it's a long book and he'd really be happy with something shorter," Naipaul said. Blair leaves office on Wednesday. The 1961 novel about an Indo-Trinidadian man's struggle to have his own house was Naipaul's breakthrough bo
