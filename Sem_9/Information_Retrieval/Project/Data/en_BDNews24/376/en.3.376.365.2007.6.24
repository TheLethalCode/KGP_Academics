<TITLE> Govt agrees metal cage for Dhaka-Kolkata trains to stop smuggling </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government Sunday agreed to install a 15-foot tall metal security cage to thwart smuggling in response to an Indian proposal for Dhaka-Kolkata direct trains. Allegations have it that smugglers carry cargo on the rooftop of trains. The new measure will stop the smugglers transporting goods in and out of Bangladesh and India. The decision to recommend the security measure came from a meeting of the advisory committee on law and order, sources familiar with meeting deliberations said. "India has proposed to install a metal cage 150 feet inside their land. This will hinder smuggling efforts as the metal cage would not allow goods smuggled on the roofs," home secretary Abdul Karim said. "We are considering a similar measure. We are also weighing India's suggestion," Karim added. Dhaka-Kolkata direct trains are scheduled to roll on by mid-July. But the communications ministry sources say the launch may be pushed back as some formalities will need more time to complete. bdnews24.com
