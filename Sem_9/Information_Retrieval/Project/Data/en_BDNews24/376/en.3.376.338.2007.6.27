<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It's been 12 years since the last 'Die Hard' movie but now Bruce Willis is back in 'Live Free or Die Hard' with the 52-year-old actor saying he has no plans to retire from action movies yet. The fourth movie in the successful franchise finds Willis' alter ego John McClane once again battling the bad guys - this time, cyber-terrorists who kidnap his daughter. Willis spoke to Reuters about making the new 'Die Hard,' coping with three teenage daughters, and why he's not about to retire from making action films anytime soon. Q: How hard is doing an action film full of stunts at 52? A: "Not that hard at all. If you keep yourself in shape you can keep up. 50 is the new 30, I guess - if you look after yourself. I know that when I was a kid, 50 seemed like a long ways away, in a galaxy far away. It seemed so ancient, but now I'm in my 50s it's not so bad." Q: How do you keep in shape? A: "I work out, but not every day. I generally only work out on a regular basis when I'm working on a film. Otherwise I just get lazy. You get to an age where you just don't feel like doing all that so much anymore." Q: Do you ever feel that you are getting too old to do all the action and fight scenes? A: "Not yet, not yet. I'd probably do 'Die Hard 5,' but it's more about the script than anything else. You have to have a great story and idea first, so I always think about that before I worry about doing anything too physical." Q: Do you see a day when you'll quit action films? A: "I'll tell you what, I just don't know. I don't really project that far into the future and I just try and focus on what I'm doing at the time. And I'm sure all those things will come to pass, but I honestly don't think about it much -- not yet, anyway. I still get a big kick out it." Q: Talking of kicks, is it true that you nearly lost an eye in one of the fight scenes with a stuntwoman? A: "No, it's not really true. I did get kicked in the head and I had to have some stitches in my eyebrow. I guess it sounds more exciting to say that I nearly lost an eye, but it was basically just a little accident on set." Q: Is having three teenage daughters taking a toll on you? A: "No, it's great and they're great kids. My daughters are my three favorite people on earth and I spend a lot of time with them, as much as I can. We're very close." Q: Do you get upset now when you read some outrageous rumor or story about yourself, like you're dating Renee Zellweger? A: "You know what? I really don't pay that much attention to it. The only time I even look at press or see any of that stuff is when I'm talking about a new film. I don't watch TV, I don't read all the tabloids. And I don't miss i
