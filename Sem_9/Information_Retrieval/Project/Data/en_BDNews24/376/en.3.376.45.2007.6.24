<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin Sunday filed an appeal with the Supreme Court for approval to move against the High Court death sentence. Mohiuddin also appealed to the apex court to "condone an inordinate delay in filing the jail appeal". Mohiuddin said he could not file an appeal in time as he was abroad for long. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed said he had received the handwritten appeal at 4.25pm from Dhaka Central Jail authorities. Mohiuddin was deported to Dhaka from Los Angeles on June 18. Immigration police arrested him at Zia International Airport and took him to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. He was then sent to jail. In his appeal, Mohiuddin said he was not involved in the killing of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. After receiving the appeal, the SC registrar told reporters that the application would be sent to the related section Monday and the execution of the death sentence would automatically be stayed. He further said a letter would be sent to the home ministry and the jail authorities to stay the execution of the death sentence until disposal of the appeal. bdnew
