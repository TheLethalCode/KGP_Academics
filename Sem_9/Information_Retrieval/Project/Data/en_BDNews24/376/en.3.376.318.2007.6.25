<TITLE> Brazil's Dunga praises Copa squad's commitment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PUERTO LA CRUZ, Venezuela, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga praised the dedication of the players in his Copa America squad on Sunday in what appeared to be an indirect criticism of the absent Ronaldinho and Kaka. Dunga said his players had joined the squad straight after the European season, spent two weeks training in Brazil and then flew straight to Venezuela for the Copa, all without complaining. "This is a highly professional group, the players are totally focused on what they want to achieve," Dunga told reporters. "They could be on holiday with their families at the moment. "At no time have they complained about the workload, about staying for two weeks at the training camp and then flying straight to Venezuela, or about giving interviews." His remarks also appeared to be aimed at Ronaldinho and Kaka, who both asked to be left out of the squad, because they said they were tired and needed a break. Although Dunga said he accepted their request, it went against his emphasis on team spirit and the philosophy that all players must consider it an honour to wear the Brazil shirt. The Copa America will be Dunga's first tournament in charge of the team. Their first match is against Mexico in Puerto Ordaz on Wednesday
