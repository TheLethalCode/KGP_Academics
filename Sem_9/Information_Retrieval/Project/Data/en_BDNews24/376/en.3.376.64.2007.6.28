 LONDON, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Spice Girls are expected to announce a reunion tour on Thursday, ending months of speculation about the five-member band that brought 'girl power' to the British music scene.

Other bandmates have been less fortunate after pursuing singing careers that never matched the success of the group. Melanie 'Scary' Brown largely disappeared from the public eye until a high-profile paternity case involving Hollywood star Eddie Murphy. Earlier this month a DNA test confirmed Murphy as the father of Brown's newborn baby girl after he declined to publicly acknowledge paternity. Reaction to news of the reunion has been mixed. While media interest in reviving the band that once epitomized female empowerment is high, it has also been met with considerable cynicism. "So why have a reunion?" asked the Daily Mirror tabloid.
