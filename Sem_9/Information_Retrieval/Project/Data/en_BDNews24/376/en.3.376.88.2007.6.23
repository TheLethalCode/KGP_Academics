 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Saturday asked government officials to expedite procurement activities to complete development projects on time. "Delay in procurement lingers project implementation," Azizul told reporters while inaugurating a workshop on public procurement for secretaries of different ministries at the National Economic Council. He said that the delay in implementing development projects reduced government credibility to different sections of people, including Bangladesh's development partners. The Central Procurement Technical Unit of the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Planning Commission, organised the workshop to bring dynamism to project implementation. Cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder spoke as special guest. The finance adviser said that delay created an adverse impact on the people who were likely to benefit from the projects. He identified the traditional procurement procedure as the main obstacle to implementation of projects on time. "I've asked the secretaries to do advanced planning, including setting a timeline for procurement, in their future development projects," Azizul said. The adviser said that close monitoring was needed for taking appropriate actions to ensure implementation. He asked senior officials to lead from the front. Ali Imam Majumder praised the Public Procurement Act 2006, saying that although it was not foolproof, it was better than the previous Public Procurement Regulation 2003. Bangladesh's development partners have frequently said that delay in decision-making on procurement hampers implementation. bd
