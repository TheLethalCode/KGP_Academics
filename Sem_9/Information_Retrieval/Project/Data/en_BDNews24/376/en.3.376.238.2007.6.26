He said he felt unloved by the club after they made an initial contract offer and media linked him with a move to Olympique Lyon or Valencia. However, a successful capital increase on the stock market has given Juve fresh funds and bosses said last week they hoped it would enable them to keep the 29-year-old striker, who has spent seven seasons in Turin. "I am proud to link my name with Juventus for another four seasons," Trezeguet said in a statement. "Today I have made a decisive choice for my career and my life. This is a club which has given me so much and with whom I want to continue to win." He stuck by the club following the stripping of their 2006 championship and demotion to Serie B for match-fixing and helped them bounce back to the top flight at the first attempt.
