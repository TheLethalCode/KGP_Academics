<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)They want a better future, a transition from the shadows of life as sex workers into the daylight of a broader society to live just as other humans. They are hermaphrodites. "We demand a healthy life to live like others, not as a sex worker," said Miss Pinky, president of an organisation that campaigns for the rights of hermaphrodites. "Before thinking about HIV/Aids prevention, I would rather want the assurance of food, home, education, medical treatmentthe basic needs of life," Pinky said. Pinky was one of those who joined a discussion "HIV/Aids and hermaphrodites: The role of media and others" arranged by Bondhu Welfare Society at the National Press club Monday. Representatives from different hermaphrodite organisations took part in the discussion. They have demanded life as it is meant to be with all its basic elements. Officials from the Family Health International and United Nations Population Fund were also present there. "We should be provided with jobs." "I think we are the most harmless of all. Our parents, siblingseverybody neglects us. We are unwanted in any social gathering." She does not want criticism from others. Jaya Shikdar, general secretary of the same organisation, said hermaphrodites have no social status. "A favourable and respectable environment should be created for us." Executive director of Shushtho Jibon Miss Layla Hijra said: "Some people talk about separate shelter homes for us. Why would we be isolated? We want to join the workforce. We do have the ability. Give us jobs." Robert Kelly, country director of FHI, said: "The hermaphrodites are very much vulnerable to HIV/Aids. They have shifted away from the major Bangladesh issues." UNFPA officer Dr Khandakar Ejajul Haque told the hermaphrodites: "Be aware of your rights first. Then nobody can humiliate you." bdnews24.c
