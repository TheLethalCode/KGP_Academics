 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh and India Monday stressed reducing a trade deficit between the countries at a meeting at the state guesthouse Padma. Bangladesh runs more than $2 billion in trade deficit with India. On the first day of the two-day talks, foreign secretaries of the two countries had talks on increasing duty-free access for Bangladeshi goods to India, removing non-tariff barriers, curtailing the list of sensitive products, water management and launching rail services on Joydevpur-Shialdah route. Indian foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon arrived in Dhaka Sunday. The secretaries are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on trade affairs Tuesday. The issues of tackling terrorism and strategies to control narcotics smuggling and trafficking in women and children also came up for discussion. After the first day's talks, Menon told reporters that he had discussed many issues with Bangladesh's acting foreign secretary Touhid Hossain, but declined to give details. They will brief reporters at a joint press conference after the talks, Menon said. Touhid Hossain said they had friendly talks. Menon met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his office Monday. A foreign ministry official preferring anonymity said India put 744 Bangladeshi goods on its sensitive products' list while Bangladesh listed 1,200 Indian products as sensitive. Representatives from both the countries discussed on how to curtail the list. Another official said an Indian team would come to Bangladesh before the rail services on Joydevpur-Shialdah route was launched. Representatives from both the countries will fix the date for launching the train service. On water management of common rivers, there will be an expert-level talk before the ministers sit on the issue. The secretaries have agreed to strengthen the working groups to control cross-border terrorism. bdnews24.c
