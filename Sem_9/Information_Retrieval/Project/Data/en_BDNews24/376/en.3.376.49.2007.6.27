 GAZA, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli forces killed at least 11 Palestinians, most of them gunmen, on Wednesday in their biggest raid in the Gaza Strip since Hamas Islamists took over the territory two weeks ago, medical workers and residents said. The operation in Gaza City and the southern town of Khan Younis appeared to signal that Israel intended to keep strong military pressure on Hamas along with its efforts to isolate the militant group financially and politically. Local residents in the two battle zones said militants fired rocket-propelled grenades and detonated explosive devices in confrontations with Israeli infantry and armour. Israeli forces killed three gunmen near Khan Younis and four militants, three civilians -- including a 12-year-old boy -- and an unidentified man in fighting in Gaza City, medical workers and residents said, numbering the wounded at more than 45. At least three of the dead gunmen belonged to Hamas, which seized Gaza this month after routing forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the secular Fatah faction. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said the Israeli incursion was part of a "conspiracy in which Abbas is a participant and which is aimed at pressuring Hamas and the people of Gaza". Fatah spokesman Jamal Nazzal condemned the raid, accusing Israel of using Hamas's takeover of the Gaza Strip to try to justify "aggression against Palestinian civilians". A military spokeswoman in Tel Aviv said the army was "operating against terror threats" and that two soldiers were wounded by an anti-tank missile fired at an armoured vehicle. She said troops shot two armed men in fighting in the Khan Younis area and a tank fired a shell at a gunman in Gaza City's Shejaia neighbourhood. The burnt body of an Islamic Jihad militant lay in the street after the shell exploded. ENVOY Despite Hamas rule in the coastal territory, the so-called Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- hopes to revive a peace process through Abbas in the occupied West Bank. Washington expects Western powers to agree to name Tony Blair as their Middle East envoy soon after he steps down as British prime minister later in the day, diplomats said. Ghazi Hamad, an aide to Ismail Haniyeh, prime minister in the Hamas-led government dismissed by Abbas, said the movement did not expect Blair to be even-handed. "Our experience with Tony Blair as Britain's prime minister has not been encouraging. He has always adopted the American and Israeli positions," Hamad said. Hamas, which came to power in a 2006 election, has rejected Western demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and accept existing interim Israeli-Palestinian peace deals. Israel pulled its forces and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 but has not stopped air strikes and other attacks against militant groups, which frequently launch rockets into southern Isra
