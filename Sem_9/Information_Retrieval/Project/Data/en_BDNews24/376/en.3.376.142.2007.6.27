 NEW YORK, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Graphic novel hero Van Von Hunter doesn't slam or kaboom his enemies but eradicates and relinquishes them in a new series of graphic novels designed to boost teenagers' vocabulary. The educational services provider Kaplan next week releases three popular graphic novels featuring manga -- the Japanese word for comics and print cartoons -- with hundreds of words tested in US college admission exams. Words like implausible, querulous and enigmatic are featured in the cartoons with the spellings and definitions also appearing in boxes around the comic strips. Kaplan spokeswoman Kristen Campbell said in these novels Hunter shows 'exemplary fortitude before nefarious' enemies like vampires and zombies while students can also read about the 'hazardous adventures' of Kalec, a blue dragon. "School librarians kept telling us how popular these graphic novels were becoming and that they were being used more and more by students," Campbell told Reuters. "These are modern comic books and it is genre that is fun to read, interesting and graphically appealing. Why not incorporate something fun and adventurous into learning to reinforce vocabulary?" Kaplan joined forces with Japanese manga publisher Tokyopop to work on the novels, replacing traditional comic words with vocabulary needed for college entrance exams. "The stories stay the same and still maintain the essence of the genre but with some of the most commonly tested words added instead," said Campbell. Figures show that manga novels have become one of the fastest growing segments in the publishing industry with manga sales jumping 22 percent in the United States last year to 9.5 million copies from 7.8 million in 2005. As well as using manga novels to reach US students, Kaplan is also turning to iPods with students able to buy and download three interactive exam preparation programs on reading, mathematics and writing, from iTunes. "Students rarely leave home now without an iPod and we saw this as a convenient, portable, accessible way to study and prepare for exams," said Campbe
