 HARARE, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe's government has ordered prices of basic goods and services to be slashed to protect Zimbabweans battling with the world's highest inflation rate, official media reported on Tuesday. The measure is intended to return prices to the levels of June 18 -- since when the price of many basic goods has risen by up to 300 percent. But it will be only a limited help for consumers when prices of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour and milk are marked up every day. Official data put annual inflation at 3,700 percent in April, and the figure now is certain to be far higher. "Government is aware that these escalating price increases are a political ploy engineered by our detractors to effect an illegal regime change against the ruling party and the government following the failure of illegal economic sanctions," International Trade Minister Obert Mpofu was quoted as saying by the official Herald newspaper. Zimbabwe, once one of Africa's most prosperous countries, is suffering not only soaring inflation and poverty, but also high unemployment and chronic shortages of fuel, food and foreign exchange. Many of its 13 million people are unable to feed themselves or their families. SHOPS DEFY ORDER On Tuesday, shops in central Harare seemed to be defying the new directive. Instead of cutting prices, some supermarkets simply emptied their shelves of goods such as sugar, salt, flour cooking oil, beef and fuel that would be subject to the order. "We have been instructed by management to remove some of the products from the shelves for now," an assistant at a leading chain store said as shoppers scrambled to buy bathing soap. At another store there were long queues as people stocked up, saying they feared basic goods would now be in even shorter supply. But for several companies it was business as usual. bdnews24.com/lq/2121hrs "We have not reduced our prices because that has not been communicated to us by the owners ... In actual fact, some of the prices will go up tomorrow," said Sam Makaza, a manager at a supermarket in downtown Harare. Producers, who are operating at a third of normal output, argue that the price increases are justified because they must pass on the cost of purchasing the foreign currency needed to import raw materials. The value of the Zimbabwean dollar has tumbled on the thriving black market, where it was trading recently between 170,000 and 200,000 to the U.S. dollar. The official rate is 15,000. Under the new directive, businesses must revert to the prices quoted on June 18 while a commission investigates whether the recent jump was justified, the Herald said, quoting Mpofu. "Government has directed manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers to reduce prices of basic commodities ... by up to 50 percent with immediate effect as it takes measures against the wave of unjustified price increases over the past few weeks," it said. Mugabe's government routinely blames the economic crisis on sabotage by Britain and other Western governments, which it says are punishing Zimbabwe for seizing thousands of white farms and redistributing the land to poor blacks. Critics argue that it is Mugabe's mismanagement that ha
