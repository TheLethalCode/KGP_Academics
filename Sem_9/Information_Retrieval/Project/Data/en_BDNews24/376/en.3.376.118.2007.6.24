 Chittagong, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  A committee to probe hill cutting in the port city Sunday recommended a freeze on new residential projects within five kilometers of hilly areas to thwart a repeat of the June 11 disaster. It also proposed a bar on throwing up brick kiln within 10 km of hill areas, Chittagong divisional commissioner Mokhlesur Rahman said. The committee called for immediate filing of cases against influential people involved with cutting hills and speeding up the proceedings of the cases already filed. Two enquiry committees were formed after 127 people were killed in hill slide and wall collapse in Chittagong on June 11. One committee was tasked to find out the cause of the slide and determine losses, while the worked what prompted the hills to cave in. Additional divisional commissioner (revenue) MAN Siddiq, convenor of both the committees, submitted two reports to the divisional commissioner in the morning. The reports have been forwarded to the chief adviser, Cabinet Division and the adviser for communications and disaster management on Sunday, Rahman, the divisional commissioner, said. "Hill cutting in Chittagong must be stopped at any cost. The government did not permit anybody to cut hill in last 10 years but scores of hills were cut in Chittagong," he quoted the reports as saying, He said the reports stressed preventing influential individuals, organisations and firms to stop cutting hills. The committees also recommended management of hills in line with their geological formation to avert large-scale disaster in the future. An official with access to the reports said the committees recommended mandatory five percent allocation for hill management in the annual development programmes of Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) and Chittagong City Corporation. They also suggested strengthening aforestation programme on government and private lands, guide walls, drainage and boundary wall on the foot of the affected hills, and a ban on extraction of sand from hill areas. The committees also stressed legal action for hill cutting, ban on habitation in the risky hills and forestation there. Removal and rehabilitation of people still living dangerously near hills, and curbing power of any one ministry to give permission to cut hills and setting up establishments there are among the other recommendations. The committees have marked 28 causes for the incident of hill slide and deaths. They however said the main cause of the hill slide and deaths was the record heavy rainfall in recent memory. A lack of implementation of forestation programme in Sitakunda, Mirer Sarai and Hathazari upazilas adjacent to the Chittagong city was also blamed for the disaster. The probes pointed finger at the absence of action against influential people and organizations, and indiscriminate hill cutting and housing projects with covert support of the political leaders. They tied the debacle to the lack of initiatives by the CDA, city corporation, Directorate of Environment and Department of Forests for proper hill management and checking cutting hills. The committees held illegal construction of houses responsible for the death of 12 people in the collapse of a boundary wall at Railway Colony near Pahartali Bazar. They have made a list of 38 people who have built houses illegally, grabbed structures on the railway land and recommended action against them. bdnews
