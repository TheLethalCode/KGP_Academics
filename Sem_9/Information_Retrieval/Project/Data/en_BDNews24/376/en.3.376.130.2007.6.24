<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  A teenager, who was allegedly tortured in joint forces' custody, died in hospital in Dhaka, minutes past Friday midnight. Fifteen-year-old Jamal, son of Abdul Malek of Noakhali, died after the police took him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The joint forces turned him over to Kafrul Police Station after arrest over an attempted burglarya charge his family brushed aside. In a brief interview with bdnews24.com Saturday night, Jamal's uncle Ali Asgar alleged that he had come to know from other detainees that the joint forces stuffed Jamal into a sack and beat him. There were no marks of injury on Jamal's body, a magistrate said in an inquest report further clouding the exact cause of his death. Police, quoting a case filed by a military police sergeant, said the joint forces arrested Jamal along with another man in the act of attempting a burglary into the house of captain Khorshed in Rajanigandha Officers' Quarters inside the cantonment. But their families denied the allegations of attempted burglary and claimed they were arrested at Mirpur-14 bus-stand near the cantonment. The second arrestee is 18-year-old Kajal, now being treated at DMCH under police watch. His condition was stated to be critical, as he remained unconscious in hospital. Kafrul police sub-inspector Alamgir Kabir said the two were taken to the DMCH after their conditions deteriorated. Rezaul Karim of the same police station said military police sergeant Sirajul Islam filed a case against the duo, accusing them of attempting a burglary. According to case details, the joint forces also detained eight more people on confessions from the two, police said. All of them were handed over to Kafrul police Friday evening. Investigating officer Alamgir Kabir, a sub-inspector of Kafrul Police Station, would not give details. Jamal's uncle Ali Asgar, a roadside teashop owner in Mirpur-14, said the joint forces had taken Jamal away from his shop. He trashed the claim that the joint forces arrested Jamal in the works of a burglary. "As he was bundled into a sack for beating, there were no marks of injury on his body," Asgar said. He said the army men kicked Jamal with their boots and stepped on his chest, causing "lung injury". Dr MA Quashem, a duty officer at the Incentive Care Unit of DMCH, said Jamal was suffering from respiratory problems when he was taken to hospital. "There was high water content in his lung. This usually happens when there are internal injuries," Quashem told bdnews24.com, shortly before Jamal's death. Meanwhile, Kajal's father Yakub Ali and mother Nasima Begum told bdnews24.com Saturday night that the joint forces had taken their son away from Mirpur-14 bus-stand when he was asleep in his taxi. "He stayed away from home for the night," Yakub said. For comment, bdnews24.com approached Kafrul Police Station, but the investigating officer, Alamgir Kabir, refused to give details and asked the reporter to contact "higher authorities". But he said: "I don't know anything about what happened to the two before they were taken to us. I have just taken them to hospital." Magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah conducted Jamal's inquest report Saturday evening but the report said there were no marks of injury on his body. Kafrul police sub-inspector Morshed Alam told bdnews24.com that an unnatural death case had been filed. bdnews24.com/
