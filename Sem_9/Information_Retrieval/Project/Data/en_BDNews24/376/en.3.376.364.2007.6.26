 MADRID, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's new signing Yaya Toure, following Thierry Henry to the Spanish club, is a strong player similar to Henry's former Arsenal team mate Patrick Vieira, a senior Barcelona official said on Tuesday. Ivory Coast midfielder Toure moved from French first division Monaco on a four-year contract in a deal which Barcelona president Joan Laporta said cost nine million euros ($12.11 million), with a further four million euros ($5.38 million) payable depending on results. The money would be split between Monaco and one of Toure's previous clubs, Metalurg Donetsk of Ukraine. Toure is the Primera Liga club's second signing after Monday's arrival of French striker Henry from English Premier League Arsenal for 24 million euros ($32.30 million) and will help strengthen a midfield which looked lightweight at times last season. "He is a strong player with a great physical presence and an ability to distribute the ball well. He's a ball-winner and is good in the air," Barca sports director Txiki Begiristain told a news conference presenting the new signing. "He is similar in style to Patrick Vieira but we shouldn't put him under pressure always comparing the two." Barca finished second in the league, losing out to arch-rivals Real Madrid on the final day. Toure admitted that Vieira, now with Inter Milan and a World Cup and European championship winner with France, was a role model for him. "Vieira has many good qualities but I think I do as well and I am keen to demonstrate them. I hope I can live up to the expectations," he said. Toure, younger brother of Arsenal defender Kolo Toure, was a member of the Ivory Coast squad at the World Cup finals in Germany last year. He has also played for Belgium's Beveren and Metalurg Donetsk and joined Monaco from Olympiakos last year. Barca are also in talks with AS Roma over their Romanian international centre back Cristian Chivu
