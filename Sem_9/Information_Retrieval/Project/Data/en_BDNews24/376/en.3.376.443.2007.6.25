<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court-upheld death sentence upon Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin has been stayed, an official said Monday. The stay order came in line with an appeal of Mohiuddin to the Supreme Court to 'condone' an inordinate delay in filing the jail appeal, said SC Registrar Iktedar Ahmed. Iktedar said the HC sentence had been stayed in line with the SC Appellate Division Rules 1988 (Order 24, Rule 5) until disposal of his appeal. The stay order has been sent to the home secretary and the related section, Iktedar said. Mohiuddin was deported to Dhaka from Los Angeles on June 18. Immigration police arrested him at Zia International Airport and took him to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. He was then sent to jail. The SC Registrar said that the Appellate Division would hear the appeal of Mohiuddin. Mohiuddin Sunday filed an appeal with the SC for approval to move against the High Court-upheld death sentence. Awami League leader Motia Chowdhury had earlier slammed law adviser Mainul Hosein for his statement that Bangabandhu murder convict AKM Mohiuddin could appeal the court verdict. Mainul on June 18 said Mohiuddin Ahmed can appeal against his conviction if the Appellate Division accepts it. bdnew
