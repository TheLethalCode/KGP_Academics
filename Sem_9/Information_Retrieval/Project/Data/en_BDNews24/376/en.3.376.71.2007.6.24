 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Law-enforcement agencies will move more cautiously than before to make an arrest under the state of emergency, a senior official said Sunday. "From now on, an accused person won't be arrested as soon as a case is filed against him," the official said, asking not to be named. The move was taken to keep consistency with legal issues. The members of law-enforcement agencies will arrest the accused after rigorous scrutiny of allegations. The decision was taken at a meeting of the advisory committee on law and order Sunday, chaired by law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein. Mainul told reporters: "Law-enforcement agencies will remain alert so that no-one can abuse the law taking advantage of the state of emergency." "They will cautiously scrunitise all information." The same meeting also decided to lift an earlier ban on arms licensing. "People will be able to apply for arms licence under the Arms Act like before. The government has taken the decision as the overall law and order situation has improved," he said. At present, military officials from major onward and civil officials from deputy secretary can apply for arms licence, but the issuance of licence for other civilians remained suspended. After the meeting, home secretary Abdul Karim said, "The meeting discussed whether the government would ease the provision for annual payment of Tk 2 lakh in income tax, which is necessary for arms licence." "After reviewing the matter, a complete proposal will be prepared and presented at the next meeting." Karim said the number of cases has increased. "But it doesn't mean the law and order situation has decreased." "Earlier, cases were not filed, cases were not accepted. Now anybody can file a case with the police," he said. bdnews24.c
