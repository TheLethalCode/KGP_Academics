<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Tigers' towering patience in desperation to avert an innings defeat against Sri Lanka thinned out just before the close of the third day's play with the visitors still trailing by 255 runs in the second innings at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground, Colombo Wednesday. Bangladesh made 233 for five at stumps with Saqib Al Hasan (4) and Khaled Mashud (0) remaining unbeaten when bad light forced to stop the play with 11.3 overs to go. It was bit of a contrast for the visitors, who took their second innings beyond 200 mark after being skittled out for 89 in the first innings, their third lowest Test innings total. The Tigers' led initially by opener Javed Omar came to an end with Rajin Saleh and captain Mohammad Ashraful returning to the dressing room in the space of four runs. They put on 67 runs in 35.3 overs for the fourth wicket with Ashraful playing an uncharacteristic 37 off 131 balls and Rajin hitting a 177-ball 51, his seventh Test fifty. Rajin edged to Mahela Jayawardene at first slip with a half-hearted drive off Tillakaratne Dilshan, leaving the side at 227 for four. Soon Ashraful saw his mistimed shot go to Chaminda Vaas at long on to become second victim of Muralitharan. Earlier, having resumed the day on three for no loss, openers Omar and Shahriar Nafees handled the Sri Lankan pace and spin confidently and took the side to 86, Tigers' best opening partnership against Sri Lanka in Test. Bangladesh went to lunch at 110 with the loss of Nafees, who saw his fierce shot caught by Muttiah Muralitharan off his own bowling for 38 as he tried to whack the spin wizard over the head. Nafees looked well set against both pace and spin as he hit Muralitharan for five boundaries and hammered Lasith Malinga and Chaminda Vaas for four apiece. After lunch, Bangladesh faced a mini-collapse of sorts, losing two wickets to add 81 runs in the second session and put on only 45 runs in the final session at the cost of two more wickets. Soon after lunch, paceman Lasith Malinga trapped opener Javed Omar lbw as the Bangladesh opener was late to fend off a yorker. The 30-year old opener, however, reached his eighth Test fifty to finish 62 off 118 balls studded with 10 boundaries. Habibul Bashar was caught behind by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardne off Chaminda Vaas for 17. bd
