 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com) - The Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday expressed concern over consistent surges in the prices of stocks on the bourses that witnessed an all-time high in turnover on the 10th day of a rally. Bank and non-bank financial stocks and cement shares continued to rally. Insurance and mutual funds closed mixed while the power sector ended lower due to profit-taking. "I have concerns over a continuous hike in the prices of issues although turnover on the bourses looks healthy," Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of the SEC, told bdnews24.com. "It won't be a proper investment decision for those investors who are rushing without analysing fundamentals," he said, "But it's fine for those who are coming with analysis." Buoyed by institutional and foreign deals, which contained 86 percent of total transactions, turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange hit an all-time high of Tk 2.34 billion, surpassing a previous high of Tk 2.06 billion on June 3. Ahmad Rashid Lali, vice-president of the DSE, however found the current market 'absolutely mature' and 'normal'. "Investors are on the right track. They are investing in the blue-chip and cashing in on the profits continuously," he said. The DGEN or general index ended at 2149.26 points, up 20.34 points or 0.95 percent. The DSI or al-share price index gained 26.15 points or 1.49 percent to 1770.36. The DSE-20 blue-chip index added 14.30 points or 0.76 percent to 1891.56. All major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange recorded all-time highs amid a new level in turnover at Tk 454.83 million. The new high breached the previous best at Tk 367.6 million on May 28. Of the issues traded, 106 gained, 78 lost and 25 closed unchanged on the DSE. A total of 57 issues advanced, 33 fell and 11 held steady on the CSE. On the DSE, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, DESCO, Heidelberg Cement, BRAC Bank and Southeast Bank were the top five issues in the day's turnover. Profit-taking forced Power Grid, DESCO and BRAC Bank shares to end lower. Others finished upbeat. Power Grid, the topmost issue by turnover value at Tk 175.39 million, fell 1.55 percent to Tk 587. Scoring Tk 140.80 million in turnover, DESCO plunged 2.27 percent to Tk 932.5. Heidelberg Cement rallied 5.18 percent to Tk 1,120 amid rising demand. BRAC Bank slipped 0.64 percent to Tk 766.75. Southeast Bank climbed 2.08 percent to Tk 490.25. bd
