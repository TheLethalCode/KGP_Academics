 KIEV, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's prime minister vowed on Wednesday to run in a September election under an accord that ended months of political deadlock, but said political decisions still had to be taken to make the poll legitimate. Viktor Yanukovich and his arch rival from the "Orange Revolution", President Viktor Yushchenko, clinched a deal in May to hold the early general election, and parliament passed enabling legislation to let the vote proceed on September 30. But the prime minister has repeatedly declared the vote unnecessary and his allies say the opposition, aligned with the president, has failed to fulfil promises to enable parliament to be dissolved legally. The pro-Western president called the election by dissolving the chamber in three decrees in weeks of fighting over powers. But it continued to sit, closing its sessions only on Wednesday. Yanukovich, who has long resisted the election, told a news conference he would reluctantly proceed with it. "I believe that in these conditions it is vital to hold the election. There is no other way. But it must take place strictly on legal, constitutional grounds," he said. He said "90 percent, perhaps more" of requirements for the poll had been met. But the situation, he said, must never recur. "Conclusions must be drawn about why this conflict occurred and why the entire country suffered as a result," he said. "This experience must not be repeated ... Conflicts between different branches of power should be resolved by other means, as we proposed, by passing laws and changing the constitution." The prime minister and his allies complain opposition politicians have failed to follow procedures in resigning their seats and rendering parliament illegitimate and dissolved. Yushchenko defeated Yanukovich, who derives much of his support in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, in a re-run of a rigged 2004 election after weeks of mass protests in his favour. But Yanukovich returned to office after his Regions Party took first place in a parliamentary election a year ago. Months of turmoil over who was to run the ex-Soviet state caused unease in Europe. Western states that backed Yushchenko in 2004 took no sides, but expressed relief the election deal was clinched without violence. The president called the election on grounds that Yanukovich was enticing his supporters to defect and create a 300-strong group in parliament, enough to change the constitution. But he acknowledges the election is likely to produce few changes. A poll published on Tuesday put Yanukovich's Region's Party in the lead with 32 percent to 18 percent for the opposition party of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, backing the president after a period of estrangement. With allied parties considered, groups backing the prime minister have only a slight lead over the president's alli
