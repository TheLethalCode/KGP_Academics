<TITLE> Open fertiliser sales might encourage smuggling: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday said Monday that an open market sales of fertiliser could lead to the item being smuggled to neighbouring countries. Such a move would encourage smuggling and result in abuse of government subsidies, Islam said. "Fertiliser prices in India and Myanmar are higher than in Bangladesh," Azizul told a post-budget discussion on "Budget for farmers," organised by Channel i, a private television channel, at the National Economic Council. The adviser's comments came when economists and civil society people asked him to allow sales of fertiliser in the open market to remove the current pressure on designated dealers during the peak season. Shaikh Siraj of Channel i prepared a 21-point set of recommendations, including proper distribution of fertiliser and seeds, after holding 8 consultation meetings with farmers and other stakeholders in 8 districts. Advisers CS Karim and Tapan Chowdhury were present at the meeting. The finance adviser apprehended that an open market sale of fertiliser could lead to creating more opportunities for the smugglers to smuggle the item to India and Myanmar, thereby abusing the government subsidies allowed in the sector. He preferred the existing public distribution system being operated through appointed dealers. "We've increased allocations for monitoring subsidy utilisation," he said, adding, "Allocations for the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division have been increased too." bdnew
