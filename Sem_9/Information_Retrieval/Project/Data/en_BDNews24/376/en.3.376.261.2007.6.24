 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Aliwardy Khandker and Munir Ahmed have joined Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) as commissioners, a senior official said Sunday. They have filled the prolonged vacancies in BTRC's hierarchy that is composed of five commissioners. Khandker is the immediate past chairman of Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB). He will manage the Engineering and Operations division, which has been unmanned since January 2005. Ahmed served under Khandker as member in BTTB. He is responsible for spectrum management in BTRC. This position remained vacant since February 2004. Both of them were appointed on a three-year term Thursday, BTRC secretary MA Hakim told bdnews24.com. The BNP-led four party alliance government appointed AMM Reza-e-Rabbi BTRC's vice-chairman and Justice Abdus Salam its commissioner for legal and licensing in January 2005. Three months later, retired home secretary Muhammad Omar Farooq became chairman. Sources allege the civil servant with a controversial track-recordbeing on the tophas inhibited others to join BTRC. The situation changed when Omar Farooq was sacked last March, ahead of the end of his term. Former army officer Manzurul Alam replaced him in April and simultaneously the government has advertised for the vacant two commissioners' posts. Altogether eleven candidates vied for the two commissioners' positions in BTRC. Finally, the two former high officials of the state-owned telecoms monopoly have been selected. bdn
