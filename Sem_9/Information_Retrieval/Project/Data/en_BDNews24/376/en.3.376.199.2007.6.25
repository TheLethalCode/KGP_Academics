 GAZA Mon Jun 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli soldier captured a year ago by militants from Gaza asked for medical treatment and urged Israel to release Palestinian prisoners, in an audio tape posted on the Internet on Monday. Except for a handwritten letter to his parents in September, there had been no sign of life from Gilad Shalit since the tank gunner was spirited into the Gaza Strip by gunmen who tunneled across the border into Israel on June 25, 2006.

"The ball is now in the Israeli court." One of the groups that captured Shalit, the Army of Islam, part of an array of militants that mingle within Gaza's clan structures, also holds British journalist Alan Johnston. Johnston appeared in a Web video on Sunday saying he was strapped with explosives that would be detonated if Hamas leaders carried out threats to free him by force. Abu Mujahed, spokesman of the Popular Resistance Committees that also took part in last year's cross-border raid, said the factions must celebrate the first anniversary of the abduction by kidnapping additional Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for more than 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. "The soldier Shalit will never be freed before we see our prisoners freed and among us," he said at a rally attended by dozens of families of P
