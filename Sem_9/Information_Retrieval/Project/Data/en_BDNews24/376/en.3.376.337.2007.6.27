 MUMBAI, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman David Morgan will be the next president of the International Cricket Council (ICC), while India's Sharad Pawar will succeed him, a senior Indian board official said on Wednesday. "We have reached an understanding, now it only has to be cleared by the members," the official, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters from London where a series of ICC meetings is in progress ahead of Friday's annual conference. Morgan will take over from acting president Ray Mali next year for a two-year term. An official announcement is expected later this week. The Indian board was keen that Pawar, the national board chief, should be president when the 2011 World Cup is held in the sub-continent. Mali was named acting president after South African president Percy Sonn died last month with a year left in his term
