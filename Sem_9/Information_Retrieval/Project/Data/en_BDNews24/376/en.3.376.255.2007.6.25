<TITLE> Pendragon warns on used car market, denting shares </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's biggest car dealer, Pendragon, warned that a tough used car market would knock about 20 million pounds ($40 million) off this year's operating profit, hitting its shares and those of rivals. Pendragon's shares, which had already lost 17 percent of their value over the last month, fell a further 17.4 percent to 81 pence by 0854 GMT on Monday. "We see the market for used cars for the remainder of the year as subdued," Pendragon said in a statement. The group, which paid 504 million pounds ($1.01 billion) for Reg Vardy last February, also warned of a 10 million pounds impact on operating profits next financial year. Shares in smaller rival Lookers, which Pendragon tried unsuccessfully to buy last year, fell 7 percent, although analysts said Lookers was unlikely to be facing the same pressure as Pendragon. Analyst Mike Allen at Panmure said the impact on Lookers' shares was unjustified, judging by recent statements. "There seem to be company-specific issues here with Pendragon," he added. "The integration of Reg Vardy has been difficult." Pendragon said in a statement that higher interest rates, as well as cut-price competition among manufacturers of new cars, was hitting demand and margins for used cars in particular. Rival Inchcape is unlikely to report the same problems in its trading update on Wednesday, said Allen. Pendragon said in the first quarter of the year new-car profits had remained broadly in line with last year, but since then it had seen margins gradually weaken as the car market softened and price competition became more intense. "Our preferred stock in the space is Lookers, with a better earnings outlook, attractive valuation and property backing," said analyst James Targett at Citigroup. Pendragon gets just over 40 percent of its gross profits from selling parts and servicing, around 30 percent from selling second-hand cars and around 30 percent from new-car sales. The group, whose shares have underperformed the UK general retailers sector by 20 percent over the last 12 months, said it saw acquisition possibilities as smaller dealers seek to exit the difficult trading environment. It is due to post its first-half results on August
