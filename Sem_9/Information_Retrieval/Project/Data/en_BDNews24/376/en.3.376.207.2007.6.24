 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has approved a nuclear station to be set up in Bangladesh to generate power, an adviser said Sunday. Adviser Tapan Chowdhury told reporters at the secretariat eight countries, including Bangladesh, have been given the green light. A delegation will visit Bangladesh next week to work on the issue. The adviser said two early delegates had already started work in Bangladesh. Tapan said Bangladesh would face a huge power crisis by 2011. "The nuclear station will produce power through alternative means to help Bangladesh overcome the crisis." Tapan said the two delegates would hold a meeting with the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission Monday. The issue of setting up a nuclear power station in a developing country and the criteria for common users would be fixed. bdnews24.c
