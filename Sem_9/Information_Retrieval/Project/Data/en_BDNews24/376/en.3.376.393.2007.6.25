 PARIS, June 25 (Reuters) - European shares slipped early on Monday, falling for a third consecutive session as investors fretted about the outlook for interest rates and credit markets, which hit financial stocks in particular. By 0828 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.8 percent, at 1,586.52, having earlier fallen as low as 1,582.94. France Telecom was Europe's biggest drag, dropping 3 percent after the French state said it would sell a 5 percent stake in the company. Traders said Societe Generale was placing the 130 million France Telecom shares.

France's new finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche published on Sunday that the French state will not reduce its stake in the group. UK-listed miners declined on weaker metal prices and after Cazenove downgraded its recommendations on Anglo American and Antofagasta. Anglo American lost 1.6 percent, while Antofagasta shed 2 percent. On the macroeconomic side, a survey by the GfK group showed that German consumer sentiment is set to improve more than expected in July as optimism about the economy remains near a record high and shoppers become more inclined to spend.
