 LONDON/MILAN, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is confident of winning shareholder support for its 1.6 billion euro ($2.2 billion) bid for Borsa Italiana, it said on Monday, despite a mixed reception to the deal. LSE shares fell as much as 8 percent in early trade, amid concerns its biggest shareholder, US rival Nasdaq, might oppose the all-share deal, or might abandon its interest in a bid for the LSE and sell its 30 percent stake. Some analysts also said the LSE was paying a high price to strengthen its position as Europe's biggest stock market. But LSE Chief Executive Clara Furse said she had spoken to shareholders and was confident of "more than sufficient" support to complete the takeover. By 0935 GMT, LSE shares had pared their losses to trade down 0.6 percent at 1,347 pence. Buying Borsa Italiana will help LSE diversify from cash equities trading, where it makes the bulk of its revenues. Borsa Italiana is exercising an option to acquire the 51 percent stake in MTS, Europe's main electronic bond trading platform for wholesale markets, that it does not already own. "It's a wonderful diversification story for the London Stock Exchange," Furse told analysts on a conference call. But some analysts said the deal would do little to strengthen the LSE's hand in a global dash for consolidation among trading exchanges. "It still looks horribly isolated in terms of global penetration," said David Buik at spread-betters Cantor Index. Others said the deal was as much about the LSE seeking to bulk up to put it beyond the reach of a string of suitors that have stalked it over the past few years, and remained sceptical whether enough shareholders would back the deal. "We believe LSE may find it difficult to gain sufficient shareholder approval given Nasdaq's stake," analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note. They added the deal looked expensive at 27 times Borsa Italiana's earnings for 2006, versus the LSE's market valuation of 23.4 times earnings in the year to March 2007 and a sector average for European exchanges of 26.2. Credit Suisse analysts, however, said the price looked good and raised their price target on LSE shares to 13 pounds from 12 pounds, on the LSE's forecast for 40 million pounds of synergy savings and a 10 percent boost to earnings in fiscal 2009. SCRAMBLING FOR PARTNERS Borsa Italiana said it had agreed the deal with the LSE over alternative propositions. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that it had also been approached by NYSE Euronext, the world's biggest stock market operator. The world's trading exchanges are scrambling to find partners as they look for global reach and for economies of scale that will allow them to meet customer pressure to cut fees. They also face growing competition from Project Turquoise, a group of investment banks seeking to set up their own pan-European equities trading platform later this year. The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday, without citing sources, that Nordic stock exchange OMX was in advance talks to be the sole technology provider to Project Turquoise. This could put Nasdaq in direct competition with LSE, as it in the midst of a $3.7 billion takeover of OMX. OMX declined to comment and Nasdaq could not immediately be reached. The Financial Times, meanwhile, reported that NYSE Euronext was looking closely at the legal terms of Borsa Italiana's option to buy its 51 percent stake in bond trading platform MTS. Borsa Italiana Chief Executive Massimo Capuano told analysts there was "no doubt" over the legality of the option. Borsa Italiana is mainly owned by banks and financial intermediaries. Its largest shareholders are Unicredito, with a 19.9 percent stake and Intesa Sanpaolo, with 18.7 percent. LSE is being advised by Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, while Morgan Stanley and Mediobanca are acting for Borsa Italia
