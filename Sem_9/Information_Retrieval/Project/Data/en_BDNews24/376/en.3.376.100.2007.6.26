 Abu Saeed Khan, bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has sought Pakistan's assistance in reforming the telecoms sector of Bangladesh, said an announcement of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). A five-member BTRC delegation made the request during a visit to Pakistan last week to see its regulatory steps "on important telecom issues such as frequency management, VoIP and interconnection". BTRC chairman major general (retd) Manzurul Alam "was impressed by the progress Pakistan has made in the telecom sector" and was "willing to follow it". He said BTRC is in the process of bringing reforms and "would seek PTA's support and help to complete this process". PTA chairman major general (retd) Shahzada Alam Malik assured him of every possible help. Malik said no operator in Pakistan gets preferential treatment in regulatory decisions. He said private operators are bringing new technologies and "Pakistan would be the first country in the world to have large infrastructure for the provision of WiMax Services." The PTA chief said in the first three quarters of 2006-07, the telecom sector attracted $1.4 billion in FDI. Pakistan's telecoms sector "is growing at an astounding pace and surpassing all forecasts over the last few years," he added. The BTRC chairman's trip coincided with the release of a study revealing Pakistan of having a better regulatory environment for mobile telecoms than India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. LIRNEasia, a Colombo-based independent public policy research outfit, has commended Pakistan as the destination for foreign investment after conducting a telecom regulatory environment (TRE) survey in five Asian countries. The survey was as part of a multi-component study carried out in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka. The TRE survey results provide a useful diagnostic tool for assessing regulatory efficacy. Overall, Pakistan scored particularly well on market entry and management of scarce resources, radio frequency to be precise, in mobile phone sector. Pakistan and the Philippines emerged as having the best regulatory environments, with Pakistan marginally ahead. Pakistan's performance was particularly impressive because it is the country with the lowest gross national income per capita in the set. India had the next best scores, with Indonesia and Sri Lanka following. Pakistan scored higher than India on four out of the six dimensions in the mobile sectormarket entry, management of scarce resources, interconnection, and universal servicewith India significantly ahead in tariff regulation, the study disclosed. On the fixed sector TRE assessments, the Philippines topped the ratings, and Pakistan came in third, marginally behind India. But Pakistan topped India on four of the six fronts  management of scarce resources, interconnection, regulation of anticompetitive practices, and universal service. "Pakistan overtook both India and Sri Lanka in basic telecom measures (that is fixed plus mobile per 100 inhabitants) within the last two years," said LIRNEasia executive director and former chief of Sri Lankan telecoms regulator, professor Rohan Samarajiva. He said it demonstrates that correct "big-bang" reforms that is transparent and broad market entry, as well as privatisationfollowed by credible, effective implementation by a motivated regulatory agency can make a huge difference. The PTA chairman said Pakistan's total teledensity (telephone per hundred people) reached 43.44 percent in May 2007, which was just 12 percent in June 2005. On average 2.3 million subscribers are being added to cellular mobile networks each month in Pakistan, "which is an exemplary growth in relation to the population of any country in Asian region." Malik said mobile penetration reached 37.6 percent at the end of April 2007. Total mobile subscribers after May 2007 crossed the 60.8 million mark. bdn
