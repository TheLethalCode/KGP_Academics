<TITLE> Govt may approve council meetings despite ban on politics: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  The country's political parties can seek permission from the government to hold council meetings to complete the so-called reform efforts despite a ban on indoor politics, an adviser said Tuesday. Communications adviser MA Matin said the emergency administration would give a positive thought to the matter to help implement the much-talked-about reforms. "We'll consider if they come to us," Matin, a former army officer, told reporters in his office at the Secretariat. Matin's comment came a day after the BNP reformists, led by party secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, unveiled a long-rehearsed reform proposal, designed to curb the party chief's absolute powers in running the party. Matin brushed aside the allegations that the military-backed government was trying to manipulate the emergency powers to send Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina into retirement from politics. Many of the recent media reports, editorials and television talk-shows argued that the "reformists" are just carrying out the agenda of the emergency government under pressure. "The government will not impose any reform agenda on the political parties. It's up to them. The changes will come, if they want," Matin said. bdnews24
