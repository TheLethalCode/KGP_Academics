<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Brothers Union came from behind to hold Sheikh Russel KC to a 1-1 draw in the crucial second-leg encounter of B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Tuesday. With the sixth draw in 15 matches, Sheikh Russel KC topped at the point table with 27 points edging past Dhaka Abahani Limited, Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club and Muktijoddha Sangsad KS, who earned 26 points each. Abahani, however, played a match less than Mohammedan and Muktijoddha's 14. On the other hand, Brothers Union raised their point tally to 23 from 14 outings with six wins, five draws and two losses. Sheikh Russel KC comparatively dominated the first half and Moroccan striker Touati Youness snatched the first goal making Brothers' two defenders and goalie Nizam faint in the 34th minute. Capitalising a harmless pass from compatriot Rida Saadane, Youness at the edge of the box took a low left-footer that kissed the back of the net to frustrate the All-Orange fans at big bowl. After the breather, Brothers Union regrouped to mount the pressure on Sheikh Russel and found the equaliser in the stoppage time. Sheikh Russel defender Prodeep brought down Brothers' Nigerian striker Elijah Obagbemiro Junior inside the danger zone and the referee did not hesitate to award penalty. Junior converted the spot kick to snatch a point from Sheikh Ruseel. Brothers, however, was a bit unlucky as an angular shot from Mamun rattled the opponent's goalpost in the 12th minute while their goalkeeper Nizam frustrated Sheikh Russel foiling a 30-yard shot from Ighir Mohammad within 12 minutes in the second half.
