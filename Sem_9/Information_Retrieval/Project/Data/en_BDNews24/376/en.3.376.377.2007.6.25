 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A mesmerising spell by Muttiah Muralitharan and two half-centuries from skipper Mahela Jayawardene and opener Michael Vandort fired hosts Sri Lanka to a 138-run lead at stumps on the first day of the first Test at Sinhalese Sports Club ground, Colombo Monday. Sri Lanka were 227 for three when the bails were drawn after their bowlers made a light work of insipid Bangladesh, bundling them out for 89, their third lowest Test total, in just 32.3 overs. Jayawardene, on way to his 17th hundred, retired hurt on 93 following cramps just before the close of play, having smashed 14 fours and a six in his 115-ball aggressive knock. Vandort was unbeaten on 87 and Tillakaratne Dilshan 27. Abdur Razzak had Chamara Silva (1) caught by Mashrafee Bin Mortaza at slips, who moved to his right to take it low. Pacer Shahadat Hossain removed debutant opener Malinda Warnapura for a first-ball duck and Kumar Sangakkara for six to leave the hosts at 14 for two. Bangladesh batsmen once again reinforced the fact that they are still a long way off from making an impact in Test cricket as they failed to reach the 100-mark for the seventh time after gaining Test status in 2000. After being put in to bat in the overcast conditions, it seemed that Bangladesh openers Shahriar Nafees and Javed Omar were well set to handle fierce pacemen Lasith Malinga and Chaminda Vaas before being separated on 28. Off-form Nafees glanced a catch down the leg side off Malinga after he was dropped on 11 by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off the same bowler, and after that, wickets started to fall all around. Javed Omar, who struck a king pair against India at home, managed seven runs before Vaas, who conceded only eight runs in first seven overs, forced him to poke at an outswinger and edge behind the wicket. Then, Dilhara Fernando and off-spin wizard Muralitharan took over and the visitors lost their way. The Tigers found Muralitharan simply too hot to handle as he claimed five wickets for just 15 runs to break the visitors' middle and tails after Fernando wrecked the top order with three for 33. Fernando struck in his first over, getting former captain Habibul Bashar (2) with a full-length inswinger. He then induced Mohammad Ashraful, making his debut as Test captain, having set the trap for him, to pull a short-pitch delivery at deep midwicket and reduce Bangladesh to 43 for four. Muralitharan also struck in his first over with his fifth delivery when Rajin Saleh (3) went to the back foot to defend a quicker one only to be trapped leg before. Saqib Al Hasan, dropped twice, tried to counterattack, cracking three boundaries, but was unable to read Muralitharan's doosra and was adjudged leg before to a delivery he offered no stroke to. Fernando finished off the session with his third wicket as Shahadat Hossain (1) top-edged a bouncer and was caught at covers before Muralitharan wrapped the tails up. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was stumped by Jayawardene when he was beaten in flight by Muralitharan, leaving the side in dire straits at 69 for eight and raising fears of scoring the lowest-ever Test total. But the rest of the batsmen managed to edge past their lowest total of 86 against the same rivals. Muralitharan had Mohammad Rafique lbw with an off-break and Abdur Razzak stumped to finish the innings in 32.3 overs. Muralitharan his 58th five-for in Test cricket with Monday's haul, and has claimed 55 wickets in 13 innings against Bangladesh at an average of 11.65 and a strike-rate just under 27. The Tigers fell one run short of their previous lowest score in the ground where they, led by Naimur Rahman Durjoy, were all out for 90 in September 2001. bd
