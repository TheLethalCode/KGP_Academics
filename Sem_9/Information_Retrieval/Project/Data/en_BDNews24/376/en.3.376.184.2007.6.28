 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  A construction contractor has filed an extortion case against former communications minister Nazmul Huda, wife Sigma Huda and advocate Elina Khan, police said Wednesday. Ohidur Rahman, who works for the Roads and Highways Department as its listed contractor, filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station charging the three with demanding Tk 10 lakh from him. Tejgaon police sub-inspector Ataur Rahman told bdnews24.com Ohidur had complained that Huda demanded the money to spend on the construction of a conference hall for Bangladesh Manabadhikar Bastabayan Sangstha, a human-rights outfit. Ohidur handed Tk 5.5 lakh in cash to Sigma Huda and Elina Khan in the office of the organisation in Monipuripara in February 2003, according to case details. Ohidur said the demanded amount was not fully paid for "various reasons". Sigma Huda is the secretary general and Elina Khan is the executive director of the rights organisation, founded by barrister Nazmul Huda. The police opened an investigation into the case, the police officer said. The former minister was arrested on Feb 3 this year as part of an anticorruption sweep by the military-backed caretaker government and was sent to jail. bdnews2
