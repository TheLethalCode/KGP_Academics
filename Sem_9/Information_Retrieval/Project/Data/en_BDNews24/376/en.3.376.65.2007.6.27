 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  LDP president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury Wednesday announced a new party presidium, axing executive president Oli Ahmed, former speaker Sheikh Razzak Ali and 11 others in a high political drama played out for a second day. He announced the 11-member presidium from a press conference at KC Memorial Clinic in Baridhara, a day after retired colonel Oli said Badruddoza and retired major Abdul Mannan had decided to quit the Liberal Democratic Party. Oli brushed aside his expulsion and thundered that he was still with the LDP. The new presidium members are Badruddoza, retired major Abdul Mannan, Mohammad Abdullah, Dr MA Mannan, retired brigadier general Gias Uddin Ahmed, Arshaduzzaman, Mukit Khan, Prof Nurul Amin Bepari, Arif Mainuddin, retired major general Abdul Halim and Joynul Abedin Bir Protik. Badruddoza said there was a proposal to keep Mahi B Chowdhury on the presidium but it could not be accepted due to Mahi's objection. After a meeting at LDP leader Mohammad Ali Zinnah's home in Gulshan Wednesday, Oli told reporters: "Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury doesn't want to see me anymore with the LDP." Badruddoza Wednesday said: "Our LDP is the real LDP. Oli Ahmed left the party on his own because of difference of opinion. They (Oli Ahmed and 11 others) are no longer with us." "They are now with LDC, not LDP," he added. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Oli said: "We are still with the LDP. It's a matter to be pondered whether three of a 17-member body can expel 14 others." Badruddoza levelled allegations of violating party discipline and derailing from ideology against Oli. "The way he (Oli) does politics it goes against LDP's politics. He moved aside from LDP's principles. I want to see a united Bangladesh but Oli does politics of division. "Oli breached the agreement on forming the LDP. The way he speaks to beat his political opponents is not acceptable. He is a megalomaniac," he added. Badruddoza blamed Oli for going public with party constitution before making it final. "LDP was established on the principles of Bikalpa Dhara and Oli's statement that I am quitting LDP is ridiculous." Asked how credible the new presidium will be, Badruddoza said the executive committee approved it. LDP secretary general Abdul Mannan said: "Oli left LDP misinterpreting the joint leadership. He is against the LDP principles. Neither the president nor I had said that we would quit LDP. He was lying." Mahi said Oli sent two letters to the Election Commission, one on the LDP letterhead and the other on Democratic Nationalist Party (DNP). Mahi showed reporters copies of the letters. LDP was formed on Oct 26, 2006 by Badruddoza, Oli and 24 other former MPs and ministers of BNP. The party was formed after abolishing Bikolpo Dhara (Alternative Path), launched by the former president and his son Mahi. Within two months of LDP's formation, the party was threatened with a split by some senior leaders who were against the decision of the party forming a coalition with the Awami League to launch a unified movement against the BNP. With the BNP winning parliamentary elections in 2001, Badruddoza became foreign minister. He became president in November 2001, but his political success faded in less than a year. Facing impeachment in parliament, Badruddoza resigned presidency under pressure from party leaders on June 21, 2002, for allegedly disrespecting the BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman by not visiting his grave on the anniversary of his death. bdnews24
