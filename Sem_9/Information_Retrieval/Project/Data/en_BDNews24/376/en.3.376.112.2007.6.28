 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government Thursday sealed a deal with the Asian Development Bank to get $465 million in loan to upgrade the power sector. External Resources Division secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan and ADB resident representative Hua Du penned the protocol in the ERD conference room. "The agreement will assist the power sector development activities extensively, enhancing its capacity," Hua told reporters. "The power sector in Bangladesh suffers from acute generation crises despite some successes lately in power distribution," she said. "The government has sent out proposals seeking investment and assistance in the power sector management from the World Bank and Japan too," Bhuiyan said. "Besides, efforts for boosting power generation using nuclear power are also on as alternatives to using fossil fuels." "We have contacted China for establishing thermal power plants," the secretary said. "The lately conceived and designed power sector master plan should help us overcome the current crisis in the sector by 2010," he hoped. bdnews2
