 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  India is keen to open additional routes and land ports to increase and diversify trade with Bangladesh, the Indian foreign secretary said Wednesday. Shivshankar Menon said at a formal talk on India-Bangladesh relations Wednesday that improved connectivity between the two countries can include linking national power grids, gas pipelines and telecommunications to overcome certain shortages and create synergy. India has also offered to extend cooperation over shared waterways and improve air connectivity through daily air services to major metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Speaking as chief guest at a talk organised by Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, Menon said: "We need to work on improving physical and economic connectivity and connectivity of our mind. "Dismantling barriers will enable not only cross-border investment flows and transfer of technology but also facilitate market access to a wide range of small and middle-sized businesses that may not be able to enter developed countries." Bangladeshi handicrafts, ethnic clothing, Jamdani saris, marine, poultry and dairy products, fruits, and vegetables could then be easily exported to India, he added. On the issue of border demarcations, Menon indicated that most of the existing problems could be resolved very quickly. "I think most of these issues are solvable and these are not very big issues," he said. The foreign secretary also supported the idea of Bangladesh exploiting its strategic geographic location to position itself as a transportation hub for South Asia, South East Asia and China, by up-grading roads, railways and ports. On the issue of challenges in South Asia, Menon said, "There are no obstacles to our realising the vision of a South Asian community. If the opportunities are economic, the challenges that come to mind immediately are primarily political." Menon mentioned terrorism and politics of hate and confrontation as reasons why progress towards the goal of a real South Asian community has been uneven and limited to date. He commented that trade within the sub-continent at only six per cent is the lowest amongst all the regions of the world. But opportunities were increasing because of economic changes within the region and a benign international environment. "There is a window of opportunity which can be helpful to our quest for development," he said. He stressed the importance of regional cooperation. "The chances we now have in Saarc are really unique. If something is doable, we should do it. If Saarc fails, we fail." Menon returned to India Wednesday evening after a four-day visit. bdnews
