<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)Dr Kamal Hossain Tuesday demanded a clear jute policy to save farmers and the ailing industry, which was the country's leading export sector in the past. Economist Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed suggested that a national commission should be formed to revive the jute sector. He said jute exports slumped in Bangladesh because of a lack of jute-friendly policy. "We want a future parliament to pass a jute policy," Dr Kamal told reporters at a press conference of Nagorik Odhikar Sangrakhshan Forum at the National Press Club. He said jute output in Bangladesh had come down while it shot up in other countries. He said no governments since independence had paid enough attention to the sector. Dr Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, president of Bangladesh Economic Association, said jute mills in Khulna should be revived immediately as it required only Tk 300 crore. "A coordinated national commission on jute should be formed immediately with all stakeholders to revive the moribund sector," he said. Rizawana Hasan of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association said: "We had failed to protect the jute sector." bdn
