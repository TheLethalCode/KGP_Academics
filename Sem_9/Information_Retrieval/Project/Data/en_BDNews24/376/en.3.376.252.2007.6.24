<TITLE> Japan PM vows to tackle pensions mess ahead of poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister pledged on Sunday to deal with the chaos in the pensions system ahead of an upper house election next month, as a newspaper reported that 100 million yen ($807,300), and possibly more, had been embezzled by officials. Public anger over botched bookkeeping -- which has left millions of premium payments unaccounted for -- means the once-popular Shinzo Abe heads into his first ballot box test with approval ratings at their weakest since he came to office in September. "We have caused concern to many members of the public and as the head of the administration I bear the biggest responsibility for that. I must apologise," Abe told an interviewer on NHK public television. Abe, who admitted on Friday he had known about problems in the pensions system since the end of last year, said the investigation process would be thorough. "One thing we must do is check records properly for every single individual. The second is to guarantee and pay people's pensions," he added. Bureaucrats would in future help concerned members of the public to look for records of missing premiums, he said, rather than demanding that they produce their own proof of the payments. Tracing the money may be difficult in some cases. More than 100 million yen in pension money was lost to embezzlement between 1989 and 2002, according to a survey cited by the Nikkei financial daily on Sunday. Some government workers pocketed premiums rather than recording them, while others had funds paid into fictional pensioners' accounts, the report said. The Social Insurance Agency now plans to launch a probe into possible further cases of corruption, the paper said, in the latest twist in a saga alarming an electorate already concerned about how the deeply indebted government will fund its ageing population. PET PROJECTS SIDELINED Abe's actions do not go far enough, according to Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, who called for more disclosure and an acknowledgement that the government was solely responsible for the confusion. He also hit at the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's free market policies, which he said had hurt the vulnerable. "Society's weaker members are facing an increasing burden, regions are being left behind, creating a two-tier society," he said on the same television programme. The pensions row has overshadowed Abe's pet issues -- he built his support base largely on a hard line against North Korea, especially its abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s. But Abe denied that Japan was being left out of the loop as the United States engaged with Pyongyang on disarming its nuclear weapons programme. US nuclear envoy Christopher Hill paid a surprise visit to North Korea last week, in what many saw as a concession by President George W. Bush, who had previously insisted Pyongyang first shut down its main nuclear weapons facility. "Not at all," Abe told the programme when asked if Japan was being excluded. "On this occasion, Mr Hill informed Japan in advance. He also told North Korea that relations with Japan were important," he added. Abe has tried to dilute focus on pensions ahead of the July 29 poll, by playing up his efforts to revise the constitution and create a "beautiful country" free of the shadow of World War Two. But opposition leaders were sceptical of his chances of success. "He ignores the problems that affect the people and is enthusiastic about matters that don't interest them -- that is why his support rates are down," Communist Party leader Kazuo Shii told the programme.
