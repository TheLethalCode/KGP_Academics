 AMSTERDAM, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The only living cousin of Anne Frank loaned a large collection of letters, photos and newspaper clippings to Amsterdam's Anne Frank House on Monday that could offer new details about her life. To mark the 60th anniversary of the publication of Anne Frank's diary, her 82-year-old cousin Buddy Elias officially handed over the 1,500 documents and 3,750 photos, which have been digitised and will be made available to researchers. The diary, which chronicles the Jewish girl's two-year period in hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands, was published in 1947 by her father, Otto. It has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into over 60 languages. The collection includes a notebook belonging to Otto Frank, in which he recorded his thoughts when the Netherlands was freed from German occupation, as well as a study book that may have inspired Anne Frank to write short stories. Also part of the collection are notebooks that Anne and her sister Margot used to study, letters they had sent, and newspaper articles about Anne that Otto Frank kept. Anne and her family were discovered in August 1944 in the secret annex of a canalside warehouse and sent to concentration camps. Anne, then aged 15, and her sister Margot died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen camp in 1945, weeks before it was liberated. "It is very special that the family kept so many documents," said Teresien Da Silva of the Anne Frank Foundation. The foundation, which also runs Amsterdam's Anne Frank Museum, hopes more documents will turn up in the future. "A whole year is missing from Anne Frank's diaries," Da Silva said. The Basel-based Anne Frank-Fonds, which administers Otto Frank's estate, will offer a grant of 5,000 euros ($6,700) for further research of the documents that will be awarded year
