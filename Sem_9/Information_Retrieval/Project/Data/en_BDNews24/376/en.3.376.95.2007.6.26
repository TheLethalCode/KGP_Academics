 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  It was not assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Alamgir Bhuyian who said he had manually stopped the speeding Chittagong Mail train with the driver unconscious and averted a possible disaster on June 17. The train with some 1,000 passengers on board was stopped by the guard who had the mechanical control, reveals a railway probe. "I informed the secretary (communications) that the train was stopped by the guard, not by ASI Alamgir Bhuiyan. The probe has proved it," Md Belayet Hossain, director general of Bangladesh Railway, said to bdnews24.com Sunday. The driver and the supervisor of Chittagong Mail running at high speed were found unconscious at their seats. bdnews24.com's own investigation found that the statements of the ASI who was in charge of security of the train contradicted what appeared to be fact. The train was scheduled to stop at Ghorasal Flag station, but it headed straight for Dhaka instead. It could have run head-on into another had the guard who had the mechanical control to stop trains in case of emergency not intervened, according to the finds. The following day the media reported quoting police sources that Alamgir had saved the train from a possible accident, earning him applause from the government high-ups. "Will the railway confess their neglect of duty?" Alamgir told bdnews24.com Friday at his Ibrahimpur home in Dhaka. He claimed he pulled off the joint of the hosepipe connecting two coaches. In a statement he gave to the probe committee on June 19 he said he along with other constables were at the compartment next to the guard's coach, known as 'guard brake'. The train that started from Narsinghdi did not stop at Ghorashal Flag station where it was supposed to, he said. He said he pulled the emergency lever but it did not work so he went to the connecting point of two coaches, pulled off the hosepipe and stopped the train at Arikhola station. But the design of the compartment does not allow anybody to get to the joint and detach the hosepipe. The compartment 779 next to the 'guard brake' was a second-class compartment with no door or window allowing passage to the joint. The 779 compartment was the last carriage of the train too. Again, it is not possible to go to the joint of compartments through the door or windows. In the inter-city compartments, there is provision to go to the joint of two compartments. bdnews24.com found the train had 15 coaches excluding the engine. But Alamgir said Friday it had 19 and there were two inter-city compartments at the tail of the train, just ahead of the 'guard brake'. He said the serial Nos. of the inter-city compartments were 17 and 18. According to the railway's reports on daily coach serial, the serial number of the compartments, starting from the engine, was in the following order: 2061 (second class), 413 (second class), 882 (second class), 1813 (second class), 353 (railway mail coach), 9733 (inter-city, power car), 6022 (inter-city, AC/berth), 227 (first class), 192 (first class), 222 (first class), 3943 (luggage carrier, 4257 (vehicles carrier), 2893 (guard brake) and 779 (second class). The ASI said he did manage to go to the joint of two inter-city coaches and stopped the train. But, according to railway, the serials of two inter-city coaches were six and seven. "Where did he get 19 compartments? The train had 15 coaches. The inter-city compartments were at sixth and seventh positions," Sardar Shahadat Ali, division traffic officer (Dhaka) and head of the probe committee, said speaking to bdnews24.com Sunday. "Except the driver, the guard is the only person who can stop a train in case of an emergency. It is impossible to disconnect hose pipes at the joint by kicking and stop trains," Abdul Wahab, chief operating superintendent (west zone), told bdnews24.com Sunday. Divisional mechanical engineer (Dhaka division), Nur Ahammad, a member of the probe committee, told bdnews24.com that it was impossible to go to the joints of coaches on a moving train. "I challenged Alamgir Bhuiyan to show me again how he had gone to the joint. But he did not respond. If he can do it, I will resign right away." Ahammad said an inspector of the railway police Sunday inspected coach 779 and said it is impossible to go to the joint from inside the compartment. The inspector would submit his report at a convenient time, Ahammad told bdnews24.com. bdn
