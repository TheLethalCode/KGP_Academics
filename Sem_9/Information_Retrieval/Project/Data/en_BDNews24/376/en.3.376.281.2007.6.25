<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Monday announced a 15-point party reform plan, including a proposal to curb the powers of the BNP chairperson. He rolled out this landmark plan in a news briefing to reporters after a meeting with senior leaders of the BNP on party reforms at his Gulshan home. "Our proposal has been designed the way all BNP leaders and workers want reforms to the party. It's a draft proposal, not final," Bhuiyan said. The BNP cannot shape up into a democratic party without cutting the powers of the party chief. "The reforms have to be made to take the party forward and keep it up-to-date. It's a demand of the time," he said. According to the plan, the chief of the party would be elected for three years by the members of the council and no persons would be allowed to hold the post for more than two terms. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia has been at the helm of the BNP since 1984, attracting blame for crafting a dynastic rule in Bangladesh's politics. If the party chief chooses to become prime minister after elections, she has to abandon her party post, according to the reform plan. A watch committee will be formed soon to identify the party men tied with corruption, nepotism and misuse of power that tainted the party's image. The committee will take action against the guilty, according to the proposal. Bhuiyan said the reform plan was designed in discussion with party leaders and workers. The council or party forum will make the reform final once the ban on indoor politics goes, Bhuiyan said. "It's a proposal from BNP leaders. If anybody can come up with a better plan, we will consider it," he added. A copy of the reform plan will be sent to Khaleda, Bhuiyan told reporters. Bhuiyan had earlier held a meeting with party leaders including M Saifur Rahman, Mahbubur Rahman, Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf, Hafizuddin Ahmed, Inam Ahmed Chowdhury, AHM Mofazzal Karim, ZA Khan, Mosharraf Hossain Shajahan, Hahmudul Hasan, Ashraf Hossain, Selima Rahman and Abdul Alim. bdnew
