<TITLE> Middle East mediators close to deal on Blair </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Middle East mediators held talks that could clear the way for the appointment of Tony Blair on Tuesday as their envoy to try to revive peace prospects after Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip. Blair, who steps down as Britain's prime minister on Wednesday, gave his clearest indication yet that he wants the job, saying in London that he was ready, in principle, to try to help bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Diplomats close to the so-called Quartet powers -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- said Blair was likely to be named to the top peacemaking position soon -- possibly as early as Tuesday. However, Hamas said Blair was not welcome because of his role in supporting U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. representative at the Jerusalem meeting, Assistant Secretary of State David Welch, told reporters that he and his fellow officials had discussed what Blair's role would be and said he expected an announcement later in the day. Visiting Ramallah in the West Bank, Welch said: "I think you will hear more from the Quartet in a few hours." Aides to Abbas said they expected Blair to be appointed. Washington and its European and Arab allies have stepped up pressure on Israel to jumpstart talks with Abbas, who heads the Fatah faction, following Hamas's violent takeover of Gaza nearly two weeks ago. Welch repeated support for Abbas on Tuesday. Israeli officials said they were considering a new request from Abbas to bring a Jordan-based Fatah force known as the Badr Brigade into the West Bank to try to shore up his control. "It is being evaluated and a decision will be made soon," a senior Israeli government official told Reuters. Welch and other representatives from the Quartet met at the US Consulate in Jerusalem, seeking to define the mandate for their new envoy. The meeting ended with no public announcements. Washington has confirmed the Quartet was discussing the appointment of an envoy to help Abbas build up the institutions of a future state and carry out political and economic reforms. Some European diplomats have questioned Blair's ability to garner broad Palestinian and Arab public support because of his leading role in the Iraq war and his close relationship with US President George W Bush. Many Arabs see the Bush administration as biased against the Palestinians. Blair, who steps down after 10 years in power, has frequently urged Bush to take a more assertive role in trying to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "I think anybody who cares about greater peace and stability in the world knows that a lasting and enduring resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian issue is essential and, as I have said on many occasions, I would do whatever I could to help such a resolution come about," Blair told reporters in London. Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would support Blair's appointment as Quartet envoy, aides said. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhmoum criticised the choice. "Blair has his own black fingerprints in the history of the Palestinian people. He had supported the Zionist occupation's terrorism and massacres against our people," he said. Bush administration officials first floated the idea of appointing Blair to the envoy post in private meetings earlier this year, long before Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip more than a week ago, Western diplomats said. Abbas responded to Gaza's takeover by sacking the Hamas-led government and forming an emergency cabinet in the West Bank. That has divided the Palestinian territories into a Hamas-controlled Gaza and a larger, Fatah-dominated West Ba
