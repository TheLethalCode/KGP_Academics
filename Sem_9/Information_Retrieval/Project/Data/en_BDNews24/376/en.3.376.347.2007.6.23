<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com) - Jahid Hasan Amili struck League's sixth hat-trick as title contenders Abahani Limited returned to their exact style to brush aside Rahmatganj MFS 7-0 in second-leg encounter of the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. The outcome took them to the top of the point table with 26 points along with Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club, Muktijoddha Sangsad KS and Sheikh Russel KC, who also shared the top spot. The sky blues outfit, however, played a match short of trio's 14. Abahani, who recorded a stoppage-time goal win over the same rivals at home, put on a collective teamwork from the beginning to take a comfortable 3-0 lead before leaving the field with the seventh win, which was also an ever big winning margin for Abahani this season. Amili, who sat out last two matches to give the room for Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim, who was ruled out due to yellow card caution, was more active in the attack and tore the opponents' defence several times to score four goals by himself. After surviving a certain goal scare from Nigerian striker Charles Ikogho, who struck straight to Abahani goalie Biplob Bhattacharya in one-on-one situation in the second minute of the match, Cameroon striker Nchouwat Souleyman gave Abahani a 21st minute lead. Then, Abul Hossain, who also found himself in the playing eleven in Saturday's match, doubled the margin with a header, which kissed the back of the net taking a deflection of Rahmatganj's Nigerian medio Abayomi Felix in the 35th minute. Abul, four minutes later, fired home to make it 3-0, utilising a rebounder after a close-range shot by Amili was denied by Rahmatganj keeper Anwar Hossain. After the breather, it was a single show of Amili, who struck his first goal in the 71st minute dodging past four opponents' defenders and, four minutes later, made the Abahani margin 5-0 with a diving header, capitalising a set piece by substitute Abdullah Parvez. The little striker completed his treble in the 79th minute to tap into home from a Mehdi Hassan Ujjal minus from the left. He became the fifth hat-trick maker in the League after Mohammedan's Nigerian duo Mwach Ukwu Paul Mac and Emeka Christina, Brothers Union's Nigerian Elijah Obagbemiro Junior and Muktijoddha Sangsad's Alfaz Ahmed struck the treble. Amili then sealed the victory giving the opponent's goalie no chance after getting a through pass from substitute defender Jahangir Alam in the stoppage time. The winning margin could have been bigger had striker Ujjal not missed two easy chances despite getting Rahmatganj goalkeeper Anwar along.
