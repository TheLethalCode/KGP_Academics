<TITLE> Filmmaker Moore wishes Bush well at LA rally </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Filmmaker Michael Moore on Tuesday launched into the final days before the US debut of his movie 'SiCKO' with two things that might surprise his detractors: a call for compassion for others and well wishes for President George W Bush. Moore is the director behind 2004's anti-Bush documentary, 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' and he is back on the attack with this Friday's release of 'SiCKO,' which aims to expose weaknesses in US health care. At a rally on Tuesday on the steps of Los Angeles' City Hall, the fiery filmmaker recalled his grandfather as a doctor who "wanted to help people, not make a buck."

But the compassion that sometimes filled his voice was noteworthy and in tune with the more humanistic tone of 'SiCKO,' compared to the combativeness of 'Fahrenheit.'

But the gist of his arguments is sound, and only a wealthy HMO executive would claim no problem exists in American medical care." Audiences will likely find it difficult to be unsympathetic toward the numerous people Moore introduces in 'SiCKO' who have had health problems and failed to receive adequate care or were bankrupted by paying bills that insurance companies denied. After more than a month of promotions at festivals and screenings around the United States, 'SiCKO' lands in roughly 440 theaters on Friday, but box office watchers said not to expect the lofty numbers of 'Fahrenheit' given the low theater count, less controversial subject and competition from family film 'Ratatouille' and adventure 'Live Free or Die Hard.' "I just hope it ignites the spark that will lead to health care for all Americans," Moore said of his hopes for the fi
