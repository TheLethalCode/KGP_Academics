 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh and India Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding on quality control of exports. The director general of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute and the Bureau of Indian Standards joint secretary for external relations signed the MoU on behalf of their respective sides. Indian foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon said commodities produced entirely in Bangladesh would be given duty-free access to India in phases within December. The two sides underscored the need to take steps to facilitate trade and economic cooperation. Later, at a joint press conference following a two-day foreign secretary-level meeting at state guesthouse Padma, Menon said: "As a friendly country, India wants to see democracy and stability in Bangladesh." He also said, "We don't interfere in internal matters. The people of Bangladesh will determine their destiny and future." In reply to another question he said, "Border terrorism is a common problem for both the countries. When a terrorist of one country crosses the border into another, it doesn't remain the problem of one country." In this context he said, "If we are united in solving the common problems of our two countries we will surely get positive results." Earlier the two foreign secretaries issued a joint statement which said that they had had constructive discussions on establishing peace along the borders of the two countries, sharing of water, and enhancing economic transactions, cultural relations and mutual cooperation. On seeking Indian cooperation for voter listing in the enclaves, Bangladesh acting foreign secretary Touhid Hossain said, "We have discussed the matter. I hope we will get the necessary cooperation." On the start of rail communications between the two countries, Menon said, "We have agreed in principle on train movements between the two countries. However, the type of communication has to be determined first." "For this, the delegations of two countries will soon sit for discussions and finalise the matter." The two foreign secretaries also said that they had discussed the demarcation of a six-kilometre stretch of border on the basis of the 1974 Land Boundary Agreement as well as the enclaves. bdnews24.c
