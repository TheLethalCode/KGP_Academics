<TITLE> Govt resets rents of Nam flats: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government has fixed new rents for 228 flats, popularly known as Nam flats, where currently former lawmakers of the eighth parliament live, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Wednesday. The lawmakers of the last parliament now will have to pay Tk 400 for a day instead of previous monthly rate of only Tk 600, Hosein said. Recently, the ministry of housing and public works engaged in a tight bargaining with the parliament secretariat to take the control of the flats. The parliament secretariat regulates the flat allotments. The ministry's move came in line with a government decision that bureaucrats will get the allotment of the flats since the parliament does not exist now. But the secretariat was not happy with the decision, as officials argued that the former lawmakers will stay until a new parliament is formed. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar reportedly wrote a letter to the government, protesting the government decision of giving the allotment of the flats to the bureaucrats. Mainul said Wednesday that he did not receive such any letter from the speaker. "I didn't get such any letter," he said. "It's not right that we can't rent the flats to the government officials." There are a total of 324 Nam flats. After the eighth parliament was dissolved, 70 to 8o former lawmakers left their flats. The government has decided to rent those vacant flats to the government officials, Mainul said. Currently officials of the Anticorruption Commission and the Special Security Force (SSF) live in some flats. bdnews2
