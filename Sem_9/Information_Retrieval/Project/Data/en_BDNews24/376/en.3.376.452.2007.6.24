<TITLE> Paris Hilton to give Larry King post-jail interview </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Los Angeles, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Hotel heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton will give her first post-jail interview on CNN's "Larry King Live" on Wednesday, the show's spokeswoman said on Saturday. A CNN spokeswoman said King would interview Hilton in a one-hour special on Wednesday, just 24 hours after the hotel heiress and reality television star is released from prison in Los Angeles. "She will be on for the hour," Bridget Leininger told Reuters. "We had (filmmaker) Michael Moore originally scheduled for that time." The network and a spokesman for Hilton said the 26-year-old would not receive payment for the interview. News of King's exclusive comes the day after two major networks, NBC and ABC, both passed on Hilton interviews amid reports and subsequent denials that they were willing to pay for the first interview. NBC was initially reported to have secured an interview with Hilton which would see the celebutante paid one million dollars, despite company rules prohibiting payment to interviewees. NBC denied a Hilton interview was planned. The Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday that ABC and its star anchor Barbara Walters had pulled out of the running on Friday, while another broadcaster, CBS, indicated it was not seeking an interview. In a statement released through her publicist, Hilton said she was pleased to be telling her side of the story on King's show. "I am thrilled that Larry King has asked me to appear on his programme to discuss my experience in jail, what I have learned, how I have grown and anything else he wants to talk about," she said.
