 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) - The benchmark DGEN or general index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange ended just about 2 points below the expected historic high of 2100 points as insurance stocks surged on hopes the government would replace the decades-old law. "A new law is on the cards to regulate the insurance sector. The law is expected to raise insurance companies' capital adequacy requirements," said Yawer Sayeed, chief of AIMS of Bangladesh, an asset management firm. The BNP-led government framed a new draft law for the sector to replace the Insurance Act of 1938, said Sayeed. "I hope the government will pass it as ordinance," he said. However M Haider Chowdhury, chairman of National Life Insurance, which rallied 10.46 percent to Tk 2,000, said, "I don't find any justification of such rise." Prime Life Insurance, Sandhani Life Insurance, Meghna Life Insurance, Popular Life Insurance and Fareast Islami Life Insurance rallied 17.44 percent, 14.13 percent, 13.55 percent, 11.74 percent and 7.38 percent. BRAC Bank, DESCO and non-bank financial sector gave extra pace to the market. The DGEN added 11.19 points or 0.53 percent to 2098.29, a new high in the bourse's history. The DSI or all-share price ended at 1715.83, up 9.34 points or 0.54 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip index finished 4.89 points or 0.26 percent lower at 1853.13. However, turnover slipped to Tk 1.49 billion from Thursday's Tk 1.51 billion. Gainers beat losers 94 to 84 while 19 held steady. "The government should immediately offload another 24 percent stakes of Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and DESCO to cool down soaring demands," said Sallahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. "Otherwise, the present surge in demands will push the prices of issues up," he said, indicating general investor's risk of high losses. The Chittagong Stock Exchange recorded a Tk 249.90 million in turnover from Tk 336.39 million the previous day. The CSE-30 index finished downbeat but other indices advanced. A total of 48 issues advanced, 39 fell and 12 closed unchanged on the CSE. BRAC Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, DESCO, Summit Power and Southeast Bank ruled the turnover board on the DSE. High demands moved up BRAC shares 6.04 percent to end at 749.75. BRAC scored Tk 149.99 million in turnover. Profit-taking led Power Grid and Summit Power to drop 1.02 percent and 0.49 percent to Tk 581.25 and Tk 913. DESCO added 5.59 percent to Tk 976 amid surge in demands. Southeast Bank gained 0.26 percent to Tk 474.5. bdnew
