<TITLE> Swiss set to wrap up Bhutto money laundering inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Swiss investigating judge is expected to complete soon a long-running inquiry into alleged money laundering by former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto, Geneva's chief prosecutor said on Tuesday. The latest chapter in the long-running graft case comes at a time when the opposition leader has vowed to return from self-imposed exile to Pakistan ahead of elections. But moving the case one step toward possible prosecution does not mean it will come to trial. Bhutto, who denies the money laundering charges, testified nearly two years ago before judge Vincent Fournier who is probing charges that she and her husband Asif Ali Zardari stashed millions of dollars in kickbacks in Switzerland. The pair were convicted in Geneva in 2003 of having laundered funds worth some $13 million through offshore companies and ordered to return the frozen funds to the Pakistani government. But the initial verdict was thrown out automatically upon appeal, sparking a new probe. Geneva chief prosecutor Daniel Zappelli said on Tuesday he expected Fournier to hand over the results of his inquiry soon. "The file should be transmitted shortly," he told Reuters. Fournier, in a separate interview, said that he had heard some Pakistani witnesses called by Bhutto since her appearance in September 2005. He declined to comment further on the case. Once he has the file, prosecutor Zappelli has three options -- to bring the case to trial, suspend it, or dismiss it. GENERAL ELECTION Any fresh Swiss legal move against Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's Party, could have great bearing on a general election in Pakistan, due late this year or early next. In Pakistan, there is speculation that President Pervez Musharraf will seek to secure a second term by forging an understanding with his old foe, allowing the two-time prime minister to return from almost a decade in London and Dubai. The case relates to accusations dating back to the 1990s that Bhutto and Zardari accepted commissions for awarding contracts to two Swiss companies to do business. Swiss inspection services firm SGS and its former unit Cotecna held lucrative contracts between 1993 and 1996. A conviction for aggravated money-laundering in Switzerland carries a maximum prison term of five years and possible fine. Bhutto was sacked on disputed charges of massive corruption in late 1996, and convicted of corruption, in absentia, by a Pakistan court in April 1999. But Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned the ruling two years later, and ordered a retrial. To obtain a conviction under Swiss federal law, a prosecutor must prove that graft or other crime has been committed abroad and the proceeds were laundered in Switzerland. The lack of a conviction in Pakistan will make it more difficult to prove a money laundering case, according to Swiss legal experts. Bhutto's lawyer Alec Reymond said the case was dragging on. "Nothing has happened at all in the past year. We asked for a whole series of witnesses to be heard, but they haven't been," he told Reute
