<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  Feroz M Hassan, who resigned from the Liberal Democratic Party as founding member on Monday, has described its new presidium as just another drama by AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and his son. "It's a drama by a father and his son," he told bdnews24.com Wednesday, hours after the former president rolled out an 11-member party presidium from a press conference at KC Memorial Clinic in Baridhara. In a letter to Badruddoza on Monday, Hassan said the LDP chief had sacrificed all principles in a "mad rush for power". He "sacrificed all the principles that we stood for and all your commitments went down the drain when you joined with Col Oli and formed the Liberal Democratic Party". Hassan referred to the formation of LDP by Badruddoza, Oli Ahmed and 24 other former MPs and ministers of BNP by abolishing Bikolpodhara (Alternative Path). "This was done without debating and discussing in the party forum, again ignoring our principles of democratic decision making in the party," he said. "I ended all relationships with LDP," he told bdnews24.com. Hassan said Badruddoza and son Mahi B Chowdhury alone put the final nail in the coffin of Bikolpodhara and the principles it stood for. "In a crazy dash to get on the train to power, you joined hands with questionable leaders and embraced corrupt and terrorist people," he said. Hassan said Badruddoza's "sheer desire for absolute power" did not stop there. "You and your son together with some sycophants traded accusation with the executive president (Oli) and entered into mud slinging, totally disregarding the image of the party and dividing the leaders and the workers," he said in the damning letter. "Mr. President, you violated each and every principle you said you stood for. You dishonored the trust of each and every dedicated party men and women who stood by you. You violated the belief that the people of this country was beginning to put on you and all of us in Bikolpodhara." "Under the circumstances, and with utter disgust, I hereby severe all my relationship with the Liberal Democratic Party," he said. bd
