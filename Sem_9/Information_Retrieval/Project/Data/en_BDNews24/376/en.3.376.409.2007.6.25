<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  'Spider-Man 3' villain Thomas Haden Church is in negotiations to co-star opposite Sandra Bullock in the comedy 'All About Steve,' which will begin shooting this summer. Bullock plays a brilliant crossword constructor who, after one short date, decides that a CNN cameraman (Church) is her true love. Because the cameraman's job takes him hither and yon, she crisscrosses the country, turning up at media events as she tries to convince him they are perfect for each other. She fails in this objective but falls in with a band of misfits who appreciate her for who she is. Phil Traill will make his feature directorial debut on the Fox project. Kim Barker ('License to Wed') wrote the screenplay. Church, who played Flint Marko/Sandman in 'Spider-Man 3,' next stars in Miramax Films' 'Smart People.' He was nominated for an Oscar for his supporting turn in 2004's 'Sideways.
