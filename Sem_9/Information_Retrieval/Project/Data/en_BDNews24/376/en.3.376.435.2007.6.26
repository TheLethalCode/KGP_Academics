 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Spiralling inflation is set to ravage consumers for at least another several months, analysts say. "Consumers may have to bear with rising inflation for next several months," Sajjad Zohir, an economist and a researcher at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Inflation spiked to a 9-year high at 8.28 percent in April, the most recent month with statistics available. It was 5.94 percent in January, 7.28 percent in February and 7.4 percent in March, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). "I doubt whether the inflation will remain within 6.5 percent projected in the proposed budget for FY 2007-08," said Zaid Bakht, research director at BIDS. The government has set inflation rate at 6.5 percent for the outgoing fiscal year, but the inflation rate would exceed 7 percent at the end of the financial year on June 30, he said. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam also set 6.5 percent inflation rate for FY 2007-08, which analysts say would depend mainly on how well the government manages the economy. "The inflation may continue to go up for May, June and the following couple of months," Zohir said. Continued rise in food inflation is hurting people the most. Food inflation rose by 0.45-percentage point to 8.98 percent in April from 8.53 percent in March, according to the BBS. It was 8.36 percent in February and 6.65 percent in January. Prof Atiur Rahman of Dhaka University marked oil price hike, lower food production and import, and the government's drive against black money for the relentless rise in food prices. A Bangladesh Bank official, who declined to be named as he is not allowed to talk to the media, said the drives against hoarding and corruption hit demand-supply chain of essential commodities in February-March, leading to continuous hike of food prices. But non-food inflation which hovers historically within 5 percent has also increased significantly in the recent months. Non-food inflation, according to the BBS, has reached 7.35 percent in April from 5.76 percent in March, 5.74 percent in February and 4.95 percent in January. "The proposed duty structure for import of raw materials, if implemented, would further push non-food inflation," Bakht warned. "Restoring political stability and confidence of the market players will be the two major challenges for the present government if it is to contain soaring inflation," Zohir said. He feared the government's plan to raise electricity tariff would further fuel the high inflation. bd
