 MARJAYOUN, Lebanon, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Many South Lebanese pin their hopes for future security on UN peacekeepers, but a deadly car bombing on a Spanish patrol has made them fear worse is to come. After last year's war in their country between Israel and Hezbollah, residents welcomed the 13,000-strong UN force -- expanded after the conflict -- as offering a chance for peace and prosperity. But Sunday's car bomb that killed six peacekeepers in the first deadly attack on the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since the July-August fighting, shocked villagers. "I'm terrified because it could get worse," said Nisreen, 35, a shop owner in the Christian village of Marjayoun, nervously eyeing a car that parked in front of the shop. "If any car parks here, I am paranoid especially because my kids play out here," she told Reuters, surveying the town square. The presence of recently deployed Lebanese soldiers near a Spanish battalion office did little to allay her fears. The road between Khiyam and Marjayoun -- normally tranquil and lined with violets and daisies -- is now guarded by Lebanese army soldiers every few metres as it winds up to scenic mountain villages. Teachers in Khiyam also said they were worried, especially after al Qaeda-inspired militants of the Fatah al-Islam group, whom the army has been battling in a Palestinian refugee camp in the north, threatened UNIFIL earlier this month. Khiyam and Marjayoun, in particular, are popular towns with UNIFIL peacekeepers and many shops and restaurants hang flags of the different contingents to show their friendliness. As well as depending on peacekeepers, the towns' economies rely on Lebanese emigrants who return to family homes in the south during the summer. Many shopowners were looking forward to a more profitable season after last year's war destroyed any hope of a prosperous summer period. But on Monday, several restaurants had closed, fastening their shutters, while those that opened were empty. "Before the incident even happened, we felt that something like that could happen. Those behind it, did it so that Lebanon would no longer be a functioning state," said Tony Wanna, co-owner of a restaurant on the main road through Marjayoun. Ragheda Wanna, another co-owner, lamented the fate of her family's newly opened restaurant. "I fled to Sweden after last year's war but then when I saw that there would be UNIFIL peacekeepers, I came back, bought a piece of land and opened this restaurant. Most of the business is from them," she said. "The peacekeepers used to tell us nothing bad will happen in south Lebanon. But now a strike like that is a knockout blo
