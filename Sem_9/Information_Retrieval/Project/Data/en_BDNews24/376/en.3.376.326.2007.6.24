 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh will discuss Monday duty-free exports of eight million pieces of garments, downsizing of India's sensitive list under SAFTA and non-tariff barriers, with the visiting Indian delegation, a senior official said Sunday. Led by foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon, a four-member Indian delegation arrived Sunday in Dhaka for bilateral talks on different issues, including the three major trade focuses. Menon will hold formal talks with his counterpart Touhid Hossain and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday. Commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed will help Bangladesh delegations in trade issues, commerce ministry officials confirmed. "We're yet to get any reply from the Indian side on exports of eight million pieces of readymade garments to India although we've notified them on June 12," a senior commerce ministry official told bdnews24.com Sunday, asking not to be named. "We've agreed to Indian proposal regarding probable disputes over product classification by Indian customs," the official said. However, the Bangladeshi businessman wanted the issue resolved through SAFTA's settlement mechanism under agreement. Bangladesh was supposed to start exports of eight million duty-free pieces of garments from July 1 2006. But the plan did not take off due to disagreements. The host country will also talk to the Indian delegation on the size of India's sensitive list comprising 744 items under SAFTA, the commerce ministry official said. "We'll ask them to reduce the list," he added. He said the all-time common issuethe non-tariff barrierswould also be discussed at the meeting. Bangladesh has long been asking India to remove NTBs, which is a major obstacle for Bangladesh to export to India, Nepal and Bhutan. bdnew
