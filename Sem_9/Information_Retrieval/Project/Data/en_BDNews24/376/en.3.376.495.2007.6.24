His family said he was due to be promoted to the rank of sergeant in September and had a bright future ahead of him in the army. "John was a cherished and devoted son and brother; a talented hardworking and successful soldier, popular with his peers and across all ranks alike," they said in a statement. Rigby's death brought to 153 the number of British troops to have been killed in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. He was serving in Iraq with his brother William in the 4th Battalion The Rifles, based in Bulford Camp, Wiltshire. The force is operating as a mechanised infantry unit in Iraq. Rigby's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Sanders, described him as "an exceptional man". "We are utterly heartbroken," he said.

Friends remembered him as a popular and loyal soldier who played the drums in his band The Motion and keenly followed Tottenham Hotspur football club.
