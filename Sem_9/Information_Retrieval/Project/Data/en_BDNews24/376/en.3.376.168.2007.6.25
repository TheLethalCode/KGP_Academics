 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A lack of specific information and definitive evidence is holding the government from taking action against allegedly corrupt staff of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, an adviser said Monday. "I hear about corruption, but so far I have not found any evidence," civil aviation adviser MA Matin said to reporters after a meeting of Biman's board of directors at the civil aviation ministry. "For any positive action against them, evidence is necessary. Specific evidence must be produced just to raise allegations with the anticorruption taskforce." Matin responded to reporters' queries about the planned 'golden handshakes' as part of an effort to overhaul the loss-making national flag carrier. "Before making Biman a public limited company, 1593 employees would be selected to send them into voluntary retirement. The committee formed to scrutinise this process has begun work," he said. Biman is slated to become a public limited company (PLC) and have a new name sometime in July, added the adviser. bdnews24.com/
