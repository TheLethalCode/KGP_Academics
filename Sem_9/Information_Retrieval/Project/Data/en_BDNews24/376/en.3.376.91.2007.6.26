<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Filmmaker David Yates has brought a darker edge to the latest Harry Potter film -- he tackles the adolescent boy wizard as he walks a thin line between good and evil. 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,' Yates' first major work and the fifth in the blockbuster film series, shows Harry experiencing the growing pains and teenage angst that come with the ascent to adulthood. In a storyline that draws parallels with the growing age of the young actors -- and brought disapproval from many readers of the book -- Harry comes across as a more gritty character than in the previous films. "Harry is angry," actor Daniel Radcliffe described his role at a news conference to promote the film on Monday. Yates, previously best known for TV dramas such as the 'Girl in the Caf' and "State of Play", has combined aspects of previous films with his own take on Harry's character, said Radcliffe, who has played Potter throughout the series based on the novels by author JK Rowling. "David has taken the best aspects of the other films and added some grit that wasn't previously there," Radcliffe said. Emma Watson, who plays Harry's sidekick Hermione, agreed. "The Order of the Phoenix is the most genuine of all the films so far," said Watson. "David wanted to find the truth from within all the characters." Yates was keen to explore new ground and push the actors further than before. "He really stopped us from getting complacent," said Watson. Yates, who was third choice to direct the film after both Mike Newell and Mira Nair turned the job down, said he was 'desperate to put his stamp' on the film and differentiate it from the work of the three directors before him. "You have to be competitive," Yates told the news conference. He has not been without help from his predecessors, however. "Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell spent lots of time with David. They were very generous in their advice," said the film's co-producer, David Heyman. Yates, who is directing the next film in the series and is also tipped to be in the running for the final film, clearly enjoyed his Harry Potter debut. "Doing this film at Leavesden Studios felt like coming home. The team were certainly off to a good start before they had even begun to write the script," said Yates. 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' has its official world premiere in London on July 3. Rowling's seventh and last book in the series, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows', is due out on July
