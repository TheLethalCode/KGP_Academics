 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain Sunday said party leaders and workers want reforms to the party to put an end to dynastic leadership. "Reforms are not designed to get rid of any person. The key purpose of our reform proposal is to ensure democratic practice in the party, decentralise power and bring an end to dynastic leadership," former whip Ashraf told reporters after a meeting with BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. Twelve leaders including former MP Abdul Alim, Nazir Hossain, Shahiduzzaman and Zahir Uddin Shwapan met Bhuiyan Sunday. "Work is on to complete a reform proposal," Ashraf said. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said Wednesday that the party would be reformed in line with the opinions of all leaders and workers. "Reforms will not be made be according to just a handful of people," the former prime minister said after visiting BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan at BIRDEM hospital. Abdul Alim Sunday expressed dissatisfaction over the remark. "We aren't few in number," Alim said. "All leaders and workers of the party want reforms." bdnews
