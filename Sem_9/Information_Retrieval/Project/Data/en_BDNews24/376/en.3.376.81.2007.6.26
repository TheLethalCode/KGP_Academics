<TITLE> BP, AB Foods, Dupont to make fuel from wheat in UK </TITLE>

 LONDON, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British oil major BP Plc, Associated British Foods Plc and US chemical company DuPont plan to build a new plant to make transport fuel from wheat in Hull, north-east England. The companies said on Tuesday they would invest 200 million pounds ($400 million) in the plant, which will produce around 420 million litres of ethanol annually from late 2009. BP and Du Pont will build an adjacent facility to produce and research biobutanol, an enhanced but currently highly expensive to manufacture biofuel. UK demand for biofuels will rise in coming years, driven by government rules that 5 percent of motor fuels must come from renewable sources by 2010. BP's head of refining, Iain Conn, said such government incentives meant the project would be profitable at oil prices of $40 per barrel and even more so at today's level of around $70 per barrel. "Biofuels represent a real and material opportunity," he told a press conference in London, expressing a view that some of BP's rivals including Exxon Mobil do not share. The head of ABF's British Sugar unit, Mark Carr, said the ethanol manufactured would produce over 40 percent less carbon dioxide than gasoline, even when the energy used in the production of ethanol is taken into account. Biofuels have been criticised for driving up food prices for the world's poor, but Carr said that if the European Union stopped paying farmers to leave land idle, enough extra grain to supply two to three such plants could be produced in the UK. Until now, BP focussed its biofuel efforts on "second generation" biofuels, which use non-food crops such as straw as feedstock. This technology means less land is needed to produce the fuel, thus reducing the need to divert land use from food production. The higher efficiency associated with second generation production techniques is also expected to offer greater CO2 reduction over current generation biofuels. Phil New said the Hull investment reflected the fact that second generation fuels were unlikely to be widely adopted before 2015 due to the technological advances still required. The partners hope the facility can later be converted to produce biobutanol from non-food sources. Biobutanol has a higher energy content than ethanol, allowing more miles per gallon, although its performance still falls short of gasoline. Norway's Aker Kvaerner will lead engineering and design work on the Hull project, while India's Praj Industries will provide the technology expertise. ABF and BP will each have a 45 percent stake in the ethanol plant, while DuPont will own 10 perce
