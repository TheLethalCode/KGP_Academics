<TITLE> ALCWC will iron out reform plan: Hasina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina Saturday said discussion was the best way to bring changes to the party and all reform proposals would be placed before the party's central working committee (ALCWC). If all proposals came to her, it means that everybody is accepting her "single leadership", the former prime minister said. She, however, said a quarter was trying to plot against the party but they were ready to face any hurdle. "The Awami League is a democratic party. Every contentious issue will come to the party forum. Everybody (inside the party) will take the outcome of the discussion into account," Hasina told reporters, as she along with senior party colleagues visited Bangabandhu Memorial Museum to commemorate the party's 58th founding anniversary. "I wanted elections in June. We had failed to reach a consensus. So it didn't proceed further," she said, adding that all issues will be settled in the party's working committee meeting. Hasina along with Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury and Mukul Bose went to Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in the city's Dhanmondi area at 8:25am. Later, Hasina held a meeting with party colleagues for one and a half hours after the leaders placed wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman outside the museum premises. Amu recently led some of the influential presidium members of the party to take a dig at the party chief for what they said had brought misfortune to the party. They accused Hasina of ignoring the highest decision-making body, the party presidium, to take some vital party decisions in the past, saying they want an end to such practice to "re-establish democracy" in the party. The stand triggered confusion among the activists, but Saturday's meeting with the so-called party renegades has apparently paired down the confrontation. The leaders' call for reforms within the party became visible after Hasina recently took a stand apparently to give a lesson to those leaders, saying that all leaders above 60 years would be put to an advisory committee instead of major decision making bodies. She said: "When I talk about the 60-year age limit, it also includes me. I'm also stepping into 60. What if I don't want to be in politics anymore? Hasina said her party-led administration could bring peace and control the soaring prices of essentials. "Time has come to evaluate. The Awami League has ruled the country for only nine and a half years. Now it's possible to compare the Awami League's tenure with the rest in past 36 years after independence," she said. She said assaults on the Awami League were nothing new. "It's the people's party. It faces assaults because it stands for people. Still the party is facing a spate of conspiracy. But the Awami League will stand again on its own feet," she said. The AL chief criticised some party leaders, who accused Hasina of making some recent statements that brought "misfortune" to the party. "I said what I think was true and just. I must speak for people. Some will be happy, some not," Hasina said. "If truth hurts anybody, I've nothing to do. I can't pander to people. When I said I'll ratify the work of the government, an adviser asked who I am to do so?" "After that I've no responsibility. It won't bring any good just blaming me." Hasina explained her position on her party's election alliance with Bangladesh Khilafat Majlish, an Islamist party, before the four-party coalition government expired in October. "They came to us promising a secular policy. But now the deal doesn't exist." About the party's source of money, she said: "The Awami League doesn't need to demand money from anybody. The well-wishers give fund willingly, and that's the strength of the party." Meanwhile, Amu separately told reporters that they would make changes to bring good to the party. He repeated the statement of the party chief, saying the party forum would decide everything. The presidium member also tried to clear the confusion that he was not allowed to see his leader after he returned from Singapore. "Today, it's proved that I was not allowed (by the government/police) to see her," he said. bdnews24.com/
