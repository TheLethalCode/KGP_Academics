 WARSAW, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's president urged Poles on Tuesday to remember how Jewish history was entwined with their own as he launched work on a museum to celebrate the life of a community almost destroyed in the Nazi Holocaust. Poland has been trying to shake off an anti-Semitic reputation it sees as unfair and the new museum aims to commemorate the contribution Polish Jews made to its life and culture before World War Two. "For 900 years our histories mingled. There were better times and worse ones ... But the history of Jews is the history of my country, my people," said President Lech Kaczynski. "For us, the museum gives us a big chance: to fill gaps in our knowledge and to make peace." Most of Poland's three million Jews -- then the world's largest Jewish community -- were killed in the Holocaust. Thousands of survivors emigrated in 1968 after an anti-Semitic campaign by the then-ruling communists. The new museum is built in the heart of Warsaw's pre-war Jewish district and just opposite the Ghetto Uprising Memorial, but it will not focus on the war. "This will not be another Holocaust museum," said Marian Turski, president of the Association of the Jewish Historical Institute in Poland and one of the originators of the idea for the museum. "It will be a museum of life." The president and the prime minister, his twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are strongly pro-U.S. conservatives and supporters of Israel, but they have been accused of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic attitudes in their own coalition. When the museum opens in two years, Polish and Jewish leaders hope it will become a centre of dialogue. The government has donated land and gave almost half the $65 million cost. Galleries will reconstruct Jewish neighbourhoods as they were in Poland and depict individual life stories collected from Polish Jews now spread around the world. The museum will also address topics that could be more uncomfortable for Poles -- such as the fight of the Jewish community for equal rights and against segregation. "Haven't we done enough already?" said one neighbour who was critical of the museum and did not want to be named. "We always talk about supporting Jewish issues, but we forget our own." Relations between Jews and other Poles took a turn for the better in 1989 when Poland overthrew communism. The Jewish community in Poland is currently estimated at anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 and is growing. Anti-Semitic attacks in Poland in recent years have won widespread attention, but some Jewish leaders say the situation is better than in parts of western Euro
