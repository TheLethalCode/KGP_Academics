 KOLKATA, India, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maoist insurgents blew up a railway station and disrupted public transport across several Indian states on Wednesday, on the second day of a strike that highlighted their growing strength and national coordination. The insurgents used powerful explosives to blow up Biramdih railway station in a pre-dawn attack in the eastern state of West Bengal, disrupting links with many parts of east and south India, officials said. "Dozens of Maoist rebels tied up all the railway employees and just blew the station and torched whatever was left of it before melting into darkness," said Mahabir Pyne, a local resident. Maoists called the two-day strike in their strongholds of east and central India to protest against special economic zones (SEZs), low-tax enclaves created to boost industrial growth that have sparked protests from farmers who will lose their land. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, rebels called out employees of a coffee extracting plant from work near the port city of Vishakhapatnam, an SEZ location, and blew it up. Authorities in many mineral-rich regions of south, east and central India suspended public transport. Shops were shut in rural areas and mining operations in the eastern state of Jharkhand and the central state of Chhattisgarh were suspended. On Tuesday, a goods train engine was blown up and another set ablaze in Jharkhand. Rebels also set ablaze five trucks transporting minerals in the state. Security analysts said the rebels have cleverly hooked onto an issue -- the seizure of land for SEZs -- that has angered many poor Indians. In March, at least 14 villagers were killed in police clashes with protesters in West Bengal, where the state government planned to set up a chemical hub on farmers' lands. It galvanised popular opposition to SEZs across India. At the same time the insurgents, who say they are fighting for rights of poor peasants and landless labourers, showed their growing punch in India's economically important mining regions. "This is the first-ever coordinated lethal action by the Maoists over a very wide area," said Ajai Sahni of the New Delhi-based Institute of Conflict Management. "It shows their dramatic shift of strategy from isolated hit-and-run attacks to a systematic and planned terrorist act." "This (SEZ) issue has been given to them on a platter and many foreign investors we spoke to recently said they were told by the governments in India that the Maoist issue won't be a problem," Sahni added. Thousands of people in India have been killed since the Maoists began their insurgency in the late 196
