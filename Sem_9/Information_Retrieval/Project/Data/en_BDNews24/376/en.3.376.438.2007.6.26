 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh were trailing by 485 runs at stumps in the second innings after Sri Lanka declared their first innings at 577 for 6 with four of their batsmen cracking centuries on the second day of the first Test at Sinhalese Sports Club ground, Colombo Tuesday. Bangladesh were 3 for no loss when the bails were drawn with Javed Omar on 3 and Shariar Nafees on 0. Opener Michael Vandort, skipper Mahela Jayawardene, wicketkeeper-batsman Prasanna Jayawardene and bowling allrounder Chaminda Vaas all joined the run fest to give the hosts a 488-run lead. Vaas cut Mohammad Rafique to point for two to reach his maiden Test hundred in his 98th Test after Jayawardene also smashed his maiden Test century to follow in the footsteps of Jayawardene and Vandort. Vaas and Jayawardene put on 223 runs for the unbroken seventh wicket to take their side to the highest total against Bangladesh, eclipsing previous best of 555 for five declared at the same venue back in 2001. Jayawardene remained unbeaten on 120 off 191 balls featuring 11 fours while Vaas scored 100 off 169 balls with the help of seven fours. The 30-year old Lankan captain, who retired hurt with a calf strain on 93 Monday, returned to complete his 17th Test hundred with a lofted boundary. He smashed 18 fours and one six before ending his 159-ball 127-run innings, giving a catch to Saqib Al Hasan off Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. He became Sri Lanka's second-highest run scorer after Sanath Jayasuriya. Rafique gave the first breakthrough on the second day removing Vandort, who gave an easy catch to Shahriar Nafees at forward short leg to leave the side at 304 for four. The left-handed opener, who resumed with overnight 87, hit 117 to reach his third Test hundred in seven matches, smashing three sixes and nine fours in 189 balls. He also put on 117 runs for the fourth wicket with Dilshan who was dismissed just before the lunch, run out for 79 by Mashrafee after Jayawardene declined his call for a second run. Dilshan hit eight fours and a six in his 101-ball knock. Sri Lanka resumed the day on 227 for three and added another 350 runs losing three wickets in three sessions except three overs Bangladesh played on the second day. bdnew
