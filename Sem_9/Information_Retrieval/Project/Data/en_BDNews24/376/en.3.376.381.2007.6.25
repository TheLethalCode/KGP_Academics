<TITLE> Early election may be too risky for UK's Brown </TITLE>

 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's next prime minister, Gordon Brown, has kindled speculation that he may call an early general election after he takes over from Tony Blair, but analysts say it would be a risky strategy. Brown became leader of the ruling Labour Party on Sunday and will take over as prime minister when Blair steps down on Wednesday after 10 years in power. Brown's appointment on Sunday of Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander as general election coordinator led to speculation that Brown might try to cement his leadership by calling an election much sooner than the expected 2009 date. The mass circulation Sun newspaper said Brown would call a general election within a year. It said the most likely date was June next year, but Brown could call a snap poll in 2007. Legislators and analysts were sceptical that Brown, renowned for his caution, would risk rushing to the polls. "I think an election before 2009 is very improbable," said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University. "I doubt Gordon Brown, having longed to be prime minister for 10 years, would likely risk his office." It was risky for a prime minister to call an early election unless he had a large and enduring lead in the polls, he said. Labour comfortable won a third successive election victory in 2005 and Brown has until May 2010 to call another. An aide to Brown declined to comment on the election speculation while Harriet Harman, newly elected as deputy Labour leader, also called the election talk "just speculation". Brown won the Labour leadership without a vote by party rank-and-file and that automatically makes him prime minister. He is sure to face taunts from opposition parties that he lacks an electoral mandate. RISKY BUSINESS Brown's Labour Party, worn down by 10 years in power and undermined by the unpopular Iraq war, has been trailing in the polls to the resurgent opposition Conservatives. However, Brown's promotion has given Labour a boost and one weekend poll showed it ahead of the Conservative Party. Labour Member of Parliament Ian Davidson said he believed Brown would wait until 2009 before calling an election, although he could bring it forward if he felt he need an endorsement for his strategy. "I think Gordon will want to demonstrate the leader he's going to be. If he called an immediate election the electorate wouldn't have had a chance to judge him in office," he said. Wyn Grant, politics professor at Warwick University, said an election as early as November or next February did not seem likely and an early election was "a very high-risk strategy". Brown is expected to implement a sweeping cabinet reshuffle after he takes power on Wednesday. Trade and Industry Secretary Alistair Darling looks certain to replace Brown as head of the Treasury while former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is favourite to be justice minister. David Miliband is tipped to stay in charge of the Environment Department -- taking on responsibility for energy -- or become foreign secretary, replacing Margaret Becke
