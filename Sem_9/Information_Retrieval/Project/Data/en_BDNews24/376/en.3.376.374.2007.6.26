 DAKAR, June 26 (Reuters) - US first lady Laura Bush began a four-nation tour of Africa in Senegal's capital Dakar on Tuesday, pledging Washington's support in improving education and combating AIDS on the world's poorest continent. The five-day trip, during which Bush will visit Mozambique, Zambia and Mali, comes a month after her husband President George W. Bush asked Congress to double the US financial commitment to fighting AIDS, particularly in Africa. After visiting a US-funded clinic in Dakar which provides outpatient treatment to people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, Bush headed to a Dakar primary school where she stressed the need for African governments to fund education. "Investment in education, no matter how significant, is always worth it," Bush, a former teacher and librarian, said in the sandy school courtyard under the shade of an almond tree. "By investing in education, governments meet their other fundamental obligations to improve opportunities for children and families, to strengthen their economies and to keep their citizens in good health," she said. The U.S. government Africa Education Initiative has trained 4,000 new teachers in Senegal since it began in 2002 and aims to train 900,000 across the continent by the end of the decade. In partnership with U.S. universities, it has also provided half a million new schoolbooks for children in Senegal alone, with another 800,000 to be delivered over the summer, Bush said. "The old textbooks dated back to 1979, before computers, before cell phones, before the Internet," she said. "The new books are up-to-date and students are eager to learn about the technologies that are transforming every day life in Senegal," she said, to applause from the crowd. World powers meeting at a G8 summit in Germany this month restated their commitment to double development aid to Africa but campaigners say they have fallen behind on earlier pledges and have promised little fresh cash. Included in the $60 billion pledged to fights AIDS and other diseases ravaging Africa was George W. Bush's plan to double Washington's anti-AIDS spending to $30 billion over five years. During her third African tour, Laura Bush will visit projects that have already benefited from the existing $15 billion President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), launched in 2003 to provide drugs to treat HIV patients. Washington's anti-AIDS policy has in the past been criticised by some in Africa for relying too heavily on preaching abstinence rather than favouring contraception. But Senegal, which has received more than $25 million in US funding to help keep HIV prevalence low, has been a relative success story. Just 0.7 percent of the population are estimated to be living with HIV, compared with more than one third in the southern African country of Botswana. More than 25 million people globally have died of AIDS, an incurable disease that ravages the body's immune system, since it was first recognised more than a quarter of a century ago. About 40 million live with HIV, most in sub-Saharan Africa, where the virus is spread primarily through heterosexual s
