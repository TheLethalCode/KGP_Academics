 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, Tuesday partnered with the Export Import Bank of Bangladesh Limited (Exim Bank) in its Global Trade Finance Programme. The IFC will finance Exim Bank with up to $5 million under the programme. This is the IFC's first funding to an Islamic bank in Bangladesh, said a statement of the WB Tuesday. The IFC Global Trade Finance Programme (GTFP) supports trade with emerging markets worldwide and promotes the flow of goods and services between developing countries. According to the deal, IFC will provide Exim Bank with risk coverage in a difficult market and a global network that will help its trade finance business to grow, the WB said. "In Bangladesh, where the Muslim population exceeds 88 percent, Islamic banking is expected to strengthen its foothold significantly in coming years. Better regulations and risk management tools are expected to gradually improve the operating environment for Islamic banks," said Paolo Martelli, IFC regional director for South Asia. Welcoming the partnership, Kazi Masihur Rahman, managing director of Exim Bank, said: "We're delighted to establish our relationship with IFC through its Global Trade Finance Programme." "IFC support will help us create new and valuable business opportunities for our clients in Bangladesh and around the world." Per Kjellerhaug, IFC country manager for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, said, "It is an important mechanism to get local banks into an active global network that facilitates transactions in challenging markets, promotes competitive financing, and builds correspondent bank relationships with new institutions on a low-risk basis," he said. Exim Bank was established in June 1999 representing industry and trade people in Bangladesh. Although it started as a conventional commercial bank, it converted to a full-fledged Islamic Sharia-based bank in July 2004. Currently, the bank has a total of 32 branches. bd
