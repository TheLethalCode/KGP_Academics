 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced former communications minister Anwar Hassain Manju to five years in jail in his absence on charges of possessing liquor illegally. Dhaka's assistant sessions judge Syed Zahed Mansur also fined Manju Tk10,000, and in case of failure in paying the amount he has to stay in jail for another six months. Manju, former chairman of the Jatiya Party (Manju), is currently abroad apparently to evade the arrest. On March 8, the joint forces seized 21 bottles of foreign liquor during a raid at Manju's Dhanmondi home. Later, Dhanmondi sub-inspector Mostak Hossain filed a case against Manju under the Narcotics Act. Manju, also the editor and publisher of the Bangla daily Ittefaq, recently announced that he would no more practice politics. Defence counsel Shamsul Kabir Tuesday appealed to the court for a stay of the delivery of the verdict, saying the state witnesses could not be cross-examined since their client is staying outside the country. But prosecutor Ehsanul Haque Shamaji argued against the appeal and demanded the verdict be announced as per schedule. On June 20, the judge set June 26 for delivering the verdict. The court testified seven witnesses to deliver the verdict. bdnews2
