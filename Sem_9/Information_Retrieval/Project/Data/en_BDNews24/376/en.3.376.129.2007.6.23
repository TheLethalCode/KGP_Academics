 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) Saturday demanded that the government approve the Consumer Rights Protection Ordinance 2007, drafted by Bangladesh Rifles. "Although there are consumer rights protection ordinances in many countries, there are no such rules in our country," CAB general secretary Kazi Faruq said at a news conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity. The government took an initiative in 1992 to draft a Consumer Rights Protection Act, which was subsequently approved in principle by Awami League and BNP governments. It was not until Jan 30 2006 that the amended draft of the Act was presented before the cabinet. It was then sent to the commerce ministry for further adjustments and scrutiny. A meeting on May 31 2006 between the commerce ministry and CAB concluded that the draft was fraught with errors. The trade and commerce-monitoring cell of BDR have since had another meeting with CAB in 2007, Kazi Faruq said. A second amended draft was prepared and forwarded to the commerce ministry, he said. The draft should go to the cabinet for final approval, according to Faruq. Faruq also raised concerns that an attempt has been made to approve the 2006 draft, in place of the new BDR one. "We strongly believe that consumers' rights will be impaired if this is done," he said. CAB treasurer Khalilur Rahman Shajal said there is no provision for penalties in the 2006 draft. In the 2007 draft, these provisions are diverse, clear and appropriate, he said. CAB president Borhan Ahmed added that the reason for ongoing price hikes is that there are no penalties for dishonest businessmen. bdnews24.
