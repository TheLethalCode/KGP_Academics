 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) - Let me indulge while I tell you a story. It's a story about the attention-grabbing engagement of Bianna Golodryaga, the smart, vivacious, stunningly beautiful financial correspondent of ABC News. A little over two weeks ago, the 31-year-old star coyly showed her engagement ring on Good Morning America. Predictably, the public announcement set off a media frenzy about who the lucky guy was. It was Bianna herself who told her colleagues on the show that his name was Peter Orszag. They first met at the White House Correspondents dinner in May. But it's not his high profile job or his stellar credentials, Binnan insists, that made her fall for him. It was his flawless pronunciation of her last name "that interested me in him", said the TV star. Bianna went on to say that she met very few people who could pronounce her last name "Golodryaga" correctly first time. To be sure, Oraszag himself is a big name in Washington. At 41, he's the youngest member of the Obama cabinet holding the crucial title of White House Budget Director. A product of Princeton and London School of Economics, he swiftly made his mark because of his brilliance holding important positions in the Clinton administration and well-known think tanks at a very early age. Before joining the Obama administration a year ago he served as the director of Congressional Budget Office, a bipartisan entity. Not surprisingly, the tabloid press and celebrity websites made a big splash of their engagement. But the story appeared to have faded after a few days - until, that is, The New York Post last week blared: "White House Budget Director Ditched Pregnant Girlfriend for ABC News Gal." Orszag's former girl friend, Claire Milonas, the 39-year-old venture capitalist and a product of Harvard and Yale, gave birth to his love child in November. The scoop raised many eyebrows not because of the love child but because of the timing. Many were asking whether Orszag told Bianna about the upcoming baby. (The engagement was announced late December and the baby girl was born in November). Inexplicably, Bianna has kept mum since the story broke. Although her reaction is not immediately known, the scoop has made things complicated for Orszag distracting him from his highly demanding job at a time when his full attention is required to fix the nation's ballooning budget deficit. Suddenly the "Orszag love-child story" became a full-term tabloid distraction in a White House otherwise preoccupied by matters like terrorist plots, health care costs and unemployment reports. Orszag alerted "the senior people in the West Wing" of the situation, said Kenneth Baer, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. (It turns out he also had a string of other affairs in between including with Katherine Weymouth, publisher of the Washington Post). Still, big questions kept coursing through the corridors of power, particularly this one: Did the Casanova with a calculator really "ditch" his pregnant girlfriend for a younger television news babe? Depends what your definition of "ditch" is  and, of course, whom you ask. People in Orszag's camp say he and Milonas had broken up well before he started seeing Bianna last spring; people close to Milonas say they are not so sure of the timing. Likewise, some in the Milonas camp suggest that Orszag had promised to marry her, but then met Golodryga; the Orszag people say that Milonas wanted to get married, but Peter did not, at least to Claire. Amid the this charge and countercharge, it is not clear what role, if any, Orszag will have in the future of his new daughter, Tatiana Zoe Milonas. He was not present for her Nov. 17 birth and has spent barely any time with her. Orszag lives in northwest Washington and shares custody of his two children from his first marriage, to Cameron Hamill. Both Milonas and Golodryga live in New York. In an apparent effort to put the matter at rest at least for now, both Orszag and Milonas made a brief statement: "We were in a committed relationship until the spring of 2009. In November, Claire gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Although we are no longer together, we are both thrilled she is happy and healthy, and we would hope that everyone would respect their privacy." But it is too early to predict whether the joint statement would shut the news media up. To be sure, another obvious  and recurring  question still lingers: whether someone whose personal life has become so complicated is really fit to tackle one of the most demanding, important and stressful jobs in the universe. "Frankly I don't see how Orszag can balance three families and the national budget," wrote Joel Achenbach of The Washington Post.
