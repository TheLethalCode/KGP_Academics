 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed renewed Friday his makeshift administration's pledge to hold the national elections before the end of the next year. "We want to hold the elections before the end of 2008," he told the Voice of America Radio in an interview that was also broadcast on private TV station ntv. "At the speed the reforms are going on it is possible to hold the elections before the end of 2008." He said there was no doubt that the ban on parlour politics should be lifted at the earliest. "If everything is okay, the ban on indoor politics will be lifted at a convenient time. But it doesn't seem that the ban has created any roadblock towards bringing reforms within the political parties," he said. On whether the EC would sit with political parties, he said: "The commission is discussing the reform issues with the civil society and others. It is up to the political parties if they would sit with the EC to discuss the issues. But the commission has showed interest to the parties to do so." The chief adviser said he understood that the EC would take steps to sit with the political parties to talk about electoral reforms. He believed the army would continue to back the government to hold a free, fair election. The interim leader termed the military very "professional" and said he believed the state's wing is contributing greatly in the government's efforts to deal with crucial national issues. "They are playing their role in curbing corruption, improving law and order," he said. "I think the army also believes in a free and fair election" within the government-announced roadmap, the chief adviser said. Fakhruddin praised the army for helping to avert a national "disaster" in mid-January ahead of the forestalled Jan. 22 elections. He said the chaos saddened him like any other citizen. "Like all I also was relieved with the changes in January," he said in reference to the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan. 11. He took the reins in Jan.12. The interim government supreme said "the roadmap towards the elections" would increasingly be clear in the near future. Fakhruddin said when he was approached for the top job he felt it was a great challenge but he took it as an opportunity to serve the nation. He continued: "The army is also helping the Election Commission in making an electoral roll with photographs. They are helping the government in other areas as well." "The army has always played their due role at the hour of need of the nation." He praised their role in dealing with this monsoon's mudslide disaster in Chittagong and in the UN-sponsored peacekeeping in troubled regions around the world. Fakhruddin detailed the steps his administration and the EC have taken to hold credible ballots by the deadline. He referred to the recent EC statement that they were likely to spell out a clear roadmap to elections sometime next month. The former central bank governor believed there has been considerable progress towards holding the elections before end of next year. Initially his government needed to complete some important tasks such as bringing changes to the EC through appointment of acceptable election officials, he said. The chief adviser said the recent government decision to separate the EC secretariat from the Prime Minister's Office (now Chief Adviser's Office) was a right step to change the system. Fakhruddin claimed the EC has already made substantial progress to fulfil the people's demand of an acceptable electoral roll and cited the ongoing pilot project on preparing a voter list with photographs. He echoed the EC decision on a final list with photographs would start from Rajshahi next month. On the government's effort to purge of corruption, the chief adviser said arrests of politicians and their trials are being conducted under conventional laws and in a transparent manner. The head of the government believed the Anticorruption Commission is now much stronger than it was ever before because of the changes after he took over. "It is now able to take tough action against corruption." He also touched upon economy, saying he hoped the economy would grow by 7 percent in the next fiscal year. Fakhruddin, who has a doctorate in economics from the Princeton University, said the economy fared well during the outgoing fiscal year despite months of political violence over electoral reforms. He hoped the country's target to halve poverty by 2015 was right on the track way to success. If the current reforms continue, if the impetus that his government has added to the economy is sustained and political stability is achieved, he said he was sanguine that the country will achieve remarkable development. On US-Bangladesh relations, he said it was "very friendly" with extensive cooperation in crucial areas of the two countries. "We are seeking duty-free access of our readymade garments. If we get that the US buyers will also benefit," he said. "We have scope of cooperation in different fields including counter-terrorism." He said he would attend the UN General Assembly session to inform the world of the success of his government in bringing reforms. Fakhruddin said once the election is over and his government transfer power to an elected government he would like to serve the country in the economic or social field. bdne
