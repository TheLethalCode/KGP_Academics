 BRUSSELS, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Incoming European Union president Portugal told Poland on Thursday not to even think of trying to reopen a deal clinched last week on a new treaty to reform the 27-nation bloc's institutions. "Questions to be reopened? None," Secretary of State for European Affairs Manuel Lobo Antunes told a news conference at which Lisbon outlined its priorities for its six-month presidency, which begins on July 1. It succeeds Germany. The negotiating mandate agreed early on Saturday at a summit chaired by German Chancellor Angela Merkel was the "clear, precise and detailed basis and exclusive framework for our work", he said. "We will be sticking strictly to the mandate we were given. I believe we will be able to do it quickly and efficiently." Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski seemed to question the summit deal this week when he said Warsaw won a mechanism enabling states just short of a blocking minority to delay EU decisions for up to two years once new voting rules enter fully into force in 2017. EU officials say the mandate provides for decisions to be postponed only until the next EU summit -- which are three or four months apart -- as originally laid down in 1994 what is known as the Ioannina Compromise. Kaczynski was quoted by the Nasz Dziennik daily on Monday as saying: "It (Ioannina) used to be about just putting off the decision for three months whereas now it is for two years." A senior Polish diplomatic source said on Thursday the Polish delegation appeared to have been misled. "In the negotiations, our sherpas agreed a two-year delay, but then the president and foreign minister signed the mandate at the Council meeting ... the question now is where have our two years gone?" the source said. The only possibility was for Poland to bring the issue up again in detailed treaty negotiations in the Inter-Governmental Conference, due to begin on July 23, although it realised that would not be welcomed by other countries, the source said. The prime minister's office, presidency and Foreign Ministry were not immediately available for comment. Lobo Antunes said it was essential to stick to "nothing else than the mandate" and avoid each delegation giving its own interpretation of the deal, otherwise things would unravel. Another unwritten aspect of the summit outcome became clearer on Thursday when a key European lawmaker said Poland and Spain could share up to 16 extra European Parliament seats. "Parliament did agree to come forward with an accelerated proposal by October and yes, on the basis of proportionality, we agreed to look at possibly dividing the extra seats between Poland and Spain," German Socialist Joe Leinen told Reuters. Leinen will have a big say in how the extra seats are shared out in 2009 as chairman of the EU legislature's constitutional affairs committee and author of the planned report on the redivision of seats among member stat
