 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)- The caretaker government has suspended deputy secretary Nasim Sultana Hossain whom joint forces had arrested earlier this year. The suspension order will come into effect from the day she was arrested, according to an establishment ministry circular issued Thursday. Joint forces arrested the then officer on special duty (OSD) on April 8 on charges of irregularities during her career. She was arrested under the Emergency Powers Ordinance 2007 and was later sent to jail. Sultana travelled to the UK taking one year's leave from August 20, 2000, which she later extended up to June 30, 2003. After the expiry of her leave instead of returning to Bangladesh she stayed on in the UK where she also took a British passport. During her stay in the UK she was promoted to deputy secretary on December 4, 2006. She accepted her promotion in Bangladesh from the UK by means of a substitute forging her signature. bdnews24.co
