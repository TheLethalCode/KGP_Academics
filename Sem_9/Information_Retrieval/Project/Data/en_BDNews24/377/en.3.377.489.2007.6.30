 TAIPEI, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan's ruling party will appeal a government committee's rejection of its referendum to let voters decide on how to apply for United Nations entry, which is opposed by China, a party spokesman said on Saturday. Within two weeks the party will appeal the opposition-dominated Referendum Review Committee's blockade of a referendum asking voters whether they want Taiwan to apply to the United Nations as "Taiwan" rather than under the island's legal name Republic of China, a party spokesman and local media said. Mainland China, Taiwan's archrival since the two sides split after civil war in 1949, has leveraged its diplomatic superiority to block Taiwan's reentry to the United Nations since Taiwan left the international organisation in 1971. China considers Taiwan is a breakaway province. The Democratic Progressive Party, which wants greater independence from Beijing authorities, says voter approval would help Taiwan's cause with 192 UN members, mostly China allies. "(Party Chairman) You Si-kun said the referendum to let Taiwan join the United Nations is the joint proposal of 90,000 people and represents (their) resolve and rights," the party said in a statement, referring to the number of signatures to qualify the referendum for an initial review. "But it suffered the committee's rejection," the statement said. "Regarding this, You feels regret." The main opposition Nationalist Party said the proposed referendum was the wrong way to apply for UN readmission.
