 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com) Awami League presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim is out on parole from jail to see his deceased mother. Achhiya Khatun, also elder sister of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, died of old-age complications at age 90 at ZH Sikder Medical College Hospital in Gulshan Thursday. Earlier, home secretary Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com that the government had decided to release Sheikh Selim, allowing him to join funeral rites for his mother. Selim's wife sent a letter to the home secretary, asking him to allow her husband to see his mother for the last time. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said Sheikh Selim had been freed on a government instruction. "He will be taken back to jail once the funeral rites are over," he said. Selim was arrested on May 29 in an anticorruption sweep by the military-backed government. He faces an extortion case. bdnews2
