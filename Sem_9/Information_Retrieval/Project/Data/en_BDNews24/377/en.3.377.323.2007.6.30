<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Third seed Andy Roddick kept the flag flying for the United States at Wimbledon on Friday with a 6-3 6-4 7-6 third round victory over Spain's Fernando Verdasco. The big-serving 24-year-old did not look under any pressure against Verdasco in the first two sets, rattling them off in 58 minutes but the world number 41 then upped his game. Verdasco broke Roddick in the third set on his way to a 4-1 lead and the American, who won the title at Queen's earlier this month, had to rely on his serve to get him out of trouble. Roddick broke back for 5-4 when Verdasco put a forehand volley out. The Spaniard then squandered two set points and crumpled in the tiebreak which Roddick won 7-2. Roddick's compatriot James Blake fared less well at the hands of another Spaniard, losing 3-6 6-3-6-3 7-6 to former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. The pair were the only Americans to make it through to the third round in the men's competition
