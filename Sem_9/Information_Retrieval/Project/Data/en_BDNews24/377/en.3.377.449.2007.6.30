<TITLE> Streisand welcomed ahead of first German concert </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany will welcome Barbra Streisand with open arms when she performs at Berlin's Waldbuehne arena on Saturday, her first appearance in the country after turning down several invitations in the past. German media have linked the Jewish star's refusal to sing there until now to the fact Germany was responsible for the Holocaust. Paul Spiegel, the late leader of Germany's Jewish community, made repeated appeals to Streisand to come, and, before his death last year, blamed her decision not to on the country's recent history. "Because her refusal to come before was blamed on the 'Third Reich', her appearance now is being hailed as a profound act of reconciliation," wrote Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. Other media praised Streisand's decision to appear, and, unlike in other countries on her tour of Europe, there has been hardly a murmur over record ticket prices of up to 500 euros. The 65-year-old singer declined to comment directly, when asked by Reuters about not performing in Germany before and her reasons for deciding to do so now. But she said in a statement: "Germany is a very different place than it was before World War Two. "Through understanding and education we can avoid the horrors of the past, whether it is the atrocities of the Holocaust, or Rwanda, or Darfur, or anywhere else in the world." Born in New York to Jewish American parents in 1942, according to online biographies, Streisand has never played outside North America except for London and Australia, a spokeswoman said. But her concert at the 18,000-seat Waldbuehne arena has a special significance in a country that spent over six decades coming to terms with the shame of its Nazi past. BIG REGRET Spiegel, late president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, was also one of post-war Germany's top talent agents. Before he died aged 68, he said one of his biggest regrets was his failure to get Streisand to Germany, even though he booked a long line of top international artists for shows here. "Barbra Streisand was the only one," Spiegel said, when asked if artists had reservations about Germany. "I would have loved to have her in Germany. In my eyes, she's simply the greatest entertainer. But she simply did not want to come." Spiegel said in the 2002 newspaper interview with Der Tagesspiegel he could understand her resistance. "But there's no way I can agree with it because Germany today is no longer the country it was in 1945. Nevertheless, one has to accept that there are people of Jewish faith forced to leave who refuse to set foot on German soil again," he said. Streisand is on a six-week, eight-city tour through Europe that began on June 18 in Zurich. The tour will finish in late July with three concerts in London. She is one of the best-selling female artists of all time with 50 gold, 30 platinum and 13 multi-platinum albu
