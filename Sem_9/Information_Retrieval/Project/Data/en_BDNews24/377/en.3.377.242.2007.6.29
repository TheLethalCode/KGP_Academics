 PRISTINA, Serbia, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO on Friday asked Kosovo Albanians to give Western powers more time to steer their independence from Serbia through the United Nations, but admitted the project was in trouble. "We all know the process ... in the U.N. Security Council is facing difficulties," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told reporters after talks in Kosovo. "Please show restraint and patience. Give the process some more time," he said following a meeting with Kosovo Albanian prime minister Agim Ceku. But referring to the diplomatic deadlock created by Russia's rejection of independence, in support of its ally Serbia, de Hoop Scheffer also warned that "unnecessary delay is not advisable". Ceku said he was "worried about the loss of credibility in the international process because of continued delay". NATO powers with troops in Kosovo are increasingly concerned at the prospect of a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian majority if Russia continues to block Western plans for its secession. Complaining of a "crisis of trust", Kosovo leaders have threatened to go it alone, a move diplomats say would split the 27-member European Union and undermine its plan to take over supervision of Kosovo from the United Nations. SATURDAY PROTEST RALLY "Nobody will gain anything from any unforeseen developments," the NATO chief said earlier after a meeting of NATO's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in Ohrid, Macedonia. NATO leads 16,000 troops in the territory, down from 50,000 deployed in 1999 after an 11-week bombing campaign to drive out Serbian forces. Western powers had promised 'supervised independence' for Kosovo by mid-year, having twice delayed in 2006 to limit the expected fallout in Serbia. But Russia has threatened to veto a draft U.N. resolution, testing the resolve of the West and raising fears of unrest. The latest draft UN resolution offers another 120 days of talks between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians, on top of 13 months of direct dialogue that ended in stalemate in March. Kosovo Albanian hardliners are due to stage protests in the capital, Pristina, on Saturday, calling for a referendum on independence and the withdrawal of the U.N. mission that has run the impoverished territory since 1999. De Hoop Scheffer called for "calm and restraint." Serbia opposes independence for Kosovo, cherished by many Serbs as their spiritual heartland. It insists on maintaining its existing borders but has no proposals for incorporating two million unwilling ethnic Albanians in Serbian society. Serbia lost control of the province under NATO air strikes which ended the 1998-99 war against Albanian separatist guerrillas, in which 800,000 Albanians were expelled. Independent estimates put the civilian death toll at between 7,500 and 12,000, mostly Albania
