<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh lost their last five wickets in only 4.4 overs in the morning on the fourth day to predictably concede the first Test to Sri Lanka by an innings and 234 runs at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground, Colombo, Thursday. The Tigers went off with their tails between their legs in just 30 minutes in the face of vicious spells from paceman Lasith Malinga and spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan, who claimed a match haul of nine for 102. It was a reversal that has become chronic with the Tigers after their top order had resisted bravely on the third day. Resuming the day on 233 for five, Bangladesh added only 21 runs before their second innings folded at 254 all out in 87.1 overs. The newest Test nation lost their way after surviving nine balls in the day's 28 balls to be bowled as a Malinga yorker caught overnight batsman Khaled Mashud (1) late and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (9) was trapped lbw by a Muralitharan doosra in the successive overs. In the next over, Malinga had Saqib Al Hasan (8) caught by Malinda Warnapura at short cover and sent the stumps of Mohammad Rafique (0) for a walk with a slower yorker to reduce the visitors to 253 for nine. Muralitharan sealed the fate of the match when he had Shahadat Hossain (1) caught by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene, with the tourists losing their last seven wickets for just 27 runs. It was 27th innings defeat for Bangladesh in 47 Test matches and fifth against Sri Lanka in eight Tests. Also, this was also biggest victory for the Lankan against Bangladesh, whose previous heaviest loss was by an innings and 196 runs at P. Saravanamattu Stadium back in 2002. Among eight Tests against the emerald island nation, Bangladesh lost four matches inside three days and the remaining four with a day to spare. Man of the match Muralitharan, who finished the second innings with 4 for 87 to go with his 5 for 15 in the first innings, has now 59 wickets in seven Test against Bangladesh. He is 25 wickets away from catching Australian legend Shane Warne's world record haul of 708 wickets. Lasith Malinga finished with four for 80 in 17 overs. The second of three-match Test series starts on July 3 at P. Saravanamuttu Stadium in the Sri Lankan capital. bd
