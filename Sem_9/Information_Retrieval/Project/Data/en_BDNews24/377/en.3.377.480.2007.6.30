 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel) has finally entered in Pakistan by overtrumping Britain's Vodafone Group and Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Company (MTC) in its pursuit to acquire stake in Pakistan's Warid Telecom. SingTel is now paying about $758 million for 30 percent share in Warid and the purchase "will be satisfied through SingTel's internal and external sources of funds," said an announcement. This deal has ended a prolonged speculation about Warid's probable offshore partner. It also gives Warid an enterprise value of $2.9 billion. The 30 percent holding will consist of new and existing shares, in equal proportions, SingTel said. The United Arab Emirates' education minister Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan's Abu Dhabi Group owns Warid. Sheikh Nahayan and SingTel's group CEO Chua Sock Koong signed the deal in Abu Dhabi Thursday. "Our partnership with SingTel marks a new milestone in the development of our company," said Sheikh Nahayan in a statement. Launched in 2005 Warid has bagged 9.7 million customers, representing an estimated 16.6 percent market share and making it the third largest mobile operator in Pakistan. Group CEO Chua Sock Koong has good reasons to boast of her company's further expansion in the region's fast growing mobile phone markets. "SingTel has made substantial investments in markets with high growth potential in South Asia, such as India and Bangladesh." She finds "strong upside" in terms of Warid's performance and praised it for "turning EBITDA-positive in only 17 months after its commercial launch" in Pakistan. Warid deal has another motivation for SingTel management. In 2006 SingTel failed to secure 26 percent stake in Pakistan's state-owned carrier PTCL. Its $1.167 billion bid was dwarfed by $2.599 billion over-inflated bid from nearest rival UAE's state-run carrier Etisalat. Pervez Musharraf's jubilance for this multibillion dollars telecoms privatisation deal soon evaporated when Etisalat failed to pay. Islamabad deviated and revised the deal in a desperate face saving bid as well as to preserve Islamic empathy. SingTel has finally succeeded to enter in Pakistan by investing in Warid that also strengthens its leadership in the Asia Pacific mobile market. SingTel owns 21.4 percent in Thailand's Advance Info Service, 30.5 percent in Bharti of India, 44.5 percent in The Philippines' Globe Telecom and 35 percent in Telkomsel of Indonesia. Pacific Bangladesh Telecom Ltd is the only non-GSM mobile phone venture where SingTel's has acquired 45 percent share of this struggling CDMA outfit. bdn
