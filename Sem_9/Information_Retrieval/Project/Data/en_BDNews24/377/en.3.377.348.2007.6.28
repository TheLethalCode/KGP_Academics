<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Abahani Limited came from behind to defeat their Chittagong namesake 2-1 in the second-leg encounter of the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. The outcome helped them take a solo lead in the 11-team point table with 29 points from 14 outings, two points ahead of the jointly second-placed Muktijoddha Sangsad KS and Sheikh Russel KC, who played one match more than the leaders. Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club are in the third position with 26 from 14 matches. Chittagong Abahani Limited has 11 points from 15 matches to stick to the second position from the bottom. The visitors, Chittagong Abahani, fought equally in the first half and snatched the first-half lead with a counter-attack in the 44th minute. The port city's captain Khokon Das fired home with a grounder capitalising a left-side minus by Nepalese striker Santosh Shahukhal after Samuel Tamba Goi dummy shot on the Shantosh minus confused Abahani defender Prodeep Pordar. Both sides, however, survived from conceding early goals when their defenders made the goalline save to rescue the respective sides. After the lemon break, the popular sky-blues outfit of Dhaka mounted heavy pressure on the opponents amid drizzles having little control on the ball and the all Chittagong Abahani players were busy foiling the attacks of their Dhaka namesake. However, Dhaka Abahani finally found the equaliser in the 58th minute as striker Jahid Hasan Amili, who struck a hat-trick in the previous match, found the back of the net with a diving header following an Obi Mikel John shot outside the box. Afterwards, Abahani played a plenty of miss passes and their striker Awudu Ibrahim and winger Mehdi Hasan Ujjal missed the target inside the box. Midfielder Pranotosh struck the decider three minutes from time with a superb combination with playmaker Abul Hossain.
