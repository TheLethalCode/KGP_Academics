 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)  Self-styled 'reformists' among Awami League leaders are indecisive about the so-called reform proposals. Who will make and present the proposals and when are anybody's guess. Senior leaders Abdur Razzak, Mukul Bose and KM Jahangir Hossain met at Prof Abu Sayeed's home Saturday for a 40-minute parley. Razzak hastily came out of the house only to say to reporters: "Talk to Mukul. I don't know anything". He left by rickshaw. Soon after, Mukul Bose came out. "Reform proposals are on the final stages. They might be out any day." He said he had talked to party colleague Amir Hossain Amuapparently by phone. Mukul said Razzak would submit the proposals. "It's not going to be too long," he said. Before the meeting at Sayeed's home, Mukul told reporters: "We have almost finalised the reform proposals after discussions with party leaders. The proposals have been sent to the presidium." On how the proposals will be submitted, Mukul said: "They will be submitted both formally and informallyinformally through the media and, in line with democracy, formally to the council through the executive committee." "We have talked to Amir Hossain Amu. We are trying hard to get him back to the country. He has been requested to return urgently. But it's his ailing wife, you know. If he cannot return, we will discuss and decide who would present the reform proposals," Mukul said. Asked how many points are to be in the proposals, he said: "The points are not finalised yet. Many things are being altered and many added. The leaders will decide the number of proposals." Sayeed said more discussion is a must. "The date for proposal submission is not fixed yet." He could not specify the number of proposals either, but said the party's structure should change. "Joint leadership means everyone is equal but one will be selected to lead the way in consultation with others," Sayeed said. bdnews24.com/
