<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com) Communications adviser MA Matin Thursday said the Election Commission could sit for discussion with political parties on issues of national importance, despite the ban on politics. Talking to reporters in his office, the adviser said, "People are engaging in political discussions at home in spite of the state of emergency. The government, therefore, should not object to the EC's holding discussions with the political parties." Reiterating that the caretaker government's chief aim was to create and nurture an environment conducive to holding a free and fair elections, Matin said, "Everyone concerned has to keep that in mind and work towards achieving this goal, and then, everything will be fine." A meeting held in the morning at the ministry just before the press briefing reviewed the progress of the development projects undertaken by the communications ministry as per the ADP for the 2006-07 fiscal year, ministry sources said. The current fiscal saw a total 186 projects being implemented, of which, 28 were foreign funded. Out of the total fund allocation of Tk 2,944 crore 74 lakh, Tk 2,172 crore 61 lakh was from the government exchequer and Tk 772 crore 13 lakh, from external resources. Of the total expenditure of Tk 1,651 crore 34 lakh, Tk 1,212 crore 75 lakh was from the government exchequer and Tk 438 crore 59 lakh, from the foreign grants. Following the end of the meeting the adviser said, "The meeting also discussed projects progressing at intervals or not progressing at all for the past 6-7 years simply due to non-allocation of funds." "We have decided to implement such projects on a priority basis now." Expressing dissatisfaction over the current fiscal budget allocations for the communications sector, Matin said, "The allocations seem so inadequate that we'll have to request for fresh allocations every time a new project is undertaken." Enhancing sector allocations would save time and communications, he said. bdnews24.com/
