<TITLE> BGMEA Bhaban to be demolished: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  The 15-storey BGMEA Bhaban will be demolished as will be the case with Rangs Bhaban, built without the approval of city planner Rajuk, an adviser said Thursday. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said, "No RAJUK approval was taken for the BGMEA Bhaban in the Hatirjheel coordinated development project area in the capital." The adviser made the revelation following an inter-ministerial meeting on the project at the conference room of the Local Government Division. He said that the government had asked the Department of Public Works to look into the project. "I cannot say why such a building was constructed without RAJUK approval. You had better ask the officials of the Public Works Department," he told reporters. On the Hatirjheel project, Anwarul said, "It was supposed to cover 302 acres of land. About 400 structures would have to be demolished. It is now being contemplated to implement the project on 250 acres so that so many structures are not demolished." However, Anwarul said that some 150 structures would still have to be knocked down. "I know that the BGMEA building has been constructed without approval of RAJUK. It is regrettable, "acting secretary of the ministry ASM Rashidul Hye said. "The law is equal for all. It would now be looked into as to how such a big building was constructed and nobody noticed the irregularities." He said that any neglect by RAJUK would be seriously dealt with. The government has made available Tk 200 crore for the Hatirjheel project, with Tk 150 crore in a loan from Japan, Hye said. Environmentalist Prof Abdullah Abu Sayeed present at the inter-ministerial meeting said, "As the building was constructed illegally encroaching upon the jheel, the Water Bodies Act has been violated. "Hatirjheel is very important for water drainage system in capital Dhaka." He said that environmentalists had moved against construction of the building, but without much success. A Rajuk official preferring anonymity said that unauthorised development work on Begunbari canal continues in violation of laws. The past BNP-led government leased three big plots in the area along Begunbari canal to the Millennium Holdings Limited, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association and the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The area was dubbed 'flood-flow zone' in the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan. The plots on the prime public land under the disposal of the Bangladesh Railway were leased out at the fag end of the BNP-led government tenure at token prices, a Rajuk official said. The building plan for the BGMEA headquarters did not have clearance from the Rajuk, the Rajuk official said. He said that the BGMEA was asked to pay Tk 12.5-lakh as fine for not taking approval, but the amount was not paid. 'We have recently written a letter to the association to open the water channel on both sides of the building properly and to construct an open bridge in front of it, but we are yet to get any response,' Rajuk chairman KAM Harun, said. The Rajuk chairman said that they would demolish structures on the leased plots as the government had asked the Bangladesh Railway to do so. Rajuk will soon demarcate the canal, he added. 'We will take steps to demarcate the canal after getting approval of the proposed Begunbari development project,' he said. BGMEA chief FM Fazlul Haque denied the allegation of not taking permission to construct the building. Rizwana Siddiqui, executive director of Bangladesh Environmentalist Lawyers' Association, slammed the government for giving permission to BGMEA to build the building. She came down hard on the BGMEA too, saying it did not show any sort of responsibility. She blamed the real estate businessmen for doing business irresponsibly. "They (real estate businessmen) did some tasks horrible for the environment," she said. Professor Mujibur Rahman, who led a BUET team that carried out a study on Begunbari canal for Rajuk, said BGMEA Bhaban, Sonargaon Hotel and the proposed FBCCI and BTMA buildings did not abide by specifications. 'These structures will block the drainage of many large areas including Panthapath, Tejgaon, Rampura, Badda, Eskaton, Moghbazar and Gulshan,' he said. The total land behind the hotel and Hatirjheel has to be used as wetland for drainage in the rainy season, and any structures on it will be disastrous for surrounding areas, said Mujib. Urban experts, academicians and environmentalists earlier suggested demarcation of the canal and Hatirjheel and asked the government to demolish all illegal structures. They also demanded excavation of the portion of Begunbari and Hatirjheel. bdnews24.com
