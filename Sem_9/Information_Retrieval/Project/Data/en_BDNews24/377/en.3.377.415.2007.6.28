 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone plans to roll out an ambitious WiMax project to conquer a new frontfixed wireless broadband access to Internet. But the planned move has caused ire among internet service providers (ISP) who dubbed the latest GP adventure as disruptive and against fair competition. Its management is tight-lipped about the high-speed wireless network strategy to comprehensively hold sway over the broadband market. The dominant cellphone provider that commands 62 percent market share is also the largest ISP thanks to its 2.3 million GPRS and EDGE mobile internet users. But the services are hamstrung by bandwidth constraints. High-speed packet access or HSPA solution using 3G technology is the logical migration path for GP to ease the crisis. But the issue of 3G licence has not even made it to the government's drawing board. GP detoured and asked leading vendors to propose a pilot WiMax project in 3.5 gigahertz band initially for Dhaka. WiMax is suitable for broadband wireless access at megabits speed in countries like Bangladesh with negligible wired infrastructure. GP may have the nationwide optical fibre backbone it has leased from railway, but it lacks radio frequency in 3.5 gigahertz band for WiMax. Is GP considering strategic alliance or will it acquire an ISP instead? This is the best-kept secret of Erik Aas. "I am sorry, we are not able to comment on potential future marketing plans," the Grameenphone chief executive told bdnews24.com. But the ISPs have sharply reacted to the WiMax initiative. "Grameenphone or any mobile operator launching fixed broadband service will disrupt the level playing field," said ISP Association's secretary general Russell T. Ahmed. Voice is the mobile operators' core business while data is the ISPs' major product. "GP will hit us below the belt if it makes fixed WiMax broadband a value-added service," Ahmed said. He said the ISPs pay 40 percent import duty on every wireless device whereas it is only Tk.400 for a mobile phone. The ISPs pay thousands of taka in annual charges to telecoms regulators BTRC for each customer's gadgets but the mobile phone operators pay nothing for handsets. "The ISPs will get broke if the mobile providers are allowed into fixed broadband territory," said Ahmed, also chief executive of Global Online. He demanded the ISPs be "similarly allowed" to offer voice service as a value-added service. "Otherwise competition, transparency and fairness remain as mere rhetoric," said the ISP Association's leader. bdn
