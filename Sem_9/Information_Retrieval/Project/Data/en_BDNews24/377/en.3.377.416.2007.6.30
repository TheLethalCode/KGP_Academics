 TOKYO, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's defence minister said on Saturday the 1945 atomic bombings on the country by the United States "couldn't be helped" as they led to the end of World War Two, Kyodo news agency reported. Government officials in Japan -- the only nation to suffer an atomic bombing -- typically express sympathy for the victims, but avoid criticising the attacks out of consideration for Tokyo's ties with Washington, its closest security ally. However, Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma went further in discussing the bombing. "My understanding is that it ended the war and that it couldn't be helped. I don't intend to despise the United States for it," he said in a speech near Tokyo, Kyodo said. "When it was dropped on Nagasaki, it was a tragedy," he was also quoted as saying. Kyuma, 66, said he does wonder why the United States had to use the bombs when its victory against Japan was evident, but added that Washington may have used them to try to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the war against Japan. Japan has been criticised for stressing its status as victim because of the atomic bombings and failing to acknowledge its own war atrocities. Kyuma, whose electoral district includes Nagasaki, is known for his outspokenness, and he has angered Washington with a string of comments after assuming his post last September. The ruling party lawmaker has said the United States was wrong to start the war in Iraq and has criticised Washington for not having a post-war strategy.
