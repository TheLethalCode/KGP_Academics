<TITLE> AL reformists to table plan shortly: Mukul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The so-called reformists of the Awami League are likely to table their proposals to bring changes to the party "very shortly" after missing some unsubstantiated deadlines, a party leader said Friday. Mukul Bose, the acting general secretary, said they have prepared and submitted the plan to presidium member Abdur Razzak, known as one of the key campaigners of the so-called reforms. "The proposal has been forwarded to Abdur Razzak," Mukul told reporters while leaving the Banani home of senior party leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. He was there to console the family of Selim whose mother died Thursday and was buried Friday. Mukul, also a party joint general secretary, said the proposals would be placed after Razzak is through with his discussions on the makeshift plan with influential presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta. The leaders recently accused party chief Sheikh Hasina of authoritarian leadership and made a spate of diatribes at her, signalling that they want to drastically curb her powers in running the 58-year old party. Mukul, however, would not say when the proposals would be placed and where since both Amu and Hasina earlier had said that the final decision on the reforms would come through the Awami League Central Working Committee meeting. Media reports recently said the so-called reformists could follow the suit of BNP reformists who earlier this week broke their reform plan at a news conference, proposing drastic curbs on the party chief Khaleda Zia's powers. On what major issues have been put into the proposed plan, Mukul said: "Issues like promotion of democratic practices through joint leadership and financial transparency are the prominent features of the proposal." On whether the proposals recommend exclusion of Hasina from the party, Mukul said: "I can't tell you anything about keeping or excluding her." He refused to elaborate. On whether they have put any condition to curb Hasina's power, Mukul said: "No, no such conditions are there in the proposals." BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Monday placed a 15-point reform proposal, envisaging a huge curb on the party chief's powers. Khaleda "welcomed" the plan but said it must be placed before the party's council meeting for a final decision. bdnews24.com/sum/r
