 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)-- Former health minister and Awami League presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim's mother Achhiya Khatun died Thursday at age 90. She had been suffering from old-age complications. Achhiya, the elder sister of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and aunt of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is survived by three daughters and two sons. She died at ZH Shikder Medical College Hospital in Gulshan, at a time when Sheikh Selim is in jail. "Bangabandhu's elder sister Achhiya Khatun died," AL presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury told reporters, coming out of hospital shortly after 1.00pm. Sajeda said she died at 12.45pm. AL president Sheikh Hasina rushed to the hospital at 12.15pm as the condition of Achhiya deteriorated. "We will wait for a reply from the home secretary to an appeal for brief release of Sheikh Selim on parole," Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapash, Sheikh Selim's nephew, told reporters. Selim's wife sent a letter to the home secretary asking him to allow her husband to see his mother for the last time, Tapash said. bdnew
