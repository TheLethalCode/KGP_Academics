 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Open University (BOU) Friday unveiled a Tk 58 crore budget for the fiscal 2007-2008, officials said. The University Grants Commission (UGC) will make available Tk 19.20 crore or 33.28 percent in government grant while and the university will mobilise Tk 38.50 crore or 66.72 percent from its own sources. The budget came amid an end to a two-year bickering with university watchdog UGC that froze its grants on the university's failure to come up with back-up documents on its expenditure. BOU vice-chancellor Professor M Farid Ahmed said bickering with the regulatory body was over. "The UGC did not make available the allocation for two years for the university's failure in submitting necessary papers on expenditure," Ahmed told bdnews24.com by phone late Friday. "We are bound to provide all necessary information to the government since we deal with public money. But there was a lack of understanding between the BOU and the UGC," he said. "But that's over." A total of Tk 50.96 crore has been allocated for the revenue expenditure while Tk 6.73 crore for development expenditure under the revenue head, said a statement of the Press Information Department. Some 65.90 percent of the budget will be spent on academic purposes while 34.10 percent will go to co-academic and administrative sector, it said. BOU treasurer AKM Rohul Amin Akanda placed the budget at the 92nd meeting of the Board of Governors held on Thursday with the VC in the chair. The meeting also approved the revised budget of Tk 56.20 crore for the fiscal 2006-2007. bdnews
