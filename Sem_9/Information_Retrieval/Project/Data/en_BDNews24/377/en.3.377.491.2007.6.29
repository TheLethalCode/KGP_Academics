<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  Fewer patients took admission at BIRDEM hospital Friday than usual with a looming threat of an indefinite strike by doctors from Sunday. About 300 inpatient doctors of the hospital appointed on contract clamped a four-day strike since Monday demanding job extensions or permanent contracts, throwing healthcare service into disarray. They called off the strike Thursday only after a meeting with hospital authorities. Only five patients got admitted until 3pm Friday, an official at the hospital's inquiry said, adding over 200 beds of the hospital were empty. Up to 25 patients are usually admitted on the weekend and 65 on six weekdays, he said. The inpatient doctors had threatened an indefinite strike from July 1 if their demands were not met at the June 30 national conference of the Bangladesh Diabetic Association. Some 350 medical officers, assistant registrars, registrars and specialists of the hospital's inpatient division have been on contract with BIRDEM. They have seen their contracts renewed every three years since 1996, but authorities recently decided not to go for an extension, sparking off the protest. Dr Nazmul Islam, one of the demonstrating doctors, said situation at the hospital was normal. He put the fewer patients down to confusion about the strike. The doctors Thursday had a meeting with the authorities at the hospital auditorium. Director of clinical service Professor Nazmun Nahar and other senior staffers asked the doctors to suspend the strike until June 30 when their case would be considered. Hospital authorities later said they were unable to take a final decision as Bangladesh Diabetic Association president Professor AK Azad is abroad. bdnew
