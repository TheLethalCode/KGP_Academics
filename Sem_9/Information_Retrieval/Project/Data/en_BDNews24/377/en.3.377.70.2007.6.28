 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina coach Alfio Basile has played down comparions between his team and the one which won Copa America in 1993, the last time the twice world champions lifted a trophy. "That team had been around a bit and twice won the Copa America," he told reporters on Wednesday. "This one is just starting out. "But we're going to try to play the same way. It's going to be difficult to play at the same level as those monsters." Basile was in charge of the team in 1993 and also led the Argentine side which won the previous Copa America in 1991. He went on to take Argentina to the last 16 of the 1994 World Cup, resigned afterwards and was re-appointed last year to replace Jose Pekerman after the World Cup in Germany. The gravel-voiced coach added that he wanted Lionel Messi to play the same way he does with his club Barcelona. "We hope he plays the way he knows, with the same explosion and inventiveness. He can undo any team in the word. At any moment, he can become inspired and win the game." Argentina's first game in Group C is against the United States on Thursday
