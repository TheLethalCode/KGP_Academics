 Chittagong, June 28 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission Thursday filed two graft cases against detained Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. ACC deputy director Abu Mohammad Arif Siddiqui filed the cases with Kotwali Police Station Thursday accusing Mohiuddin of pocketing Tk 85 lakh of the corporation's fund in two separate scams. Mohiuddin Chowdhury, eminent drama personality Abdullah Al Mamun, Chittagong lawyers' association general secretary Iftekhar Saimul Chowdhury and Golam Mostafa Kanchan have been made the accused persons in the first case. According to the case details, the four accused people misappropriated Tk 44 lakh after they had transferred the money to the fund of Chittagong Muktijoddha Shilpi Samannay Parishad to make a film in 1997 on the Liberation War without approval of the local government ministry. No such film was found to have been made, he said. The second case was filed against the city mayor, Janata Bank chairman and former secretary of Chittagong City Corporation SM Solaiman, former CCC chief executive Abdullah Wahab, former Chittagong Development Authority chairman Mahmudul Islam Chowdhury and Prof Iftekhar Uddin Chowdhury, who teaches at Chittagong University. The ACC said the accused people had taken up a project to conduct a survey on the population of the city and transferred Tk 41 lakh to Nagorik Adhikar Sangrakkhan Committee. Mohiuddin was the key patron of the committee. The money was later embezzled, according to case details. Kotwali police sub-inspector Mohammad Arif confirmed the filing of the cases. bdnews2
