 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Martina Hingis's luck finally ran out at Wimbledon on Friday when she lost 6-4 6-2 to American Laura Granville in the third round. The Swiss former champion had survived two match points in her opening tie against British wildcard Naomi Cavaday but she was unable to pull off a great escape on Friday. Hingis, who said she was not fully fit, missed the French Open through injury and had pretty much written off her chances of repeating her 1997 triumph after her woeful display against Cavaday. The ninth seed was proved right when she failed to last the distance against Granville and has now fallen in the third round on both her visits to the All England Club since making her comeback in 2006
