 NEW YORK Fri Jun 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks rose on Friday after data showed strength in the economy while an inflation measure moderated, putting the stock market on track to end the quarter on a strong note. Among advancing shares, Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM.O: Quote, Profile, Research)(RIM.TO: Quote, Profile, Research) surged after the BlackBerry maker posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and announced a stock split. For details, see Apple Inc. (AAPL.O: Quote, Profile, Research) rose on the day its new iPhone went on sale in U.S. stores. The Federal Reserve's favorite inflation measure showed its lowest reading since March 2004, according to government data. Separate reports on Midwest business activity and consumer sentiment were stronger than expected a day after the Fed's assessment that the economy was likely to expand moderately in coming quarters.

The inflation measure -- core personal consumption expenditures -- increased by 1.9 percent in the 12 months ending in May, its slowest annual gain in three years and a sign the Fed is making progress in fighting inflation. Adding to optimism, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said Midwest business activity grew in June as new orders poured in. The Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumers showed sentiment improved slightly as gasoline prices ebbed. RIM shares surged nearly 17 percent to $193.55 on the Nasdaq.
