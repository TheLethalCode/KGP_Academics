Vergara, who teaches at the nearby University of Valparaiso, said the gentle hills around Los Maitenes were once part of the sea bed. The teenagers found the fossils while on a field trip with their biology teacher Veronica Andrade. "We got to the place thinking we might find a bone, something small and some invertebrate fossils," Andrade told Reuters. "But because the kids are restless they fanned out all over the area and they found lots of fragments close to the surface." Local authorities are hailing the discovery as one of the most important of its kind in central Chile and say they plan to declare the area a national monument, which would give the area protected status.
