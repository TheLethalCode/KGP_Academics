<TITLE> Azizul says return of laundered money doesn't help economy much </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)- The government has stated that reclaimed laundered money will not contribute significantly to reducing the budget deficit, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Thursday. "We're trying our best to reclaim any laundered money, just as Bangladesh Bank. However the experiences of other countries in this regard are not inspiring. We have to be realistic," Azizul told a discussion at the National Press Club. He cited the Philippines, where only $560 million was brought into the 'white economy' in 17 years. Nigeria brought back a similar amount in approximately six years. The finance adviser said countries like Bangladesh are hampered in their development due to ongoing resource crises. "Our budget accounts for just 15 percent of GDP. It's not possible to make satisfactory progress with this meager amount of money. The ratio of tax to GDP is just 10.4 percent," Azizul said. Welfare states, as in Europe, have budgets of more or less 50 percent of their GDP. He said the government is trying to utilise its resources properly. The government's war against corruption is an example of this." The finance adviser emphasised that the increasing importance of the services sector was linked to a decrease in the relevance of labour-intensive industries in achieving growth. "Value-added sectors such as banking, insurance, information technology and bio technology with their demand for highly skilled workers are increasingly important. This leads to an increase in the inequalities between skilled and unskilled workers," he said. The adviser added: "The government alone can't do everything. Nongovernmental organisations and the private sector must also come forward." bdnews24.
