<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer needed just 10 minutes on Thursday to finish his rain-interrupted match against Juan Martin del Potro, winning 6-2 7-5 6-1 to notch his 50th successive victory on grass. The win propelled him into a potentially tricky third-round tie with former world number one Marat Safin. "It was done quickly like I was hoping, but I was ready to go five sets in case," Federer told a news conference. "I was in control right away and I felt good out there today. He was struggling a little bit with his serve. I took advantage of that. I was solid from the baseline." The top seed, aiming for a fifth successive Wimbledon crown, sped through the first set, breaking the 18-year-old Argentine in the sixth and eighth games. The second set went with serve until the 12th game when Federer earned himself three set points, converting the second when Del Potro messed up a forehand. The world number one broke early in the third to lead 2-0 before rain stopped play on Wednesday. They resumed on Thursday at 30-30 in the third game and Federer said the key was winning the first point after the interruption. "That was basically the point of today's match -- hitting that forehand winner to go up 40-30," he said. Safin, the Russian 26th seed, beat Federer in the 2005 Australian Open semi-finals on his way to the title. "I expect a tough match," Federer said. "He's obviously a player who can always upset anybody on any day. I hope he's not going to have one of those crazy good days against me. "But I think I can pretty much control also how things are being played on grass. Hopefully I can use my variety against him.
