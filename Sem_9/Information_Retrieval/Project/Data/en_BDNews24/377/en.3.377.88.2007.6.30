 Dinajpur, June 29 (bdnews24.com)- Intern doctors at Dinajpur Medical College Hospital have gone on an indefinite strike protesting misbehaviour with them by outsiders, whom they termed terrorists. The strike has thrown scores of patients at the hospital and healthcare seekers into utter woes, patients said. The intern doctors at a press conference at Dinajpur Press Club Friday morning said the "armed terrorists" detained intern doctor Dipankar Chakravarty at the main gate of the hospital Wednesday night and assaulted him. They said they would continue with the strike until the "terrorists" were arrested and tried. Intern Erfan Ahmed read out a written statement at the press conference. Dr Ayesha Akhter, Dr Junayet Md Touhid, Dr Mobasshera Mariam, Dr Hasin Ahmed and Dr Umme Farhana were present. Injured Dipankar (Surgery Department) filed a general diary with Kotwali Police Station demanding arrest of the terrorists involved in the incident and seeking security. Dinajpur Kotwali Police chief Motiar Rahman said they had already investigated the incident and marked three persons. The civil surgeon said in the face of the doctors' strike, a team of eight doctors was providing emergency medical care in the hospital. The doctors said if the administration did not take necessary steps they would withdraw the eight-strong emergency team. bdnews24.c
