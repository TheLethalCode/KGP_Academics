 LONDON, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British mortgage approvals rose in May for the first time since January but lending secured on dwellings slowed unexpectedly, notching its smallest increase in more than a year, official data showed on Friday. The mixed signals on the housing market are unlikely to alter expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week, particularly when money supply growth is accelerating and the economy remains strong.

Analysts had expected lending to pick up to 9.2 billion pounds. Other figures showed annual broad money supply growth picked up to 13.9 percent in May, coming within a whisker of 16-year peaks above 14 percent hit late last year. Britain's housing market has so far been resilient in the face of rising borrowing costs, although policymakers have recently cited tentative signs of activity slowing.

Credit card lending remained subdued in May, the BoE figures showed, falling 238 million pounds -- the weakest figure since August 2006. Overall consumer credit came in stronger than expected, rising by 842 million pounds, compared with expectations for a rise of 500 milli
