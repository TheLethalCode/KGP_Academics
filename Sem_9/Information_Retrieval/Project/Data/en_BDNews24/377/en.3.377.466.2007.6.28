<TEXT>
 Barisal, June 28 (bdnews24.com) -- A court Thursday sentenced former BNP lawmaker from Barguna-3 constituency, Motiur Rahman Talukder, to three-year imprisonment and a Tk 10,000 fine in a fraud case. If he fails to pay the fine, he will have to suffer another six months in jail, according to the sentencing by the magistrate for Amtoli upazila in Barguna district, Anup Barua. The case proceedings say the former MP took Tk 30,000 in bribe from Nizamuddin Piyada of Nachanpara village under Amtoli upzila on June 23, 2003 promising him a job. The former MP Talukder later embezzled the money and did not give Piyada any job, according to allegations. Nizamuddin on March 29 this year filed a case against Talukder accusing him of cheating. Sub-inspector Shamsul Haque, assigned to investigate the case, submitted a charge-sheet against Talukder for fraud. When the case was on trial, Talukder surrendered to court. The court rejected his bail prayer and ordered him into jail. In reaction to the verdict, Talukder said he was a victim of injustice. Advocate Mostafizur Rahman Babul defended the accused in court. He told reporters: "We will appeal to the High Court against the verdict." bdnews2
