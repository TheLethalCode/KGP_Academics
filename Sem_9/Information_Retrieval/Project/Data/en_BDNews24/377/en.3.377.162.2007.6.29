 CANBERRA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - He may be second in line to the British throne, but Australia's political leaders say Prince William is unsuitable to be their country's governor-general because he lacks the right pedigree. Tina Brown, author of a new book about William's late mother Diana, has said that the young prince would like to be Australia's next governor-general -- a position his father Prince Charles coveted but was denied in the 1980s. But Prime Minister John Howard, an avowed monarchist who successfully faced down a 1999 referendum vote for Australia to break its ties to London and become a republic, moved quickly on Friday to rule out the young prince as a future governor-general.

When the first Australian-born governor-general, former High Court Chief Justice Isaac Isaacs, was named in 1931, the move was opposed by King George V and created considerable tension between Canberra and Buckingham Palace. In 1945, the late king's third son, Prince Henry William Frederick Albert, Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden, became Australia's first post war governor-general. When he left in 1947, Prime Minister Ben Chifley, who used to drive trains for a living, declared he wanted a governor-general "without pomp and plumes and social glitter". Chifley appointed an ex-boilermaker and leftist Labor politician, William McKell, to replace the du
