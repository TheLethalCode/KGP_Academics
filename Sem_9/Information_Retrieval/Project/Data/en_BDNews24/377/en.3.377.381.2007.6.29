 BRUSSELS, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union should keep alive Turkey's prospects of joining the bloc or risk a nationalist or Islamist backlash in its neighbourhood, a newspaper quoted the EU's enlargement commissioner as saying. Olli Rehn told the European Voice weekly that while acknowledging French President Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition to Turkey's EU entry, the European Commission believed it necessary "to keep our word and respect our existing commitments".

The executive European Commission reports every year on the progress of each candidate for membership, and EU governments draw conclusions from those reports usually in December. The source said one idea would be to propose a fuller strategic review in the second half of 2012 -- before Turkey is likely to conclude the negotiations but after the next French presidential election -- in a bid to depoliticise the iss
