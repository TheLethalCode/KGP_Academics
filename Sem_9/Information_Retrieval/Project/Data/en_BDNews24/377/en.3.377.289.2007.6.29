<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British housebuilder Berkeley Group posted a forecast-beating 14 percent rise in profits on Friday and said it remained well-placed for the future owing to strong sales and favourable market conditions. Berkeley, which focuses on the buoyant London and southeast England housing areas, reported pretax profit of 188.1 million pounds ($376.5 million) for the year to end-April, beating the average estimate of 171.9 million pounds from seven analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Berkeley is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the strong London housing market, which is leading Britain's property boom with double-digit percentage price growth, as the city's robust financial industry attracts investment, jobs and foreign money. "The housing market in our core regions of London and southeast has been favourable over the year ... Outside London, the market remains very satisfactory but there is a little bit of more caution," Berkeley Chairman Roger Lewis told Reuters. Lewis said the market has been tempered by four interest rate rises of 100 basis points in total since last August and expectations of more rises, but said the market would remain stable as borrowing costs were still at historically low levels. Berkeley said its average selling price fell to 285,000 pounds, from 293,000 a year ago, due to changes in product mix. More than 40 percent of Berkeley's customers are investors such as second-home purchasers or buy-to-let investors. It said forward sales rose 18 percent to 936.3 million pounds and expected margins to stay in the range of 17.5 percent and 19.5 percent, although they were seen under pressure due to increasing labour and building material costs ahead of 2012 London Olympics. By 0800 GMT, shares in Berkeley rose 3.1 percent to 1,833 pence. "The strength of landholdings and margins suggests that Berkeley should see rising earnings going forward," Bridgewell analyst Chris Millington said. "We are going to remain buyers arguing that Berkeley's fair value is 1963p and the fact landholdings, profits and cash flow are better than forecast." Berkeley, which launched a 12-pound-per-share capital return programme in 2004, said 7 pounds has been returned to shareholders so far and the remaining 2 and 3 pounds were scheduled for payment in January 2009 and 2011 respective
