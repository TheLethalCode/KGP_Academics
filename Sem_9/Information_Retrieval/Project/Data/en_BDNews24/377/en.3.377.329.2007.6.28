 ISLAMABAD, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistani government is dropping its insistence that accusations against the country's suspended top judge be heard by a judicial panel in a move that could speed up proceedings, a government lawyer said on Monday. Disagreement over who should hear the case against Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has delayed proceedings, dragging out a judicial crisis that began on March 9 when President Pervez Musharraf suspended Chaudhry over accusations of misconduct. Musharraf referred the case to a five-member judicial watchdog, known as the Supreme Judicial Council. But Chaudhry challenged that in the Supreme Court, saying some of its members were biased and he has insisted a full Supreme Court bench hear the accusations. The Supreme Court suspended the panel's proceedings in May and has been hearing arguments from both sides to decide which forum should take up the case. Government lawyer Malik Abdul Qayyum told reporters his side now had no objection if a full Supreme Court bench handled the case. "From the highest authority, I have an instruction that we have no objection if this full court hears it," Qayyum said, apparently referring to Musharraf. "Our position is whichever option the chief justice chooses ... we are ready to follow that." The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the government lawyers' suggestion. While the Supreme Court has been hearing the arguements, the government's attempt to dismiss Chaudhry has touched off a broad campaign against Musharraf, the army chief who took power in a 1999 coup. Lawyers supporting Chaudhry and campaigning for the independence of the judiciary have been joined by opposition parties in a campaign to end military rule in the run-up to elections due around the end of the year. Analysts suspect Musharraf's motive for wanting to replace Chaudhry was that the independent-minded Supreme Court chief might have allowed challenges to Musharraf's election plans. Musharraf has said he would seek re-election by sitting national and provincial assemblies -- where he enjoys significant support -- before they are dissolved for a general election. He is also believed to be reluctant to step down as army chief, as he is constitutionally required to do this ye
