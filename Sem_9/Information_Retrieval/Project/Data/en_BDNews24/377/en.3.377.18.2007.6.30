 TEHRAN, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A team from the UN nuclear watchdog will visit Iran on July 11-13 to discuss how to resolve questions about Tehran's disputed nuclear programme, the ISNA news agency quoted an Iranian official as saying on Saturday. The International Atomic Energy Agency last week said Iran had invited it to send a team after Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, agreed a "plan of action" for clearing up issues with IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei. "A team consisting of the agency's deputy and some officials ... will come to Tehran to study a working plan that will answer all the remaining issues in regard to Iran's nuclear programme," Iran's IAEA envoy, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, told ISNA.
