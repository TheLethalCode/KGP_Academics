 Gazipur, June 29 (bdnews24.com) - Rafiqul Islam, serving a three- year prison term in Gazipur jail, felt proud on being enlisted as a voter Thursday under the Sreepur pilot project. Rafiq, in jail over a land dispute with a neighbour, did not feel like a convict thanks to the warm gesture he received from the pilot project team members who collected his photo and fingerprints for the voter and national ID cards. "I never thought I would be a voter and get a national identity card with photo as a detainee," an official of the project quoted Rafiq as saying. As many as 35 detainees, 31 from Gazipur District Jail and five from Kashimpur Central Jail, were enlisted under the pilot project. Shah Alam, district election officer, told bdnews24.com that according to the law, prisoners could be enlisted as voters using their permanent addresses. bdnews24.com/c
