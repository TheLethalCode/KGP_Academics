<TITLE> China says can't accept US ban on mainland seafood </TITLE>

 BEIJING, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China cannot accept the indiscriminate ban on four kinds of seafood imported from the mainland by the United States, and urged the matter be settled as soon as possible, Xinhua reported on Saturday. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Thursday it would not allow imports of Chinese farm-raised seafood unless suppliers could prove the shipments contained no harmful residue. There might be isolated cases of Chinese enterprises exporting products with quality problems, Xinhua quoted Li Changjiang, director of the State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, as saying. However, the indiscriminate ban of all exports of such products is "unacceptable", said Li, urging the US "properly deal with the problem as soon as possible". China's food safety record has drawn international attention since mislabelled chemical exports were mixed into cough syrup in Panama and pet food in the United States. In apparent response, China has also announced the seizure of substandard food shipments at its ports. In the past week, China seized two fruit shipments from the United States and warned it would apply greater scrutiny to US cargoes, even as it tightens monitoring of manufacturers at home. Beijing also announced on Friday a new health minister, a Paris-trained scientist and only the second non-Party member to be named to a ministerial post since the 1970s, but gave no reason for the change. China has already adopted measures to solve the problems of the seafood, Li said. The US said it would send a team to China soon to negotiate a solution to the seafood ban, Xinhua said. Xinhua had reported earlier that 180 domestic food manufacturers were shut down over the past six months for making substandard food or using inedible materials for food production.
