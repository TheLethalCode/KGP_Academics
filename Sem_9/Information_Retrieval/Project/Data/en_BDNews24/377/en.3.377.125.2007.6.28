<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com) - The government is set to pay for the Adamjee land given to the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) for a foreign investors' EPZ, a senior official said Thursday. "We have decided to pay a nominal price for the Adamjee land to the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation. A three-member committee has been formed in this regard," Nazrul Islam, executive chairman of the Board of Investment, also a member of the BEPZA board of governors, told bdnews24.com. The decision came at a BEPZA board of governors' meeting at the chief adviser's office on June 27. Headed by finance secretary Dr Mohammed Tareq, the committee will submit its recommendation on the possible price to be paid for the Adamjee land. It will submit the report within 15 days. The move followed a BJMC claim of Tk 550 crore for about 300 acres of Adamjee land, given to the BEPZA for a token Tk 1.0. The Adamjee, the country's biggest jute mills, was closed in 2002 in the face of increased pressure from multilateral donors such as the World Bank. "We are not ready to pay such a huge amount of money. The secretary level committee may determine a book value of the Adamjee land," a BEPZA official, wanting anonymity, said. The official said that the BEPZA was currently using Adamjee buildings and lands. Most of the movable goods and machinery were under BJMC control, the official added. BJMC, which had owned and regulated the jute factory until its closure, handed over the entire Adamjee to the BEPZA following a cabinet decision in 2005. BEPZA opened Adamjee EPZ in March last year. Founded by Sir Adamjee Hazi Daud in 1950 at Siddhirganj, Narayanganj, the post-independence government nationalised the mills in 1972. bd
