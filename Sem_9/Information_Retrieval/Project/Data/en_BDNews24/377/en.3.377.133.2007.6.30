<TITLE> Leather industry demands tax break </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Leather and footwear exporters Saturday demanded a tax break for the industry and asked the government to declare the new leather industrial town in Savar a special economic zone. They also demanded Tk 250 crore in compensation for the initial cost of shifting tanneries to Savar. At a seminar held Saturday on leather as an emerging sector, the exporters said Bangladesh could count Tk 12,000 crore a year from the sector if the capacity of existing factories could be properly utilised. However this would need greater support from the government including a tax break. An estimated Tk 2,800 crore now comes from the sector. Tipu Sultan, president of Bangladesh Finished Leather, Leather Goods and Footwear Exporters Association, said: "Exports of raw leather from processing animal hides would boost revenue by up to 85 percent. The revenue could be boosted by a further 45 percent more if the raw leather is processed into finished leather. If we could process the leather into a variety of goods, it would add up to 45 percent more to the revenue in the sector." The vice president of the organisation said: "Vietnam currently earns $200 crore exporting leather while we are earning only $25.7 crore in leather exports." Planning Commission member Muhammad Abdul Majid said the leather sector had more potential for revenue than the readymade garments sector. He asked leather businesspeople to boost investment in footwear and finished products. "Leather companies has to be declared small and medium enterprises, which would enable them to get bank loans more easily," Majid said. He added that the leather industry should be shifted outside Dhaka only when the developing leather industrial town is completed. bdnews2
