 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to reach 15,000 runs in one-day internationals while steering India to a six-wicket win over South Africa in the Future Cup in Belfast on Friday. The 34-year-old from Bombay thumped 93, sharing an opening partnership of 134 with Saurav Ganguly (42), to help India reach their target of 227 with five balls to spare and level the three-match series 1-1. Tendulkar bludgeoned 13 fours and two sixes before he was bowled by spinner Thandi Tshabalala as his side slid from 134 for nought to 142 for four. But Yuvraj Singh (49 not out) and Dinesh Karthik (32 not out) shared a stand of 85 to clinch victory. "As long as the team are winning, everything else is secondary," Tendulkar told reporters. "It is obviously a very happy feeling especially when we ended up on a winning note. But after playing for 18 years, I feel it (the milestone) is just one of those things." Tendulkar said he particularly enjoyed his alliance with Ganguly. JUNIOR DAYS "He is a fabulous player, I've seen him play since junior days," said Tendulkar. "I enjoy playing with him. He plays wonderful shots and it's a treat to watch him." Earlier, opening batsman Morne van Wyk top-scored with 82 and Mark Boucher made an undefeated 55 as South Africa chalked up 226 for six in 50 overs. Yuvraj was the pick of India's attack, taking three for 36 in nine overs. South Africa captain Jacques Kallis paid tribute to Tendulkar. "It was an unbelievable knock he played," said Kallis. "Unfortunately we went past the edge a few times and things didn't quite go our way. "You need things to go your way when you've got a world-class player like that. On his day he's very dangerous." The last game of the series is on Sunday
