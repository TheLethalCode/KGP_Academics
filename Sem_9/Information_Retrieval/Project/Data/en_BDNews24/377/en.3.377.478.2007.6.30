 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombia will not sink beneath the waves despite a 5-0 drubbing by Paraguay in the Copa America, coach Jorge Luis Pinto said on Friday. "This is not a catastrophe. A catastrophe is when you can't control the circumstances, such as the climate, the sea...This is not what is happening at the moment," he said. "We haven't been destroyed, neither in a footballing sense, nor a tactical sense nor in our morale. We lost but the world hasn't ended," he told reporters. "We're not down yet, we're going to react." Colombia dominated the early stages of their opening Group C game on Thursday and Alvaro Dominguez missed a 28th minute penalty. Paraguay went ahead two minutes later and the Colombians fell apart in the second half. Curiously, Colombia's defence had been their strong point in the run-up to the tournament conceding two goals in six games. Their next match is on Monday against tournament favourites Argentina, who began with a 4-1 win over United States. "We will make changes. We may vary the style of play and the players," said Pinto. Pinto also compared the match to Colombia's 5-0 win over Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in 1993. "On that occasion, we weren't that good and Argentina weren't that bad," he said, "This game (against Paraguay) reminds me of it.
