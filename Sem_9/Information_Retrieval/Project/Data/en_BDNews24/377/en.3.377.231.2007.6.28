<TITLE> BGMEA Bhaban illegal: Adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  The 15-storey BGMEA Bhaban was built without approval of city developers Rajuk and should be knocked down just as Rangs Bhaban is going to be, an adviser said Thursday. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said "no approval was taken from RAJUK" to erect the headquarters of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters' Association in Hatirjheel coordinated development project area in the capital. The adviser made the revelation after an inter-ministerial meeting on the project held at the conference room of the Local Government Division. He said the government has asked the Ministry of Public Works to also look into the Hatirjheel project thrown up on wetland. "I cannot say why such an illegal building was constructed without RAJUK approval. You better ask the officials of the Ministry of Public Works," he told reporters. On Hatirjheel project, Anwarul said, "The project was supposed to be built on 302 acres of land. About 400 structures there will have to be demolished. "Now it has been contemplated that the project would be implemented on 250 acres so that so many structures are not demolished." Still, he said, some 150 structures would have to be knocked down. "The building has been constructed without approval of RAJUK, I know this. It is regrettable," acting secretary of the ministry ASM Rashidul Hye said. "The law is equal for all. It would now be looked into as to how such a big building was constructed and nobody noticed the irregularities." He said any neglect by RAJUK would be seriously dealt with. The government has made available Tk 200 crore for Hatirjheel project, with Tk 150 crore to be taken in loan from Japan, Hye said. Environmentalist Prof Abdullah Abu Sayeedw who was present in the inter-ministerial meeting said, "As the building was constructed illegally encroaching upon the jheel, the Wetland Protection Act has been violated. "Hatirjheel is very important for water drainage system in capital Dhaka." He said environmentalists mounted a movement against it when the building was constructed without much success. bdnews
