 OHRID, Macedonia, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO on Friday urged flexibility from all sides in overcoming the diplomatic deadlock on the fate of Serbia's breakaway Kosovo province, and warned against any "unforeseen developments". NATO powers with troops in Kosovo are increasingly concerned at the prospect of a unilateral declaration of independence by the ethnic Albanian majority if Russia continues to block Western plans for its secession at the United Nations. NATO and its Kosovo peace force "need political flexibility from all those concerned in finding a solution for the status of Kosovo," said NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. "Nobody will gain anything from any unforeseen developments," he told a news conference at a meeting of NATO's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in Ohrid, Macedonia. De Hoop Scheffer later arrived in Kosovo. NATO leads 16,000 troops in the territory, down from 50,000 deployed in 1999 after an 11-week bombing campaign to drive out Serbian forces. Western powers had promised Kosovo's 90-percent Albanian majority 'supervised independence' by mid-year, having twice delayed in 2006 to limit the expected fallout in Serbia. But Russia has threatened to veto a draft U.N. resolution, testing the resolve of the West and raising fears of unrest. Complaining of a "crisis of trust", Kosovo leaders have threatened to declare independence unilaterally, a move diplomats say would split the 27-member EU and undermine its plan to take over supervision of Kosovo from the United Nations. In a statement on Friday, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said he was "worried about the loss of credibility in the international process because of continued delay." The latest draft U.N. resolution offers another 120 days of talks between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians, on top of 13 months of direct dialogue that ended in stalemate in March. Kosovo Albanian hardliners are due to stage protests in the capital, Pristina, on Saturday, calling for a referendum on independence and the withdrawal of the U.N. mission that has run the impoverished territory since 1999. De Hoop Scheffer called for "calm and restraint." Serbia opposes independence for Kosovo, cherished by many Serbs as their spiritual heartland. Belgrade lost control of the province under NATO air strikes which ended Serbia's 1998-99 war against Albanian separatist guerrillas, in which 800,000 Albanians were expelled. Independent estimates put the civilian death toll at between 7,500 and 12,000, mostly Albania
