Deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said the AL leader would be freed again on parole at 10am Friday to attend the last funeral prayers for his mother. He will be back to jail at 5pm. Selim's family members waved him a tearful goodnight from the balcony of their house in Banani as a prison van sped him away to the Dhaka Central Jail. Selim waved them back. Achhiya Khatun, also elder sister of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and aunt of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, died of old-age complications at age 90 at ZH Sikder Medical College Hospital in Gulshan Thursday. Hasina who also joined the funeral for her aunt left Selim's home at 9:45pm. She arrived in Banani shortly after 2:00pm amid tight security. Earlier, home secretary Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com that the government had decided to release Selim, allowing him to join funeral rites for his mother.
