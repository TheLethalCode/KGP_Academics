<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia Saturday said reforms to the BNP must be done in line with the councillors' thoughts. "I want reforms. Party leaders want reforms too, but that must follow a democratic way," the BNP chairperson told reporters after visiting ailing party treasurer Shahe Alam at his Malibag home. "A final decision will come after reviewing opinions of the party leaders and activists," she said of the reform proposals recently placed by secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. "The party is run by the (party) constitution. Nothing depends on a person." She said she was aware of the fact that many party leaders and workers were keen to voice their concerns at the council meeting. "The BNP is not an underground party. We'll take a final decision through discussion," she said. On whether she has any proposal on the possible reforms, the former prime minister said she would place her part at the council. A united BNP is her mission, she said. "Nobody wants division in the party." bdnew
