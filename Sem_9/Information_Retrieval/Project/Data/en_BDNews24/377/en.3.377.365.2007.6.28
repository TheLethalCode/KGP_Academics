<TITLE> NBR to launch massive drive to trace taxpayers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com) -- The National Board of Revenue will launch a massive drive next week to locate potential new taxpayers in an effort to widen the tax net, said NBR chairman Badiur Rahman Thursday. "Some 20 teams in metropolitan cities will begin a survey from July 5 to net potential taxpayers," the NBR chairman told reporters at the finance ministry. "Another 28 teams will work at the district level," he added. A separate survey team will be allocated for Rangpur where a number of local industries are based. The NBR launched a three-month-long survey on March 29 in the Dhaka metropolitan area identifying at least 15,000 new taxpayers. The survey is especially aimed on fixed business premises like shopping malls, diagnostic centres, clinics, consultancy firms, law firms and coaching centres. Badiur Rahman said the NBR has no option but to widen the tax net. The revenue body has simplified tax systems and introduced a universal assessment system in order to cut the discretionary power of the tax officials. "We've offered a provision to legalise untaxed money until July 31 so that people with undisclosed income could take the opportunity," he said. "There will be no mercy after the July deadline," he said: "Fines up to 250 percent will be imposed in case of detection of untaxed money." Replying to a query, the NBR chairman said that the board is preparing to file some 15 to 16 cases for tax evasion. The cases will be more or less in line with the case against Ali Asgar Lobi, the former BNP lawmaker and manpower businessman, he added. bdn
