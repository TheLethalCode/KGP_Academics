 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)  The government is contemplating assigning any established bank, nongovernmental organisation or agency to issue and renew passports in an effort to cut hassles, a senior government official said Saturday. Saturday's meeting of the interim cabinet, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, discussed the matter and asked the home ministry to draw up a complete proposal on how to relax the rules, regulations and other procedures for obtaining a passport. The cabinet directed the ministry to ensure timely delivery of passports and examine if validity of a passport could be extended to 10 years from the present five years.

Advisers, cabinet secretary, press secretary to the Chief Adviser and concerned secretaries were present at the meeting in the chief adviser's office. bd
