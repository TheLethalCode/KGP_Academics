 BAGHDAD, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiery Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr vowed on Thursday to go ahead with plans for his followers to march on a destroyed Shi'ite mosque in the Sunni city of Samarra next week, his office said. The statement came after prominent Sunni religious groups advised against the July 5 gathering, fearing militants could attack his followers and worsen relations between the two sects. Sadr, who has huge appeal among Iraq's Shia masses, made his call for the march in the city after suspected al Qaeda militants blew up the two minarets of the revered al-Askari mosque on June 13. "We want Iraqis, tribes, community leaders and officials to show goodwill and cooperation to make this visit successful and a turning point in broken relations because those criminals who destroyed the shrine will not be pleased (by this march)," said the statement from Sadr's office in the Shi'ite city of Najaf. The prime minister's office later released a statement, saying more time was needed to make the road to Samarra safe. Samarra lies 100 km (62 miles) north of Baghdad. Sadr's followers would be expected to travel from Baghdad as well as other Shia cities in southern Iraq, leaving them vulnerable to attack as they pass through known Sunni Arab insurgent strongholds north of the capital. "While we take into account the emotion of people who want to march peacefully to Samarra, we say that the task of securing the road is still incomplete according to reports from field leaders on the ground," the government statement said. The latest attack on the al-Askari mosque occurred more than a year after militants blew up the shrine's golden dome in February 2006. That attack sparked waves of sectarian violence that has pushed Iraq close to all-out civil war. Iraq's government has also blamed Sunni Islamist al Qaeda for the 2006 attack. The al-Askari Mosque, also known as the Golden Mosque, is one of the four major Shi'ite shrines in Iraq. Two of the 12 revered Shi'ite imams are buried in the shrine -- Imam Ali al-Hadi, who died in 868 and his son, the 11th imam, Hasan al-Askari, who died in 8
