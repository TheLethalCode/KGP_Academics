 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed has approved the budget for fiscal 2007-08 without changing duty slabs on import of raw materials and capital machinery, the National Board of Revenue chairman said Thursday. However importers of raw materials and capital machinery will be given benefits through a statutory regulatory order (SRO). The government has proposed the introduction of duty slabs at 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent instead of the existing 5 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent causing concern for businesses who say local industry will be hit hard by the move to increase duty. "We've considered every recommendation by different sections of the public," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told reporters after the president approved the budget Thursday. The budget raises the duty for import of raw materials and capital machinery to 10 percent from the existing 5 percent, which businesses say will inflate the overall project cost and deter new investment in industry. But the NBR chairman said: "Importers of those items will be given 5 percent duty reduction by the issuing of SROs from time to time." Rahman also confirmed that the approved budget contains reductions of duty on other items, which will cost the NBR an extra Tk 400 crore. However the NBR's proposed target of Tk 43,850 crore for the 2007-08 budget will remain unchanged. Although he declined to mention specifically on which items the proposed taxes have been changed he said: "They will affect the cost of computers and newsprint." He gave no further details. Replying to a query on the revenue target for the outgoing fiscal year, the chairman said that the NBR was still lagging behind by over Tk 5,500 crore from the revised target of Tk 37,479 crore. Revenue collections were Tk 32,000 crore up to May, according to the chairman. "We're expecting to make up the gap by taxes to be earned from legalising undisclosed money," he noted. The chairman said only Tk 5 crore has so far been legalised under the provision in place since June 5. "Of which, Tk 1 crore was legalised by an individual today (Thursday)," he added. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam announced the Tk 87,137 crore budget for fiscal 2007-08 on June 7. The budget was not announced in parliament for the first time since 1985 as the country is run by a caretaker government. Comments from the public were taken by e-mail, postal-mail and newspaper reports and accordingly the government brought changes to the proposed budget before presidential approval. bdnews
