<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)- Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak has presented a "personal" proposal for reform to the Awami League including election of leaders at each level through secret ballot. Abdur Razzak presented different aspects of his reform proposal to journalists at his Dhanmondi home Saturday evening. His proposal said that one person would not able to hold the post of president or general secretary for two consecutive terms. Besides, the same person would not hold government and party positions simultaneously. It would be effective not only at the central, but at the district and thana levels as well. Abdur Razzak proposes, "Anti-liberation elements will neither be able to become Awami League member nor its trustee." " To make somebody a trustee, discussions must be initiated from the grassroots level. Leaders must be elected through secret ballot at every level of the party." The AL leader also demanded cancellation of the agreement signed with the Khelafat Majlish before the January 22 cancelled election. The reform proposal also says, "If anybody is sentenced for a specified term or proved guilty he will not be eligible to contest polls. He will not also be able to hold any party position." Abdur Razzak read out the whole set of proposals. No copy of the proposal was given to journalists. He only invited the journalists of the electronic media. But when the news spread, newsmen of other media also assembled there and were allowed in midway. After reading out the proposal Abdur Razzak said: "This is my personal opinion. It will be placed in the working committee after the indoor politics starts. There is no scope for misunderstanding regarding this. Please excuse me if I am wrong. And if I am not wrong, accept it." On the proposed reform excluding the two leaders he said, "Who minuses whom? Workers are the force of the party, what the workers want will be materialised. This reform proposal is not for excluding anybody or installing anybody." Asked whether the proposal to the effect that one person will not hold the party's president or general secretary post for two consecutive terms was aimed at excluding Sheikh Hasina he said, "Not for excluding anybody. We must take decisions based on principles. And that has to be taken at the party working committee meeting." He said, "I had been silent so far. Did not say anything. But there has been some talk involving me too." Earlier in the day, Abdur Razzak, Mukul Bose and KM Jahangir had a sitting at the pro-reform Prof Abu Sayeed's home Saturday. Abdur Razzak came out of the home at around 12.40pm and left hurriedly. When journalists gathered near him he said: "I know nothing worth mentioning about the reform proposal." At one stage he said, "Talk to Mukul. I know nothing." He then left the place in a rickshaw. bdnews
