 JERUSALEM 28 June -(bdnews24.com/Reuters)--President Moshe Katsav pleaded guilty on Thursday to committing sexual crimes against women employees, signing a plea bargain that will keep him out of jail, Israel's attorney-general said. Under the deal, Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz retreated from his stated intention to charge Katsav with rape but said the president, whose term expires next month, would resign and that 'shame will accompany him forever'. 'From Israel's 'First Citizen', he turns into a criminal convicted of sexual offences,' Mazuz told a news conference, insisting he had not given a special break to a public figure. An attorney for one of the victims expressed outrage at the plea bargain and a women's rights' advocate said it would discourage other women from complaining about sexual crimes. The unprecedented case against an Israeli head of state has stirred powerful emotions in a country where women's groups have long complained that authorities shrug off sexual harassment in workplaces. As part of the arrangement that Katsav signed, he pleaded guilty to charges he committed a string of indecent sexual acts against one woman who worked for him and sexually harassed another female employee, Mazuz said. He said that Katsav could have faced a maximum seven years in jail for the offences but would instead receive a suspended sentence, pending a court's approval of the plea bargain. Katsav, who had denied any wrongdoing, also agreed to pay the equivalent of $3,500 in compensation to one of the women and $8,300 to the other, Mazuz said. After the attorney-general's announcement, Katsav was quoted by several Israeli news Web sites as saying: 'I had no strength for a court battle so I admitted that I hugged and kissed (the women) out of affection.' 'Cowardice' Zahava GAl On, a left-wing legislator and women's rights advocate, accused Mazuz of moral cowardice. 'Victims of sex crimes will believe they do not have any shield,' GAl On told reporters. Kinneret Barashi, an attorney for one of the women, said her client 'feels she is a victim for the second time'. Israeli news reports said Katsav would resign later in the day and the speaker of parliament would replace him until Shimon Peres, elected president by lawmakers earlier this month, becomes head of state as originally scheduled on July 15. The Justice Ministry said in January it planned to accuse Katsav of raping an ex-aide and sexually assaulting three other women who worked for him. But Mazuz said prosecutors concluded that pressing ahead with the original charges would have led to 'not inconsequential problems of proof and evidence' during trial. Katsav has been on leave of absence from his largely ceremonial post since the plans to indict him were announced. Born in Iran in 1945, Katsav immigrated with his family to Israel in 1951. At age 24 he became the country's youngest mayor and went on to hold a number of cabinet posts as a member of the right-wing Likud party. Parliament elected him president in 2000 in an upset victory over Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize laurea
