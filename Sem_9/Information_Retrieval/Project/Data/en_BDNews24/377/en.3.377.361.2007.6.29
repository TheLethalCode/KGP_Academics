<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The deep monsoon depression over the Bay moved north-westward and crossed the Orissa coast near Puri at 12 noon and was stationed over Orissa and adjoining areas as a land depression, the Met office said. It is likely to move in a north- westerly direction and may weaken gradually through precipitation. Under its influence, a steep pressure gradient persists over the North Bay. Squally weather may affect the ports while the sea will remain moderate, the weathercast said. Chittagong, Mongla and Cox's Bazar maritime ports have been advised to hoist local cautionary signal three until further notice. Fishing boats and trawlers have been advised not to venture out into the sea until otherwise notified. The coastal districts of Noakhali, Laxmipur, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barisal, Chandpur, Barguna, Pirojpur, Jhalokathhi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira and the offshore shoals are likely to experience wind-driven surges two to four feet higher than the regular tide level. bdnews2
