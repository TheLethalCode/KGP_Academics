 LONDON, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 3,500 people have been rescued from this week's deadly floods by emergency services in Britain's biggest-ever peacetime rescue effort, the Fire Brigades Union said on Thursday. Thousands more have been evacuated to safe areas after flooding in Sheffield and large areas of northern England and the Midlands. But forecasters are predicting more heavy rain in some of the worst-affected areas over the weekend. The death toll rose to five after Lincolnshire police divers searching for a missing 60-year-old man recovered a body from a canal at Torksey, near Gainsborough. Eleven severe flood warnings remain in place, 10 in the most badly affected areas in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. FBU General Secretary Matt Wrack said the government had underestimated the scale of the flooding. "We have witnessed the biggest rescue effort in peacetime Britain by our emergency services and it's not over yet," Wrack said. Environment Agency Chief Executive Barbara Young, responsible for flood defences, told BBC television that drains and flood barriers had been swamped by extraordinary volumes of water. "We had a whole month's worth in a few hours in many places. It's the sort of event we would only expect to see perhaps one in 150 years. "No amount of flood preparation can withstand these very extreme weather events" she added. Water levels were falling in many areas on Thursday but the river Don burst its banks overnight, flooding houses and streets in Bentley, north of Doncaster. Forecasters said heavy rain expected on Saturday and Sunday could put further pressure on areas already swamped after Monday's storms. The Met office said up to an inch of rain could fall across England and Wales over the weekend, with a risk of as much as two inches locally in some areas. Steady rain on Saturday followed by showers on Sunday were expected to fall heaviest on Norfolk, Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire as well as the east and west Midlands. The weather was likely to remain unsettled into early next week, with more showers possible on Monday and Tuesday, a Met Office spokesman said. As much as three or four inches fell in places on Monday. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Wyman said the floods had caused "significant damage" to South Yorkshire's infrastructure, with many roads needing repairs and likely to remain closed for some time. But he said the risk of a dam breaking near Rotherham at Ulley Reservoir had been significantly reduced after two days of pumping to reduce water levels. On Tuesday, police divers recovered the body of 68-year-old district judge Eric Dickinson from his car submerged under two metres of water in Pershore, Worcestershire. In Sheffield Peter Harding, 68, and 14-year-old Ryan Parry died in separate flood-related incidents on Monday. In Hull, Michael Barnett, 28, died after becoming stuck in a dra
