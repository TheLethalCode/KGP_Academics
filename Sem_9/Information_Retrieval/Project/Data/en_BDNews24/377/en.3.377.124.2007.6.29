 HARARE, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe has lifted a ban on political rallies and protests in Harare which the opposition had likened to a state of emergency, but police permits are still required for such gatherings.

The MDC said Mugabe had imposed the ban in the opposition urban strongholds to cripple its operations ahead of general elections due by March next year. Mugabe's ZANU-PF government has routinely used riot police squads to crush anti-government rallies, most recently on May 8 when they used rubber batons to disperse a march by human rights lawyers protesting against the arrest of two colleagues. Tension rose sharply in early March after opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC members suffered serious injuries after being arrested by police at an aborted prayer rally in Harare. Mugabe accuses the MDC of being stooges of Zimbabwe's former colonial power Britain in an effort to oust his government, as punishment for seizing and redistributing white-owned commercial farms to landless blacks. Britain denies there is such a pl
