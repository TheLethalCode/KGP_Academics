 LIMA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori vowed on Thursday to return to Peru, a day after announcing he planned to run for a seat in Japan's Upper House. Fujimori, who is under house arrest in the Chilean capital, Santiago, where he arrived in November 2005, is fighting extradition to Peru where authorities want to try him for suspected embezzlement and human rights abuses dating from his 1990-2000 rule. "Today, I assert in front of all of you my commitment to return (to Peru)," he said in a statement posted in his Web site. He gave no details on when he would return or under what conditions. On Wednesday, Fujimori told Reuters in an interview, "I shall continue (fighting) the extradition process until the end, with a well-sustained defense, because I did a good job over the 10 years (of government) and I have the results to prove it," he said. Fujimori, who is of Japanese descent and has dual Peruvian-Japanese citizenship, unveiled plans on Wednesday to run for a seat in Japan's Upper House in a July 29 vote. He lived in Japan from 2000 to 2005 after the collapse of his presidency under the weight of a huge corruption scandal. Although Fujimori has said his decision to get involved in Japanese politics has nothing to do with his extradition process, Peruvian President Alan Garcia has labeled the move "a strategy to divert attention" from the legal proceedings. The Peruvian attorney general pledged on Thursday to visit Chile to step up pressure on that country's authorities to hand over Fujimori. "Without any doubt, (Chile) will proceed with the extradition (process) because of the overwhelming evidence we have," Attorney General Carlos Briceno told Reuters. A Chilean Supreme Court judge is expected to rule on the extradition case in coming weeks or months. The court must then decide whether to ratify it. The Fujimori extradition case has raised passions in Peru, where some praise the 68-year-old former leader for the tough stance he took on terrorism during his presidency, while others say he was corrupt and undemocratic.
