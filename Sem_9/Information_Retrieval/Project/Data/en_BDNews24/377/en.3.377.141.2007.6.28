 KAMPALA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uganda's population growth rate, the third highest in the world, threatens to undo government efforts to promote economic growth and slash poverty, the United Nations said on Thursday. The United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) annual report said this week Uganda's population was growing at 3.6 percent a year, behind only East Timor and fellow African nation, Burundi. Uganda's population now stands at 30.9 million. UNFPA programme officer for Uganda, Nestor Owomuhangi, told Reuters state targets of 7 percent annual economic growth and cutting poverty to 26 from 31 percent by 2014 would be unlikely at current population growth rates. "Population is outstripping the capacity of government services to keep up with it," he said. "Seven percent GDP growth will be very difficult to reach." Owomuhangi said this was because too much revenue had had to be spent on healthcare and primary education to meet the needs of growing numbers of children, leaving little room for investment in infrastructure or supporting the private sector. "Education is almost 24 percent of the budget," he said. "The returns don't come back for a while." He said the planning of government services by the finance ministry was being disrupted by mushrooming population figures. "You're planning the health sector. Before you even put in the numbers, they're coming back to you for a supplementary budget because of growing numbers," he said. High population growth had also hurt GDP per capita, the basic measure of a country's well being, since last year's 6.5 percent GDP growth had to be divided between a population growing more than half as fast. Key to tackling the problem was lowering Uganda's fertility rate -- at 7.11 children per woman, only East Timor and Niger have more births, the UNFPA report says. "That's the average," said Owomuhangi. "Some districts, you're talking about 14 children per woman. Where do they sleep? How can they go to school?" He said politicians had been too reluctant to make family planning a priority. Health care tackling child mortality would also encourage women to have fewer children. "There has to be a plan starting now or else in 50 years were going to be 130 million people," he said, adding that this would wreck environments as competition for land would lead to more trees being cut down and soil eroding aw
