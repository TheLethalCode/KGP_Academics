 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)  The stock market is on the surge. Would-be investors plan to open accounts to get a slice of the cake but older ones and the regulator are a little worried as the crunch of blue-chips has been pushing prices higher on rising demand. The upbeat mood has continued since the interim government took office in mid-January, helping the market shrug off a two-year bearish trend. Most parameters on both bourses are riding high. The DGEN or general index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange added 540 points or 33.56 percent since the end of December 2006. Daily average turnover more than trebled to Tk 1.69 billion by the end of June from Tk 439.11 million in December 2006. Buoyed by a surge in prices and new listings of some banks and financial institutions, market capitalisation touched Tk 475 billion, up Tk 155 billion since December. Absence of political unrest, entry of foreign and local funds, diversion of funds from the real estate sector due to a slowdown in businesses amid an anticorruption crackdown, a loan facility by brokers and merchant banks, good corporate disclosures and a moderate economic outlook boosted confidence, analysts said. The result is, a rally of new entrants and a steady surge in prices. "Many new investors are coming to the market and creating fresh demand for quality shares which drives the market as well as prices higher," said Abu Ahmed, who teaches economics at Dhaka University. "The government should offload the shares of state-run companies quickly to stop share overheating," he said. The number of beneficiary owners' accounts, which are necessary to take part in trading, almost doubled in six months from the previous full-year figure. From January to June, 4,66,000 BOs were opened, up from 2,39,000 BOs in January to December 2006. Since the introduction of the system in 2004 to prevent fake shares, total BOs now stand at about 1.4 million. "The resilient and sustained bullish trend contributed to the gain," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh that manages over Tk 600 million in funds. He said awareness and alertness against manipulative practices, an improving supply of blue-chips and increased participation of institutional investors will cool the market. "The government should immediately offload 24 percent shares of DESCO and Power Grid to cool demand," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. "Shares will go overvalued unless we meet soaring demand. This will increase risks," he said. "A supply shortage of quality shares is contributing to the rise in prices to some extent. Besides, prospects for some sectors such as power have been fuelling the prices," said Ziaul Haque Khandker, managing director of Investment Corporation of Bangladesh. bdnew
