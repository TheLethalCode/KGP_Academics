 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Friday said the youth need to prepare themselves to lead the nation by getting disciplined. He was addressing the jamboree scouts after inaugurating 'Jamboree on the Train' arranged as part of the centenary celebrations of Bangladesh Scouts at the Kamalapur Railway Station. On the scouts from India and Nepal who participated in the event, he said they would gather experience here and a friendly bond will grow between them and the scouts of Bangladesh. The adviser in scout uniform described the experience of the long train journey he took the them as amazing. "This mutual exchange can contribute to strengthening the relations among the SAARC countries," Hosein said. Communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman was the special guest at the ceremony presided over by Dr Shah Mohammad Farid, president of Bangladesh Scouts. Chief scouts commissioner Md. Fazlur Rahman also spoke. Scouts Moniruzzaman and Rakibul Islam said they had been enjoying every bit of the journey since the train started from Chittagong. Even though they had train journeys in the past, they said, they did not get to see the country from one end to the other in a week-long trip before. The Jamboree on the train programme started from Chittagong on Thursday. On the second day Friday, the train entered Kamalapur station in Dhaka and after the inaugural functions it left for Dinajpur. The train would reach Dinajpur on July 2 and would make a few stopovers on its way and the scouts would observe different programmes. About 3,000 scouts are participating in the programme. Members of the scout delegations from India and Nepal are also participating. Farid, the president of the scouts, said the 'jamboree' is very attractive to the scouts. "They will cross 800 kilometres in six days. They will perform all other duties on board the train and will stop at specific spots to participate in different programmes," he added. bdnews24.
