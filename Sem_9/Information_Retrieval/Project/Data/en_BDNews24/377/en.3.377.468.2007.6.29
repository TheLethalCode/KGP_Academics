 BOUAKE, Ivory Coast, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ivory Coast's Prime Minister Guillaume Soro escaped unhurt when his plane was hit by a rocket on arrival at the rebel stronghold of Bouake on Friday, but three others were killed, witnesses said. Soro, head of the New Forces rebels who seized the north of the West African country during the 2002-2003 civil war, became prime minister in April after signing a peace deal with President Laurent Gbagbo to guide the country to elections. "There was an explosion and it was panic. The plane had just landed and we waited until the plane came to a stop. We tried to calm people down until the plane stopped," a New Forces administrative assistant who was on board told Reuters. "Those who fired must have been in the bush. I didn't see anyone. I don't know if anyone saw them," the assistant, who declined to be identified, said by phone from Bouake hospital, where he was being treated for an injury to his arm. Allan Aliali, a journalist for Gbagbo's party newspaper Notre Voie, who was also on board the plane, told U.N. radio he had seen three bodies in Soro's cabin in the plane, but could not identify them. A Reuters reporter later saw Soro arrive unharmed at the rebels' headquarters in Bouake, although other members of his entourage had visible injuries. Some more seriously wounded people were taken to the city's hospital for treatment. Rebel reinforcements threw a security cordon around the headquarters and deployed troops across the city and at the airport. News of the attack pushed futures prices for cocoa -- of which Ivory Coast is the world's top producer -- to four-year highs in London and New York. "DEAFENING NOISE" "A minute after we landed, we heard a deafening noise. A rocket came through the plane and when I got up I saw blood everywhere," said a local television journalist who had been travelling on the plane, his trousers stained with blood. After years of stop-start peace efforts, a deal signed in March in Ouagadougou, capital of neighbouring Burkina Faso, has led to progress in dismantling a U.N.-policed military buffer zone cutting the country in two. "It's too soon to know who was responsible, but clearly we're thinking about people in Soro's own movement who are not happy with the way things have turned out," Gilles Yabi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told Reuters. "The agreement was a real step forward in the peace process, but it was still fragile because the (citizen) identification process had not yet begun ... and of course because of tensions in the rebel camp," he said. France, which ruled Ivory Coast until independence in 1960, has troops stationed in the country helping back up more than 7,000 U.N. peacekeepers. France has scaled back its deployment to 3,500 troops from 4,000 since the March agreement. "France strongly condemns this cowardly attack and reaffirms its solidarity with the whole Ivory Coast nation and people," French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said in a statement. "It underlines the urgent need to continue the reconciliation process undertaken in the framework of the Ouagadougou agreement," he sa
