 SREEPUR, Gazipur, June 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Saturday said that an election roadmap would be declared by mid-July to clear the way for the ninth national parliamentary polls to be held by end-2008. "We will declare the roadmap after discussions with consultants," the CEC said at a press conference after the concluding ceremony of the voter- listing pilot project in Sreepur, Gazipur. Huda was the chief guest at the ceremony. He said the roadmap would provide an idea about when the elections would be held. It would also mention when the voter list with photographs would be prepared for each area. Mizanur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur, presided over the meeting, also joined by election commissioners Sahul Hussain and Shakhawat Hossain. The project that started in Sreepur on June 10, listed about 41,076 residents as voters. National ID cards were also distributed among them as part of the project. The chief of the main polls office described the project as satisfactory and said the final voter list would be prepared based on the Sreepur experience. Work on the final voter list is set to take off in Rajshahi City Corporation by mid-July during which, besides army cooperation, assistance of political parties and NGOs would be taken, he said. Mobile telephone companies will be requested to send SMSs to subscribers to make them aware about the voter listing. Publicity will also be carried out through advertisements in the media, he added. bdnews24.co
