 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Double former champion Serena Williams, firing on all cylinders after recovering from a hamstring injury, overpowered Venezuela's Milagros Sequera 6-1 6-0 on Friday to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon. "I have always thought I would be number one again," a super-confident Williams said after her 43-minute demolition job on Centre Court. Williams, whose ranking plummeted after injury problems last year, defied the odds by winning the Australian Open in January as world number 81. She said Wimbledon was one of her favourite tournaments. "I'm feeling really positive. I feel like I'm going to get there," Williams added. The seventh seed utterly dominated Wimbledon's show court against a demoralised opponent, who knew exactly what to expect after losing to the American at the French Open. "It definitely felt like one of the quickest matches in a long time but I felt really focused," she told reporters. Being free from injury lifted a great weight off Serena's shoulders. "It is definitely a mental relief knowing I don't have the pain I had before," she said. "My hamstring is a lot better which I'm really excited about. It's the first time I've felt this good. It is all coming together." Williams, holder of eight grand slam titles, meets Slovak Daniela Hantuchova in the fourth round on her way to a possible quarter-final clash with top seed Justine Henin. Asked about meeting Henin, Williams said: "I have to win another match still. I have a very tough fourth round match. I have to get over that hump first." Serena was also confident that her sister Venus, three times a Wimbledon winner, could topple number two seed Maria Sharapova whom she is on course to meet in the fourth round. "Venus has the game to beat Maria. She runs like the wind and she is so tall.
