 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The National Council of Bangladesh Diabetic Association Saturday decided to extend contracts of 194 inpatient medical officers, raising high possibility that doctors will not return to strike. The council also said uniform service rules would be approved by a related committee shortly in line with the demand of inpatient doctors. Some doctors said they might withdraw their plan for further strike. But they will ask the authorities to set a deadline to meet all the demands. In a statement after the national council's meeting, the association said it decided to extend the contracts of the medical officers every three years and design new rules to make their jobs permanent. About 300 doctors appointed on contract went on strike from Monday demanding job extensions or permanent contracts, throwing healthcare services into disarray. They called off the strike for two days after a meeting with hospital authorities Thursday. The doctors had threatened an indefinite strike from July 1 if their demands were not met at the national council. They have seen their contracts renewed every three years since 1996, but authorities on June 24 decided not to go for an extension of the jobs of the doctors, sparking off the protest. bdnews
