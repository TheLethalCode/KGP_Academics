 WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The surprise resignation of the International Monetary Fund's head prompted calls for the search for his replacement to reach beyond Europe, but European finance officials quickly laid claim to the succession. Europe has provided all the IMF's leaders since the Fund's inception after World War Two in 1945. Rodrigo Rato, a former Spanish finance minister, was the most recent in a long line. Similarly, the World Bank is typically headed by an American, shutting out Japan and developing countries. Rato's resignation came just weeks after debate raged over the selection of the next president of the IMF's sister organisation, the World Bank, following the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz over his promotion of a companion. "It's very early days since Rato's departure came out of the blue, but at some point I would expect the Europeans, given this tradition to put forward a candidate," a European finance official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Both financial institutions, whose biggest contributors are the United States and Europe, are under pressure to give more say to emerging countries in how they are run. But the European official said: "I would be rather surprised if, so soon after the United States put one of their own at the World Bank, all of a sudden the whole arrangement were called into question." The IMF has started a reform process it hopes will give a bigger voice to the rest of the world, so opening up the selection of Rato's replacement to non-Europeans would be critical, an IMF board official from a developing country said. "It will be important for the credibility of that reform process that the selection process is opened up to candidates other than a European," the official told Reuters. The ousting of Wolfowitz challenged the US leadership of the poverty-fighting World Bank. But the board of member countries last week still unanimously chose another American for the job, approving US former secretary of state, Robert Zoellick, who starts on July 1. Rato has been IMF managing director since 2004, when he succeeded Germany's Horst Koehler. The Spaniard said on Thursday he would leave after the institution's meetings in October. Just hours after his announcement, IMF commentators and development groups said it was time to change the long tradition of a European heading the IMF. "Rather than limiting the search to Europe, the governors of the IMF should open up the playing field and draw on the expertise of leaders in developing countries," said Bernice Romero, Oxfam International's advocacy and campaigns director. Kenneth Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist and now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he was worried that Washington would not press for change in the IMF selection process because European allies had backed Zoellick. "If anything good came out of the whole Wolfowitz debacle, it was the recognition that the days when the Americans hand-picked the head of the World Bank and the Europeans hand-picked the head of the IMF had come to an end," he said. "It would certainly be a shame if this was something that was done in the backroom as a political compromise and quality doesn't come into the equation," Rogoff added. While Rato's announcement was a surprise, there was already a flurry of speculation about possible successors. Among names cited were Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and France's Jean Lemierre who heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Bank of Italy governor Mario Draghi, another potential candidate, was quick to rule himself out. A central bank spokesman said Draghi was not interested in the IMF job. Rato and Koehler, now Germany's president, have said that the selection of the next IMF leaders should be opened up and based on candidates' qualifications. Rato was selected as the IMF's chief three years ago despite a push by developing countries to open up the selection process by nominating a second candidate, Mohamed El Erian, for the job. A straw vote by the IMF's 24-member executive board produced a majority in favor of the Spaniard, whose departure comes before he has completed his full five-year tenu
