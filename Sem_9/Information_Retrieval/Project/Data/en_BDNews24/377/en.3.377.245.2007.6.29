 SRINAGAR, India, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A stalagmite which occurs annually in a cave shrine deep in the Himalayas is melting fast, officials said on Friday, disappointing Hindu pilgrims who worship it as a symbol of Lord Shiva. Every year, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims trek through treacherous mountains in revolt-torn Kashmir, along icy streams, glacier-fed lakes and frozen passes, to reach the Amarnath cave, located at an altitude of 3,800 metres (12,700 feet). The phallus-shaped stalagmite is believed to be a symbol of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and regeneration. The pilgrimage, one of Hinduism's holiest, is due to begin officially this year on Saturday, although thousands have already visited the shrine. "It is melting very fast," N K Raina, director of the Amarnath Shrine Board, told reporters, adding that when the stalagmite was last measured on May 25 it was 12 feet (3.5 metres) tall and its circumference was 8 feet (2.5 metres). "Now, it has reduced to almost one-tenth of its original size," he said, without elaborating on the reasons. Syed Iqbal Hasnain, a glaciologist at New Delhi's Centre for Policy Research, blamed it on a combination of factors. "One is, the number of pilgrims have increased dramatically, generating more heat. Also, atmospheric temperatures attributable to climate change have also gone up in recent years," he said. BAD OMEN The size of the stalagmite has varied in previous years depending on the weather. Last year, pilgrims were outraged when authorities reportedly used snow to create a stalagmite as the natural ice formation failed to show up at the start of the pilgrimage. Many Hindus consider the melting as a bad omen. "Last year, it did not appear, and this year there are reports it is melting fast. I think Lord Shiva is angry with us," said Rajni Goswami, a 55-year-old housewife, who is due to start for Amarnath on Saturday. "I will still travel to the holy cave and pray for peace in Kashmir." Shiv Kumar, a pilgrim from the northern Indian city of Lucknow who visited the cave this week, said he was "deeply saddened" by the "very small size" of the stalagmite. The pilgrimage has been targeted several times by Islamist separatist militants fighting against New Delhi's rule in India's only Muslim-majority state. Last year, over a dozen pilgrims were wounded in attacks. Security, as a result, has been stepped up over the years and thousands of troops guard the 330-km (200-mile) route taken by pilgrims. Officials say more than 42,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in the insurgency since it first erupted in 1989. Human rights groups put the toll at about 60,0
