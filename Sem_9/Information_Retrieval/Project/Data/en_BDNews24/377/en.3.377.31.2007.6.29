 Bandarban, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  Two more platoons have joined in a massive manhunt for Danida official Hossain Shahid Sumon as the army arrested three local suspects Friday, four days into his abduction from Khiburipara under Thanchi upazila in Bandarban. An army officer, preferring anonymity, said operations were bolstered following the rescue of Danida driver Hanif Thursday. Khiburipara and its surroundings were being thoroughly combed in search of Sumon, he said. The officer also said three locals arrested on suspicion Thursday were Aung Thwai Ching, Hlathwa Pru and Aung Kia Nue. The arrestees said a gang of 12 alleged miscreants executed the abduction for ransom, security officials said. bdnews24.com Chittagong bureau chief Faruque Iqbal said Chittagong divisional commissioner Mokhlesur Rahman confirmed the arrest of the three suspects Thursday in Bandarban. "The rescue operations are on, but inclement weather Thursday hampered the efforts to an extent. A new army contingent joined the operations Friday morning," Rahman said. Officials related to the operations said the security forces launched a three-pronged rescue operation to search out the abducted Danida official in an expanded zone including Khiburipara. A gang of 10/12 people abducted the Danida programme officer and driver Hanif at gunpoint from Khiburipara Monday afternoon. The security forces rescued Hanif Thursday morning. Based on information from Hanif, the law and order personnel deployed there were carrying out an intensive search for the official. bdnews24.com/
