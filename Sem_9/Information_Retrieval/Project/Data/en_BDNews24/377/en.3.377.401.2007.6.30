<TEXT>
 MILAN, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan President Silvio Berlusconi has said he would like to see Inter's Brazilian striker Adriano make a shock switch to his team. Italian champions Inter have numerous forward options after beating bitter rivals Milan to the signing of Cagliari striker David Suazo. Brazilian Adriano suffered a loss of form and fitness last season but Berlusconi is still a fan. "I have always liked Adriano a lot and I think that at Milan among many Brazilians he would fit well," the former Italian prime minister told Saturday's Gazzetta dello Sport. Berlusconi also said Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had priced Milan out of a bid to bring back striker Andriy Shevchenko despite a tough first season in England. "For me in the first place there is always Shevchenko but Abramovich asks too much," said Berlusconi. "Shevchenko would have no problems returning and I am convinced he would be an ideal attacker to play with Ronaldo. "Then there is Ronaldinho, but I know that is an impossible dream because the president of Barcelona has told me he could not remain in Spain if he sold Ronaldinho. Samuel Eto'o is very good but also with him negotiations are very difficult." Berlusconi also reiterated that the club would not sell Brazil playmaker Kaka amid interest from Real Madrid and played down expectations over the possible arrivals of striker Antonio Cassano and midfielder Emerson from the Spanish champions
