 WASHINGTON, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Panama signed a free trade pact on Thursday, nearly 18 years after the United States invaded the country and almost eight years after it ceded control of Panama's canal. "Today's signing marks the beginning of a new era in the long-standing, yet still evolving commercial partnership between the United States and Panama," US Trade Representative Susan Schwab said. The trade deal would be one of the first to be submitted to the new Democratic-controlled Congress. Business groups are hopeful the pact will be approved, but no date has been set yet for the vote. Panama's national assembly is expected to meet in early July to ratify the pact. The agreement tears down tariffs and other trade barriers between the two countries in manufacturing, services and other sectors. Over 88 percent of US exports of consumer and industrial goods to Panama will become duty-free immediately, with remaining tariffs to be phased out over 10 years. "This agreement reinforces the shared vision of both countries that trade can become a major tool for economic and social growth," Panama's Commerce and Industry Minister Alejandro Ferrer said. The United States invaded Panama in December 1989 and deposed its military leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted on US charges of cocaine trafficking, racketeering and money laundering and remains imprisoned in Miami. In Panama City, approximately 200 people gathered in front of the Trade and Industry Ministry to protest the signing of the agreement. Labor groups and students who organized the rally expressed concerns over potential job losses if the country's farmers and companies cannot compete against their US counterparts. According to US figures for 2006, the United States had a trade surplus of $2.3 billion with Panama. The total trade in goods in the same year was valued at $3.1 billion. Panamanian negotiators were concerned that the agreement not be seen by their countrymen as returning control of the Panama Canal to the United States just as the country was embarking on a project to expand the waterway. The agreement was signed at the Organization of American States in the same room where the two countries signed a treaty 30 years ago ceding full control of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999. The pact guarantees Panama's construction firms at least 10 percent of the contracts in the $5.25 billion canal expansion, while providing US companies preferred access to one of the largest building projects in the world. It also gives Panama's farmers more access to the US sugar market, a sensitive sector for the United States. More than half of current US farm exports to Panama, including high-quality beef and other meat and poultry products, will become duty-free immediately, with most other farm tariffs phased out over 15 years.
