 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com) - BIRDEM hospital doctors halted their strike until Saturday after a meeting with hospital authorities. About 300 doctors appointed on contract had called the strike Monday demanding job extensions or permanent contracts. They had threatened an indefinite strike if their demands were not met at the June 30 national council meeting. The doctors agreed to return to work Thursday after a meeting with the authorities at the hospital auditorium. Director of clinical services Professor Nazmun Nahar and other senior staff requested the doctors to call off their strike until June 30 when their case would be considered. However, hospital authorities said they would be unable to take a final decision on that date as Bangladesh Diabetic Association president Professor AK Azad is abroad. The demonstrators nevertheless submitted a memorandum seeking a deadline for the fulfillment of their demands. Approximately 350 medical officers, assistant registrars, registrars and specialists of the hospital's inpatient division are appointed on a contractual basis by BIRDEM. Their contracts had been renewed every three years since 1996, but authorities recently decided not to extend their contracts sparking off the protest. Admission of patients for inpatient treatment has been non-existent since June 25 when the authorities failed to renew the contracts in question. Several hundred patients from across the country seeking admission to the hospital have had to return home untreated during this period, said inpatient doctors. According to the register available at the room of a resident doctor, 188 out of about 600 beds were empty until Thursday noon, when two patients were admitted for treatment. bdne
