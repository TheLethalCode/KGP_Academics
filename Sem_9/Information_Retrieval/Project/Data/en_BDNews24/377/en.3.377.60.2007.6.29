<TITLE> Dalai Lama's envoys in China, hoping for talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Envoys of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, flew to China on Friday in hopes of resuming dialogue, but a member of Tibet's parliament-in-exile was not optimistic about a breakthrough. Lodi Gyari, the Dalai Lama's top envoy in Washington, and Kelsang Gyaltsen arrived in Shanghai from India, accompanied by two senior assistants, according to a source with knowledge of the trip. He declined to provide further details to avoid upsetting China, which has insisted the talks be shrouded in secrecy. The cabinet spokesman's office and Foreign Ministry declined immediate comment. China's state media have not mentioned the visit. It was not immediately clear if the envoys would hold a sixth round of talks with officials of the Communist Party's United Front Work Department, responsible for dealing with religious leaders and winning over non-Communists. "It is important to go to Beijing to meet people. But instead the envoys are being shown how good China is doing," said Khedroob Thondup, a member of Tibet's parliament-in-exile. The five previous rounds were also held behind closed doors. The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since fleeing his predominantly Buddhist Himalayan homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against Communist rule. China and the Dalai Lama's envoys have been engaged in conciliatory talks since 2002, although little progress has been made. Analysts say the desire for dialogue is driven in part by fear on both sides that if the winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize dies in exile, it could lead to trouble in his homeland. But Khedroob Thondup said China resumed dialogue because of U.S. pressure on Beijing to mend fences with the Dalai Lama. The London-based Tibet Info Net said the envoys would return to India on July 5 after discussing a plan for the Dalai Lama to make a pilgrimage to China. "A proposal by the Dalai Lama to go for a pilgrimage in China is expected to be a central topic of the discussions," it said. But Khedroob Thondup was not optimistic. "With Beijing's growing hardline stance, is there any hope of a breakthrough in the talks between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and Beijing?" Khedroob Thondup asked. Comments by Qiangba Puncog, chairman of Tibet's regional government, at a news conference in Beijing this month "confirm Beijing's continued resistance to accept the Dalai Lama's sincere efforts to resolve the Tibetan issue", said Khedroob Thondup, a nephew of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama says he wants greater autonomy, not independence, for his homeland, but China considers him a separatist. China put the squeeze on the Dalai Lama's overseas trips recently. This month, China protested against Australian Prime Minister John Howard's meeting with the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama scrapped a planned visit to Brussels in May after the Belgian government informed him of Chinese displeasure ahead of a trip to China by Belgium's Prince Fil
