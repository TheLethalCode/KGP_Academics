 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An undefeated 55 by Owais Shah guided England to a five-wicket win over West Indies in the second and final Twenty20 international at The Oval on Friday. The home team were facing their second defeat in as many days when Shah was joined at the wicket by Dmitri Mascarenhas (18 not out) but the pair added 69 in 36 balls to take England to victory with three balls to spare. Captain Paul Collingwood (27) and Matt Prior (22) also chipped in with valuable knocks. Photo Earlier, West Indies totalled 169 for seven largely thanks to a 37-ball 61 from skipper Chris Gayle. Opening batsman Gayle struck one six and eight fours before he became one of two victims for Collingwood. Marlon Samuels added a quickfire 42 in 20 balls including three sixes and three fours. The teams play the first in a three-match series of one-day internationals at Lord's on Sunda
