 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com) Law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein Thursday blamed previous governments and politicians for the country's present tainted image. "Some people still don't feel ashamed to speak out for the corrupt people," he said at a meeting with district officials of the Directorate of Registration at the Judicial Administrative Training Institute in Dhaka. Mainul said the interim government is a "crisis management" one that came to power when the country was in deep crisis. "The present government has taken steps to reform various levels of the administration and will look into bringing changes to the highest level too," the adviser said. bdnews24.com/m
