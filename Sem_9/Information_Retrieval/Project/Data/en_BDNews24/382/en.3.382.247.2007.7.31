 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday governmental measures to contain soaring inflation have failed. "The administrative measures undertaken by the government have not succeeded in containing inflation," the ADB said in its quarterly economic update on Bangladesh. The ADB said point-to-point inflation had climbed from 5.9 percent in January to 8.1 percent in May. Food inflation rose to 8.4 percent in May from 6.7 percent in January while non-food inflation increased to 7.8 percent from 5 percent in the same period. According to the ADB report, the rise was due to growing domestic demand, with higher incomes combined with continued high monetary and credit growth also contributing. The multilateral lending agency added that ongoing flooding and further rises in the price of international commodities are likely to worsen the level of inflation further. The ADB said the drive against corruption should be more targeted to ensure the informal economy is not affected. ADB's Bangladesh representative Hua Du and head economist Rezaul Karim Khan spoke to reporters at the report's launch. Hua Du said: "I hope inflation will be contained." However she did point to the current severe flooding as a cause for concern. The report praised the central bank's decision to adopt a more cautious monetary policy and its attempt to control budgetary borrowing in order to mitigate any adverse inflationary pressure. The report maintained that Bangladesh is still likely to achieve improved GDP growth of around 7-8 percent over the medium term. Risks that could affect healthy growth remain political uncertainty, infrastructure constraints, vulnerability in the garment sector and increasingly tough global competition. Investment declined by a 0.4 percentage point to 24.3 percent in 2007, mainly due to falling public investment. The bank said Bangladesh's indecision over foreign direct investment proposals, amounting to $11 billion, could drive potential investors overseas. Industrial growth was 0.2 percentage point lower, at 9.5 percent, in FY 2007 from the previous year's figure. The services sector witnessed 6.7 percent growth in 2007, up from 6.4 percent in 2006. According to the bank, exports and imports grew strongly although the rising trade deficit was offset by a 25 percent surge in workers' remittances, which resulted in a surplus of $468 million in the current account. Hua Du said: "The anticorruption drive will benefit the country in the long run. The ADB is fully supportive of the government's anti-corruption efforts." bd
