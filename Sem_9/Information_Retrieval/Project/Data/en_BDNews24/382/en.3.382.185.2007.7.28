<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA President Sepp Blatter has hailed Iraq's inspiring performance to reach the Asian Cup final as further proof of sport's ability to achieve the seemingly impossible. Blatter, who will attend Sunday's final between Iraq and Saudi Arabia in Jakarta, said Iraq's achievement showed the unifying powers of football at their very best. "To have the national team of Iraq in the final is definitely a great achievement when emotions are at their highest," Blatter told a news conference on Saturday. "This proves, if it was necessary, how football enhances the good national feeling of the people who are suffering so much in the past few years." Iraq's fairytale ride has captured the imagination of the sporting world and propelled the Asian Cup into uncharted waters with even U.S. media outlets joining the rush to report on their unlikely success. Most of the interest has focused around the effect the team's progress has had in Iraq, uniting a country ravaged by sectarian violence. The squad is made up of Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish players, moulded together by a Brazilian coach, Jorvan Vieira, but there is no room for politics in this team. The squad have united under a common goal and their bonding has become infectious with millions of people staying glued to their television screens for the team's matches. "It is tremendous what is happening in Iraq," Blatter said. What the players have done is exceptional.
