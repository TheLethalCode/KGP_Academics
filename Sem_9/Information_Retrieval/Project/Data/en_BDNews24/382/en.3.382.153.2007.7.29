 NEW DELHI, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A popular Indian actress Nandita Das is starring in a Pakistani film about a boy who accidentally strays into India is hoping that the touching story will move people in both countries and bring them closer. 'Ramchand Pakistani,' inspired by a real-life incident, examines the emotional turmoil of a 7-year-old boy and his father after they inadvertently cross into India and are jailed, while the mother is left pining for them in Pakistan.

Das, who has acted in more than 30 films in 10 different Indian languages, said she enjoyed 'complete comfort' working in Pakistan, where the language and even the food were familiar. But she rued that Indians were less aware of the cinema and culture of Pakistan, which had many serious filmmakers who were more enthusiastic and committed than many Indian counterparts. "We tend to get a bit complacent in India," said Das, known for her performances in two of Deepa Mehta's element trilogy 'Fire' and '1947: Earth.' "After all, we make about a thousand films annually.
