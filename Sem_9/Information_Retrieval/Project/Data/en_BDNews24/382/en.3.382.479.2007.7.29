<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  The countrywide flooding is set to worsen further in the next 24 hours from 6am Sunday as major river systems continued swelling, said the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) Sunday. An FFWC bulletin said nine rivers were flowing over the danger level at 16 points and the floods were likely to assume graver proportions in case of heavier rainfalls across the country. With the floods getting worse, river erosion in many regions has aggravated. A number of poulders and embankments have been breached by the onrushing waters to inundate fresh areas. Communication systems suffered serious disruptions as highways, motorways, railway tracks, bridges and culverts have either been submerged or washed away at places. The marooned people have been reported to be looking helplessly for dry shelter for their families and livestock, if any. Country boats and makeshift rafts are now their major means of commuting. Almost all the stricken areas are reeling under scarcity of food and safe drinking water. The army is helping out local administrations in providing relief for the victims. The FFWC said the Dharla swelled further and the river was flowing 77 cm above the danger mark at Kurigram. The Teesta was flowing 29 cm above the danger level at Dalia point in Rangpur. The Brahmaputra was flowing 47 cm above the danger mark at Noonkhawa point and 57 cm above the red mark at Chilmari, the FFWC said. The Jamuna too swelled further and was flowing 68, 80 and 65 cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad, Sirajganj and Aricha points. The Dhaleswari was flowing 15 cm above the danger level at Rekabi point. The Padma also surged further and was flowing 87 and 33 cm above the danger mark at Goalando and Bhagyakul points. Both the Surma and the Kushiyara continued to swell, worsening flood situation on Sylhet. The Surma was flowing 128, 35, 69, 26 and 26 cm above the danger level at Kanaighat, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Shyaola and Amalshid points. The Someswari also rose further to aggravate the flooding in Durgapur. The river there was flowing 183 cm above the danger mark. bdnew
