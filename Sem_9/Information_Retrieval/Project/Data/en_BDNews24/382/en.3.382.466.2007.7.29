 BOSTON, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Software company VMware Inc said on Friday that networking equipment maker Cisco Systems will buy a $150 million stake in the company as parent EMC Corp prepares to take it public in a highly anticipated IPO. Cisco will pay $25 per share for about 1.6 percent of its total outstanding common stock, VMware said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. VMware said it would also consider appointing a Cisco executive to its board in the future. The agreement is similar to one that VMware announced with Intel Corp on July 9, under which it would sell a 2.5 percent stake to Intel for $23 a share. It was not immediately clear why Cisco would pay more than Intel. Cisco said the deal was worth it but declined to elaborate. "We believe the price of our own investment is attractive given the long-term value potential of VMWare and the strategic benefits of the investment," said Cisco spokesman John Noh. EMC has said it expects VMware's initial public offering to be priced between $23 and $25 per share. VMware sells software that companies use to help manage data centers. It allows them to run a single server computer as if it were multiple machines, using a technology known as virtualization. Companies can save money using the software because they're able to reduce the number of computers they need to run their business. The `virtual' machines that they build with VMware programs can quickly be moved from one server to another, in some cases traveling across computer networks to data centers around the world. In its announcement, VMware said it plans to expand its current collaboration efforts with Cisco to accelerate use of VMware's software products with Cisco network infrastructure. EMC has said it aims to conclude VMware's initial public offering before the end of next month. VMware's chief competitors include No 1 software maker Microsoft Corp, which is preparing to introduce new line virtualization software next year. Two other main rivals are privately held start-ups Virtual Iron, whose investors include Intel and software maker SAP AG, and XenSource Inc, whose investors include Silicon Valley venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins, Sevin Rosen and Accel Partners. EMC shares edged up 2 cents to $18.41 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoo
