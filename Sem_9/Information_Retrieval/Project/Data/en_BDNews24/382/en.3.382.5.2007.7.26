<TITLE> Former French PM to be questioned on smear scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin will be questioned by judges on Friday over allegations that he took part in an attempt to smear Nicolas Sarkozy before he was elected president. His appearance is the latest twist in a rancorous scandal that nearly tore the centre-right government apart last year as Jacques Chirac's 12-year presidency drew to a close. Villepin, who was questioned last year, has denied any involvement in the case in which Sarkozy's name appeared on a faked list of accounts purportedly held at Luxembourg-based securities clearing house Clearstream. But after months of combing through mountains of files and cryptic notes of conversations and hours of prising information from reluctant witnesses, judges have taken aim at the former prime minister directly. They have searched Villepin's house and offices and may place him under official investigation, a step that can lead to trial but which does not imply guilt. The former prime minister is expected to claim that any actions he undertook were related to his ministerial functions, which is likely to complicate the investigation. Villepin, a former diplomat close to Chirac and Sarkozy, the interior minister in his government and head of the ruling UMP party, were bitter rivals who made little secret of their antipathy as they struggled over who would succeed Chirac. But the "Clearstream affair" gave their hostility a special intensity amid suspicions that Villepin used the affair in the hope of sinking his rival's presidential ambitions. Even by the murky standards of French political intrigue, the affair is a twisted story apparently reaching into the top levels of the state and featuring spies, forgery, anonymous tip-offs and deleted computer files. The affair emerged in 2004 when anonymous letters were sent to a magistrate alleging that Sarkozy and other senior politicians held accounts at Clearstream linked to the controversial sale of frigates to Taiwan on 1991. The claims proved to be spurious and the focus of investigations switched to who was behind the denunciation, which was apparently aimed at damaging Sarkozy. Earlier this month, deleted files recovered from the computer of intelligence officer Philippe Rondot fuelled suspicions Villepin himself may have been behind the anonymous tip-off, leaving him open to charges of complicity in false accusations. Villepin was an ordinary minister at the time the scandal broke and he has said he was simply fulfilling his duties to check up on rumours of wrongdoing by a cabinet colleague. "Dominique de Villepin reaffirms at this point in time that he acted strictly in accordance with his duties as foreign affairs minister and (then) interior minister and denies any criminal involvement in this case," a statement he issued earlier this month said. Sarkozy says he was not informed about the allegations until months later and knew nothing about Villepin's investigation, despite the fact they were serving in the same government. As well as Villepin, the current interior minister and former defence minister Michele Alliot-Marie may also be implicated in the affair following claims that she was told of the anonymous denunciations before they became publ
