<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31(bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson's adviser Hannan Shah Tuesday said the proposed reforms to the BNP are designed to drop Khaleda Zia to execute the so-called 'Minus Two formula'. "To implement the Minus Two formula, the reform proposal has been placed to drop the name of party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia," he said at a news conference at his Mohakhali DOHS home. He referred to the alleged move by the military-backed emergency government to exile former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina from politics. "I have by now come to know from discussions with district and upazilla level leaders that the so-called reformists have no support at the grassroots level," Hannan said. He accused the so-called reformists led by BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan of not minding some procedural defects in rolling out the proposal. "Before taking any proposal to the council, the proposal itself will have to scrutinised by the sub-committee. This policy embedded in the party constitution has not been adhered to". Hannan said BNP leaders and workers do not support the proposed proposals and warned that "reformists" would be isolated from the party if they excluded the party chairperson. Hannan Shah rejected the allegation of BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain that he was creating misgivings in the party. "It amounts to passing the buck on others. Small splits in the party do not matter. Leaders and workers in the party are united and will remain united." Hannan said the statement of ZA Khan, another adviser to the BNP chairperson that he was adviser to the party was made without his not knowing the party constitution. He said after his return from Sylhet Sunday, he had talks with Khaleda, who wanted to know about the situation. He said she had told him she would have stood by the flood-affected people had the situation in the country not been what it was now. Reacting to Hannan's remark, BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain said, "Whether BNP reformists will be isolated or not is the view of Hannan Shah. We are presenting a draft proposal not only to the party but to the nation." "The councillors will consider the proposals. How can Hannan Shah announce the consequences before the council is held? It is not comprehensible to me," he said after meeting at his Gulshan home. "Hannan Shah was not associated with the party for long. He does not know how the council of the party is held. That is why he should not make one-sided observation on the issue," he told reporters. "We are presenting a draft proposal to the nation in line with the party constitution. There may be opinion for and against the proposal. All will be finalised at the council session." "If he has any proposal, he should place it at the council. He can also present a separate draft proposal." BNP district leaders and former parliamentarians from Faridpur, Sylhet, Bogra, Pabna and Meherpur met Bhuiyan Tuesday. bdnews24
