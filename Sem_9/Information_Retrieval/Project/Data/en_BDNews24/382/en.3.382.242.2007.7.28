 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) - Two goals each from Iddi Badanbuze and Nicodemus Gichana Anunda powered Arambagh KS to a 4-2 win over Chittagong Mohammedan SC in the second-leg encounter of B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. It was their eighth win in 19 matches that took Arambagh KS to the fifth place with 26 points and the port city's black and white outfit slipped to the sixth position with 25 points playing as many outings. Arambagh KS, who have the lone match against Dhaka Mohammedan SC on August 1, came from behind to take a sweet revenge of their 2-0 loss in their away match against the same rivals as the hosts enjoyed a superior ball possession in the match, which locked 1-1 in the first half. Mohammedan, who hosts Sheikh Russel KC in their last match on August 1, went ahead in the 16th minute with the strike from Mohammad Yousuf, but their lead did not last for long as Ugandan striker Iddi reimbursed the goal six minutes later. After the breather, Kenyan striker Nicodemus gave Arambagh lead in the 51st minute and Iddi made it 3-1 two minutes later. Then, Nicodemus widened the Arambagh margin 4-1 in the 63rd minute before Asif Yousuf converted a penalty to reduce the visitors' margin to 4-2 in the 67th minute.
