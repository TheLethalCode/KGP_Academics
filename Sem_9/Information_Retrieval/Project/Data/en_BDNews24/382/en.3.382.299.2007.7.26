 ANKARA, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A lawyer charged with killing a top judge last year in a case that fueled tensions between Turkey's government and secularists was quoted on Thursday as saying he had also planned to assassinate the president. The attack in May 2006 inside the Council of State, the top administrative court, shocked Turkey and sparked mass secular protests against the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party. The main suspect, lawyer Alparslan Arslan, has said he acted in protest against a ban on the Muslim headscarf in schools and universities. The courts, part of Turkey's powerful secular establishment, strongly support the headscarf ban. In a court hearing on Thursday, the state Anatolian news agency quoted Arslan as saying: "The aim of the attack was to punish the shameful actions against God's religion, the Prophet and Muslims."

"These people (the secularists) have crossed the boundary. They think they can insult us easily whenever they like," Anatolian quoted Arslan as saying. Sezer, a former judge himself, is a staunch defender of the secular order and a critic of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, which was re-elected with a comfortable majority in last Sunday's parliamentary election. Tensions with the secularists are rising again amid signs that the AK Party will field Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as its candidate to replace Sezer as president. Secularists, including the army generals, fear Gul and Erdogan, both ex-Islamists, want to undermine Turkey's strict separation of state and religion, a claim they deny. Sezer's term ended in May but he was forced to remain in office as interim president after opposition parties blocked Gul's first attempt in parliament to be elected head of state. In last year's gun attack, Arslan killed one judge and wounded four others. Arslan has also been charged with bombing the secularist newspaper Cumhuriyet. He faces life imprisonment if convicted. Erdogan has suggested the courthouse attack was the work of a shadowy right-wing group aiming to discredit his government and its efforts to boost religious freedoms in Turk
