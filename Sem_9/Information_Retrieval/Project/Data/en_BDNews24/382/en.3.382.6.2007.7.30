<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Monday said he was overjoyed by the High Court bail to Sheikh Hasina. "We are happy and overjoyed as Sheikh Hasina has been granted bail. It proves the truth always wins," Zillur said, after the High Court approved bail for the detained former prime minister. Zillur said, "I hope the authorities will not abuse the law in future. If they do so, it will be very sad." He alleged that the Awami League president had been insulted and harassed in an "illegal and motivated way". Thanking Hasina's lawyers, Zillur said people would lose respect for the law if the government continues abusing it. On showing Hasina arrested in a case filed by businessman Noor Ali he said: "The authorities know that if cases are filed against Sheikh Hasina those won't hold out in court. "She has been shown arrested to stop her coming out of jail." Asked what they would do if more cases are piled against Hasina he said, "If it happens we will appeal to the High Court so that no more cases can be filed without court permission. "People's tolerance is thinning. I have kept leaders and workers quiet. If anybody wants to run the country infuriating people, I have nothing to say." bdnews
