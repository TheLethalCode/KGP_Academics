 MANILA, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea called on the United States on Tuesday to scrap a strict trade ban and drop it from a list of countries Washington says sponsor terrorism, promising steps in retun that would improve ties between the adversaries. Jong Song-il, a spokesman for North Korea's delegation at an East Asian security meeting in Manila, told reporters Pyongyang had been "very active" in implementing its obligations under agreements reached during six-party talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear programmes, and others should reciprocate.

Talks between the countries this month failed to produce a deadline for those steps. All six parties are in Manila for the security meeting this week, but no substantive talks between them are planned. Several sets of working-level talks will be held in August and more senior officials will meet in Septemb
