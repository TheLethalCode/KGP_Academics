 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com) - Detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina greeted her only son Sajeeb Wazed Joy on his 36th birthday Friday, one of her lawyers said. Counsel Anisul Huq, who met Hasina at the special jail in the parliament building complex at 4:00pm, said the former prime minister asked him to convey the message to Joy. Joy, who lives in the United States, passed his birthday without talking to his mother. Joy's father and nuclear scientist Wazed Miah is in Square Hospital with multiple complications. It was not clear if Joy talked to his father. Hasina, who faces charges of extortion, was arrested at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16. A Dhaka court later ordered her into the jail pending trial. Hasina and her Awami League denied the charges and said they were designed to stop her taking part in next elections, expected to be held anytime between October and December next year. bdnews24.
