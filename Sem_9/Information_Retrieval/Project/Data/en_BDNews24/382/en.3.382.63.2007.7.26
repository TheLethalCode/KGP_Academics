<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday ordered the release of detained Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim if he faced no other case and ruled his detention was illegal. A panel of Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Syed Md Ziaul Karim gave the ruling after final hearing of a writ appeal filed by Selim's son Sheikh Fazle Fahim Subhash. The court said Selim was detained on unclear charges and observed that detaining a citizen on unspecified allegations during the state of emergency is illegal. The joint forces arrested Selim at his Banani home on May 29. He was produced before the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on May 30, and the court later placed him on a three-day remand. The same court on June 3 ordered him into Dhaka Central Jail. The government on June 5 gave a 30-day detention under Special Powers Act and later had it extended by another 90 days. On May 30, an extortion case was filed against the former health minister in Sheikh Hasina's 1996-2001 cabinet. On July 24, police charged him with an extortion case that also involves Hasina and sister Sheikh Rehana. The case involves alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from a businessman in return to allow his company to build a power plant. Barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapash stood for Selim while deputy attorney general Naima Haider opposed him. bdnews24
