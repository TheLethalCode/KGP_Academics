 Rajshahi, July 26 (bdnews24.com) -- A Rajshahi court Thursday sentenced former BNP minister Aminul Huq to 31 and a half years of rigorous imprisonment for aiding and abetting militants. Judge Rezaul Islam of the Additional Sessions Judge's Court-2 in Rajshahi also slapped Tk 25,000 in fine on the former telecommunications minister who will have to serve out another three years in failure to pay the sum. It is one of the harshest punishments to politicians during the state of emergency. The court also handed down the same jail term to 24 others, including district BNP secretary Shish Mohammad. Aminul Huq, Mohammad and 13 others are fugitives from justice. Local farmer Fazlur Rahman from Baghmara, who was tortured by the militants led by Siddiqul Islam, popularly known as Bangla Bhai, filed a case against 28 people with Bagmara Police Station on March 30. Bangla Bhai, the chief of now outlawed Jama'tul Mujahideen, Bangladesh, was hanged along with five other top militants earlier this year for killing two judges in the southern district of Jhalakathi. The investigating officer of the case, Muktar Hossain, pressed the charges against 27 people on April 23. Additional public prosecutor Nurul Islam stood for the state while advocate Ankur Sen defended the accused. Aminul has been accused in eight cases since the state of emergency was slapped. A court acquitted him in one case. Two days after Fazlur Rahman's case against Aminul, Ayub Ali of Baghmara filed another case against 30 people including the former minister for aiding militants. Mohsin Ali, father of Monwar Hossain Babu, the first to be killed by militants, filed a murder case against 66 people on July 12. Aminul, former deputy minister Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu, former MP Nadim Mostafa, Rajshahi City mayor Mizanur Rahman Minu and ex-Rajshahi police chief Masud Mia were among the accused. Freedom fighter Mujibur Rahman and Alauddin separately sued Aminul for grabbing land and cutting trees. The cases were filed with Godagari Police Station. Golam Mostafa, a resident of Tanore in Rajshahi, filed another case with Tanore Police Station. A court acquitted Amiul of a land-grabbing case, filed by a retired primary schoolteacher, also named Golam Mostafa. bdnews24.com/cor
