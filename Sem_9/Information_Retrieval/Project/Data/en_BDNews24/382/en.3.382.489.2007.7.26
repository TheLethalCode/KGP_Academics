<TEXT>
 ABUJA, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Nigerian court granted bail on Thursday to a former state governor who has been charged with looting public funds, despite a history of governors jumping bail and going into hiding to avoid facing trial. The Abuja High Court set eight conditions for freeing Jolly Nyame, ex-governor of northeastern Taraba state, including that he should leave his travel documents in court, report weekly to the anti-corruption police and pay $2.4 million in sureties. "The defendant is hereby admitted to bail. However any breach of any of these bail conditions would lead to automatic revocation of same," said Justice Adebukola Banjoko. Nyame, who lost his immunity from prosecution when his tenure ended on May 29, stands accused of stealing more than $10 million in Taraba state funds. He is one of five former state governors who were charged with theft in one week by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), a development that gave hope to anti-graft campaigners in one of the world's most corrupt countries. Nigeria's 36 state governors have discretionary powers over millions of dollars of public funds and immunity from prosecution while in office. For decades they were untouchable, left to enjoy their wealth after their tenures ended. That started to change after then-President Olusegun Obasanjo created the EFCC in 2003, although he was widely accused of using it as a political tool against his opponents while stopping it from investigating his friends. During Obasanjo's tenure, two state governors were arrested in Britain over alleged money-laundering but both of them jumped bail and fled back to Nigeria. One other governor went into hiding after he was impeached and lost his immunity. Anti-corruption activists were hoping for better things under President Umaru Yar'Adua, who came to power in May, and the burst of activity from the EFCC was hailed as fast progress. However, the court's decision to grant bail to Nyame casts doubt over how serious the process really is because Nigerian court cases often drag on for years. In many cases, once a person is freed on bail the trial is quietly dropped. Whether or not that happens in Nyame's case will be a test of government resolve to tackle corruption serious
