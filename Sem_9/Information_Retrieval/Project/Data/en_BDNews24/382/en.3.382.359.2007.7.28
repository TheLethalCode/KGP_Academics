<TITLE> Spielberg may quit Games role in Darfur protest: ABC </TITLE>

Spielberg has been criticized for not using his position to push the Chinese government to change its stance on the issue. "Steven will make a determination in the next few weeks regarding his work with the Chinese. Our main interest is ending the genocide.
