 Sylhet, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  Charges were framed Tuesday against four members of a militant Islamic group, Harkatul Jihad, for a grenade attack on British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury. A special court in Sylhet, which deals with arms and explosives cases, fixed the charges of murder and possession of explosives against the accused. Judge Ferdous Ahmed presided over the case. The deadly assault, which targeted the envoy, left a police officer and two others dead with more than 50 seriously wounded, including Choudhury. The four accused allegedly launched the grenade attack in May 2004 in the shrine of preacher Shah Jalal in Sylhet. Choudhury was leaving the shrine after praying when the attack took place. The accused are Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Abdul Hannan and group members Shahedul Alam Bipul, Delwar Hossain Ripon and Mafizur Rahman. Following his arrest in October 2006, Shahedul Alam Bipul confessed in Sylhet's magistrate court to launching the attack. In Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Mufti Hannan also later confessed to supplying the grenade. The accused claimed innocence in court. The court set August 14 for the next hearing. bdnews24.c
