<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Barrister Shafiq Ahmed Saturday said the appointment of nominated directors by the government to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry was a "clear violation of the Companies Act". "It's a violation of the law and should be changed immediately," the lawyer told a roundtable on "Reform to FBCCI and trade bodies", organised by Bangla-language daily Bhorer Kagoj at the National Press Club. Ahmed, an expert of corporate laws, said: "Section 19 of the Companies Act 1994 clearly mentions that directors must be elected to trade bodies direct." Shafiq criticised the government for postponing the FBCCI election after the announcement of an election schedule and scrutiny of candidatures. A section of business leaders has been demanding direct elections to all posts of the FBCCI since 2002 when the then government issued an order nominating 14 directors to the FBCCI board, out of the 38 directors. The remaining 24 directors came through a direct election. Later, 38 directors elected a president and two vice presidents to the board for two years. The trend lingered into the present. "The government generally nominates powerful businessmen, who are hardly seen in FBCCI activities. They are also far removed from grassroots-level businesses," Helal Uddin, president of Dhaka City Shop Owners' Association, told bdnews24.com. "Nominated directors need only six more directors to elect a president of their own choice," the FBCCI director said. Another director, Abu Motaleb, said no president has been appointed to the FBCCI through elections since 2002. Prof Atiur Rahman of Dhaka University said big loan and tax defaulters can "purchase the law". "Even powerful lawyers back them," he added. Monjur Ahmed, a trade expert and FBCCI adviser, blamed the commerce ministry for playing a "whimsical role" in FBCCI activities and its election. bd
