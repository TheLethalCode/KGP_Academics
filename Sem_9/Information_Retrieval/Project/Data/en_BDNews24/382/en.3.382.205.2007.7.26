<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Thursday expressed doubt over the 2008 deadline for elections. "The Election Commission could not yet start work on a voter list. A fair election cannot be held without an accurate voter list," the AL leader told reporters at his Gulshan home. He disagreed with army chief General Moeen U Ahmed on his statement that the two leaders (Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia) were responsible for the present situation in the country. "BNP-Jamaat didn't let an election happen. They are responsible for the present situation," Zillur said. On the sentencing of former state minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir to 13 years in jail, he said: "I doubt whether we will get justice." "Although noted personalities testified for Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir in court, he was jailed for 13 years." Zillur rejected the cases against Hasina as false and said: "The seizure of Sheikh Hasina's car is regrettable." On an adviser's claim that the government did not get any complaint against Jamaat-e-Islami leaders, he said: "We don't agree with him." bdnews
