<TITLE> Barcelona only great on paper so far, says Rijkaard </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard has sought to play down expectations that the "Fantastic Four" of Samuel Eto'o, Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi and new signing Thierry Henry will sweep all before them next season. "On paper we have a great team but we have to prove it on the pitch. Everything starts with hard work and only after that does talent comes into play," Rijkaard said in an interview with sports daily Marca on Sunday. "The important things are work, humility and sacrifice." Barca just missed out on their third successive Primera Liga title last season, finishing level on points with arch-rivals Real Madrid but second due to an inferior head-to head record. They have moved swiftly to reinforce for next season splashing around 65 million euros on France striker Henry, Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure, France left back Eric Abidal and Argentina centre-back Gabriel Milito. But the Dutchman said he would not be pushed into fielding Eto'o, Ronaldinho, Messi and Henry at the same time, as many Barca fans are hoping. GREAT PLAYERS "The pressure doesn't bother me. All fans want to see great players on the pitch but it is up to me to decide. I think they can all play together but it depends on the balance of the team," Rijkaard said. "The season is very long. Everyone will be able to participate and will have their opportunities." That said, press speculation has centred on how the club will manage the egos of the leading players if a likely policy of rotations leaves one or more of them on the bench. Last season's failure to win any major silverware was in part put down to dressing room rifts among big-name players, along with complacency and a general lack of commitment. But Rijkaard believed the new recruits would help refresh the squad instead of causing further headaches. "The signings bring new hope and a change in the squad dynamics where everyone wants to prove their quality and to participate," he said. Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas last week said the problems facing Barca were similar to those that led to the downfall of Real's "Galactico" era under president Florentino Perez. But Rijkaard added: "I would like to thank Real for this message. It would be stupid of us to allow ourselves to slip into a similar dynamic. I think we know what we are doing
