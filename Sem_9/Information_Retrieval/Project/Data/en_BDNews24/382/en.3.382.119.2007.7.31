 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com Correspondent, from Tangail Tangail, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Yusuf Ali and his family have lost everything to the Jamuna. The 65-year-old has spent all his life on the banks of this mighty river. He had borne the onslaught of its deluge in the past too. But this time, as the entire village was eroded and sank chunk by chunk into the muddy waters, he could only look on with helplessness. Over 1,000 people lost their homes in July as the Jamuna devoured the village of Jagatpura in Bhuapur, Tangail. More than 150 families of the village have been driven to take shelter at Jagatpura Naimuddin High School. Yusuf Ali owned a small but thriving farm until just this month. The Jamuna destroyed all 17 bighas (over three and a half acres) of cropland. "I suffer to see my five children live on relief food," he says. "It hurts my dignity," he adds. With the weekly handout of 10 kg of rice at the temporary shelter, Ali is able to manage only one meal a day for everybody in the family. He has already sold three of his five cows. "I will have to sell the other two soon. We don't want relief any more; we want work from the government," says a frustrated Ali. Many in this area are facing similar predicaments. Most of the educated and once solvent families of Bhuapur and Gopalpur upazilas lived in Arjuna union where the village of Jagatpura once stood. After this year's devastating floods, rich and poor alike have been reduced to barely surviving side by side. Local administrators say 70 per cent of Arjuna union has been submerged by floodwaters, while the situation in the neighbouring Gabchhara union is even worse. The whole union now lies under water. There is no emergency shelter for the people as the floodwaters have engulfed the school grounds. Local authorities and members of the joint forces are distributing emergency relief among the flood victims and taking steps to raise tube wells above the flood level. They are attempting to mitigate the impact of the flood, but their measures are proving inadequate. The available relief is failing to meet the people's needs. Those marooned by the seas of floodwater are facing a crisis of drinking water. The surrounding waters have been greatly polluted by human excreta, with very little open space left around existing emergency shelters. The relief agencies are apprehensive about outbreaks of diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases in epidemic proportions. Abdus Sattar, a member of a school management committee in Arjuna, says: "Such diseases usually occur when the flood waters start receding." But such diseases are already affecting the flood victims sheltering at the crowded camp, according to Sattar. "Human excreta is scattered everywhere," he says. "The supply of safe water and oral saline must be increased," Sattar adds. Food and disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury visited the area Tuesday, distributing relief materials among the flood victims. He directed local administrators to intensify emergency assistance. Although the Jamuna is still flowing 38 cm above the danger mark, the adviser assured the people that the government would soon increase emergency provisions to the flood-affected. He expressed dissatisfaction about the poor maintenance of the Water Development Board's flood protection embankments and stressed the need for their proper operation and maintenance. Meanwhile vast tracts of prize farmland have been damaged as much of Bhuapur and Gopalpur upazilas remain inundated. The rising waters of the Jamuna are about to reach road level on the west side of Fakirpara sluice gate in Bhuapur. The road here is serving as a flood control embankment. As the water level is low on the eastern side, however, water pressure is breaking through breaches in the embankment. Relief forces working alongside the local people are desperately trying to protect the embankment with sandbags, bricks and timber. How long the embankment can be shored up to protect them remains to be seen. bdnews24
