 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)- The price of hilsha has eased by Tk 50 a kg over the last week, but the delicious fish is still beyond the reach of the middle-income group as it still sells at up to Tk 400 a kg. Fish trader Awlad Hossain at Hatirpool Bazaar said the price of hilsha, still in short supply, had come down slightly over the month. Though the price of small size hilsha fell, the bigger ones were still at a premium. Shahana Sultana Zaman, a banker who came to buy hilsha in the weekend market, said, "Hilsha is yet beyond my reach. A one kilo fish is just enough for a day." She bought a fish for Tk 350 for her children for the classic khichhuri ilish dish on the rain-soaked holiday. She had come to the market last week too, but failed to get a hand on a pricey fish. Hilsha is aplenty in the monsoons. The government has also taken an initiative to make the national fish more available to the people by banning its export to India. An yet, it is beyond the reach of the common people. The prices of other essentials are also on an an upward curve. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) in its market monitoring report said the price of rice, soybean oil, palm oil, atta, flour and onion increased last week. The price of coarse and fine rice rose a 6 percent on average over the month. The rice price is still 20 percent higher than it was in the same period last year. The price of atta rose 15 percent compared to the last week of June. Though duty on soybean oil has been withdrawn in the budget that came into effect this month, the price spiral of the item continues, registering an increase of 3.5 percent over the last month. Last week soybean sold at Tk 70 to 72 a litre in the retail market, but now it sells at Tk 71 to 73. The price of lentils, though up last month, was static over the week. Onion rose by Tk 1 to 2 a kg. A set of four eggs was selling at Tk 18 to 19, Tk 1 up from last week. The price of powdered milk has increased by Tk 5 a kg. A two-kilo packet of Dano milk milk now sells at Tk 970 and Milk Vita one kg powdered milk packet at Tk 390. Last week the prices were Tk 960 and Tk 385 respectively. bdnews24.
