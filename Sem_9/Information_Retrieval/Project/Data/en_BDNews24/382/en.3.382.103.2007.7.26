 BEIJING, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has set up a team of top officials to steer efforts at repairing the stained reputation of the country's food and products at home and abroad, state media announced on Thursday.

"We must strengthen administration from the source and establish a rigorous network of food inspection and management," the cabinet announced. "People can rest assured about our country's farm products overall," said the headline of an accompanying story in the People's Daily. The government revealed earlier this month that 19.1 percent of goods for domestic consumption checked in the first half of this year failed standards. Among smaller manufacturers, the failure rate was 27.1 percent.

In China's top-down but ill-coordinated government, rival bureaucracies often battle over who shoulders blame for problems. The leadership often resorts to leading small groups to seek greater unity among departments. The official reports did not specify which officials would sit on the new group.
