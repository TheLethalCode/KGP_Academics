 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Sunday the current rate of credit growth can be sustained at the projected 7 percent of GDP growth this fiscal year. Azizul spoke to reporters at the finance ministry after receiving Tk 1 crore in dividends from the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha. "A 15 percent credit growth is sufficient for attaining 7 percent GDP growth. I think this is the optimal figure," he said. The adviser's comment came following business concerns that a slowdown in credit flow could hamper overall economic growth as well as investment. Private sector credit flow has been declining since December 2006 due to a lack of investor confidence in the altered domestic situation, particularly the anticrime drive. According to Bangladesh Bank figures, the July to May period for the previous fiscal year saw private sector credit growth decline to 15.2 percent from near 18 percent during the same period the year before that. "Businessmen have nothing to be apprehensive about with the current credit growth," the finance adviser said. Azizul added that the growth trend is on right track when one compares it with the inflation rate and GDP growth rate. BSRS managing director, FRM Hafiz Ul Islam, handed over a cheque for dividends worth Tk 1 crore for FY 2005-06. The adviser asked the BSRS to be dynamic and diversified in terms of giving industrial credits. Azizul said that BSRS's efficiency is increasing. He said: "Operational profit for BSRS was nearly Tk 10.59 crore in FY 2005-06, which increased to Tk 17.29 crore in FY 2006-07." The adviser said he is not aware of a government plan to privatise the BSRS: "They [BSRS] are improving now." Finance ministry officials however said they are forwarding a file asking for the privatisation of BSRS by offloading its shares in the capital market. "The ministry will hold a meeting on August 2 this regard," a finance ministry letter issued Sunday said. bd
