<TITLE> Hasina gets bail, freedom far off </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday granted bail to Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case. But the chance for the detained former prime minister to get freedom from jail anytime soon is slim as the police Sunday showed her arrested in another extortion case. The High Court asked the government to take the extortion case off the reach of emergency powers rules. The court also asked the government to explain in two weeks why the inclusion of the case in the emergency powers rules would not be declared illegal. In instant reaction, Hasina's chief counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told reporters: "Sheikh Hasina got justice. She will get justice in future too." "I am lucky to defend the daughter of Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujibur Rahman)," he said. The bail order came after Hasina's lawyers Sunday filed a writ appeal with the bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury. Security forces arrested Hasina on July 16 in the extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading. The Awami League chief is detained in the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex. "Sheikh Hasina is not getting freedom anytime soon though. She is facing more cases, but we will battle them all out in court," Rafique-ul-Huq said. The army-backed emergency government Sunday moved to scuttle the chance for Hasina to find a legal way out of prison, by showing her arrested in a case filed by businessman Noor Ali. The police timed the legal move with Hasina's filing the writ appeal with the High Court the same day. Hasina's lawyers had earlier argued the emergency powers rules cannot cover the alleged incident that had taken place before the state of emergency was imposed in January. According to the writ petition, inclusion of the extortion case against Hasina in the emergency powers rules was illegal. A case under emergency powers rules means the accused will not get bail from the trial court. "She (Hasina) has been named in the FIR with some malafide motive...to harass and humiliate her," the petition alleged. "The case is not of public importance. " The petition said the inclusion of such less important case under the emergency powers rules clearly shows that the government is adamant to detain the petitioner by "any means, curtailing scope for obtaining bail from any court". The petition that gave a detailed description of the case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury alleged that the police submitted a chargesheet without an investigation. Hasina was arrested on July 16 at her Sudha Sadan home, and later a Dhaka court denied her bail and ordered her to jail. On July 24, police formally charged Hasina with extortion, and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka in a second rule fixed Aug 16 to hear the case. Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, who lives in the UK, has also been charged in the case although the complainant did not name her in the original complaint. The case involves alleged extortion of Tk 2.99 crore from a businessman in return for allowing him to build a power plant in Siddhirganj, Naraynganj, during Hasina's regime in 1996-2001. Azam filed the case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station, accusing Hasina and former minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of extortion. The party also decried the arrest arguing that it was meant to prevent Hasina from taking part in next elections, expected to be held anytime between October and December 2008. NOOR ALI CASE Businessman Noor Ali filed the Tk 5 crore extortion case with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina, Hasina's cousin Sheikh Helaluddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury on June 13. Noor Ali in the case details said he handed 12 cheques of Standard Chartered Bank and IFIC Bank to Hasina in Gono Bhaban, when she was the prime minister, to get permission for his business company Fortune Limited to set up thee power plantsone in Haripur of Naryanganj, one in Shikalbaha of Chittagong and the third in Khulna. Noor Ali alleged Sheikh Helaluddin demanded Tk 1 crore or a flat worth Tk 1 crore as he helped him get the permission. Noor Ali handed over the documents of the two flats to Rupa Chowdhury. bd
