<TITLE> Japan PM's bloc headed for election loss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's ruling camp is on course to lose its majority, possibly by a hefty margin, in Sunday's upper house election, a newspaper said on Thursday, an outcome that would put pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to resign. The forecast by the conservative Yomiuri newspaper was the latest to predict a loss for Abe's coalition after his support rates slid to around 30 percent on anger over bungled pension records and a series of gaffes and scandals that led two cabinet ministers to resign and one to commit suicide. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner, the New Komeito, need a total of 64 seats to keep their majority in the upper house, where half of the 242 seats are up for grabs. The New Komeito is aiming for 13 seats. The Yomiuri said the LDP could win fewer than 40 of the 63 seats it has up for reelection, a performance seen by analysts as certain to prompt calls inside the LDP for Abe to step down. The main opposition Democratic Party has a shot at winning more than 60 seats on its own, which would make it the biggest party in the upper house, the newspaper said. But it added that the outcome was uncertain, since around 40 percent of voters were still undecided. The ruling camp will not be ejected from government if it loses in the upper house since it has a strong grip on the more powerful lower chamber, and government and party officials have said there would be no need for Abe to step down after a defeat. But without a ruling bloc majority, laws would be hard to enact, threatening policy paralysis, unless Abe's coalition can woo independents, members of small parties or even disaffected lawmakers from the Democratic Party -- a sometimes fractious group of conservatives, ex-LDP lawmakers and former Socialists. Japanese TV broadcasters and other media will issue results of their exit polls after polls close at 8 p m (1100 GMT) on Sunday, July 29, and final results are expected later that night or early on Mond
