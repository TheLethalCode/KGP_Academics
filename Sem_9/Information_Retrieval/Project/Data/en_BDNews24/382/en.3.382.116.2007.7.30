 LOS ANGELES, July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham is unlikely to make his second appearance for Los Angeles Galaxy in their final SuperLiga group match in Frisco, Texas on Tuesday as he battles to shrug off an ankle injury. The England midfielder was restricted to a brief cameo role for his Galaxy debut against Chelsea eight days ago and his new employers do not want him to return unless fully fit. Although the Major League Soccer club need to win or draw against FC Dallas in Frisco to reach the SuperLiga semi-finals, head coach Frank Yallop will decide on Monday whether Beckham will travel to Texas with the squad. "He wants to get healthy and fit and play properly," Yallop told reporters after the Galaxy were beaten 2-1 by Mexican side Chivas de Guadalajara in their second SuperLiga fixture. "There's no way that we're going to send him out when he's not ready to play for us. He wants to play properly and prove to the guys why we brought him over." Asked if his high-profile signing would be with the Galaxy in Frisco, Yallop replied: "We'll have to see in the morning (on Monday) when he comes in for treatment. But it's too early to say." Although Beckham was one of seven substitutes for Saturday's SuperLiga match against Chivas at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Yallop never considered sending him on to the pitch. TEAM MORALE "He wanted to be on the bench and be involved in the locker room and it's obviously good to have him around," Yallop said. "Just having him there is good for morale. "Plus this is a good learning experience to get him used to the players, when they get ready for matches, how they react and all that sort of thing. "So, when it (Beckham's return) comes along, it won't be a surprise about how we prepare for games, my team talks and half-time talks as well. He kind of knows how we operate." Beckham, signed by the Galaxy from Real Madrid on a $32.5 million five-year deal, has not been able to train with his new team mates since his much-hyped arrival in Los Angeles just over two weeks ago. Although he came on for 16 minutes as a late substitute against FA Cup holders Chelsea on July 21, he has spent most of his time since then receiving ice treatment and massage to help reduce the swelling around his left ankle. The 32-year-old twisted his ankle playing for England against Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifying match last month and aggravated it in his final appearance for Real 11 days later
