<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) The interim government has rolled back an earlier decision to set up a deep seaport, an adviser said Monday. Communications and shipping adviser MA Matin said the latest decision came since the government does not feel any need for such a cash-hungry project. The BNP-led coalition government took up the project months before its five-year term expired in October. In a briefing after a meeting on the shipping ministry's annual development programme, Matin said they have other plans to ease pressures on the seaports. Monday's announcement came despite completion of a feasibility study by the government that had earlier identified suitable places for the planned seaport. The study had said the project will cost Tk 42,000 crore and the deadline is 2055. Jetties over an 11 kilometre-long stretch had been planned. "The present ports are functioning normally. Two more inland container depots are being set upone in Gazipur and the other at Keraniganj. It will ease the pressure on the seaports. "That's why the government doesn't consider it essential to go for a deep seaport right now," Matin said. After the present government took over in mid-January, the result of the feasibility on the ambitious plan came out. The feasibility study had identified Sonadia and Kutubdia islands as the best suitable places for the port. bdnews24.co
