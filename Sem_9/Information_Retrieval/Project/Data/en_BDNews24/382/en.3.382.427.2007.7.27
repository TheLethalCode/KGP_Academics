<TEXT>
 NOTTINGHAM, England, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chris Tremlett made the first breakthrough for England 10 minutes before tea but India were still in command of the second test after reaching 149 for one on day two at Trent Bridge on Saturday. Dinesh Karthik (77 not out) and Wasim Jaffer (62) put on 147 for the opening stand and helped India to a dominant position after England were bowled out before lunch for just 198. India skipper Rahul Dravid was yet to score. Hampshire seamer Tremlett claimed a wicket with the first ball of his third spell when a delivery with extra bounce surprised Jaffer, took the edge of his bat and was caught by wicketkeeper Matt Prior. It was the highest first-wicket partnership for an Indian opening pair in England for 28 years. With the pitch much drier than on the rain-affected first day, India are well placed to consolidate their superiority and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Both openers fought hard against England's seamers and left-arm spinner Monty Panesar and blocked out much of the verbal aimed their way. FORTUNATE BATSMEN The batsmen also enjoyed moments of fortune. Karthik, when at 29, survived a scare when his cover drive was dropped by James Anderson just a fraction off the ground although it was a difficult catch to make. Tremlett was unlucky not to make the breakthrough in the next over when Jaffer's edge to gully was dropped by Ian Bell, who dived to his left and failed to catch the ball with one hand. Jaffer was on 32 at the time. Panesar was introduced in the 29th over and almost took a wicket immediately. Karthik, on 44, missed an attempted sweep shot and was hit on the pad in front of middle stump. Television replays indicated he was out but umpire Ian Howell thought otherwise. Jaffer, on 36, also survived a Panesar delivery when he was hit in line with off stump but again Howell decided in the batsman's favour. Karthik reached a patchy consecutive test half-century when he lofted Panesar through cover for four. Before Karthik added to his 50 runs, he was so nearly run out backing up at the non-striker's end after Panesar deflected Jaffer's straight drive. India are seeking their first test series win in England for 21 years, while the hosts are trying to protect a record of going six years without a home test series defeat
