 NEW DELHI, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Recently retired Australia bowlers Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath are set to join an unofficial Indian Twenty20 league to be launched this year, former India captain Kapil Dev said on Thursday. "They've almost signed," Kapil, a board member of the Indian Cricket League (ICL) told Reuters. "It is just a matter of legal papers. Other terms and conditions are agreed. "Around 20-30 people are sitting and signing and going through the papers with their lawyers. It is only a matter of time before we make announcements." Warne retired from international cricket after the 2006-7 Ashes triumph while McGrath stepped down after Australia retained the World Cup in the West Indies this year. Former West Indies captain Brian Lara signed this week and there has been media speculation that New Zealand test skipper Stephen Fleming could also join. India's diversified Essel Group, controlling the nation's biggest listed media firm Zee Telefilms, announced the annual league in May. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has refused to recognise ICL and asked Kapil, captain of the 1983 World Cup winning team, to choose between it and remaining as chairman of the National Cricket Academy
