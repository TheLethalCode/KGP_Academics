<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After paying their dues on the small screen for 18 years, 'The Simpsons' have become movie superstars in just one day. 'The Simpsons Movie,' an animated feature based on the TV mainstays from Springfield, smashed industry expectations to earn an estimated $29.1 million on its first day of release on Friday in the United States and Canada, tracking firm Box Office Mojo (http://www.boxofficemojo.com) said.

Pictures' boy wizard saga 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' ($5.0 million). Warner's new Catherine Zeta-Jones romantic comedy 'No Reservations' opened at No 5 with a lukewarm $4.0 million. At least it did better than the latest bomb from troubled actress Lindsay Lohan. Her Sony Pictures thriller 'I Know Who Killed Me' opened at No 9 with $1.3 million. It will be lucky to crack $5 million for the weekend. Lohan was arrested in Los Angeles early Tuesday for suspected drunk driving and cocaine possession after a high-speed car chase.
