 Washington, July 31 (bdnews24.com/bbc/reuters)--- A high-level US delegation is travelling to the Middle East, after confirming plans for massive arms deals for allies in the region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defence Secretary Robert Gates are due to meet Arab ministers at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. The main beneficiaries of the deals are Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Ms Rice said they were needed to shore up allies against influences from Iran and Syria, and groups like Hezbollah. But Iran - whose nuclear programme and influence among Shia Muslim militant groups have long been sources of US concern - said the arms package would spread fear in the Middle East. 'High priority' During a stop-over in Shannon, Ireland, Ms Rice told reporters: "There isn't a doubt, I think, that Iran constitutes the single most important, single-country challenge to... US interests in the Middle East and to the kind of Middle East that we want to see." The trip is Ms Rice's first joint tour of the region with Defence Secretary Robert Gates. They will visit Egypt and Saudi Arabia together, and other countries separately. Mr Gates told reporters travelling with him that US officials wanted "to reassure all of the countries that the policies that (US President George W Bush) pursues in Iraq have had and will continue to have regional stability and security as a very high priority". But Iran said the military aid deal was America's attempt to destabilise the Middle East. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said: "The United States has always had a special policy of spreading fear in the region and tarnishing existing good relations" between countries in the Middle East. Congressional opposition The $30bn aid to Israel over 10 years represents a 25% increase from present levels. The Jewish state said the package would allow it to maintain its military "qualitative edge" in the region. The sale of satellite-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia, the first such sale to any Arab country, is thought to be part of the proposed $20bn arms deal with the kingdom and give other Gulf states - the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. During their lobbying tour of the region, Ms Rice and Mr Gates are expected to ask Saudi King Abdullah to do more to support the Iraqi government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, has gone as far as accusing Saudi Arabia of undermining efforts to stabilise Iraq. The weapons deals need to be approved by Congress, and appear set to encounter opposition. Two Democratic congressmen, Anthony Weiner and Jerrold Nadler of New York, said at the weekend they would introduce legislation to block military aid to Saudi Arabia.
