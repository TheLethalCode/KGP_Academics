 WASHINGTON, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Senate on Thursday approved a domestic security spending bill that provides for more border patrol agents and other border security measures that backers said could help lay the groundwork for broad immigration reforms. On a vote of 89-4, the Senate approved the bill that funds the Homeland Security Department for fiscal 2008, which begins Oct 1. Earlier, senators overwhelmingly approved an additional $3 billion for border controls and immigration law enforcement. A similar, slightly less expensive domestic security spending bill already has passed the US House of Representatives. The two chambers will have to work out their differences before sending a bill to President George W. Bush. The White House has threatened a veto, complaining that the legislation is now too expensive. Republican sponsors of the $3 billion border security amendment said the extra money could help build support for a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would also address the status of an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States. "It will make it easier to go to the next step," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. The money would help hire more border security agents and purchase vehicles, cameras and radio towers that mostly would be used to help stem the flow of illegal immigrants over the U.S. border with Mexico. Some of the money could also be used to help law enforcement officials track down immigrants who failed to abide by deportation orders. These and other enforcement measures had been part of a broad immigration overhaul backed by Bush. That bill, which would have legalized millions of unlawful immigrants, faltered in the Senate in the face of stiff opposition from some Republicans who considered it an amnesty that would encourage more illegal immigration. "One of the things that those of us who supported immigration reform learned was that the depth and breadth of cynicism about the government's commitment to enforcement is an impediment to comprehensive reform," said Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican who helped write the failed immigration bill. The border security money would be on top of the $37.6 billion that had already been part of the bill Bush had threatened to veto because it was more than he sought. Graham and others argued the border security money would help strengthen Republican support for the bill, making it more difficult for Bush to reject. Besides money for border protection, the bill also funds a range of post-Sept. 11 domestic security programs, including more money for airport and port security as well as grants to states and local governments to prepare for terrorist attacks or natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated southern states in 2005. bdnews24.com/lq/1553
