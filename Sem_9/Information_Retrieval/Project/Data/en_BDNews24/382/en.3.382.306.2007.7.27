 BERLIN, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich midfielder Mark van Bommel will miss Saturday's League Cup final against Schalke 04 for unsportsmanlike conduct during the semi-final against VfB Stuttgart, the German FA (DFB) said on Friday. Television footage showed the Dutchman grabbing Stuttgart captain Fernando Meira in the crotch area in the 53rd minute of the match, which Bayern won 2-0. The DFB said it based its ruling on the television footage because the referee had not noticed the incident. Van Bommel had accepted the penalty, the DFB added. Bayern are due to play Schalke in the final of the pre-season League Cup on Saturday in Leipzig. Van Bommel will also be banned from the next two League Cup matches Bayern are scheduled to play before June 30 2010. He is eligible for the start of the regular Bundesliga season next month however
