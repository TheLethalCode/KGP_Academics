<TITLE> Vaughan excited at new fast bowling options </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOUGHBOROUGH, England, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Michael Vaughan said on Thursday he was relishing the new competition for places among his fast bowlers after the young attack that played at Lord's almost won him the first test. On the eve of the second test at Trent Bridge, Vaughan did not appear frustrated to be without his more established bowlers Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Matthew Hoggard who are all likely to miss the India series. There was talk of a bowler crisis in the England camp before the first test began last week but James Anderson, Ryan Sidebottom and debutant Chris Tremlett claimed 17 of the 19 Indian wickets to fall, albeit in conditions that suited seam bowling. "Until everyone is fit and firing we will just have to pick from the guys who are available," Vaughan told reporters. "The bigger pool of bowlers that we can have the better it is for the team. Hopefully everyone will get fit and there will be a few tough decisions to make. "It would be nice to have a situation where all the bowlers are fit and bowling well to see what the best combination would be to go into a game. "Until that day arises it is very difficult to say who would get into the side but I was very impressed with the guys who played at Lord's. "It was an excellent display by them all, they really worked well as a unit, which we probably haven't done as well since 2005. It's nice for a captain to have options and variations with all the bowlers working well together." Although England were just one wicket from taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series on Monday, when rain prevented any play after tea, Vaughan said the team were not deflated by failing to take that 20th wicket. "It felt as much a victory with the way that we played and the positive manner with which we went about our cricket. The young bowlers produced an excellent display. It was enthralling watching over the five days. England, who trained at their indoor academy at Loughborough University on Thursday with Trent Bridge waterlogged, will play the same team that featured at Lord's, with seamer Stuart Broad acting as cover for any late injuries
