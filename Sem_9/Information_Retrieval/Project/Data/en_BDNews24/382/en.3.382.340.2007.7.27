<TITLE> Prince Charles to visit flood victims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 27 (bd24.com/Reuters) - Prince Charles will visit areas devastated by the worst floods in modern history on Friday and meet some of the thousands of victims left without power and water. He is due to meet families, emergency workers and volunteers in the southwest, one of the regions that bore the brunt of torrential rain and flooding. The worst floods in 60 years damaged 15,000 houses this week and left ten times that number without mains water, the government said. Severn Trent said it would restore water to thousands of homes in flood-stricken Tewkesbury. Many more are still relying on bottles or mobile tanks in the street. Large swathes of the country have been left under water and at least eight people have died during a month of torrential rain. A father and son were found dead in a cellar of a rugby club in Tewkesbury on Thursday. They are thought to have been overcome by fumes as they used a petrol-powered pump to clear floodwater. The Queen has made a private donation to the Red Cross flood appeal, Buckingham Palace said. In the past two months, Britain has experienced the heaviest rainfall since records began in 1766, leading rivers to burst their banks. Insurers say the cost of flooding in June and July could be more than 3 billion pounds. After more heavy rain in parts of England on Thursday, forecasters said it should be drier on Friday and into the weekend.
