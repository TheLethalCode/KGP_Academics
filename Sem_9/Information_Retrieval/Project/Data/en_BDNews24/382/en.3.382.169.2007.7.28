 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)  Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Saturday said the application of law alone cannot bring the pervasive corruption to a tolerable level unless there is social disapproval of corruption. Justice Amin said the application of law, without being soft toward some and tough to others, is important but that is only a small part of the process. "In my opinion, along with addressing the corruption upon due application of law, without being soft toward some and tough to others, unless there is social disapproval of corruption and corrupt persons in public and private it would be difficult ... to bring down the present level of corruption to a tolerable position," Amin said in a written speech to a seminar in the city. His comment came at a time when the country is witnessing a massive crackdown by the interim government with the backing of the country's influential military on high-profile corruption. Amin was speaking at the launch of the seminar on "Rule of law to establish corruption-free society". A publication, Monthly Legal Aid, organised the seminar. The chief justice, however, said he should not be misunderstood that he does not want a stringent application of law. "I may not be misunderstood that I am against stringent provision of law for curbing corruption and enforcement thereof. My view is that along with addressing the corrupt person upon due enforcement of law, let there be social abhorrence and disapproval of corruption," Amin said. "Law alone is not sufficient. Society and its components are to be motivated and educated about ethics and moral values, too," he said. Amin also said the current all-pervasive corruption has been created "because of us". "Corruption, in its present volume, in all spheres of life is because of us," he said. "The society because of its culture and behaviour (is) also partially responsible for harbouring or patronising corruption as there is absence of disapproval of corruption from considerable number of us since most of us do not disassociate with the corrupt person. "Soft application of the law of corruption at different levels by the government and the institutions entrusted with or responsible for administration and enforcement of law to some beneficiaries or corruption on some lame excuse is no less responsible for corruption." Justice Amin said corruption is a global problem. "Corruption is at the moment not only in our society, but in other parts of the globe," he said, adding that it is not possible at this moment or in future to bring the corruption down to zero level. "This being the reality it would not be correct to say we are showing tolerance to or acceptance of certain kinds of lapses or corruption," he said. He regretted that corrupt persons are lionised in society, terming it a "peculiar behaviour of the society". He, in particular, referred to the public reception of corrupt persons in the country. "This is generally done by arranging public reception or invitation to persons who pass them off in the society as distinguished personality being associated with this kind or that kind of organisation or are being considered distinguished person by a certain section of people of the society for their purposes," he said. He said all this happens despite the fact that everybody knows such a person earns money by questionable means. "This queer behaviour of the society is long way responsible for thriving corruption." bdnew
