 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks showed resilience Tuesday after a slump following the Securities and Exchange Commission's suspension of the financial adjustment facility for quality, or 'A' shares. The SEC announced the suspension Monday to rein in a lingering surge in the price of stocks and liquidity flow on bourses. The directive became effective from Tuesday. Indices curved down after trading began. Within one and a half hours the main index DGEN lost 75 points amid selling pressure but regained a foothold by the midday session, encouraged by companies' half yearly profit results. However it ended far from positive territory. "The market appears to have absorbed the initial shock from the settlement system's realignment. I hope volatility will ease over the next few days," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 700 million in funds. The DGEN or general index slumped 41.80 points or 1.72 percent to 2384.18. The DSI or all-share price index finished at 1936.83, down 26.29 points or 1.33 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip index fell 44.94 points or 2.0 percent to 2192.18. Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst, observed that the market turnaround demonstrated its strength withstand the SEC directive. "It shows that investor are ready to buy shares, even after three days. There is liquidity in the market. Otherwise, it would not have shown such resilience," he said. The financial adjustment facility, effective from early 2005, had earlier permitted investors to buy additional shares from the proceeds of shares sold the same day. With the facility suspended, investors will have to wait until the fourth day for their transactions to be settled. The SEC hope the suspension will help reduce liquidity flow, which resulted in high demand and issues price spiraling. Of the issues traded, 36 added, 142 lost and 13 closed steady.
