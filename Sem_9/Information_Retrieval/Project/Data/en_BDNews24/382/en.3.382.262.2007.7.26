 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Trial courts Thursday sentenced three former ministers and a ward commissioner to long jail-terms in separate cases, making the highest number of emergency-time verdicts in one day. One of the high-profile verdicts was on former BNP minister Aminul Huq who was sentenced to 31 and a half years of rigorous imprisonment for aiding and abetting militants, in one of the harshest punishments to a politician during the emergency rule. Judge Rezaul Islam of the Additional Sessions Judge's Court-2 in Rajshahi also slapped Tk 25,000 in fine on the former telecommunications minister who will have to serve out another three years in failure to pay the sum. The court also handed down the same jail term to 24 others, including district BNP secretary Shish Mohammad. Aminul Huq, Mohammad and 13 others are fugitives from justice. Local farmer Fazlur Rahman from Baghmara, who was tortured by the militants led by Siddiqul Islam, popularly known as Bangla Bhai, filed a case against 28 people with Bagmara Police Station on March 30. Bangla Bhai was hanged along with five other top militants earlier this year for killing two judges in the southern district of Jhalakathi. The investigating officer of the case, Muktar Hossain, pressed the charges against 27 people on April 23. Additional public prosecutor Nurul Islam stood for the state while advocate Ankur Sen defended the accused. MOHIUDDIN VERDICT A special court in Dhaka dealing with high-profile corruption cases Thursday found former state minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir guilty on two counts of corruption and sentenced him to 13 years in jail. Shahed Nuruddin, the judge of the Special Judge's Court-3, found Alamgir guilty of earning a huge amount of money by illegal means and concealing information about his wealth. Alamgir, who was the state minister for planning in Sheikh Hasina's 1996-2001 administration, is to serve out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for corruption and three years of a normal term for suppressing information. The court also fined him Tk 10 lakh. Alamgir has to stay in jail for another year if he fails to pay the fine. Alamgir's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman said his client did not get justice and they would move the High Court to overturn the trial court verdict. The former bureaucrat-turned-politician is one of the high-profile corruption suspects to be on a list of 50 people published by the Anti-Corruption Commission on Feb 18. The commission had asked the 50 including politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats to submit their wealth statements by a 72-hour deadline from notification. His brother, Borhanuddin Khan Jahangir, turned in the statement to the ACC on Feb 22 on behalf of Alamgir since he was in jail awaiting trial. Earlier on Feb 3, joint forces arrested Alamgir at his Banani home. On March 6, ACC deputy director Jiban Krishna Roy filed a case with Tejgaon Police Station accusing Alamgir of concealing information about his wealth and making illegal money. On April 29, ACC investigator Sharmin Ferdousi filed a chargesheet with Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court for Dhaka, accusing him of hiding the fact of his having Tk 1.17 crore in six fixed deposit accounts. DULU CASE A Natore court Thursday sentenced former BNP deputy minister for land Ruhul Quddus Talukdar Dulu and brother Atiqur Rahman Talukdar to eight years in prison. The brothers are to pay Tk 10,000 in fines or serve one more year in jail in failure to pay the amount, in a case of an arson attack. Dulu and Atiq will serve five years for torching houses, one year for vandalism and another year for armed rioting, and the eighth year for commanding atrocities. Asaduzzaman of Ramshahkazipur filed the case on Feb 25 with Naldanga Police Station in Natore district accusing 94 persons including Dulu on charges of torching 18 houses using explosives.
