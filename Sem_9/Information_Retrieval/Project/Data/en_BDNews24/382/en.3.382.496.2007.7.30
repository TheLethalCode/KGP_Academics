<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday fixed August 22 to hear the appeal for close the corruption case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on charges of appointing a foreign consultant to BEPZA. The HC bench of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Ataur Rahman Khan set the date following an appeal by public prosecutor Abdur Rauf Miah. Miah said Hasina appealed to the court to cancel the case in 2002 and hearing on appeals for quashment of her other cases have been set. So all the hearings should take place together, he argued. Hasina's counsel barrister Fazle Nur Tapash disagreed with the appeal and asked for four weeks from the court as he said he needed to consult Hasina. He said as she was in prison, it was taking time for him to talk to her. He also said chief attorney barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud was unwell and that was another reason for them to seek time. The court, however, rejected the prayer and allowed them three weeks. The High Court halted proceedings of case in the trial court in December 18, 2002 following Hasina's appeal. The HC also ordered the government to explain why the case would not be cancelled. Abdullah Al Zahid, a former Anti-Corruption Bureau official, filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina and three others on December 11, 2001. The case details said the Hasina-led Awami League floated a tender in breach of the rules and appointed their selected consultancy firm. Hasina being the prime minister at the time abused power and forced the government to incur a loss of $3.6 million. Charges were pressed against Hasina and three others on June 18, 2002 and the case went to trial at Dhaka Divisional Special Judge's Court. bdnews24
