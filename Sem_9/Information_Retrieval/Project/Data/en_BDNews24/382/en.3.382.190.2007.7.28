 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) convener, Ferdous Ahmed Quraishi, Saturday termed allegations against Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina serious. Quraishi told reporters, present in the office of the Daily Deshbangla for the first news briefing since the formation of the party this month: "The allegations against Sheikh Hasina are serious. The list is long. Many people are in prison for committing minor crimes. There should not be any exception for major ones. The law must be equal for all". Quraishi also called for adequate arrangements to ensure Hasina did not suffer any harassment. On the recent demand of Dhaka University teachers for Hasina's release, Quraishi said: "One person was detained in accordance with the law, following which, teachers refused to take classes and wore black badges in protest." "Students, on the other hand, have not taken up any such programme. If talented teachers wish to enter politics, they must leave their jobs first. We will welcome them," the PDP boss went on to add. Quraishi hinted that many activists and leaders from established parties were interested to join the new party. "There will be no place for 'star-leaders' in our party. Prominent positions will not be offered to friends, including Razzak, Tofail and Suranjit," he said, adding, "We are seeking election of new leaders to 300 seats and are acting accordingly. We are getting a massive response from across the country." He added: "The party committee will be formed in one month." The PDF convener went on to commend the current administration's success in signing the new road link deal with Myanmar. However, he urged the government to take adequate measures to curb the prevailing price spiral. Quraishi also stressed the need for greater governmental vigilance regarding businessmen's interests: "The government must ensure that small traders and investors are not harassed while making their tax payments at the revenue department and banks." Regarding criminal proceedings against several Jamaat MPs, Quraishi said, "At present four Jamaat lawmakers are in prison and four more are absconding." "If any corrupt person was found in the PDP, he would be expelled immediately," Quraishi added. "Arrangements are currently underway to collect wealth statements of PDP committee members," he said. bdnews24
