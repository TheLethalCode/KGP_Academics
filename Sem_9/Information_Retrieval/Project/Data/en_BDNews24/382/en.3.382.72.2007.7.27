 DUNDEE, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thierry Henry scored the winner on his Barcelona debut on Thursday when the Spanish side beat Dundee United 1-0 in a pre-season friendly at Tannadice. The French international had a last minute penalty parried by United's Polish keeper Grzegorz Szamotulski, but slammed in the rebound.

Barca came close to a first half opener with a 25-metre free kick from Ronaldinho which slammed high against the far post in the 18th minute
