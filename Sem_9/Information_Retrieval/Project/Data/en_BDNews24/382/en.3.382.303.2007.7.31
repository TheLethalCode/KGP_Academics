<TITLE> Asia stocks rise on US, easing credit fears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, July 31 (Reuters) - Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as credit fears eased, with the focus on earnings after gains on Wall Street, setting the scene for a positive start for European markets. Japan's Nikkei 225 index bucked the trend and dipped 0.2 percent on some weak corporate results and political uncertainty after an election defeat for the government at the weekend. "Investors are finding it difficult to make moves because of earnings. More than 200 companies are set to report results on Tuesday," said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an equity strategist at Shinko Securities Kyocera Corp. dropped nearly 7 percent as higher earnings failed to impress investors, while semiconductor shares such as Advantest Corp. fell after data showing a plunge in orders for Japanese chip-making equipment in June. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific stocks excluding Japan rose 1.5 percent, buoyed by a recovery in US shares on Monday after ratings agency Standard & Poor's upgraded Morgan Stanley's debt, and a hedge fund that had been hit by tightening credit conditions was bailed out. Asian markets were also boosted by companies reporting strong earnings, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index up 1.3 percent as HSBC Holdings Plc's results showed its bad debt provisions were not as large as feared. In Europe -- where several corporate heavyweights such as British bank Lloyds TSB and telecoms equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent are reporting results -- bookmakers are calling the FTSE 100 up 40-42 points, the DAX up 73-81 points and the CAC 40 up 40-42 points. But investors remained cautious that ongoing US subprime mortgage market woes could still spread to wider credit markets after US shares had just suffered their worst week in nearly five years. "It looks like markets will continue to rebound, though given that there's still a lot of uncertainty, it may be hard to expect strong gains," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities. Mining firms such as BHP Billiton were higher following gains in industrial metals prices. Higher copper prices seen on Monday continued onto the Shanghai futures market on Tuesday, with the October copper contract up over 1.5 percent, while LME tin hit a record high at $16,275 a tonne on the LME's electronic trading platform. RISK AVERSION FADES The dollar steadied at 118.90 yen as risk aversion that had led to the unwinding of carry trades and supported the Japanese currency eased. Investors had been closing out carry trades, in which they borrowed in low-yielding currencies such as the yen to buy higher-yielding assets, sending the dollar to a 3- month low of 118.02 yen on electronic trading platform EBS last week. "The rebound in US shares on Monday was not very strong, and if the Dow fails to rise today or wipes out all of Monday's gains, then the dollar could fall towards 118 yen and the euro towards 161 yen," said a dealer at a Japanese bank. The Chicago Board of Trade's volalility index, or VIX, a key measure of the market's risk perception, eased by nearly 14 percent on Monday to close at 20.87, after on Friday hitting its highest since April 2003. US crude was down 18 cents at $76.65, sitting less than half a dollar off an 11-month high hit the previous day as concerns continued about falling stocks. Japanese government bond futures were slightly up at 133.15, as investors remained cautious about taking positions on expectations that the Bank of Japan could raise interest rates as soon as August. A fall in Japan's jobless rate to a nine-year low of 3.7 percent in June suggested the central bank will raise interest rates as early as next month, although global market volatility in recent days has dented the near certainty many in the market had felt about this.
