 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein Monday instructed all field level government administrators and officials to effect better coordination and work freely without any qualms. The adviser issued the instructions at a meeting with divisional commissioners at the land ministry. After the meeting, Hosein told reporters that the field level administrative officials were reportedly suffering from insecurity and various doubts following graft cases against seven UNOs recently. Many officials were also being 'trapped' and at times, faced harassment due to internal feuds, he said. Hosein asked all to ward off 'petty differences' and keep working concertedly. The adviser told the officials that the Chief Adviser had expressed satisfaction about the way the government officials had been discharging their duties and conveyed to them the CA's felicitations in this regard. He assured them that government officials would not be transferred frequently so that they did not feel harassed. Mainul said that the graft cases against the seven UNOs were under investigation and that the government was alert about ensuring that no officer was victimised or harassed. bdnews24.
