 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)- Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury left Dhaka Monday on a three-day visit to the Philippines to attend a meeting of Asean Regional Forum of Foreign Ministers in Manila. Filipino Foreign Minister Dr Alberto Romulo invited Chowdhury, who will be leading a Bangladesh delegation to the forum meeting from July 31 to August 2, to visit his country. Speaking to reporters about the conference before his departure, Chowdhury said, "This will be a key meeting. This will be our first participation in the Asean Regional Forum (ARF), into which we have been accepted after years of efforts." He said: "The event would be an important milestone in forging strong links with the Asean countries, many of them seen as emerging tigers in the global economic scenario." When asked if he would also hold any bilateral meeting, he replied, "As always, I will use this multilateral event to build some important bilateral connections. I understand meetings have been arranged for me with the foreign ministers of China and Indonesia. I look forward to those talks. Naturally, there will be others I will also have scope to talk to. I am seeing President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines on July 31 as well." While in Manila, Chowdhury will sign on behalf of Bangladesh the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, as mandated by the Council of Advisers. The ARF meeting is likely to be attended by the foreign ministers of the 10 Asean countries and also by 17 other foreign ministers who are the members of the Forum. The forum was established in 1994. It draws together 25 countries that have a bearing on the security of the Asia-Pacific region. In a region with little history of security cooperation, the Asean Regional Forum is the principal forum for security dialogue in Asia. The ARF complements the various bilateral alliances and dialogues that underpin the region's security architecture. The ARF is premised on the ideadrawn from the Asean experiencethat a process of dialogue can produce qualitative improvements in political relationships. It provides a setting in which members can discuss current regional security issues and develop cooperative measures to enhance peace and security in the region. bd
