 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) -- A BNP leader has been accused of embezzling more than Tk 1 crore over the last five years by exploiting his position as the principal of a school in Dhaka, a government report has disclosed. The activities of Md Liakat Ali, the principal of Balughat High School and College and the BNP general secretary for the cantonment thana unit, are the subject of the report. Ali is accused of failing to deposit up to Tk 1.31 crore in student fees into the schools' bank account between 2002 and 2007. The education ministry conducted the inquiry and submitted its report this month. An official with the ministry, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com: "The report is now with the education ministry which will ask the management committee, headed by Dhaka deputy commissioner, to take action in this matter." The report accuses Ali of misappropriating school funds without the executive committee's approval and of failing to submit any audit reports for the school. In addition, the report alleges that Ali did not deposit teachers' contributions into their provident funds. The inquiry further states that Ali's initial appointment to the principal's post was also illegal. It said: "He became the principal without having the necessary qualifications required by the advertisement. Ali's appointment as principal does not make sense." Contacted by bdnews24.com, Ali conceded that experience is necessary to become a college principal. "I agree that I didn't have those qualifications when I became principal. But a friend of mine, Faruk Ahmed, became principal of Gulshan College in the same way at the same time." Regarding the student's fees Ali said: "I did not deposit the student's fees into the bank account because I wanted to do that after resolving a court case with the governing body." According to the report, Ali became the principal of Balughat High School and College, located in the cantonment, in December 2001. The appointment came soon after the BNP-led alliance formed the government in October the same year. The ministry's investigative team claims that Ali provided them with details of the alleged crime in a statement. According to this statement, student and session fees were collected from the students' families but were not then properly deposited into the school's bank account. The law states that all money received by the school must be deposited directly into their bank accounts with approval gained from the executive committee as well as the school authority before any money is spent. "He [Ali] neither deposited the money in the bank nor took any permission from the committee for spending it," the report said. A bdnews24.com investigation has uncovered the existence of an earlier report by the education ministry, compiled in 2005, which also described Ali's appointment as 'illegal'. However, there was no subsequent legal action taken against him. "He [Ali] was able to avoid any action because of his political connections to the previous government," said Md Borhan Uddin, the previous headmaster of the school who was ousted by Ali in 2001. Prof Ali Akbar Khan, director of the inspection and audit department at the education ministry, said: "What he [Ali] has done is clearly a black and white crime." Balughat High School got government permission to operate as a college in 1995. In 1998 however, the authorities withdrew the licence, citing a failure to fulfil the required terms and conditions for college status. Borhan Uddin, who joined the school in Feb 1984, added: "Ali has no right to hold the principal's chair as it ceased operating as a college 1998." A senior education ministry official said, on condition of anonymity: "We will ask Dhaka's deputy commissioner to take action against the responsible person." According to Ali: "Approval from the School's governing body is only required for depositing money and is not necessary for any spending." bdnew
