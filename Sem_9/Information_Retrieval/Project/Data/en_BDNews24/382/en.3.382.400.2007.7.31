<TITLE> Judgement in Rangs Bhaban case Thursday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Tuesday closed hearing a government appeal against the High Court verdict on the Rangs Bhaban and set Thursday for a judgement. The High Court ruling had declared the cancellation of Rangs Bhaban design illegal. A panel of five judges of the Appellate Division led by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim set the date of judgment after a five-day hearing on the appeal. "According to the Building Construction Act, aviation regulations will apply in cases of erecting building in certain special zones," attorney general Fida M Kamal said during the hearing on the fifth day. "As the multistoried Rangs Bhaban is sited near the old airport, the civil aviation regulation of keeping building heights in areas contiguous to an airfield under 60 feet or six storeys at the most would be applicable to the highrise in question." He said Rangs authorities defied court orders slapped on the Rangs Bhaban construction. They continued to raise the building despite giving an undertaking that they would not construct the building any higher than the prescribed maximum limit of up to six floors. Barrister Rafique-ul-Haque, the counsel for Rangs authorities, told the court that city developer RAJUK had asked for a stop to the construction after the building was erected up to 16 floors. He submitted a relevant police report in the court. RAJUK cancelled the Rangs Bhaban design on June 21, 1999, prompting Rangs to file a writ petition with the High Court the same month. The High Court on May 2, 2000 declared that RAJUK's cancellation of the Bhaban design was illegal. The government appealed with the Supreme court against the verdict and the apex court accepted the appeal on December 5, 2005 for hearing. bdnew
