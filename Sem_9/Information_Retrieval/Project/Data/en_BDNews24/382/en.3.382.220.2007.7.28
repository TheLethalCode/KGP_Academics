 CAIRO, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police detained 18 members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood in northeast Cairo on Friday night, the Brotherhood said on Saturday. The 18 men were in a house in the suburb of Mataria when police raided, it said on its Web site, www.ikhwanonline.com. They included engineers, a pharmacist, a chemist, teachers and other professionals. A Brotherhood source said they were young and were not Brotherhood leaders. The Egyptian police regularly hold members of the Brotherhood for long periods and then release them without charge or trial. Several hundred are in custody but Brotherhood officials said they did not have an exact number to hand. The government calls the Brotherhood an illegal organisation but its members hold 88 seats in parliament and the group, which seeks an Islamic state through democratic elections, can operate with some limited freedom of movement. An Interior Ministry spokesman said he had no information about any detentions on Friday.
