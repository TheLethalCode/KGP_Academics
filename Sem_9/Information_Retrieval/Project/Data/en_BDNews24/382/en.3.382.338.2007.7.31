 LONDON, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British housebuilder Taylor Wimpey Plc raised its cost savings estimate and unveiled a 750 million pound ($1.5 billion) share buyback as its merger integration remains on target, boosting its shares 12 percent. The company, which became Britain's biggest housebuilder this month by combining Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey, reported 259 million pounds in profit before tax and exceptional items for the six months to end-June, on revenue of 2.67 billion pounds. It said it expected the UK housing market to cool in the second half following a series of interest rate rises, and repeated that earnings from U.S. markets would be substantially lower due to worsening trading conditions in some areas. It said in a statement, however: "Current (UK market) conditions are stable, and the business is in a strong position to respond to any change in the market. "Our strong proforma order book, which is 5 percent up year on year, combined with completions to date, accounts for over 80 percent of our full-year volume expectations." Its upbeat comment sent housebuilders' shares higher across the board, with Persimmon up 3.5 percent, Bellway up 4.6 percent, and Bovis Homes up 4.7 percent. By 1110 GMT, Taylor Wimpey shares, which have lost over 30 percent from March's record highs after the merger announcement, were up 12 percent at 336-1/2 pence, recovering from two-year lows on Friday, buoyed by the buyback and new savings target. "The positive surprise is the share buyback of 750 million pounds," Investec analyst Tessa Guy said. "The outlook statement signals caution over UK volumes and site openings, and the U.S. slowdown is likely to be more prolonged." But some analysts warned the long-term share performance would be limited, given fragile trading conditions. "The impact of handing this money back when so much work needs to be done ... indicates that the short-term palliative of shareholder acceptance of the new company comes before the longer-term absolute need to catch up in margin terms with the better peer-group operators," Evolution Securities said. Taylor Wimpey, which set margin improvement as its post-merger priority, said its UK operating margin rose 2.2 percentage points to 13.2 percent and said it was aiming to achieve industry averages over a 2-3 year period through tight control over incentives and sales strategy. "There is an enormous amount of potential in the UK margin programme, and we think the US is an extremely good market, although current conditions are tough," Group Chief Executive Pete Redfern told reporters. Taylor Wimpey increased its annualised pretax synergy estimate to 100 million pounds from 70 million, mainly stemming from building cost efficiencies, and said the integration was progressing well, with no changes in the planned 700 job cuts. In North America, profit from operations before exceptional items tumbled 52 percent to 46.4 million pounds, with revenue down 21 percent to 353.2 million. "We've taken action where the markets are tough, particularly in Florida and California, where conditions had worsened over the last few months," Redfern said. "We've reviewed land holdings, and we've taken a fairly significant 86 million pounds writedown in U.S. assets." It is cutting 25 percent of workforce in the North American operation as tight credit conditions depress housing demand. In Spain, it also saw a significant slowdown due to overcapacity and reduced demand from British buyers following higher interest rat
