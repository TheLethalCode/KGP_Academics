 NEW DELHI, July 31 (bdnews24com/Reuters) - Australia will decide soon whether to lift a ban on uranium sales to India, a reversal of its policy of selling only to signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, India's foreign minister said on Tuesday.

It needs clearances from the Nuclear Suppliers Group of nations that govern the global civilian nuclear trade, and India also needs to conclude an agreement to place its civilian reactors under UN safeguards before the US Congress can approve the de
