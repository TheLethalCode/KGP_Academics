<TEXT>
 TOKYO July 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold rose on Thursday after falling to its lowest in a week on Wednesday on a firmer U.S. dollar, while Tokyo futures fell for the fourth day in a row, tracking sharp losses on New York's COMEX market. Spot gold rose to $675.80/676.60 an ounce at 0255 GMT, from $674.40/675.20 late in New York on Wednesday, when it dropped to as low as $670.50 after a recovery in the dollar sparked heavy liquidation. Trade was slow as players carefully watched the currency market after the dollar's sharp recovery. "If the dollar's value should continue to rise rapidly it could trigger selling by funds," said Koji Suzuki, market analyst at Kazaka Commodity Co. Ltd. NYMEX crude for September delivery (CLc1: Quote, Profile, Research) rose 33 cents to $76.21 a barrel in Globex electronic trading, after surging $2.32 on Wednesday. Gold often draws support from oil because investors use it as an inflation hedge when energy prices are high. Most active June 2008 gold futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange closed the morning at 2,650 yen per gram, down 10 yen, or about 0.4 percent. The benchmark contract has fallen by about 1.6 percent this week, in contrast to the previous week when it rose by about 2 percent to a high of 2,989 yen on a weaker dollar. "The rise was driven by a weaker dollar, and now that the U.S. currency is recovering, the TOCOM market can't find the incentive to rise for the time being," Suzuki said. The most active December contract on the recently launched "mini" gold futures contract fell 5 yen per gram to 2,637 yen. The dollar held on to gains on Thursday, staying off a record low versus the euro as traders reckoned that the U.S. currency has been sold to a point that well reflects concerns about the U.S. subprime mortgage market for now. The euro slipped a touch to $1.3710 , off a record high of $1.3853 hit earlier in the week. The dollar inched up to 120.55 yen , pulling away from the 119.80 yen level, its weakest in 2- months, touched in the previous session. The benchmark TOCOM June 2008 silver contract slipped to a one-week low of 511.9 yen per 10 grams, before closing the morning at 512.2 yen, down 2.4 yen, as it tracked New York's decline.
