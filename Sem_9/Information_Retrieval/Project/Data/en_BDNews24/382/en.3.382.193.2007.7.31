 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) - The local government ministry Tuesday decided to run all community clinics meant to deliver primary healthcare services at the grassroots level. The ministry took the major decision to take charge of some 11,000 community clinics built at union levels at a meeting that also approved budgets for Zila Parishads (district councils). Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and secretary Safaraz Hossain, among others, were present in the meeting. "We have approved Tk 348.49 crore budget for 61 districts and hope to collect Tk 191.49 crore in revenue," Iqbal told reporters after the meeting. "Of the total budget, Tk 157 crore is included as the government's Annual Development Programme," he said. Iqbal said the ministry hoped to earn an additional Tk 45 crore in revenue this year from leased-out local markets. The adviser said the community clinics did not function under the health ministry and they would be run under district councils. He said foreign donors were willing to offer assistance to run the CCs if need be. Iqbal also said museum-cum-libraries in memory of the liberation war martyrs would be built in 10 districts. In memory of the National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, special memorials would be built across the country including in Dhaka University Nazrul Mazar, Mymensingh's Trishal and Comilla. On recruitment of administrators for the Zila Parishads, Iqbal said: "As per the District Council Act there is scope for appointing administrators. "However, as per the constitution there is no provision of appointing such administrators to the local government body." bdnew
