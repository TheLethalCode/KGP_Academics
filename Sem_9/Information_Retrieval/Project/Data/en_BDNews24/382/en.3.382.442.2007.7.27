 SINGAPORE, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares tumbled on Friday after weak US housing data revived worries about the world's biggest economy, sparking a flight from risky assets and boosting the yen and government bonds. The yen hit a three-month high against the dollar as investors, rattled by the problems in US credit markets, rushed to buy back the Japanese currency used to finance purchases of higher-yielding, riskier assets. The yen hit 118.02 per dollar in early trade but had dropped to around 119 by 0143 GMT as some Japanese investors started buying the dollar again. By 0110 GMT Japan's Nikkei had fallen 2.3 percent, hitting a three-month low after Thursday's 0.9 percent drop. The sell-off did not spare companies whose earnings beat expectations, such as Sony Corp., though Sony's drop was limited to 0.5 percent. "Stocks here will likely be sold across the board, and companies with good earnings results will be dragged down by the negative external environment, including the stronger yen," said Yutaka Miura, deputy manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities. Other stock markets in the region also tracked overnight losses on Wall Street, where the blue-chip Dow Jones average fell 2.3 percent, its worst drop since the last global sell-off on Feb. 27, in the wake of poor housing data. US new home sales fell sharply in June and prices slumped, highlighting the weakness in the housing sector. Benchmarks in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore all fell by more than 3 percent, while Australian stocks were down 2.2 percent by 0110 GMT. MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan dropped 1.8 percent. The flight to quality boosted safe-haven government debt and Japanese bond futures jumped to a two-month high, tracking an overnight rally in US Treasuries. Dealers said sliding equity and non-government debt markets stirred doubts over whether the Bank of Japan would raise interest rates next month, helping lift September 10-year JGB futures by 0.58 point to 133.08. Oil prices edged up in Asian trade after a drop of over $1 on Thursday, with US crude up 39 cents at $75.34 a barrel and London Brent up 37 cents at $75.55. Gold failed to capitalise on the rush to safety in New York, hitting a two-week low in nervous trade ahead of an options expiry, but the price picked up in early Asian trade, rising to $665.25/665.75 an ounce from $660.90/661.70.
