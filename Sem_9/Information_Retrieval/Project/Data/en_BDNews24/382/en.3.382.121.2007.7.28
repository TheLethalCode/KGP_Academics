 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, who has been in jail since July 16, fears her life is at stake, her lawyer said Saturday. Toufique Nawaj, who visited Hasina at the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad premises, told reporters that Hasina had mentioned to him that a "process" to kill the two surviving members of Bangabandhu's family (Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana) was on. "It is part of the process to complete the wiping out of Bangabandhu's family," the former prime minister was quoted by the lawyer as saying. The lawyer quoted Hasina as saying that she was being deprived of her constitutional rights. Toufique said Hasina's documents had been seized at a time when she was asked to submit a wealth statement. Toufique said Hasina wanted to know how she could prepare a wealth statement now. Hasina alleged that she was arrested without a warrantonly to bar her from taking part in polls, the lawyer added. Toufique said Hasina handed in a court dossier to him after signing it. He said they would go for a legal fight. The lawyer said Hasina had not received any response from the Bangladesh Bank governor to whom she wrote for a list of her bank accounts and other information. Hasina's aunts Razia Naser, Sheikh Khadiza Hossain, cousins Sheikh Sheli Zaman, wife of her cousin Shahana Yasmin Shampa and Sheikh Farmina Khan met her at the jail. bdnew
