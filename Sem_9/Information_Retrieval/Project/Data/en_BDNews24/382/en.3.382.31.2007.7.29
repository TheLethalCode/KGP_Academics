 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The Water Development Board has set up 23 new pumps in the Dhaka Narayanganj Dam area to control potential flooding within the two cities, officials said Sunday. Dhaka's defences have been reinforced by eight new pumps with a further 15 installed to deal with the Narayanganj side of the dam. Flooding in the area has been controlled to some extent as a result, the WDB claimed. A meeting of the Local Government Division on flood defence and water drainage for the capital was held to discuss the threat. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal convened the meeting. A proposal has been made to construct another embankment on the eastern side of Dhaka, in a bid to protect the city. Iqbal said: "The whole of Dhaka would come under the DND if this embankment was constructed." The adviser also ordered the Department of Public Health and Engineering to ensure the supply of medicines and clean drinking water to the affected areas. A further request was made to the Local Government Engineering Department to repair rain-damaged roads as quickly as possible. The adviser told reporters: "An initiative to reclaim Dhaka's drainage canals has been revived. Due to the publication of some negative reports, the responsibility of reclaiming the canal system was given to law-enforcement agencies." "But as the flood situation has deteriorated the time has come to reclaim the canals." "WASA and the WDB are working together for drainage and flood control in the DND area. Dhaka City Corporation will arrange bamboo bridges and small boats to keep the communications system intact in flooded areas," he said. bdnews24
