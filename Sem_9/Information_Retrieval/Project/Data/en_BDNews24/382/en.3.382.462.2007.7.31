<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka stocks plunged in midday trade Tuesday, frustrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission's directive suspending the financial adjustment facility for quality or 'A' shares. The SEC Monday suspended the facility to rein in a lingering surge in the prices of stocks and liquidity flow on bourses. The directive became effective from Tuesday. Indices curved down after trade took off. Within one and a half hours of trade, the main index DGEN lost 75 points amid selling pressure. The market started to regain foothold prior to the midday session but remained far from the positive territory. "It appears that the market has absorbed the initial shock. Let's see how it behaves for the rest of the session," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 700 million in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh. The DGEN or general index plunged 64.47 points or 2.65 percent to reach 2361.51 at 11.44am. The DSI or all-share price index slumped 45.80 points or 2.33 percent to 1917.32. Losers beat gainers 135 to 15 and eight issues held steady. Turnover stood at Tk 550.77 million. On Monday, total turnover was Tk 2.07 billion. The financial adjustment facility, effective from early 2005, had earlier allowed investors to buy another share the same day with proceeds from the sold share. With the facility suspended, investors have to wait until the fourth day for transaction settlement. The SEC expected that the suspension of the facility would help reduce liquidity flow, which resulted in high demand and price spirals of issues. Square Pharma, BRAC Bank and Southeast Bank topped the turnover table at 11.35am. Square Pharma slumped to Tk 5,195 from Monday's Tk 5,424.25. BRAC Bank which traded on the spot market following a SEC directive fell to Tk 875 from Tk 893. Southeast Bank slipped to Tk 568.75 from Tk 589.75. National Bank stood at Tk 950.25, down from Tk 1,017.25. UCBL dropped to Tk 3,430 from Tk 3,562.25. All the remaining top issues in turnoverSummit Power, Grameen 1 mutual fund, EXIM Bank, Shahjalal Bank and Prime Banktraded downbeat.
