 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  Nuclear scientist Wazed Miah, who is suffering from multiple complications, has been shifted to the Square Hospital from the Bangladesh Medical College Hospital, doctors said Friday. Miah, the husband of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was taken to the Square Hospital at 11:00 pm Thursday after his condition deteriorated, Square's general manager John Gomez said. A seven-member medical board, headed by Dr Mirza Nazim Uddin, is treating the ailing scientist in the hospital's Intensive Care Unit, he said. Uddin said Miah's condition was stable. Miah has been suffering from high blood pressure, heart trouble, diabetes, kidney trouble and body-ache, he said. "His kidney is not working normally since his diabetes problem has aggravated. He has a bypass surgery. We're trying to treat him taking all his complications into account," Uddin said. The other members of the medical board are Sohrabuzzaman, MH Millat, AB Sarwar-e-Alam, MA Hashem, Abdullah A Jamil and Ismail Chowdhury.
