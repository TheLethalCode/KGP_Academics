<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday said the date for party council would be fixed with the permission of party chairperson Khaleda Zia. "The date of the council would be fixed with the permission of the chairperson," Bhuiyan said to journalists at his Gulshan home Friday noon. "The first work for our reform proposal is building public opinion in favour of the proposals. The work of creating opinion inside and outside the party is going on. "We are getting huge response from all over the country," said the BNP secretary general, whom Khaleda recently accused of plotting to split the party. Asked what if the party chief refused permission, he said, "If permission is not available then we will think about what else can be done. It is still premature to speculate on that." A pro-Bhuiyan BNP leader had earlier said they would press on with the council keeping Khaleda in the cold if she refused the go-ahead. Former lawmakers Nazir Hossain, GM Siraj, Dr Ziaul Haque Mollah, Masud Arun and Shammi Sher, acting president of Jaiyatabadi Krishak Dal Mujibur Rahman Mollah and some leaders of Dhaka city BNP met Bhuiyan until midday. Nazir told bdnews24.com that they were garnering public opinion about the reform proposals and getting in touch with BNP councilors. "BNP is a big political party. Our reform proposals are aimed at making [president Ziaur Rahman's] party democratic in tune with time. We want to make BNP more powerful and united through the reforms, "Nazir said. "The question of division or conflict does not arise." Asked why the "reformists" have softened their stance he said they were sticking to their stance. "We are going by the party constitution." bdnew
