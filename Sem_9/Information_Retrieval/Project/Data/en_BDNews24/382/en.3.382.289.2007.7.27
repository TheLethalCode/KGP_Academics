 MUMBAI, Fri Jul 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Muslim man who plotted and arranged financing for country's worst bombings was sentenced to death on Friday, the 12th person to be handed capital punishment over the attacks that killed 257 people in 1993. Yakub Memon, a brother of the main accused, fugitive Tiger Memon, was the last of those convicted in the case for whom prosecutors had sought the death sentence. He struggled with police and protested as Judge PD Kode read out the sentence in a crowded courtroom in India's financial capital.

The anti-terrorism court, which found 100 people guilty over the attacks, has so far sentenced 96 people, including 12 to death and 20 to life, mostly on charges of conspiracy, preparing the bombs or leaving explosives-laden cars and scooters. Another 64 people have been sentenced to varying jail terms and fines for planning and abetting the attacks or for illegal possession of arms. The death sentences have to be confirmed by the Supreme Court. The four remaining convicts, including Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, are expected to be sentenced next week. They face a maximum punishment of up to 10 years in prison for possessing illegal arms bought from those involved in the attacks.
