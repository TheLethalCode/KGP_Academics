 WASHINGTON, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US economic activity expanded further in June and early July, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, as slower housing markets contrasted with improvements in manufacturing and commercial real estate. In the Fed's Beige Book summary of anecdotal economic conditions, seven Fed districts reported the pace of growth as moderate or modest, while others said conditions were moderating, decelerating, mixed or varied. Only the Philadelphia district said economic conditions had improved. "On balance, consumer spending rose at a modest pace, although a number of districts indicated that sales were mixed or below expectations," the Fed in the report, prepared by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank from information collected through July 16. The report comes as recent data has shown solid jobs growth and improved business spending. However, housing market problems have made financial markets jittery over signs that subprime mortgage problems are spilling into prime mortgages and loans for leveraged corporate buyouts. Last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that housing market woes could dampen an expected pickup in US economic growth, but he restated the central bank's main worry remains inflation. The Fed's policy setting Federal Open Market Committee has held benchmark overnight interest rates steady at 5.25 percent for more than a year in the hopes that slower economic growth would curb price pressures. INPUT COST GROWTH The Fed's Beige Book said districts overall reported cost pressures on businesses, particularly from petroleum-related items, but retail prices were increasing at a moderate rate. "Almost every region said that oil and gasoline prices were either rising, high or 'an issue,'" the Fed said. Wage gains were described as either moderate or similar to the previous reporting period, but "significant upward pressure" was reported on wages and salaries for in-demand, highly skilled workers. Employment increased in most locations and in many sectors of the economy, with some districts describing labor markets as tight or tightening. But the Fed districts reported that businesses were having mixed success in passing on higher costs to their customers. Prices for some construction materials, such as lumber and cement, declined in parts of the country. Most districts said residential construction and real estate activity continued to decline through mid-July, with some describing conditions as "soft" and "weak." Two notable exceptions were the Cleveland and Richmond regions, which experienced slight increases in home sales. Manufacturing activity expanded in June and early July in most districts, while Atlanta and Chicago pointed to general stability in the sector, and Kansas City and Dallas said activity had "slowed" and "cooled," respectively In the agricultural sector, the Fed noted that crop development in the Chicago, Atlanta and Richmond regions had been hurt by drought, while heavy rains impeded the hay and wheat harvests in the Dallas and Kansas City districts.
