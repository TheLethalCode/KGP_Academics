If we know it very well, we will be able to take steps," SEC chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi told bdnews24.com.

The SEC set the merchant banks a two-day deadline to send the details. "We have also asked merchant banks to give information on what type of prudential guideline they follow themselves," Siddiqi said.
