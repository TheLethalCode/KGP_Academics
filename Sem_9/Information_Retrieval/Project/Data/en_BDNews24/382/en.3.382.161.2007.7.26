 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Myanmar's construction minister Major Gen Saw Tun arrived in Dhaka Thursday to sign a deal on the construction of a road connecting Bangladesh with the Southeast Asian neighbour. The proposed 25-kilometre highway will link the border town of Teknaf to Bawlibazar in Myanmar. The plan is to create an overland route to Kunming in China as well as Malaysia and Singapore. Saw Tun arrived Zia International Airport at midday where he was received by communications adviser MA Matin and communications secretary Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman. "We will sign an agreement on construction of the road tomorrow (Friday)," Saw Tun told reporters gathered at the airport. He declined to elaborate on the scheme until the talks had been completed. "The 25-kilometre road link between the two friendly countries will allow us to go to Kunming in China via Myanmar and also Malaysia and Singapore. The road, if constructed, will increase trade and commerce between the two countries," Matin said. The adviser added that Bangladesh would fund the project as a 'gesture of the friendly relations' existing between the neighbouring countries. "This is another step forward in the government's 'look east' policy," Matin said. The minister's arrival in Dhaka follows an earlier visit made by Myanmar's deputy minister of foreign affairs. Bangladesh's foreign affairs adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury signed a memorandum of understanding for the highway project while in Myanmar in April. bdnews
