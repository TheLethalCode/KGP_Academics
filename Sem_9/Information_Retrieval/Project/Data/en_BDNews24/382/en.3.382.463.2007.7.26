 Rajshahi, July 26 (bdnews24.com)Rajshahi University authorities are making a list of those teachers who protested Sheikh Hasina's arrest by missing classes Thursday, said the university's vice chancellor. More than 200 RU faculty members abandoned classes en bloc Thursday, in aid of their demands to the governmentto free Hasina, to lift the ban on political activities to hold elections before the declared cutoff time and to eliminate corruption from different universities including RU. Immediately after the protest programme, RU vice chancellor Prof M Altaf Hossain asked university departments to list those teachers who took part in the protest. Speaking to bdnews24.com, the VC said: "The list is being made according to orders from higher authorities." He refused to disclose further details. Faculty members who participated in the protest programme have complained to bdnews24.com that officials of the various security agencies on the campus have visited teachers' houses to quiz them in person and harassed them over the phone. The teachers who made the complaints preferred to remain unnamed and said they were anxious about the proposed list and its consequences. bdnews24.com/
