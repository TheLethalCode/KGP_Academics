 CAIRO, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 15-year-old Egyptian boy died on Tuesday of gunshot wounds sustained during anti-government protests between Sinai Bedouin and Egyptian police a day earlier near the border with the Gaza Strip, his father said.

The Bedouin of north Sinai have become increasingly assertive about their grievances against the government in Cairo and have staged several large protests this year, mainly to demand the release of detainees. The police detained thousands of Bedouin after a series of bombings at tourist resorts in Sinai between 2004 and 2006. The authorities have released about 60 people.
