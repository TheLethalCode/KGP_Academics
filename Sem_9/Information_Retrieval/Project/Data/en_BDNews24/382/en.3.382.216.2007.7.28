 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  Prepaid or postpaid, a mobile phone call cannot cost more than Tk 2 and less than Tk 0.25 per minute from now, the telecoms regulator has said. Cellphone operators cannot offer any promotional packages with a spending limit even for prepaid customers, BTRC said in 'interim directive' issued Thursday. Neither can the operators offer any freebies other than free talk-time, free SMS or free handsets from now. The regulator has tightened its grip on the sales and marketing of mobile phone services. The operators cannot offer any freebies other than free talk-time, free SMS or free handsets from now. But the customers can use the free talk-time only for "off-net" calls, which means mobile phone users cannot make bonus calls within the network using the minutes they have earned. Users have to call other mobile networks to enjoy the bonus airtime. The first regulatory intervention on commercial issues explicitly prohibits any cash or valuable rewards to allure the consumers. Claiming to be the telecoms sector's "custodian", the BTRC said it would also approve the operators' marketing campaign that tags anything free other than talk-time, SMS or mobile phones. The mobile phone operators are divided on the new regulatory decree. "The minimum tariff should not apply to smaller players," an operator's top official told bdnews24.com, requesting anonymity. "It would make the big operators bigger as they can afford prolonged subsidy. But the smaller operators don't have a deep pocket and BTRC should understand that," the official said. Consumers have welcomed the tariff cuts but objected to making "off-net" calls mandatory for bonus airtime. "Using the free minutes that I have earned is my prerogative," Abdul Malek, a schoolteacher in Mymensingh, told bdnews24.com by phone. He said BTRC should have asked the operators to improve the quality of services. "Selling trash at cheaper prices makes no sense." BTRC will sit with the operators Monday to discuss the directive it has imposed. bdnews
