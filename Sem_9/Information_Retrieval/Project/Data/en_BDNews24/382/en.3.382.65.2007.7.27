<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Environmental groups have branded BAA's attempts to seek an injunction limiting next month's planned protest at Heathrow as "insanely draconian". The company has applied for an injunction against an environmental umbrella group, Airport Watch, which covers 5 million members belonging to 10 groups such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the National Trust. The injunction, if granted, would allow police to arrest anyone demonstrating against climate change and airport expansion near its facilities. Up to 5,000 demonstrators were planning to hold a Camp for Climate Action at the airport between Aug. 14 and 21. The injunction would cover protesters' movements on the underground near Heathrow and parts of the M4 and M25 motorways if they fail to give 24 hours' notice of a protest, the groups said. Spanish-owned BAA will seek judicial approval for its injunction in the High Court on Wednesday. The Independent newspaper, which said it has seen the legal documents submitted by BAA, said: "Protesters would be allowed to gather at three protest points on the outskirts of the airport providing they did not exceed an as yet unspecified number, and gave their names, car registration plates and advance notice." They would not be allowed to go within 100 metres of any airport operation. Benedict Southworth, director of the anti-poverty campaign group World Development Movement (WDM), said: "For BAA to attempt to prevent our staff, members and supporters, along with millions of other law-abiding citizens from travelling on the Piccadilly line or parts of the M4 or M25 is not only insulting but ludicrous beyond belief. "WDM is campaigning for climate change to be taken seriously by big business and the government alike -- this insanely draconian attempt by BAA to stop peaceful protest starkly shows how much work there is to do." Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said BAA had not consulted Transport for London about the travel restrictions. He added: "Transport for London will be writing to BAA to demand that all reference to its property and services be removed from any such injunction and will oppose any attempt to restrict the lawful use of its public transport services in the courts." A spokesman for Heathrow said in a statement the injunction was to "protect the operation of the airport and the safety of passengers". "We respect people's right to protest within the bounds of the law and the airport bye-laws and would invite protesters to similarly respect the rights of passengers travelling through Heathro
