 RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canada scored an upset shootout win over Argentina to claim the men's field hockey gold at the Panamerican Games on Wednesday and a coveted berth in the Beijing Olympics.

"We've had seven terrible years and this is the most important win of my career," said Canadian team captain Rob Short, who was earning his 248th cap. "It means so much to me.
