 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com) Charges were framed Wednesday against Mahbuba Sultana, wife of former BNP lawmaker Mosaddak Ali Falu, in a tax-dodging case. Neither Mahbuba nor her lawyer was present at the Special Judges Court-1, set up in the Jatiya Sangsad premises, during the charge framing. The court set July 31 to take testimony from witnesses. Deputy commissioner of the National Board of Revenue Masudur Rahman Masud filed the case on July 5 against Mahbuba for submitting false wealth and bank statements to the NBR, concerning her assets and earnings for 2001-2006. Mahbuba was accused of concealing information about property worth Tk 6.32 crore in her statements in order to evade Tk 1.58 crore in taxes. Police had raided Falu's Shahjahanpur home several times but have been unable to arrest the accused. bdnews
