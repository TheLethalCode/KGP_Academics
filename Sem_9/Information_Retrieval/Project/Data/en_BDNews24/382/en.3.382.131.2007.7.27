 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  The daily average turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange reached an all-time high last week at Tk 2.23 billion from Tk 2.13 billion the previous week, buoyed by a consistent surge in fund inflows from the financial sector. Entry of new investors in the market along with businessmen, who are being cautious in investing in new projects, also drove the market, stakeholders said. "It's a temporary phenomenon. Excess liquidity in the market will shift if alternative investment options are created," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. Khan observed that excess liquidityfrom banks and non-bank financial institutes was flowing into the market. Businessmen, who were taking a wait-and-see appeoach in taking on new projects, were also putting their money, he said. Stakeholders also said loan extension facilities, from the merchant banking operations of banks and Non-banking financial institutions were helping to increase fund inflows. According to the DSE, total turnover increased 4.77 percent to Tk 11.19 billion last week from Tk 10.68 billion the previous week. The bourse saw the highest-ever turnover at Tk 2.75 billion on July 22, up from Tk 2.39 billion on July 17. Sharif Ataur Rahman, managing director of SAR Securities, attributed the rise in turnover to the entry of new investors in the market. "I used to manage 50-60 clients a day three months ago. Now I manage 300-400 clients daily," he said. Beneficiary owners' accounts, through which investors take part in trading, were opened at a rapid rate. In the six months to June this year, a total of 466,000 BOs were opened. The figure is almost twice the total BOs opened in January-December in 2006. The current number of BOs stands at some 1.4 million. Higher demand for shares, as reflected by the surge in transactions, in turn drove the price indices to a new high. In the month to July 25, the benchmark DGEN or general index added 300 points or 14.28 percent to reach 2400 points. On June 25, the DGEN had topped 2100 points. "Investment flow normally increases when the market remains upbeat," MKM Mohiuddin, president of Chittagong Stock Exchange, told bdnews24.com. Saiful Islam, managing director of Equity Partners Securities that facilitates foreign investment here, observed that local individual as well as institutional support pulled the turnover. "However, foreigners are going slow due to excessive current market price of stocks," he said, adding foreign investors had earlier in the year been highly active in the market. bdnews
