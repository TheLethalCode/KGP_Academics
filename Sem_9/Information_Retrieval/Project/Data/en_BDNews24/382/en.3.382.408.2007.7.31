 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury met US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte at the International Convention Centre in Manila Tuesday, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Both arrived in the Philippine capital to attend the session of the Asean Regional Forum currently being held in the city. Bilateral relations and international affairs were reported to have featured in the meeting, said the ministry. Speaking to the media afterwards, the foreign adviser said, "Secretary John Negroponte and I have both represented our countries at the United Nations in New York at the same time, and are good friends." "I told him we in Bangladesh see the US as a close partner, and wish to work with them across a whole range of issues including development, anti-terrorism, non-proliferation and human rights and dignity." The adviser told reporters, "I also explained to him the plans and programmes of the caretaker government and the 'roadmap' leading to elections by December 2008. In the world today Bangladesh is a mainstream voice of moderation and is a responsible international actor, which the US appreciates very much." "Negroponte wished us success in our endeavours," he added. Negroponte said that the US administration was following the events in Bangladesh very closely. He noted that the plans of the caretaker government enjoyed "popular support", and expressed the hope that elections would take place as stipulated. Chowdhury is scheduled to sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of Southeast Asia at a ceremony at the conference centre Wednesday. bdn
