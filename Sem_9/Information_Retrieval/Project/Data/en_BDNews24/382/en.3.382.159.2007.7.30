 July30 (bdnews24.com/BBC)--Islamic militants have occupied a shrine in a tribal district of Pakistan and named it after the Red Mosque in Islamabad, eyewitnesses say. More than 70 pro-Taleban militants evicted local officials from the Haji Sahib Turangzai shrine near the Afghan border in the country's northwest. They are also reportedly planning a religious school for girls, to be named after a seminary in the Red Mosque. The mosque was the scene of a siege this month in which 100 people died. On Friday, a suicide bomber killed at least 13 people near the mosque.

Earlier in July, Pakistani troops stormed the Red Mosque after its clerics and students waged an increasingly aggressive campaign to enforce strict Sharia law in Islamabad. The mosque had become a centre of radical Islamic learning and housed several thousand male and female students in adjacent seminaries. More than 100 people were killed in the siege, including 11 soldiers and an as yet unknown number of militants and their hostages. The attack on the mosque was the fiercest battle fought by security forces in Pakistan since President Musharraf vowed to dismantle the jihadi network in the country in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001.
