<TITLE> Committee to relax barrier to government info </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Monday moved to form a committee to assess which information people can access without harming state security, a spokesman said. The directive came from the first meeting of the advisory council committee on public administration reform and good governance, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com. The meeting was chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Bureaucrats retreat behind the Official Secrets Act, denying people access to government information. The new move is meant to relax the barrier. At present, the Rules of Business applicable to government officials are marked "secret" but information about it reaching the people would not harm the state, the meeting observed. The committee led by the establishment secretary will list such issues. The number of the committee members will be determined later. The committee also discussed the work of state-owned service-providing organisations. Efforts are underway to ease the payment of utility bills by building a kind of the one-stop payment system, people familiar with the details of the meeting said. The committee also discussed ways to smooth the issuance of passports and driving licences and stressed making easier land registration, instant delivery of land documents, cutting registration costs and modernising land administration. It was decided that any ministry or directorate would acknowledge complaints from people, in a measure meant to ensure accountability and transparency of the government. Ministries and directorates have been instructed to make a list of such complaint letters and send them to the chief adviser for review. Munaim said the meeting was part of efforts to take deeper administrative reforms. He referred to the 18 committees and commissions formed in the years from 1972 to 1997 on reforms to the administration. The latest administrative reform commission was formed in 1997 with ATM Shamsul Haque as its chief. The commission submitted its report to the government in 2001, outlining short-term, interim and long-term proposals for implementation. But the past governments did not implement many of the recommendations. bdnews24.c
