 PHNOM PENH, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chief Khmer Rouge inquisitor Duch was charged with crimes against humanity on Tuesday, the first of Pol Pot's henchmen to be formally accused over the deaths of 1.7 million people in Cambodia's "Killing Fields". After a morning hearing before a tribunal of domestic and international judges, the 65-year-old schoolteacher and born-again Christian was taken into provisional custody of the court, a statement said.
