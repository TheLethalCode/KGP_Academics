<TITLE> Students to get NCTB English grammar textbook soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)-- The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) is to publish an English grammar textbook for higher secondary students. NCTB chairman Mohammad Yusuf Farooq told bdnews24.com that the book would be available to students who enrolled this year. He said that there were many books on English grammar available in the market, published privately. These books were not up to the mark, because the writers of these books were underpaid due to publishers' tendency for more profit. The board intended to give the students a standard book at a reasonable price, he added. To a query on the progress stage of the book, Farooq said the manuscript had been written and sent to the publishers. However, the price was not fixed. It would be set following the page makeup. The book titled ' English Grammar and Composition' would hit the shelves of bookstores in late August or early September. The NCTB took the initiative about a year ago when Dr Gazi Mohammad Ahsanul Kabir was in office. However, the board chair could not say anything about the progress of a textbook on Bangla grammar. Meanwhile, quite a few institutions have started classes for the current academic session. Tahmina Khanam, principal of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College told bdnews24.com that she was not aware of such an English grammar book. Nevertheless, such an initiative would definitely facilitate the students and it should come out in the market in time, she added. bdnews2
