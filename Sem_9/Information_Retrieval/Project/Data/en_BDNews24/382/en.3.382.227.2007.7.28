 Syed Mahmudul Huq Chairman Bangladesh Myanmar Business Promotion Council Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) -- The signing of an agreement on the construction of Bangladesh-Myanmar Friendship Road Link Friday marks the beginning of a new era in Bangladesh-Myanmar economic relations. This is actually the restoration of the old road, which once linked Chittagong with Akiyab. Although it does not go to Akiyab any more, the old habits die hard. The people of the area still call it Arakan road. The construction of this road link will help re-establish the old land surface link between Gumdum on Bangladesh side and Tumbro on Myanmar side. The present volume of trade between Bangladesh and Myanmar is considered quite insignificant compared to the huge potential it offers. With an area of 676,577 square kilometres, Myanmar is five the size of Bangladesh. The coastline is 2,832 kilometres, twice the size of Japan and 4.58 times of Bangladesh. Its population is 47 million, less than 40 percent of Bangladesh with density of 70 persons per square kilometre, compared to 861 of Bangladesh, and as such, per capita share of land is 12.3 times greater in Myanmar than in Bangladesh. However, Myanmar's own geography adds a different angle to the prospect of bilateral business relations between the two countries The Arakan Mountain range separates Rakhine and Chin states bordering Bangladesh from the rest of Myanmar. These two states are endowed with rich natural resources including limestone, timber, bamboo, marine products and a variety of minerals. Besides millions of tonnes of limestone deposits in the Rakhine State, there is a single patch of bamboo forestry stretching over 7,000 square kilometres producing 2.2 million tonnes of single species of bamboo, equivalent to 8,00,000 metric tonnes of pulp that can feed up to 25 paper mills the size of Karnaphuli Paper Mills. Recent discovery of 16 TCF of proven gas reserves in the Rakhine has opened up new possibilities. Because of the geographical proximity, Bangladeshi businessmen could be the logical, ideal partners of Myanmar when it comes to harnessing these resources in Rakhine and Chin states to the mutual benefits of both. We can set up import substitution industry as well as export-oriented industries under joint venture. We can also establish Special Economic Zones on both sides of the border for the purpose. Myanmar's liberal policy on leasing out land for agro-based industries is indeed tempting. On a commercial basis, up to 5,000 acres of cultivable, fallow or wasteland is available for plantation crops, 3,000 acres for orchard and 1,000 acres for seasonal crops. For aquaculture, the limit is 2,000 acres. For livestock, 5,000 acres available for buffalo, cattle and horse, 1,000 acres for sheep and goat, and 500 acres for poultry. Depending on the type of venture, exemption from land tax is also offered for a period from two to eight years. There are also provisions for income tax waiver for a minimum period of three years from the date of commercial operation. Besides, we can develop contract-farming in the Myanmar states bordering Bangladesh. Under the contract, Myanmar farmers can offer their land and labour, while Bangladesh entrepreneurs may provide know-how and necessary supervision, supply of required inputs and furnish a buy-back guarantee ensuring recovery of cost of production plus certain profit for the farmers as would be mutually agreed upon. As for supply of inputs, fertilisers, especially urea, will be of most significance. Since Bangladesh is still importing urea fertiliser, we may explore the idea of importing gas from Rakhine, for production of urea fertiliser for re-export to Myanmar. The construction of a gas pipeline from Rakhine to Chittagong could be undertaken by a private sector-led consortium of investors from Bangladesh. I am sure the construction of the surface road link will certainly facilitate translation of some of these vast opportunities into realities. It may be mentioned here that Myanmar is a unique country that has borders with five countries in Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. As such, this friendship road link will not only connect Bangladesh with Myanmar by surface; but also it will allow us to access China and Thailand. We will not be far off from planned Asian Highway and the revival of Southern Silk Road will also enable us to access Kunming in China. It may also be mentioned here that the 160-kilometre Indo-Myanmar Friendship Road already connected the North Eastern States of India with central Myanmar in 2001. The physical connectivity, I am sure, will enhance the economic co-operation in the region including Bangladesh, China, Myanmar and India. In the post-WTO era, we are now dismantling the tariff barriers and trying to create a borderless world of trade. It will put us up against huge challenges of globalisation and there is no alternative to regional co-operation to survive these challenges. It is in this context that the physical connectivity in the region will have to be understood in order to take fullest advantage of the complementarities of the region. While the connectivity offers huge opportunities, it may also create further intra-regional disparity if relatively less developed economies like Myanmar and Bangladesh do not prepare themselves to face competition from bigger economies like China and India. Myanmar and Bangladesh are at the confluence of these two giant economies and if we do not make use of the expertise and experience of the bigger economies in an appropriate and structured manner, there is every possibility of our being overrun by the bigger neighbours in their bid to secure the huge market that they offer to each other. This dimension of the connectivity will have to be well appreciated both at the level of policy planners and relevant stakeholders so that Bangladesh and Myanmar may work hand in hand to forge strong partnership to withstand the challenges from within and outside the region. The recently-concluded official level talks in Dhaka between Bangladesh and Myanmar have duly flagged the issues that we are to address in the days to come. In a recent meeting held in the Ministry of Agriculture, it was decided that a business delegation would be sent to Myanmar next month under the leadership of the agriculture secretary to follow up on what have been discussed at the official level meeting including contract-farming and import of gas from Myanmar primarily for production of fertiliser for export to Myanmar to support its farming sector. bdn
