 MADRID, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of African children are at risk of violence and even sexual abuse in Spanish government migrant detention centres in the Canary Islands, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Thursday. Children at the four centres established to cope with a surge in illegal migration to the Canaries last year complained of beatings by staff and of a lack of protection from violence by peers, the human rights lobby group said in a report which the island government said lacked proof.

Another boy said: "When we tell them that we are hungry they tell us that we were starving in Senegal and should be happy to be given food at all." But the Canary Islands' regional government said it had initiated an internal investigation in February after Human Rights Watch first told it of the abuses described in the report only presented on Thursday and found no evidence for them. "The Canary Islands asked for more detailed information, but the organisation (Human Rights Watch) refused to provide it," the islands' government said. It added that it also wants to close down the centres and said the national Spanish government had failed to meet a commitment to transfer more of the children to the mainla
