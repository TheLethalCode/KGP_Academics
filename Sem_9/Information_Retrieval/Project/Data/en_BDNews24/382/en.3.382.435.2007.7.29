 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has announced a possible split in the Department of Fisheries into two areas of work in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the department. The plan will see the creation of two new wings, one dealing with promotional activities and the other with the regulatory side of the department, fisheries adviser CS Karim said Sunday. "Both regulation and promotion are important in today's globalised world. But the fisheries department as it exists now cannot do the work alone," he said. "Talks are now ongoing as to whether we can separate the department's two areas of concernregulation and promotion." Karim made his comments as chief guest at an industry seminar at the Matsya Bhaban, organised by Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation (BSFF) and Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association (BFFEA). The fisheries adviser highlighted the importance of both safety and quality in achieving sustainability in export growth and the significance of identifying new potential in markets. According to BFFEA figures, frozen food exports from Bangladesh were worth $510 million in fiscal 2006-07. Exporters have now set a target achieving $1 billion in turnover by 2010. Karim added: "If we want to succeed in the global market we must concentrate on quality." "Countries in the European Union and the United States do not compromise with food safety. They won't buy our product if we fail to comply with their guidelines." "Food safety is equally important to us. An independent regulatory body may improve our ability to ensure the quality of food products for domestic consumers as well." Francois Collet, a representative from the European Commission, said: "Bangladesh is confident and committed to ensuring food safety for outside buyers as well as for domestic consumers." BFFEA president Maqsudur Rahman claimed: "The plan is to increase export volume to 1 lakh tonnes from the current 50,000 tonnes by 2010." BSFF president Syed Mahmudul Huq added: "Local exporters are not aware of EU compliance issues. The foundation is planning to form a Bangladesh shrimp development alliance to bring all stakeholders under one umbrella to achieve greater integration." bdnew
