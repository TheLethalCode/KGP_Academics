 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks slumped Thursday following a rush by investors to secure their profits in most scrips, particularly in the banking and power sectors. The market traded upbeat in the morning although it started to decline by midday, remaining in the negative towards closing. "It's a healthy sign that investors' took their overdue profit, it resulted in a mini correction. Such a move should take from place time to time," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh which manages about Tk 700 million worth of funds. Mutual funds and IT shares gained along with certain multinationals and Square Group stocks. Renewed talks for the privatisation of Atlas Bangladesh, a state-run engineering company, and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (BSRS) drove their prices to soar. The DGEN or general index slumped 21.05 points or 0.86 percent to 2401.49. The DSI or all-share price index shed 18.13 points or 0.92 percent to end at 1944.30. The DSE-20 blue-chip index ended almost unchanged at 2219.79 down 1.56 points or 0.07 percent from the previous day. Losers beat gainers 117 to 72 with 17 issues finishing unchanged. "It appears that investors are cautious and making prudent judgments. Correction helps reduce the prices of overvalued shares," said Ziaul Haque Khondker, managing director of the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh. Turnover rose to Tk 2.46 billion from Wednesday's Tk 2.32 billion. The Chittagong Stock Exchange finished lower as major sectors such as banking, power and cement slumped, influenced by profit-taking. A total of 28 issues gained, 74 lost and seven held steady on the CSE. Turnover on the bourse dropped to Tk 319.50 million from Tk 372.94 million. On the DSE, Square Pharma continued its bullish run at the top of the turnover table, announcing a planned rise in its authorised capital to Tk 5 billion from the current Tk 1 billion. Square Pharma shares added 1.84 percent to end at Tk 5498.25. Speculation of an increase in half-yearly earnings drove Square Textile shares up 3.28 percent to Tk 119.6. BRAC Bank lost 2.45 percent to end at Tk 915.5 after investors locked in their gains. NCC Bank also dropped 0.46 percent to Tk 377. Anticipation of good half-yearly earnings encouraged Eastern Bank to gain 0.12 percent to Tk 799.75. Bangladesh Lamps, Bata Shoe, PLFSL, Popular Life Insurance, UCBL, Bank Asia, City Bank, IFIC and National Bank all reported a rise in their half-yearly earnings. Rupali Bank and Shahjalal Bank fell reporting a decline in earnings.
