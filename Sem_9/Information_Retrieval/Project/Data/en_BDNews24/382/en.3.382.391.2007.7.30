 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  The makeshift committee of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), headed by Major General Sina Ibn Jamali, will sit at an emergency meeting on Wednesday to settle some unresolved issues, an official said Monday. BCB chief executive Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com the meeting would discuss the pending issues such as appointments of the national coach and selectors, the announcement of the squad for the Twenty20 World Cup and getting a sponsor for the team. Rahman said he had a meeting with the new BCB boss Monday, a day after the government had appointed a 12-member ad-hoc committee. The meeting would also discuss 17 standing committees and the sub-committees would be dissolved after the en bloc resignations of the elected members of the executive committee three days ago. "It is not clear in the constitution whether the sub-committees would be dissolved after the dissolution of the executive committee," Rahman said. "I have informed him (the BCB president) about this." Bangladesh are currently without a coach after Dav Whatmore resigned and no permanent decision has been taken about the sponsorship. The deadline of announcing the Twenty20 World Cup final team is August 11. bdnews24.com/mp/ar/bd/225
