 ADDIS ABABA, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopian opposition leaders accused the government on Thursday of waging an "intensive propaganda campaign" against them through state media, less than a week after being freed in a clemency deal. Thirty eight opposition members and activists were freed from jail last Friday after a nearly two-year trial that rights groups and donors complained was an attempt to dismantle the opposition after it made strong gains in 2005 elections.

The defendants were arrested after two bouts of violence following disputed 2005 elections in which 199 civilians and police were killed, 800 people wounded and 30,000 arrested according to a parliamentary inquiry.

The group was freed after the government made public a letter it said CUD leaders sent to Meles admitting their guilt and promising to respect the law.
