 NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND, July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India were left needing just 73 to beat England and take a 1-0 lead in the Test series after bowling out the hosts for 355 on the fourth day at Trent Bridge. England captain Michael Vaughan hit 124 and put on 112 with Paul Collingwood to put England narrowly in front. But the last seven wickets tumbled for just 68 runs as Zaheer Khan (5-75) produced some inspired seam bowling. Collingwood hit 63 and Andrew Strauss 55, but other key batsmen failed. India closed on 10-0, needing a further 63. With bright conditions overhead and the ball already 16 overs old at the start of the penultimate day, the biggest threat to England's batsmen appeared to be the leg-spin of Anil Kumble. But instead, it was the seamers - with Zaheer always the outstanding presence - who shared the first seven wickets. India's first wicket of the day, which had begun with England on 43-0, came as early as the third over. Zaheer got a ball to straighten a fraction on Alastair Cook; the batsman, looking to play away on the on-side, missed to be lbw bang in front of middle stump. Vaughan and Strauss struggled for the next half hour, befuddled by the movement constantly on offer. England finally registered their first boundary of the day when Vaughan pushed Sree Santh through the covers. Later, the young right-armer insolently shoulder-barged England's captain and umpire Ian Howell immediately hauled Dravid over for a word. Vaughan ignored Santh's constant histrionics, and Strauss gradually began to play fluently too. In the second hour runs were much easier to come by. When Kumble finally appeared, he was briefly joined by Sachin Tendulkar for a twin-spin attack. But there were no further breakthroughs for India before lunch, and instead the scoring rate increased further. With both batsmen suddenly looking comfortable, it was massively deflating for England fans to witness Strauss wafting wastefully outside off stump in only the second over after the interval. The batsman produced no footwork, and the thin edge off Zaheer was gratefully pouched by Mahendra Dhoni. New man Pietersen played himself in comfortably, and had moved smoothly to 19 when he was almost decapitated by a Santh beamer. Clearly unsettled, he was dismissed by RP Singh in the subsequent over. Having almost been caught behind from a wild attempted cut, he played no shot to a ball from round the wicket which reversed sharply and trapped him in front off-stump. Vaughan was beginning to play the long innings England needed, and played some delightful cut shots off the disappointing Kumble. After tea, a forcing shot off the back foot through the covers for four off Kumble brought him his 17th Test century. Vaughan celebrated with a defiant punch towards the dressing room, and more landmarks followed for him and Collingwood. The 100 partnership was brought up, and the deficit, initially 283, was finally rubbed off. The second new ball hovered as the next crucial stage in the match, and initially signs were good for England as three boundaries came off Zaheer Khan's first over with it. But in his next, Vaughan went to play a leg-glance and deflected the ball, agonisingly, via thigh-pad onto his stumps. Two balls later, Ian Bell got his pads in the way of a straight one, and India were scenting victory again. Collingwood continued to play his shots, but it was clear whatever he did would be in vain once Matt Prior's middle stump was loosened by Singh. When he drove to slip, Kumble removed the last three men, leaving Ryan Sidebotom high and dry on an entertaining 25
