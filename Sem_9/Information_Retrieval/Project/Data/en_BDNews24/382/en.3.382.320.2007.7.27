<TITLE> Japan election to sow political, policy confusion </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling camp looks set to lose an upper house election on Sunday, but anyone expecting this to bring clarity to the future of Japan's government should think again. Media surveys forecast that voters will deprive Abe's camp of its majority in parliament's upper house because of anger at his government's sloppy handling of pension records, as well as gaffes and scandals that led two cabinet ministers to resign and one to commit suicide. After that, however, the outlook turns murky. Some analysts expect Abe to try to cling to his post despite a stinging defeat and even a slightly better-than-expected performance could help him make his case. If he does go, it's not clear how his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would pick a successor, or who that would be. Whether and how the LDP will try to cope with its loss in the upper house to get key legislation passed is another open question, though most experts expect the party to try to woo independents, small parties and even lawmakers from the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan to its side. How the Democratic Party -- a sometimes fractious mix of former LDP lawmakers, ex-Socialists and young conservatives, many of whom share policy positions with LDP counterparts -- will cope with victory is also uncertain. "When does Abe resign? We don't know. How do they choose a successor? We don't know. What will be the LDP strategy for holding onto power? We don't know. And we don't know what the Democrats will do with their newfound power," said Steven Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in Tokyo. "We could have two years of confusion and manoeuvring." Abe, 52, took office last September pledging to boost Japan's global security profile, rewrite its pacifist constitution, and revive traditional values such as group harmony and patriotism. Analysts, though, disagree over whether the LDP would tone down that approach following a defeat, or tilt further toward nationalism to attract Democratic lawmakers who share that stance. TO RESIGN, OR NOT TO RESIGN Some economists are equally perplexed. "We don't know what it means in terms of policy. It's a mess," said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. "Policy will be on hold while they try to sort it out." The LDP and its partner, the New Komeito, need 64 seats to keep their majority in the upper house, where half of the 242 seats are up for grabs. The New Komeito is aiming for 13 seats. A survey by the liberal Asahi newspaper published on Friday forecast that the ruling bloc would win between 38 and 58 seats, with the LDP accounting for between 31 and 45 of the total. The ruling camp will not be ejected from government if it loses in the upper house since it has a strong grip on the more powerful lower chamber. But without a ruling bloc majority, laws would be hard to enact, threatening policy paralysis. Abe's allies have been laying the groundwork for him to stay on and many analysts agree he might be able to do so at lest temporarily -- especially if the LDP wins at least 40 seats -- partly because of the lack of a convincing successor. Foreign Minister Taro Aso has long been spoken of as the frontrunner, but many wonder whether the gaffe-prone political veteran would be a convincing replacement to lead the party into a general election that must be held by late 2009. "I think the LDP will try to win time and Abe will try to use that time to muddle through," said Martin Schulz, a research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute, adding that Abe might, however, be toppled later in the year or early in 2008. The ability of the Democrats to remain united after an upper house win is also unclear. Analysts say dissatisfied younger conservatives are unlikely to jump ship soon, but could do so later if the LDP makes skilful use of policy issues on which the party is divided, such as security matters, to drive a wedge. "It would not be acceptable to change parties right after winning the election but around the time of an extra parliament session in the autumn ... there could be good excuses to rationalise changing parties," said Jiro Yamaguchi, a political science professor at Hokkaido University. Speculation persists that post-election confusion could force an early election for the more powerful lower house, but several analysts dismissed that scenario as unlikely. "I don't think there will be a quick election," Reed said. "It's up to the LDP and whenever the LDP is in trouble, it puts the election off until the very last moment."
