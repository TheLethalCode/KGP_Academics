<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) - Detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina Sunday challenged in the High Court the government's decision to take an extortion case against her under the cover of the emergency powers rules. Her attorney barrister Rafiqul Huq filed a writ appeal at 1pm with the High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury. The same bench had accepted her petition to file the appeal in the morning. Hasina's lawyers argued that a case that had taken place before the state of emergency was clamped cannot come under emergency powers rules. Earlier, seeking permission to file the appeal, barrister Huq told the court that Manzila Faruque, chief protocol officer of Hasina, need the court's permission to file a writ appeal with special power of attorney from the former prime minister. On Saturday, Sahara Khatun, Awami League's legal affairs secretary, Saturday claimed that they had enough grounds to challenge the case. After a meeting with the party's acting president Zillur Rahman at his Gulshan home, Khatun told reporters that lawyer Toufique Newaz visited Hasina at the special jail and finalised the power of attorney and other documents from her to move the planned petition. Khatun argued that Hasina was arrested under regular law but an order from the home ministry, issued hours after her arrest, said the case had been taken under cover of emergency powers rules. A case under emergency powers rules means the accused will not get bail from court. Hasina's lawyers have been arguing that the case could not be brought under emergency powers act since the so-called incident of extortion is an eight-year old affair. Such an old case cannot be considered under the emergency powers rules that surfaced after the state of emergency was declared in mid-January, they said. Hasina was arrested on July 16 at her Sudha Sadan home, and later a Dhaka court denied her bail and ordered her to jail. On July 24, police formally charged Hasina with extortion, and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka in a second rule fixed Aug 16 to hear the case. Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, who is abroad now, has also been charged in the case although the complainant did not name her in the original complaint. The case involves alleged extortion of Tk 2.99 crore from a businessman in return for allowing him to build a power plant in Siddhirganj, Naraynganj, during Hasina's regime in 1996-2001. Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading, filed the case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station, accusing Hasina and former minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of extortion. Hasina and the Awami League denied the charges, saying that the case was politically motivated. The party also decried the arrest and subsequent detention, arguing that it was meant to prevent Hasina from taking part in next elections, expected to be held anytime between October and December 2008. bdnews24.com/sum/mh
