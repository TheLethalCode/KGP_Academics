<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, July 28 (ALJAZEERA.NET/bdnews24.com) -- Pakistani television channels have reported that Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani president, has met Benazir Bhutto, the exiled Pakistani opposition leader and former prime minister, in the UAE. The meeting comes amid speculation that Musharraf is seeking Bhutto as an ally in his plans to win reappointment for another presidential term, Al Jazeera reported quoting news agencies. The talks, allegedly held on Friday in Abu Dhabi, UAE, lasted for about an hour and ended without an agreement, Pakistani newspapers and television networks reported. Spokespeople for the president and Bhutto's party denied any knowledge of the meeting. Farhatullah Babar, Bhutto's spokesman in Pakistan, said: "I am not in a position to confirm or deny the development." Major-General Rashid Qureshi, Musharraf's spokesman, declined to respond, saying: "I have really no idea, so I don't want to comment." Talks allegedly faltered when Bhutto, who controls Pakistan's most liberal political party, the Pakistan People's party and is in self-imposed exile in London, refused to agree to support Musharraf unless he resigned from the military, Geo television reported, citing unnamed sources. A potential deal would include changing part of Pakistan's constitution which currently blocks Bhutto from becoming prime minister again. Al Jazeera correspondent Kamal Hyder said: "The government is keeping mum about the whole affair - they have been issuing continuous denials, but people will tell you its an open secret now. Hyder reported that Pakistanis do not want a government decided by Musharraf has he has become unpopulr, but nor do they want Benazir Bhutto "because she is not in a position to stem the wave of anger in this country". "A lot of people will also tell you the president's troubles are of his own making ... people are questioning whether the president's team has done their job or not," he said. "They are also questioning as to the role of a military general in a parliamentary democracy. They are saying the military should go back to the barracks and hand over power to the real representatives of the people." "If the president decides to take off his uniform, it will be seen as a victory for Benazir. If he refuses to take that uniform off, then Benazir will be seen as another titular head of state without any real power." Bhutto served as prime minister twice in the 1980s and 1990s, but fled the country to avoid corruption charges after her second government collapsed. Talks between envoys for the two leaders have been reported for months, and a face-to-face meeting between the two could indicate the sides are close to a deal. Musharraf has kept a low profile since the supreme court ended his bid to fire its chief judge, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, which has been seen as a major setback to his plans to seal a new five-year presidential term in the autumn. The government is seen as failing in its handling of the Red Mosque siege, which killed at least 102 people. The collapse of a security deal with tribal elders on the Afghan border to contain Taliban and al-Qaida forces is adding to Musharraf's decline in popularity. With US pressure increasing, Bhutto has been positioning herself as a champion of democracy. Earlier this month, she attacked Musharraf's record of fighting extremism, but left open the possibility of returning to the country while he was still president. She said that, before she returns, the president will have to give up the power to dismiss the prime minister and dissolve parliament and show that free and fair elections can be held. Musharraf, who was due to leave for Jeddah in Saudi Arabia after spending a few hours in the UAE, met the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed al-Nahayan, a Pakistani embassy spokesman said. The two leaders discussed bilateral relations, chiefly "cooperation in fighting terrorism and extremism," and regional issues, the spokesman said.
