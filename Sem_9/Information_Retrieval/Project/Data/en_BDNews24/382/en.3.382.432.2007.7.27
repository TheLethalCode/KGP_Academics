<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  Detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has written to the Bangladesh Bank governor seeking a list of the her accounts with commercial banks. "It will be difficult for Sheikh Hasina to give her wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission before getting a reply from the Bangladesh Bank governor," her lawyer advocate Anisul Haq told reporters Friday afternoon after a meeting Hasina. "The matter of having Sheikh Hasina's account was like a matter of pride for the banks. So Sheikh Hasina has accounts with different banks," he said. "She mainly wanted to know the date of the accounts opened, opening balance and current balance with the banks," said Haq. "Besides on the day she was arrested some papers were seized from her home. That is why she has sought the assistance of the Bangladesh Bank governor," he added. Asked what Hasina and her lawyers would do if they do not receive a reply from the central bank before the ACC deadline expires, Haq replied: "The governor of Bangladesh Bank has been asked; we don't want to impose any obligation on him. He surely knows that the ACC has given seven days' time." Haq told reporters that the former prime minister again expressed her doubts about getting justice. "She told me that if the trial is just and fair she will be proved innocent. The case against her is politically motivated." "I have informed her that the chargesheet has been submitted in the case," he said. On conditions in the special jail in the parliament complex where Hasina has been detained, Haq said: "She told me she was trying to adapt to the jail. Now she does not face any difficulty in taking food." "When the former law minister and Hasina's counsel Abdul Matin Khasru met her on July 20 some vokalatnamas (power of attorney) were sent through him. Those vokalatnamas have not been returned to us yet. "A fresh writ vokalatnama was given on Thursday. We are also yet to receive it. However, the deputy inspector general, prisons, have assured us the vokalatnamas will be reach us by Saturday morning. "If we do not get it by Saturday we will not be able to appeal in the Supreme Court on Sunday. If we cannot file a writ petition on Sunday we will have to wait another week for it. "Besides, her case-related documents such as her statement under section 164 and copy of the FIR have not yet been given to us." Barrister Fazle Noor Tapash, another Hasina cousel, alleged authorities were dragging their feet with warrants of attorney to stop them filing writ appeals. Haq said, "She was hurt in the leg on the day she was arrested. It is still persisting. The doctor will see her on Sunday for treating her leg." "She was infortmed of the illness of her husband. She has been praying for his recovery. She has requested me to convey her greetings to her son Joy on his 36th birthday." At about 11am, four persons wearing shrouds came to the jail gate and demanded Hasina's release, only to be chased away by police. The Motor Drivers League held prayers at the jail gate at 4:30pm for her freedom. Its president Ali Hossain and general secretary Alauddin Rana were present. bdnews24.com/
