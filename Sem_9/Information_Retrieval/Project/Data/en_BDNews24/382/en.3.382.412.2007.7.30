 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy Monday said his mother getting bail from the High Court proved that the way the government was filing cases against her was ill-motivated. "My mother has been purposefully kept under detention to muffle her. She has been detained for political reasons," Sajeeb said to bdnews24.com by phone from the United States. The High Court Monday granted her bail in the extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. On police showing the former prime minister arrested in another case filed by businessman Noor Ali, he said, "My mother has been detained because many will face difficulty if my mother remains free." bdnews
