 Barisal, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists from Agailjhara Degree College in Barisal took out a procession Thursday to protest the arrest of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. Up to 20 leaders and activists from the Awami League's student wing demanded Hasina's immediate release from the special jail in the parliament complex where she is currently detained. The demonstration was held on the college's campus and was broken up by police when they attempted to take it onto the main streets. Agailjhara police chief Golamur Rahman told bdnews24.com that four to five men not associated with the college entered the campus at around 11:30am. They dodged police questioning about their involvement with the BCL procession. College principal Md Hemayetuddin was not immediately available for comment. bdnews24.com/
