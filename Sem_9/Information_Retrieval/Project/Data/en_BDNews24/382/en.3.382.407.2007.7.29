 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Sunday deferred charge-framing against former BNP minister Mirza Abbas who faces allegations of illegally possessing foreign currency. Judge Abu Mohsin of Dhaka Metropolitan Special Court-6 fixed Aug 5 to hear the case again after lawyers for Abbas appealed to the court seeking more time as Abbas was sick and did not get necessary documents. Abbas was taken to the court Sunday from Apollo Hospital. Police formally charged the BNP leader on July 16. Joint forces searched Abbas's Shahjahanpur home and seized huge foreign currency on Feb 4. Motijheel police sub-inspector Rafiqul Islam Mirza filed a case the following day. On Feb 25, the joint forces arrested him at the Anticorruption Commission office in Segunbagicha when he went there to submit his wealth statement. bdnew
