 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has appointed former Bangladesh test cricketer Aminul Islam Bulbul as country development officer for China. "The ACC has appointed me as CDO for three years and I will have to work in China," Bulbul told bdews24.com Friday. Bulbul will be ACC's fourth appointed development officer alongside Roger Binny of India, Rumesh Ratnayake of Sri Lanka and Iqbal Sikander of Pakistan. Bulbul received the appointment letter Thursday and has been asked to join the ACC on September 1, though he may join before the deadline. "The ACC may assign me to the Under-19 Asian Cup in Malaysia to begin on August 20 and I expect to leave Bangladesh the day before the tournament starts," said Bulbul, who hit a century in Bangladesh's inaugural test against India. He said that he would take the charge of the Chinese cricketers on September 10 as far as he knows. "I feel lucky that I will be the first cricket coach for the men of China, who have a great reputation in world sports," said Bulbul, who has been studying in North South University to learn the Chinese language. bdnews
