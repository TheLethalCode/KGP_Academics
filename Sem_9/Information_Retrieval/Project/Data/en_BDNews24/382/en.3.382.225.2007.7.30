 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League leaders and workers Monday distributed sweets on the Jatiya Sangsad premises following the High Court's granting bail to Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case. Shortly after the court order, scores of AL leaders and workers gathered at the gate of the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad premises to celebrate. At about 4pm, Krishak League chief Mirza Jalil led a group of up to 35 people to the special jail gate. They embraced each other, prayed for Hasina and distributed sweets. The cheerful workers halted a bus carrying government officials and offered the passengers sweets. At 5.25pm, up to 30 lawyers led by advocate Sahara Khatun and Barrister Sheikh Fazle Tapash arrived at the jail gate. They brought two case dossiers for Hasina's signature. Jail guard Motaleb Hossain took the dossiers inside the jail at about 6pm. Barrister Sheikh Fazle Nur told reporters that one dossier was required in case the government appealed against Hasina's bail and the other for the case against her filed by businessman Noor Ali with Tejgaon Police Station. Sahara Khatun termed the bail a primary victory. "We will free Sheikh Hasina proving the cases against her false shortly," she said. The jail authorities did not say when the dossiers would be handed over to Hasina's lawyers. Assistant police commissioner Mashiur Rahman, on duty in the jail area talked to authorities and told reporters the dossiers would be handed in to the lawyers Tuesday. bdnews24.com correspondent saw AL workers at the jail gate celebrating the bail until 6pm. Earlier in the day, High Court granted bail to Hasina in an extortion case. But chances for the detained former prime minister to get freedom from jail anytime soon are slim as the police Sunday showed her arrested in another extortion case. The High Court asked the government to take the extortion case off the reach of emergency powers rules. The court also asked the government to explain in two weeks why the inclusion of the case in the emergency powers rules would not declared illegal. The bail order came after Hasina's lawyers Sunday filed a writ appeal with the bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury. Security forces arrested Hasina on July 16 in the extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading. The Awami League chief is detained in the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Hasina's lawyer Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said: "Sheikh Hasina is not getting freedom anytime soon though. She is facing more cases, but we will battle them all out in court." bdnew
