 Dhaka/Kolkata (bdnews24.com) -- A total of 35 government officials arrived in Kolkata Sunday to discuss unresolved issues about the launch of direct passenger rail services between the two neighbouring cities. A trial train, Moitree, from Dhaka left for Kolkata at 7:02am with the Bangladesh delegation and reached the neighbouring city at 5:40pm Bangladesh time, according to railway officials. Additional secretary of the communications ministry ATKM Ismail leads Bangladesh delegation. After reaching Kolkata, he told reporters that India's preparation to introduce direct rail links between the two countries was better. ATKM Ismail said: "I hope we will be able to complete all preparations before Ramadan." He, however, said the final decision in this regard would be taken at political level, bdnews24.com's Kolkata correspondent reports. The Bangladesh delegation will hold a meeting with Indian officials Monday and Tuesday. bdnews24.com's senior correspondent Kamran Reza Chowdhury reports: Ismail indicated that Bangladesh might change its earlier stand on fixing the place for immigration and customs formalities of train passengers. Earlier, Bangladesh had proposed completing the immigration and customs for Kolkata-bound passengers at Cantonment Rail Station in Dhaka. But as some law-enforcement agencies including the BDR opposed the proposal in writing to the government, now the Darshana Station on the border is being considered for immigration checks. A 32-member Indian delegation arrived in Dhaka on July 8 on a trial train to discuss the issues on the launch of Dhaka-Kolkata passenger trains. The officials of the two countries failed to reach a consensus on an Indian proposal to build fencings along the Darshana-Gede border. Bangladeshi and Indian officials at a joint press conference on July 10 said the unresolved issues would be sorted out at the bilateral meeting in Kolkata. The Dhaka meeting decided that one train would set out from Dhaka for Kolkata every week and return a day later. The same way, one train will leave Kolkata for Dhaka every week and return to Kolkata the next day. Bangladesh delegates will return home on Aug 1. bdnews
