<TITLE> South Korea face Japan in Asian Cup sideshow </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Games between South Korea and Japan are traditionally fierce, passionate affairs, but Saturday's clash for third place at the Asian Cup is unlikely to set pulses racing. The two regional soccer powerhouses have been relegated to the role of bit-part players after stunning semi-final defeats, while their conquerors, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, prepare to share the limelight in Sunday's final. The Koreans and Japanese are expected to field teams full of fringe players for the playoff in Palembang, on Indonesia's Sumatra island, despite the carrot of automatic qualification for the 2011 Asian Cup for the winner. For Korea coach Pim Verbeek, it may be a parting gift. The Dutchman, well liked and respected by the players and staff, has been hounded by the Korean media for months and put his job on the line before the tournament by guaranteeing a semi-final place. While that objective has been achieved, Verbeek still may opt to stand down rather than live under constant criticism. "I've made my decision already but I'm not going to tell you what it is," Verbeek said in the aftermath of Korea's penalty shootout loss to Iraq in Wednesday's semi-final. "I'm not thinking at all about World Cup qualifiers, I'm just disappointed about what we tried to achieve here." Japan coach Ivica Osim, meanwhile, does not seem the type to fall on his sword. The fire-brand Bosnian was furious after they were beaten 3-2 by Saudi Arabia in the game of the tournament so far and accused his players of "going soft". Despite being the competition's joint top scorer with four goals, striker Naohiro Takahara is likely to find himself on the bench against Korea following a hugely disappointing display against the Saudis. Getting back in Osim's good books will be no easy task
