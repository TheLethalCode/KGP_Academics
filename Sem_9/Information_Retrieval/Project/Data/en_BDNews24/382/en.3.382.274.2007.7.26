<TITLE> Key US Democrat pushes Iraq pullout without deadline </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saying he sees signs the White House is open to changing course in Iraq, a leading House Democrat on Wednesday proposed starting a US troop pullout without a hard deadline for completion that many Republicans oppose. Rep. John Murtha, a moderate Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime critic of the war, said he would propose that in an amendment to a defense spending bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, expected on the House floor next week. The bill providing $459.6 billion for defense was approved on Wednesday by the House Appropriations Committee. Murtha said some Republicans on Capitol Hill, backed by the White House, have advocated reducing US troops in Iraq to 70,000 from the current level of nearly 160,000. While he opposes leaving any US troops behind, Murtha said he'll bring an amendment to the House floor next week that requires the White House to start redeployment within 60 days of enactment, without setting a deadline for completion. "I'm hearing signals. They (Republicans) are trying to work out a deal where we leave 70,000 troops over there ... That's the White House telling them to do that, I'm convinced," he told reporters. "I'm hoping there will be an agreement between Democrats and Republicans and the Senate and the House and the White House and I think you'll see that happen. I think you'll see that happen by September, October," he said. The Democrat-run House of Representatives has voted three times this year for ending U.S. involvement in Iraq by a certain date, but similar provisions have stalled in the more closely divided Senate amid strong resistance from the Republican White House, which does not want to signal a departure date to US enemies. Many Republicans have criticized the unpopular war, but say they are reluctant to vote for a pullout before U.S. Iraq commander Gen. David Petraeus makes a report in September. Bush has been adamant that he would take advice from his generals on the ground. "Troop levels will be determined by conditions on the ground and based on the recommendations of the commanders on the ground," said White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. House Republican Leader John Boehner sounded unimpressed by Murtha's proposal. "Our commanders in Iraq are reporting solid progress in the new offensive against al Qaeda, but Democrats won't bother themselves with facts on the ground," he said. Murtha said pressure from liberal House Democrats -- including the leadership -- could still force a pullout deadline to be added to his proposal. "I know they get so much pressure from the public. The public wants us the hell out of there," he said. Murtha said he would also propose an amendment to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within 180 days and another to require troops sent to Iraq be fully trained and equipped. As approved by committee, the defense spending bill slashes $139 million from missile defense programs Bush favors. Aides said this cut would stop construction of a missile interceptor site in Eastern Europe that has angered the Russian government. The bill has no new money for special armored vehicles called Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAPS), but Murtha indicated this could be part of a funding bill this fall. Gates has made the program one of his top priorities because the vehicles' V-shaped hull helps to protect troops against roadside bombs. Some funding is in the pipeline from this year, but Murtha expressed frustration at the Pentagon's sudden sense of urgency when for years there have not been enough armored vehicles to protect US soldiers in Iraq. "We'll build whatever they ask for," he said, but added: "You can't come to us at the last minute and say it's going to save lives to build these damn things and then force us to pay for (higher) transportation costs and everything right no
