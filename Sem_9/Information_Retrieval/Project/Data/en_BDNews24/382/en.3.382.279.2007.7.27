 RAMALLAH, West Bank, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Palestinian government of President Mahmoud Abbas has dropped the phrase "armed resistance" from its platform, a minister said on Friday, in a further break from Hamas Islamists in control of Gaza. A spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert welcomed the move, which coincided with a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at resuming long-stalled peacemaking. "In this platform, we are very clear that the armed resistance must come to an end because it has nothing to do with establishing the state," Ashraf al-Ajrami, the Palestinian minister of prisoners affairs, told Reuters. "Armed resistance and armed struggle are not included in the platform," he said. The long-dominant Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), then led by Yasser Arafat, dropped its commitment to "armed struggle" on signing interim peace accords with Israel in 1993. Hamas refuses to renounce violence. Some Fatah members took up arms in an uprising after 2000 but Abbas, the current Fatah leader, has committed himself to negotiating peace. Since dismissing a Hamas-led government last month, he has spoken of the need for Palestinians to resist Israeli occupation in peaceful ways and dozens of Fatah militants have been given amnesty from arrest by Israel in return for laying down weapons. A source in Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's office, which drafted the policy document, also confirmed that wording on "armed" action -- which had been included in the platform of the two previous Hamas-led governments -- had been dropped. "(The platform) says that peace is not only a strategic decision but a necessity," the source said in remarks that underscored the divide between Fatah, which holds sway in the West Bank, and Hamas in Gaza. "How are we going to achieve this? Through negotiations," the source said. The source acknowledged that the word "resistance" on its own does appear in the new platform but said it refers to measures such as non-violent demonstrations. Abbas dissolved a Hamas-led unity government after the movement's fighters routed Fatah forces in Gaza last month and appointed an administration led by the Western-backed Fayyad, allowing resumption of foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority. Asked about the platform change, Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Olmert, said: "In general, we can see on the ground, both in words and in fact, a new atmosphere on both sides. "We still have a lot of work to do but this is a positive aspect and we both need to respect each other, in hope." Earlier, in an interview with Israel Radio, one of Olmert's closest confidants, cabinet minister Haim Ramon, called the Palestinian government, shorn of Hamas, a partner for peace. In a bid to bolster Abbas, Israel has renewed a measure of security cooperation with his forces in the West Bank, agreed to stop pursuing some 180 wanted Fatah fighters and released 255 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. "There is a need to renew talks with (the Palestinian Authority) and to reach agreements, mainly on final-status principles," Ramon said. Olmert has raised the prospect of talks with Abbas that would deal with the stages of establishing a Palestinian state. But he said there was no precise timetable for any discussions on permanent borders and the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees, all divisive issues in the Jewish state. Abbas told Reuters on Thursday he was still insisting on negotiating "final status" issues as a package, not in stages. Earlier this week, Arab envoys on a landmark visit to Israel presented its leaders with a regional land-for-peace plan and called for a rapid timetable for talks with the Palestinians over statehood.
