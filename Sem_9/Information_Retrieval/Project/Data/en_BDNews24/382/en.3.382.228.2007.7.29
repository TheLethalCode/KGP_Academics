 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) -- A senior army official has become president of Bangladesh Cricket Board, replacing agriculture secretary M Abdul Aziz as president, the sports ministry said in a statement Sunday. The government formed a temporary committee in line with the National Sports Council Act 1974. "The board has been dissolved as most members have resigned voluntarily," the sports ministry said. "It is hoped that the interim committee will soon take up charges and will take steps to organise a permanent committee." Jamali commanded the 24th Infantry Division based in Chittagong until he was transferred to Dhaka as the chief of general staff in Bangladesh Army recently. The Iajuddin Ahmed-led caretaker government appointed agriculture secretary M Abdul Aziz in the place of former BNP lawmaker Ali Asgar Loby, who had resigned his post. The new appointment is seen as part of the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led emergency government's move to purge the board of politicisation. The interim committee includes Syed Fahim Munaim, press secretary to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Industrialist Salman Ispahani, a leading sports organiser, is the only member of the dissolved board to be included on the interim committee. The authorities had criticised most board members for being linked to major political parties, which they said jeopardised the normal running of the game. bdnews2
