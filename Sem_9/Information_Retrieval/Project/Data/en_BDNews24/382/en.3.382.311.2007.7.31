 BERLIN, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich sporting director Uli Hoeness called himself a fool in an interview released on Tuesday for not opening his wallet sooner to acquire more expensive talent in Europe. Bayern, who finished fourth in the Bundesliga last season, missing out on a place in the Champions League, have spent 70 million euros ($95.91 million) on players for the coming campaign. "I look back now and remember how angry I was at times last season compared to how much I enjoy watching football now," Hoeness told Stern magazine's online edition. "During the League Cup last week I was thinking to myself about how stupid I was for not spending the money sooner," said Hoeness, who previously had a reputation for frugality and tough negotiations. "We should have done this a lot sooner. It would have improved my own quality of life," he added after watching France midfielder Franck Ribery, who cost Bayern 25 million euros, score three goals in two matches in a pre-season tournament. Hoeness said it no longer seemed so important to pursue good business practices in the sport. "The people don't want a serious businessman anymore who makes sure the books are in good order. They would rather see the spectacular. They want big names, they want entertainment. "For a lot of people it doesn't matter if we make a profit or lose money. It's only important that the team play attractive football. But that scares me a bit too because if that is the long term policy, that's dangerous.
