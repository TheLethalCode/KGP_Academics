 MADRID, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona on Friday reported earnings of 290.1 million euros for the 2006-7 season, despite having failed to win any major trophies. The Catalan club said their income had grown 31 million euros on the previous year's figure, to give a net profit of 6.8 million, in figures published on their Web site www.fcbarcelona.com. "The economic health of the club is stable whether we win or lose. Not every company or club can say the same," Barcelona vice-president Ferran Soriano told a news conference. The growth was achieved, he said, through better use of the club's installations, increased money from sponsorship deals, friendlies, and tours, advertising income from the club's TV station and the sale of Barca TV international. Wages for players amounted to 51 percent of the club's total income which put them just under the industry recommended 55 percent. Bank debts were reduced from 68.5 million to 39.8 million taking into account the purchases of France striker Thierry Henry for 24 million, France left back Eric Abidal for 15 million and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure for 9 million. The budgeted income for next season was set at a record 315 million euros, the club said. Barca missed out on their third consecutive Primera Liga title due to their inferior head-to-head record with arch-rivals Real Madrid last month. They have since reinforced the squad with Henry, Toure and Abidal and have also secured Argentina centre-back Gabriel Milito from Real Zaragoza for 17 million euro
