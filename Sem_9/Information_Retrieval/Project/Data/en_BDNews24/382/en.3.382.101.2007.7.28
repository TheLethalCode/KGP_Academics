<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tournament which has already thrown up so many surprises could take one last twist when Iraq play Saudi Arabia in Sunday's Asian Cup final. Saudi Arabia are chasing an unprecedented fourth title and strongly favoured to win but face opponents who have defied incredible odds to reach their first final and inspired a nation ravaged by war. Few people gave Iraq any chance of making it past the group stage after they drew their opening match against co-hosts Thailand but they made it through with a combination of hard work, skill and an ounce of luck. Masking their grief at the fighting in their homeland, they beat tournament favourites Australia to top Group A before overcoming Vietnam in the quarter-finals and twice winners South Korea on penalties in the semis. Iraq's extraordinary run has captured the imagination of the sporting world and provided a rare chance for people in the country to celebrate. "When I started this job I promised to bring more happiness to the Iraqi people and I think I have accomplished that," Iraq's Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira told a news conference on Saturday. "We knew what we wanted from the beginning...and now that we have reached the final it will be very hard to stop us." HARD WAY Saudi Arabia also earned their way to the final the hard way, holding off a determined challenge from Uzbekistan in the quarter-finals before upsetting defending champions Japan 3-2 in the last four. The Saudis boast the best attacking record in the competition with strikers Yasser Al Qahtani and Malek Maaz netting six goals between them but are wary about playing Iraq, who have the best defensive record. Saudi Arabia coach Helio Cesar dos Anjos, who is also Brazilian, said his players were aware of the significance of playing Iraq but could not afford to let their emotions get the better of them. "A lot of people might be surprised to see Saudia Arabia and Iraq in the final but they both deserve to be there because they played the best football," Anjos said, speaking through a translator. "But we will have to face a very tough opponent that has a lot of quality (players) and is highly motivated. "The Iraqi team has a great dream but we can dream too." Iraq captain Younis Mahmoud said the key to his team's success had been to block out the problems in their homeland. None of the Iraqi players have been untouched by the war and although the squad is made up of Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish players, they have formed a special bond. "All the players have faced some difficult times but we know we can bring happiness to the Iraqi people," he said. "We share a great responsibility to bring happiness to the Iraq people through football so we always just concentrate on the match. "We love football and we love our country and we are ready to defend it.
