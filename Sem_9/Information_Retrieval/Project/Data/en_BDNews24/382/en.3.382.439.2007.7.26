 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Many rivers across the country have breached their banks leaving thousands marooned without adequate shelter or provisions. At least six rivers are flowing at dangerous levels with a risk of further swelling in the Brahmaputra and Padma basins over the next 24 hours, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said in a forecast Thursday. The flood situation in Sirajganj district worsened with the Jamuna river in full spate at Sirajganj point. The Jamuna breached its protective embankment in several places, leaving more than 20 villages deep in water. The low-lying districts of Pabna and Tangail have also been left vulnerable.

About 5,000 people have been marooned without adequate shelter or provisions. Pabna Water Development Board engineer Abdullahel Baqui said the Padma swelled by 8cm at Hardinge Bridge and 25cm at Nagarbari point in the last 24 hours.
