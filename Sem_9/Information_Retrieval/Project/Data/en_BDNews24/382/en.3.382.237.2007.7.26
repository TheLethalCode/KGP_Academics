<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com) -- The Appellate Division has stayed until Monday the hearing of a government appeal against the High Court verdict that declared the cancellation of the Rangs Bhaban design illegal. In an order Thursday, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim and four other judges of the Appellate Division fixed Monday for the next hearing after proceedings of the appeal into a third day. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq defending Rangs in court said Rangs Bhaban was built in line with the law. Rangs authorities should not pay for the mistake by city developer Rajuk, he said. Not so, said Barrister Ziaur Rahman Khan who stood in for Rajuk. "Rangs Bhaban was built ignoring a Rajuk notice," he said. The court asked if there was a restriction on constructing buildings higher than six storeys in the area as per the civil aviation rules how Rajuk could allow the construction of 22-storey Rangs Bhaban. After completion of construction of 16 floors, Rajuk ordered the demolition of Rangs Bhaban. Rajuk cancelled the design of Rangs Bhaban on June 21, 1999. On an appeal against it by Rangs, the High Court declared the cancellation illegal. The government appealed to the Appellate Division against the HC verdict. Attorney general Fida M Kamal completed his submission Thursday. bdnew
