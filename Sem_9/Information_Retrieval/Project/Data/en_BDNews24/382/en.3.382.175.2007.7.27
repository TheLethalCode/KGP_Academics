 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh cricket team return home Saturday evening on a Qatar Airways flight after playing a three-match Test series and as many ODIs against Sri Lanka. The Tigers are scheduled to land at the Zia International Airport on 5:45pm, according to Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). The Bangladesh had a miserable five-week tour of Sri Lanka where they were whitewashed in both the Test and ODI series. The Bangladesh batsmen hardly showed any courageous display in the emerald islands that caused them three innings defeats in the Tests. The batsmen continued their dismal show in the one-dayer series also and missed two golden opportunities to push Sri Lanka down in the first and third one-day internationals.
