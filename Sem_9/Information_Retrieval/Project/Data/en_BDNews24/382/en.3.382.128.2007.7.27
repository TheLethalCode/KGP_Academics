 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - US stocks slipped in volatile trade on Friday as skittish investors weighed the prospects of a global credit crunch against signs of a resurgence of US economic growth. US Treasuries were up, after earlier declines, following surprisingly strong growth data that eased some of the worst fears of an economic slump following a day of sharp equity losses. The dollar rose on news of the US economic data. A government report showed the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter, rebounding from a dismal start to the year. It was the fastest rate since 4.8 percent in last year's first quarter; the economy expanded a downwardly revised 0.6 percent in this year's first quarter. The strong growth figures helped lift stocks into positive territory in early trade but they later slipped as credit worries reemerged. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 53.08 points, or 0.4 percent, at 13,418.95. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 7.88 points, or 0.53 percent, at 1,474.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 13.04 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,587.23. Investors are torn between robust economic fundamentals in the world economy and deteriorating credit markets, which could curb future corporate activity as a fallout in the US housing market threatens to trigger contagion across the globe. "What you have is really some forced liquidation on the market on subprime and credit concerns," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. After the strong economic data, a survey of consumer sentiment came in lower than expected. The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers' final July consumer sentiment index rose to 90.4 from June's final reading of 85.3, according to a report released on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a final July reading of 91.2, according to the median forecast. The US economic data's inflation gauge showed prices excluding food and energy rose mildly in the second quarter, indicating the Federal Reserve now has more leeway if it needs to cut benchmark interest rates in the second half of this year. US Treasuries held onto thin gains as investors kept a close eye on volatile stocks. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was up 2/32, with the yield at 4.7979 percent. Sentiment even showed some improvement in the recently hard-hit credit markets, as reflected by swap spreads. Oil rose above $75 a barrel as investors brushed off worries over corporate borrowing costs and focused on tightening fuel supplies. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index was flat, erasing gains spurred by strong Volkswagen results. The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the US Dollar Index up 0.53 percent at 80.88 from a previous session close of 80.453. The euro was down 0.62 percent at $1.3657 from a previous session close of $1.3742. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.30 percent at 118.76 from a previous session close of 118.40. Earlier, hectic buying of the yen, long under pressure as a funding vehicle for risky carry trades, pushed the low-yielding currency to a 3-month high against the dollar. In energy and commodities prices, US light sweet crude oil rose 55 cents, or 0.73 percent, to $75.50 per barrel. Spot gold prices fell 50 cents, or 0.08 percent, to $660.
