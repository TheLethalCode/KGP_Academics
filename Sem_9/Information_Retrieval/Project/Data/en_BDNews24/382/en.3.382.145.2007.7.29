 NOTTINGHAM, England, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters - England's bowling coach Allan Donald paid tribute to his old rival Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday after the Indian batsman became the third man to pass 11,000 test runs. Former South Africa pace bowler Donald, who took 330 wickets in 72 Tests, watched from the England balcony while Tendulkar helped put India in control of the second test at 56 runs ahead with seven first innings wickets remaining. Tendulkar reached 57 not out at the close and now trails only Brian Lara and Allan Border. Tendulkar, at 34, is well placed to surpass the record of the now retired Lara, who finished with 11,912 runs. "In my era I think he was the best player that I had the pleasure of playing against," Donald told reporters. "He is something very special, very freakish not only for what he has done for the game but for what he has done for his country. "It has been phenomenal. I know he has been through a rough trot with injuries but he looked like his old self today apart from when he got grilled (by James Anderson). "There is still a lot more cricket in Sachin Tendulkar, he looks so boyish, it's amazing how long he has stuck it out. He deserves the record because he is such a wonderful and humble guy." India opener Dinesh Karthik, who made 77 and helped put on 147 for the first wicket, also paid his tribute to Tendulkar. "For me he is the best player I have ever seen," Karthik said. "I'm so happy to be part of this team and I am honoured that a person like Sachin even knows my name. "I'm 100 percent sure he's going to beat the record, there's no doubt about it.
