 TEHRAN, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has sentenced two Kurdish dissident journalists to death for mounting an "armed struggle against the system", a judiciary spokesman said on Tuesday. "Adnan Hassanpour and Abdolvahed 'Hiva' Botimar have been sentenced to death. But they have 20 days to appeal their verdicts," Alireza Jamshidi told a weekly news conference.

Defying rights groups' calls to abolish the death penalty, Iran's judiciary hanged 16 men convicted for rape and other offences on July 22. Iran says it is acting on the basis of Islamic sharia law. The hanged men were among those arrested in a crackdown on "immoral behaviour", during which dozens of drug addicts, smugglers, bandits and other criminals were arrested. A newspaper said two assassins of a judge, who sentenced several reformist dissidents to jail, would be publicly hanged on Thursday. Public hangings are rare in Iran. "The two men will be hanged in front of the judiciary complex where they shot dead the judge two years ago," the Iran newspaper sa
