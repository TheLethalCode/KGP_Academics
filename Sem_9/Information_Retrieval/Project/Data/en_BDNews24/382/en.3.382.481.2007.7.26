 Tangail, July 26 (bdnews24.com)Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Thursday said sports organisations have turned into dens of corruption and stadiums have ended up in the hands of drug abusers. Moeen said those who had not previously been involved with sports had become officials of the country's sports federations and were patronising corruption. The damning comment came when he spoke at length of political influence infiltrating and corrupting national sports bodies. Speaking at a views exchange meeting in Tangail, the army chief said: "The sports organisations have turned into dens of corruption and stadiums have been turned over to drug abusers." Moeen who was elected chairman of the National Sports Council vowed to free the sports arena of corruption, saying: "The proper environment must be restored in the sports arena, eliminating irregularities and corruption." "Those who are not involved with sports have become sports officials and have built up corruption," he claimed. The NSC chairman alleged that former state minister for sports Fazlur Rahman Patal had approved construction of a stadium at a sugar cane field in Lalpur, an isolated area in Natore, Patal's former constituency. Moeen said "crores of taka" were spent to build the stadium which was not being used for any purpose. He denounced irregularities at Bangabandhu National Stadium and proposed an investigation into the irregularities in allotment of shops premises at the stadium. "In the outer stadium (Paltan Maidan) more political rallies were held than sporting events," he added. Moeen said most of the 37 sports federations in the country do not have any job at hand. "All the current federations will be dissolved. The number of members will be decreased and committees will be formed to include sportsmen. A government committee has been formed for this purpose. The next steps will be taken on the basis of their recommendations." Moeen also expressed his dissatisfaction over the failure of the Bangladesh cricket team in Sri Lanka. He criticised the inclusion of non-cricketers as members of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "Such persons were made members of the cricket board who never played cricket in their life," said Moeen. On the dismal performance of the cricketers in Sri Lanka, he said: "Bangladesh got whitewashed in Sri Lanka. The cricketers pass their time abroad in swimming pools and hotel rooms instead of practicing." bdnews24.co
