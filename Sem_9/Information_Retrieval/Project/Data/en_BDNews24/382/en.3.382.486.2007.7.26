<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Myanmar are all set to close a deal to revive a cross-border highway that went into disuse decades ago. Myanmar's construction minister Saw Tun arrives Dhaka Thursday to sign the deal with his Bangladesh counterpart MA Matin Friday. The proposed road link will connect Bangladesh with Myanmar, Thailand, China, Laos and some other east Asian nations. Chittagong was connected closely to Arakan, now the Rakhine state of Myanmar, for ages until the link was disrupted in early 1960s. According to the communication ministry officials, they are ready to sign the final deal. They said the construction of the 153-km-long road link will cost Tk 946 crore. In the first phase, 43 km roads will be built with 23 km from Ramu to Gundom at the Bangladesh end and 20 km from Taungbro to Bawli Bazar on the Myanmar side. Officials said Dhaka will bear the cost of Tk 274 crore for the first-phase construction. The remaining 110 km road of the 153 km road will be constructed later at a cost of Tk 770 crore. In April, during the visit of foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury to Yangon the two countries agreed on the terms and conditions of the proposed road link. Experts have maintained that a road network from Kunming of China to Chittagong via Myanmar could be set up to boost trade and commerce and cultural interactions as well between the people of the region. bd
