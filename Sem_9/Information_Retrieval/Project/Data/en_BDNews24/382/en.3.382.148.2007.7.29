 NOTTINGHAM, England, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were 43 for no wicket in their second innings at the close of the third day of the second test against India at Trent Bridge on Sunday. Sachin Tendulkar was denied a 38th test century by an umpiring error as India continued to push towards victory against England on the third day of the second test at Trent Bridge on Sunday. India were all out for 481 and are well placed to claim a rare test victory outside Asia given their lead of 240 runs. Australian Simon Taufel, rated the world's best umpire for the last three years, gave Tendulkar out lbw for 91 off medium pacer Paul Collingwood to the sixth delivery after lunch -- the bowler's first of the day. Television replays indicated the ball struck Tendulkar outside the line and would have missed off stump in any case. Taufel's on-field colleague Ian Howell has made a series of errors in the innings that have all gone in India's favour. Tendulkar, who on Saturday became only the third man to pass 11,000 test runs, stood his ground after the umpire's finger was raised and it was likely his reaction was out of disappointment with the official rather than self-admonishment. ANOTHER CONTROVERSY Taufel was at the centre of another controversy 15 minutes before tea when he sent Ganguly on his way for a catch down the leg side to wicketkeeper Matt Prior off the bowling of James Anderson for 79. The left-handed Ganguly, chasing his 14th test century, tried to glance Anderson down to fine leg and when Prior took a diving catch to his right Taufel upheld England's appeal. Television replays were inconclusive, although they did not find evidence to support the decision. Taufel had rejected an lbw appeal against Ganguly when he was on 75 but on that occasion he made the right decision. Mahendra Singh Dhoni edged Ryan Sidebottom to Prior for five shortly before tea to eliminate the danger of a quick-fire innings from the usually dangerous batsman. India are seeking their first test series win in England for 21 years but Michael Vaughan, who has never lost a home series as captain or player, will be determined to preserve his record. The first test was drawn after England were prevented from taking a 20th wicket to win by rain
