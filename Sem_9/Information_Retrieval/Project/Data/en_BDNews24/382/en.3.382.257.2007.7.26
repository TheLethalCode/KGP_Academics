 KABUL, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-led troops killed more than 50 insurgents in a battle in Afghanistan's southern province of Helmand, the US military said on Thursday. There were no casualties among coalition troops in the 12-hour battle with Taliban militants which finished early on Thursday, it said in a statement. No civilian injuries were reported. The Taliban could not be reached for comment and because of the remoteness of the region there was no independent verification of the report. More than 160 insurgents have been killed in Helmand's Musa Qala district since Sunday, the military said.
