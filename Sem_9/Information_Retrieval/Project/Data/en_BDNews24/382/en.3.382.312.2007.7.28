 HYDERABAD, India, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police shot dead at least eight protestors in southern India on Saturday after a political demonstration demanding free land for the poor turned violent. Police opened fire after hundreds of protestors burned furniture in a government office in a small town in Andhra Pradesh state, where communist parties are campaigning for distribution of government land to the rural and urban poor. "The protestors attacked the revenue divisional office and destroyed valuables leading to the police firing," said R K Meena, a police superintendent. The demonstrators also set fire to a vehicle. The dead included a woman. Ten people were injured in the shooting. Television pictures showed police and protestors, many of them women, hitting each other with big sticks and flagpoles. Several protestors fell to the ground and were beaten by police. The protest was part of a day-long demonstration across the state planned by two communist parties spearheading the demand for free government land for the poor. Some of the campaign leaders are on a hunger strike that has now lasted six days. "Left party workers' agitation has taken a violent turn with burning of buses and attack on government property all over the state," K. Jana Reddy, the state's home minister, told reporters. The authorities have filed charges against communist leaders in the state and jailed thousands of leftist activists.
