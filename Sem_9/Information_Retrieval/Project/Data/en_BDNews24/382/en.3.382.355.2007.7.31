 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  Relatives Monday met Tarique Rahman, elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, at Dhaka Central Jail. Khaleda's mother Taiyaba Majumder, Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman and sister-in-law Shahina Khan Bindu were among the visitors who came in a white car at about 6pm. They brought some books and dry food for him and talked with him for about half an hour at jail superintendent Shafiqul Islam's office. A prisons official and Special Branch of police official were present during the meeting. The visitors left at about 6:45pm. The prisons authorities let their car in at the jail premises apparently to keep them from talking to the media. Tarique's lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan later told reporters that he was in the room next to the one where the relatives met Tarique since he did not have an approval to meet him Monday. "Relatives of a divisioned inmate can meet him every 15 days. The visit was a routine one," he said. Azam said wealth statements of Tarique and his wife were being prepared for submission of the statements by August 7. On July 15, wife and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu met Tarique. bdnews2
