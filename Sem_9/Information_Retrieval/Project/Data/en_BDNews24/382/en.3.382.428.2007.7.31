 Chittagong, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  Capital market watchers Monday said the introduction of derivatives would help increase liquidity flow in the stock market. Derivatives, a financial instrument, will also help cut investor risks and create a new investment opportunity, speakers said at a workshop in the port city of Chittagong. "The introduction of derivatives will push the liquidity of the equity market. But awareness among investors, journalists and professionals is essential," Abdul Malek, editor of Bangla-language daily Azadi, told the workshop on "Derivatives and Book Building" in the port city. A derivate is a financial contract whose value is based on, or "derived" from, a traditional security (such as a stock or bond), an asset (such as a commodity), or a market index. Referring to Indian experience, Malek said the total volume of trade in derivatives is much higher than equity products on the National Stock Exchange of India. The Chittagong Stock Exchange that organised Monday's programme submitted its proposal for derivatives trade to authorities, the CSE said in a statement. Malek said the desire to achieve sustained development would be a far cry without a strong, predictable and accountable capital market. "We are trying to create a friendly environment through diverse products. We are very much optimistic that our capital market will cope with derivatives very soon," CSE vice president Nasiruddin Ahmed Chowdhury said. bdnews
