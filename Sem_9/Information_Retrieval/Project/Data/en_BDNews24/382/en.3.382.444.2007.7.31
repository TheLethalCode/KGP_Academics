 LONDON, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares got off to a strong start on Tuesday, gaining 1 percent in early trade to break a five-day losing streak as credit market worries eased and company news returned to centrestage. At 0714 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1 percent at 1,532.78 points. Shares on Germany's DAX rose 1.3 percent, while benchmarks in Britain and France rose around 1 percent. Budget carrier Ryanair was the top percentage gainer in Europe, soaring 8.3 percent after strong results, while drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline climbed 4 percent after a U.S. regulatory panel said one of its key drugs should stay on the market. Telecoms equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent led losers, down 4.9 percent, after a bigger-than-expected loss in the second quarter. European credit markets rallied sharply, boosted by a rebound in U.S. stocks overnight, just a day after hitting life highs. The Crossover index, the most widely watched indicator of European credit sentiment and made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, fell to 415 basis points, a 35 basis point drop from Monday's close at around 450 basis points. "It shows that the worst has gone, but whether it's totally over is difficult to say," said Thierry Lacraz, a European strategist at Pictet & Cie. "We won't see another two-week period like the one we've seen recently."
