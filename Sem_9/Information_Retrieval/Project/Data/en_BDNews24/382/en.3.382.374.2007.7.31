 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has fined fixed-phone operator Jalalabad Telecom Tk 2 crore for poor customer intake, a top official said Tuesday. Jalalabad Telecom, which operates in Sylhet Division, is the second operator to have been penalised this week after the telecom regulator Sunday forfeited Tk 2 crore bank guarantee of Bangla Phone, which also operates in Sylhet Division, on the same ground. "Foreign or local, fixed or mobile, even the ISPs every operator has to abide by the law," BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam told bednews24.com. BTRC said Jalalabad Telecom was way short of a minimum 10,000 customers that the licensing condition required of the company. The company that operates in Sylhet Division serves a little over 4,000 customers, Alam said, adding they forfeited Tk 2 crore in bank guarantee that Jalalabad had provided. "This is clearly non-fulfilment of the company's licensing obligation," the BTRC chief said. Jalalabad Telecom has deployed wired as well as wireless fixed-phone network using the equipment of Huawei Technologies. It has yet to make full payment to the Chinese vendor although it has been since operating for more than two years. The BTRC earlier cancelled the nationwide fixed-phone licences of Bashundhara Networks and Dominox Technologies for not paying annual licence fees. "All these actions are the results of the clearly defined licensing conditions and there is no room for compromise," the BTRC chief said by telephone. The private fixed-phone industry has been struggling with sluggish growth in the face of explosive growth in mobile phone. Last year the BTRC allowed them to operate with "limited mobility" as a respite. The mobile operators immediately protested what they called was "backdoor entry" but BTRC remained unmoved. The then BTRC chairman defended the decision, saying they were safeguarding local investments. But the private fixed-phone providers failed to capitalise on the "extra-regulatory" privilege. Rather, Rangs Telecom, the leading fixed-phone provider, was caught illegally terminating overseas calls. Rangs recently paid the BTRC Tk 17 crore for the crime, by far the highest penalty the telecoms regulator has realised from an operator. Now the telecoms watchdog is on the move to nail bigger call terminators with even bigger financial punishments. "We remain committed to the law and there is simply no discrimination when we apply it," said Alam, the retired major general who became BTRC chairman a little over three months ago. bdn
