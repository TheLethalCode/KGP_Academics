 BAGHDAD, July 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi security forces said on Saturday they had plans to protect soccer fans determined to celebrate Iraq's historic run to the Asian Cup soccer final despite deadly suicide bomb attacks after the last match. "All responsible men are preparing for the expected terrorist attacks targeting people who are celebrating," Brigadier General Qassim Atta, Iraq's chief military spokesman, told Reuters. Iraq will play favourites Saudi Arabia in the final in Jakarta on Sunday after beating South Korea in a semifinal penalty shootout on Wednesday. The victory over South Korea sent thousands of joyous Iraqis into the streets in spontanoues celebrations which were quickly marred by suicide bombings that killed 50 people. "There will be heightened security measures just before and after the game," said Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Karim Khalaf. "We want people to celebrate but we want them to do so in an organised manner." Neither he nor Qassim Atta would go into specific details about what measures would be put in place to stop possible attacks in Baghdad and other centres, for fear of tipping off potential attackers to their plans. Major thoroughfares in key areas of Baghdad such as the predominantly Shi'ite district of Karrada were blocked off before the previous game and similar measures can be expected again for Sunday's final. "We can secure the entrances to an area but locals have to spot strangers in the street," Khalaf told Reuters. "It's an extremely difficult task but, with a little organisation, we hope people can enjoy the occasion," he said. WIN OR LOSE, CELEBRATE War-weary Iraqis said they were planning big celebrations despite the danger and regardless of the outcome. Some have already begun decorating their cars and homes in Iraq's colours and national flags, a rare sign of unity in a nation fractured by sectarian violence between majority Shi'te Muslims and Sunni Arabs. Haji Abu Hasan has decorated his car with flags and pictures of the Iraqi team, which includes Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish players. "Even if we lose the match, we are so proud of our team," Hasan said. "They could unify the Iraqi people, and that's where politicians failed." Mohsin Kadim, 34, said Sadr City, a sprawling Shi'ite slum in northeastern Baghdad, would hold one of the biggest parties. "We will go celebrating even if we are attacked by nuclear weapons," Kadim said
