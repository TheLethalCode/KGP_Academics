 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Myanmar closed a deal Friday to construct a 25-kilometre highway linking the border town of Teknaf to Bawlibazar in Myanmar. The plan is to create an overland route to Kunming in China as well as Malaysia and Singapore. Myanmar's construction minister Major Gen Saw Tun who arrived in Dhaka Thursday and his Bangladesh counterpart Major General (rtd) M A Matin put pen to paper at 11am. "The main goal of constructing this 25 kilometre road is to be connected with the Asian Highway network," Matin told journalists after signing the deal at the conference room of the communications ministry. "We will start constructing the road as soon as possible," Matin said without specifying a timeframe. The adviser said Bangladesh would meet the expense of the Tk 141 crore-project. "We will have to continue with this project if we want to go to other countries like Thailand and Singapore through Myanmar," Gen Tun told journalists. "Not only Bangladesh and Myanmar, China was also involved in the construction of the tri-nation (Bangladesh-Myanmar-China) road. "Further discussion is necessary to implement the whole project," Tun said. Matin said he would speak to Beijing to connect Bangladesh with China on the sidelines of the next meeting of BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar) in Myanmar. "Bangladesh, China and Myanmar will carry out feasibility studies on construction of the tri-nation (Bangladesh, India and China) road," the communications adviser said. He said a Chinese delegation that visited Bangladesh about a month ago underlined the need for constructing the tri-nation road. Matin said the BCIM car rally, originally planned sometime in November, would be held in March, 2008. bdn
