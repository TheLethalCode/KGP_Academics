 Khulna, July 26 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka Mohammedan SC got a jolt to slip from the B. League title race when Khulna Abahani halted them to a 1-1 draw in the second-leg encounter at the local stadium Thursday. The second draw in 19 matches means Mohammedan are trailing by two points from league leaders Dhaka Abahani, who have 41 points from 18 outings and need just two points in the remaining matches against Sheikh Russel KC or Muktijoddha Sangsad to clinch the first-ever professional football league title. Abahani can make the celebration a title triumph with one match to spare if they can beat Sheikh Russel Friday as Thursday's scheduled match between them has been shifted to Friday because of unplayable conditions in the Bangabandhu National Stadium pitch following the monsoon rains. Dhaka Mohammedan, who play their last match against Arambagh KS on August 1, will now hope that Abahani lose both their remaining matches. In the match, hosts Khulna Abahani comparatively enjoyed the superior ball possession over the Dhaka giants, who were unimpressive in the first with their defective passes in the rain-soaked pitch. Abahani, who lost to the same rivals in their away match in Dhaka 6-1, created at least three good opportunities in the first half, but all their efforts went in vain. Mohammedan could have taken a lead had Mohammedan Nigerian captain Mwach Ukwu Paul Mac not missed a penalty shot in the 31st minute. Abahani goalie Iran Sheikh brought Paul down inside the danger zone and referee Hannan Miron did not hesitate to award a penalty, but Iran rescued his side stopping the spot kick from Paul, the second highest scorer of the league with 14 goals. GM Mamun broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half to put Abahani ahead with the striker heading a Shahin lob home. Ariful Kabir Farhad equalised the Mohammedan margin in the 60th minute tapping the ball home from a goal-mouth-melee. bdnew
