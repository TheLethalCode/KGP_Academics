<TITLE> Japan PM bloc suffers big election defeat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative ruling camp suffered a devastating defeat in upper house elections on Sunday, a result that could well force Abe to quit and paralyse policy-making. But Abe, who took office 10 months ago pledging to boost Japan's security profile and rewrite its pacifist constitution, said he planned to stay in his post. Voters, angry at a string of scandals and gaffes among his handpicked appointees and government bungling of pension records, stripped Abe's coalition of a majority in parliament's upper house in the first national electoral test since he took office. KEY POINTS: Public broadcaster NHK said Abe's Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, the New Komeito, were seen winning between 39 and 55 seats -- far short of the 64 needed to keep their majority in the upper house, where half of the 242 seats are up for grabs. Private broadcaster TV Asahi said the ruling camp was set to win only 46 seats in total, with the LDP winning only 38 seats. NHK said the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan was on track to become the biggest party in the chamber, winning between 55 and 65 seats against between 31 and 43 for the LDP. COMMENTARY: IZURU KATO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, TOTAN RESEARCH "If Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stays in his post, a cabinet shuffle may take place in September, rather than immediately. "For the Japanese stock market, the result of this election is not a positive incentive in the short term. The market is likely to continue getting influence from political factors." KIICHI MURASHIMA, ECONOMIST, NIKKO CITIGROUP "Looking at reports of exit polls, I think it is now more likely that Abe will need to resign. I think there is about a 70 percent chance of his resignation. That means it will make it difficult to pass any bills that are contentious between the ruling coalition and opposition parties. "If Abe resigns and the LDP needs to hold an election to pick a new head of the party, it will probably take place towards the end of August. If so, that will delay a rate hike by the Bank of Japan until September. "The BOJ would never say a delay in a policy shift is affected by political uncertainty, but they have many other excuses like possible weak readings in (April-June) GDP (due out in mid-August) and subprime loan problems." HITOSHI YAMAMOTO, PRESIDENT, COMMERZ INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (JAPAN) "The Japanese market will likely extend losses on Monday following the drop in U.S. stocks, rather than the result of the election, as the situation in the U.S. market has become very serious. "It appears anyway that the Nikkei already dropped on Friday to the level where it could have gone if the outcome of the election realised the worst-case scenario. "For a while, investors will likely focus more on the U.S. market and forget about Japanese politics. But if Prime Minister Abe decides to step down, that could slow down the Japanese market's rebound even after the U.S. market regains ground and other global markets follow suit." MARI IWASHITA, SENIOR FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, DAIWA SECURITIES SMBC "The results of the election seem to be in line with forecasts. The bond market's focus will shift to whether Abe will step down or not, although that may not become clear soon. "The bottom line is that the election results alone are unlikely to encourage investors to buy JGBs aggressively, especially with the benchmark 10-year yield already below 1.8 percent. "(The LDP's defeat) is unlikely to affect the timing of the next BOJ rate hike, which we expect to take place between August and October. However, it may have some impact on the timing of the one after the next rate hike. YASUHIRO ONAKADO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SB INVESTMENTS "A huge defeat was one possible scenario, so this is no big surprise. But there is uncertainty on whether Abe needs to resign or whether there will be a snap election. That could weigh on Tokyo share prices. "This election was about the problems with the pension system. But it was also about stresses caused by reforms under former Prime Minister (Junichiro) Koizumi and Abe. "So this result that criticised the LDP's way could lead to a slowdown in implementing reforms, a negative factor for foreign investors in the stock market." JIRO YAMAGUCHI, PROFESSOR, HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY "The people clearly gave Abe a thumbs-down. His credibility as a leader was completely rejected. "Bills would not pass the upper house, so the ruling bloc would be forced to dissolve the lower house and hold a snap election. That could be as early as in January at the start of regular session of parliament, or in the spring when they debate the budget, as budget-related bills would not go through the upper house." MARTIN SCHULZ, SENIOR RESEARCHER, FUJITSU RESEARCH INSTITUTE "This is a clear-cut message to Abe and the LDP. The message is that we need more (former prime minister Junichiro) Koizumi reforms." "We have had no major initiatives for the last nine months and this is what frustrated the voters. We had no initiatives on pensions, health care and tax reform." "Abe might stay, at least for a while, but there will be criticism, definitely. He will get a lot of pressure. He knows it will be difficult to go ahead with his agenda. He might just quit, but I think he will stick." HARUMI ARIMA, PRIVATE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR "This was basically as I expected. Abe was really out of touch with the people. The pension issue was definitely a big problem, but even worse was the way they tried to handle it. Instead of reassuring people, I think Abe's leadership in fact just made people more worried. "Given the projected results, there will be pressure for him to resign. But the final decision has to be Abe's, and I get the sense that he might well hang on, at least for a while." TORU UMEMOTO, CHIEF FX STRATEGIST JAPAN, BARCLAYS CAPITAL "It is a severe defeat for the LDP. The exit polls are showing the LDP winning 30 to 38 seats and coalition partner New Komeito 8 to 10 seats. The coalition is very likely to lose. This is worse than consensus. "Prime Minister Abe is most likely to be forced to resign, and the LDP presidential election will be held in one month's time. Political instability is inescapable. The DPJ is likely to show an opposition stance in the upper house, so any important bill is likely to be blocked in parliament. The implication is yen-negative. "I think Abe could stay for several reasons, but below 40 seats for the LDP he is likely to resign. In an LDP presidential election, Tanigaki, Fukuda and Aso are the top candidates. The most likely successor is Aso, although I'm not very sure." KEN MASUDA, SENIOR EQUITIES DEALER, SHINKO SECURITIES "The Democratic Party did quite well -- better than I expected. The stock market will likely correct tomorrow, mainly because Wall Street plunged again on the subprime problem, but the defeat of the LDP will be a factor because it creates uncertainty politically. "But any correction will be temporary. We may see a fall tomorrow, and the Nikkei could break below 17,000. But I'd bet the market will recover on Tuesday or Wednesday. It's not as if the Democratic Party doing well or the LDP doing poorly really has any impact on corporate profits." PROFESSOR KOICHI NAKANO, SOPHIA UNIVERSITY "Assuming these results are indeed confirmed, it confirms the worst expectations for the LDP. It is a very clear vote of no confidence. "There is a general sense of dislike against Abe. He was perceived as being out of touch. His television appearances were seen to be counterproductive. I don't think he can continue as leader. "Assuming Abe steps down, probably not tonight but tomorrow ... I think Aso is clearly the closest to the premiership." BACKGROUND: - The upper house is the less powerful of parliament's two chambers. It lacks the authority to select a prime minister, and budgets and treaties can be enacted without its approval. But the chamber can reject other bills approved by the lower house, and the legislation can then only be enacted by a two-thirds majority of the lower chamber. - The upper house has 242 seats and its members serve for six years, with an election for half the seats every three years. In the last upper house election in July 2004, the LDP and New Komeito retained a majority after winning a combined total of 60 seats. - Of the 121 seats at stake this time, 73 are for prefectural or provincial constituencies, each with one to four seats, where candidates with the most votes win. The remaining 48 seats are from a nationwide proportional representation bloc in which voters choose either a candidate or a party, and seats are allotted based on the total number of votes cast for pa
