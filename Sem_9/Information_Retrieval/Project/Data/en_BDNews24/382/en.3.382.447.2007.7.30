<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday started hearing a writ petition that challenged the government's decision to take an extortion case against Sheikh Hasina under the cover of emergency powers rules. The court called Hasina's lawyers to hear the case at 12:30pm but one of her counsels, barrister Shafique Ahmed, sought postponement of the hearing since their chief counsel, barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, was busy with another case in the Appellate Division. The court had earlier accepted the appeal and the hearing took off shortly after 2:30pm. "I sought postponement and requested a start in the hearing at 2:00pm," Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Huq Sunday filed the writ appeal with the bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury. "I took permission from the court in the morning to file the writ petition," the lawyer told bdnews24.com Sunday. Hasina's lawyers said the emergency powers rules cannot cover the alleged incident that had taken place before the state of emergency was clamped. Sahara Khatun, Awami League's legal affairs secretary, Saturday claimed that they had enough grounds to challenge the case. According to the writ petition, inclusion of the extortion case against Hasina in the emergency powers rules was illegal. "She (Hasina) has been named in the FIR with some malafide motive...to harass and humiliate her," the petition alleged. "The case was approved under the emergency powers rules," the petition said, adding it was an "illegal approval". The approval has been given "arbitrarily and without lawful authority", it said. "The case is not of public importance. " The petition said the inclusion of such less important case under the emergency powers rules clearly shows that the government is adamant to detain the petitioner by "any means, curtailing scope for obtaining bail from any court". The appeal claimed that Hasina was innocent. The petition that gave a detailed description of the case filed by Azam J Chowdhury said the police submitted a chargesheet without an investigation. Earlier Khatun told reporters that lawyer Toufique Newaz had visited Hasina at the special jail Saturday and finalised the power of attorney and other documents from her to move the petition. Khatun argued that Hasina was arrested under regular law but an order from the home ministry, issued hours after her arrest, said the case had been taken under cover of emergency powers rules. A case under emergency powers rules means the accused will not get bail from court. Hasina was arrested on July 16 at her Sudha Sadan home, and later a Dhaka court denied her bail and ordered her to jail. On July 24, police formally charged Hasina with extortion, and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka in a second rule fixed Aug 16 to hear the case. Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, who is abroad now, has also been charged in the case although the complainant did not name her in the original complaint. The case involves alleged extortion of Tk 2.99 crore from a businessman in return for allowing him to build a power plant in Siddhirganj, Naraynganj, during Hasina's regime in 1996-2001. Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading, filed the case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station, accusing Hasina and former minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of extortion. Hasina and the Awami League denied the charges, saying that the case was politically motivated. The party also decried the arrest and subsequent detention, arguing that it was meant to prevent Hasina from taking part in next elections, expected to be held anytime between October and December 2008. bdnews24.c
