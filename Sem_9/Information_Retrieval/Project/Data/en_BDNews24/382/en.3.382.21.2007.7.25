 LONDON, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening batsman Marcus Trescothick has made himself unavailable for England's winter programme while he recovers from a stress-related illness, the ECB said on Wednesday. The illness has cut short his last two England tours, most recently the Ashes defeat in Australia, and the 31-year-old said he needed more time before making an international return. Trescothick, who was included in England's 30-man provisional squad for the first world Twenty20 tournament in South Africa this September, will also miss the tours to Sri Lanka and New Zealand. "Whilst I have been enjoying my cricket for Somerset this summer and feel that I am making good progress, I need to ensure that I am completely ready for a return to international cricket before making myself available for selection," Trescothick said in an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) statement. "I recently informed the selectors that I was happy to be included in the 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup to leave all options open but I am now clear that I should take more time to complete my recovery. I still have ambitions to play for England." Trescothick, who has not featured this summer in the home test series against West Indies and India, has played 76 tests with an average of 43.79. ECB chairman of selectors David Graveney said Trescothick still had a future at international level. "The selectors have been acutely conscious that it would be counter-productive to try to rush Marcus back into international action before he was ready," Graveney said. "Marcus has proved himself to be a very special talent on the international stage and we look forward to his making himself available again for England when the time is right and to his pushing his case for selection through his performances for Somerset.
