 ISLAMABAD, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomb attack in a restaurant near Islamabad's Red Mosque complex on Friday killed at least 11 people and wounded 43, Khalid Pervez, the top administrator in the city, said. The mosque had been the centre of a protest by Islamist radicals earlier in the day. "Yes, it was a suicide attack," Pervez told Reuters. Pakistan has suffered a spate of suicide attacks by Islamist militants since a military operation to crush Taliban style movement at Red Mosque, of Lal Masjid, earlier this month. Over 180 people have been killed, mostly police and soldiers, in the attacks aimed at destabilising the government of President Pervez Musharraf. At least seven police were killed in the latest blast, Interior Secretary Kamal Shah told Reuters. "Police were the target of attack," Shah said, adding that it was probably retaliation for the assault on Red Mosque, or Lal Masjid. The bombed restaurant was was located some 550 metres (600 yards) from the mosque. "Uniforms and caps of policemen were scattered all around. Bloodstains are all around," A Reuters witness said. Another witness, Nisar Ahmed, said: "It was a very big blast. I myself saw two bodies flying into air and falling on the road." Earlier Pakistani police had fired tear gas to disperse protesting Islamists who had spoiled government plans for the resumption of religious activities at the mosque complex, which had been a battleground earlier this month. Pakistani security forces stormed the Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, compound on July 10 following a week-long siege after supporters of radical clerics there refused to surrender. The government said 102 people were killed in the assault on the compound, the base for a Taliban-style movement. After the battle the authorities closed off the bullet-riddled and explosion-scorched complex and renovated it before formally reopening it for prayers on Thursday. The reopening of the mosque had been seen as a government move to cool anger over the siege and assault. Maulana Abdul Aziz, the mosque's firebrand cleric, was caught fleeing disguised as a woman after troops surrounded the complex, but his younger brother and deputy, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, was killed in the attack. Chanting slogans of "Musharraf is a killer" and "Ghazi, your blood will spark revolution", hundreds of bearded protesters stormed out of the mosque on Friday after offering the most important prayers of the week. They threw rocks at police and uprooted signboards on the roadside, and earlier manhandled Islamist parliamentarians who tried to enter the mosque. The protesters refused to allow a government appointed imam to lead prayers in the mosque, and about two dozen climbed to the mosque's roof and raised a black flag inscribed with Kalma -- the Muslim expression of faith. "If jihad is terrorism then this terrorism will stay forever," said protester Ghulam Mustafa. Lal Masjid had long been known as an Islamic radicals' stronghold. It made international headlines this year when burqa-clad female students of a madrasa in the complex, along with male supporters of the clerics, launched an aggressive campaign to impose Taliban-style religious culture in Islamab
