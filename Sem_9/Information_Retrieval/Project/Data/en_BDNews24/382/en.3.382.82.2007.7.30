 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) - Sigma Huda, the wife of former communications minister Nazmul Huda, claimed Monday that her physical condition was deteriorating while the government provided her with inadequate treatment. "The government will be responsible if I die. I will file a general diary with Lalbag thana informing them of the matter," she said. Sigma, who is being held in Dhaka Central Jail, is currently being tried in a bribery case in the Special Judge's court, set up at the Sangsad Bhaban. Judge Amar Kumar Roy is presiding over the case. "The condition of my heart is very bad, water has built up in my lungs which means I cant walk properly. The government, however, claims that I am not unwell and do not need any treatment," she said. "I feel very distressed to arrive in court everyday in a wheelchair. Despite making several appeals, I have not been exempted from appearing in court." Sigma Huda also described to the court her academic life, her career as a lawyer, as well as her family status and role in the human rights movement. Nazmul Huda and his wife stand accused of taking Tk 2.5 crore in bribes. A total of 40 people have taken the witness stand in the case since July 9. According to the court record, Nazmul Huda is alleged to have taken Tk 2.40 crore in bribes from Mir Zahir Hossain, the owner of contracting firm Mir Akhter Hossain Ltd. The money was then allegedly deposited in the account of the Weekly Khaborer Antorale, a magazine which she publishes. Sigma Huda intends to defend herself in court on Tuesday. bdnew
