 BAGHDAD, July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's mainly expat national soccer team are looking forward to returning home to celebrate winning the Asian Cup, but some are fearful for their safety and for the security of any jubilant crowds. Iraqi Youth and Sports Minister Jasem Mohammed Jaafar said on Monday it was hoped the team, most of whose players live abroad, would arrive in Baghdad this week after their historic triumph in Jakarta on Sunday. "They will be met at the airport by representatives of the prime minister, president and speaker of the Council of Representatives," Jaafar told Reuters.
