<TITLE> Reformists' claim figment of imagination: Hannan Shah </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) - BNP adviser ASM Hannan Shah Thursday said party 'reformists' command the support of no more than 5 percent of councillors. Shah dismissed BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's claim that the reformists were receiving a significant and positive feedback from councillors across the country. Talking to reporters at his Mohakhali DOHS home, Shah said: "Their claim comes from their imagination. They will not succeed if they try to move according to these plans." Bhuiyan had recently proposed to limit the tenure of party chairperson and secretary general to a maximum of 6 years. At a press conference last Friday, he claimed that there was massive support for these proposals throughout the country. Shah said in response: "Reform within the party will take place under Khaleda Zia's leadership. After the resumption of indoor politics, councillors will be invited to submit their proposals. "Decisions will be made in light of the opinions of the majority of the councillors. The minus formula will not work, nothing will happen without Khaleda Zia. There are no alternatives to Khaleda Zia in the BNP. "Leaders who favour reform should visit their own localities to gauge their level of support." bdnews24
