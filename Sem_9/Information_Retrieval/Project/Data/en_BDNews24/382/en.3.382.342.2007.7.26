 TOKYO, July 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar held on to gains on Thursday, staying off a record low versus the euro as traders reckoned that the US currency has been sold to a point that well reflects concerns about the US subprime market for now. The dollar rose sharply on Wednesday, brushing off weak US homes sales data and posting its biggest daily gain in a year against a basket of major currencies as traders covered short positions after the dollar index hit a 15-year low. Ongoing worries that problems in the US mortgage market may bleed into the broader economy continued to resonate on Thursday, keeping investors from aggressively selling the low-yielding yen for assets in higher-yielding currencies in risky carry trades. "Until now, the story has revolved around dollar weakness, yen weakness and euro strength," said Hideaki Inoue, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking. "We're seeing some adjustments in those positions." Gains in US stocks on Wednesday quelled some fears that fallout from a dive in the subprime market due to rising mortgage defaults and a wave of credit downgrades might drag on the rest of the economy. The euro slipped a touch to $1.3710 off a record high of $1.3853 hit earlier in the week. The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 120.55 yen pulling away from the 119.80 yen level, its weakest in 2- months, touched in the previous session. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was at 80.66, recovering from a 15-year low of 80.01 touched on Tuesday and keeping above the psychologically crucial 80.00 level. The New Zealand dollar dropped around 0.5 percent to 79.62 US cents after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Thursday followed up an anticipated rate rise to 8.25 percent by saying that it did not expect another lift any time soon. Currency traders showed limited initial reaction to comments from Bank of Japan Board member Tadao Noda, who reiterated that the central bank needs to be convinced about economic and price conditions before deciding whether to raise rates. Noda was speaking days before an election for Japan's upper house, in which the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is widely expected to lose, as well as a policy meeting next month at which the BOJ is expected to lift rates to 0.75 percent. The single European currency was at 165.20 yen recovering from a one-month low of 164.70 yen hit on Wednesday but keeping its distance from a record high of 169.05 yen hit at the beginning of the week. The yen was supported against higher-yielding currencies, having inched away from 16-year lows hit against sterling and the Australian dollar late last week and its lowest level in more than 20 years against the New Zealand currency reached earlier in the week. But analysts said investors were merely catching their breath from recent yen selling, and the overall yen weakness trend remained firmly intact. "The subprime issue is unlikely to lead to a global equity meltdown, so yen carry trades will maintain their appeal," said Toru Umemoto, chief forex strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. He added that retail investors' risk appetite is unlikely to wane any time soon, given expectations that Japanese interest rates -- the lowest among developed countries at 0.5 percent -- will rise very slowly even if rates rise next month. Figures on Wednesday showed that the pace of US existing home sales in June fell to a 4-1/2-year low. New home sales due at 1400 GMT are expected to show a slide from the previous month. Traders awaited German business confidence figures from the Ifo institute due at 0800 GMT, which were expected to fall for the second month in a row in July.
