 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) -- The National Board of Revenue Tuesday extended the deadline for legalising untaxed money by two months to Sep 30, NBR chairman Badiur Rahman said. "The move follows an unprecedented, last-minute rush by people wishing to formalise tax arrangements," Rahman said at a meeting of tax officials with Anticorruption Commission chief Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury in the NBR office. "We're getting a huge response at the last moment. This has encouraged us to extend the deadline by two months," he said. According to NBR figures, some 3,511 individuals had legalised their untaxed money by Monday although the number stood at only about 2,000 a day earlier. The NBR said it received as much as Tk 94 crore in one-day tax collections on Monday. On June 5, the NBR set people a deadline to legalise untaxed money for a two-month period ending on July 31. Under the ruling, an additional 5 percent penalty was added to the standard tax rate. Tax officials received more than Tk 137 crore in tax for the whole period until Monday under the provision, the NBR said. Badiur Rahman had previously warned people with undisclosed money that tough action, including imposing up to 250 percent fine, would be taken against them after the deadline on July 31. bdnews
