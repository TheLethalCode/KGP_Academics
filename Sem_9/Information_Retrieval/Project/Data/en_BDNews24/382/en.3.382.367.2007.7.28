<TITLE> Posters in Barguna demand Hasina's freedom </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Barguna, July 28 (bdnews24.com)  Scores of handwritten posters demanding Sheikh Hasina's release have covered many walls in the coastal town of Barguna, witnesses said Saturday. Content of the posters criticises two caretaker advisers, Mainul Hosein and MA Matin, apparently for their recent comments on the arrest of the former prime minister. But police said they were not aware of such posters and had no clue about who could post them, a claim that contradicts the witnesses' statement. The posters were visible in prominent places of the small town, such as the Press Club, Municipality Market, Zila School, Girls' School, Government College, Women's College and Lawyers' Association office. Slogans such as "We are still on the streets", "We want Sheikh Hasina's freedom" and "Prices of essentials are too much" are part of the content. Many other posters branded Mainul and Matin as "traitors". Some posters allege that Mainul had links with murders that involve the Bangla-language daily Ittefaq. Barguna sub-inspector Golam Mustafa said the police did not get any information about the reported posters. "We'll look into the matter if we find any clue," he said. The incident is part of stray protests that brewed after Hasina was arrested at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 on charges of extortion. Hasina has been kept in a special jail on the parliament building complex pending trial, and police formally charged her with extortion allegedly in return for allowing a company to build a power plant during her time in office between 1996 and 2001. bdnews24.com/c
