 LONDON, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea skipper John Terry signed a new five-year contract with the club on Friday, ending months of speculation about his future. Terry, 26, the England captain who has spent all his career at Chelsea and played more than 300 matches for the club, told Chelsea's Web site (www.chelseafc.com), "I'm really happy this has now been concluded. "There has been a lot of speculation but these things take time and I never had any doubts that I wanted to stay at Chelsea and that the club wanted me to stay." Terry had just over two years on his old contract, which has now been superseded by the new one.
