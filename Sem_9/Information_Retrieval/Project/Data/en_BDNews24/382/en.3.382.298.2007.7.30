 DEARBORN, Mich, July 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqi expatriates poured into the streets of a Detroit suburb on Sunday to celebrate Iraq's upset victory in soccer's Asia Cup and to savor a rare moment of good news from home. Police stopped traffic in Dearborn, Michigan for a spontaneous victory parade as dozens of cars draped in the Iraqi flag and trailing red, white, black and green balloons cruised the main drag of the largest Arab community in the United States, horns blaring.

"I'm all out of Iraqi flags," said store owner Jamil Aoun, who said he was surprised by the sudden rush of business on a normally quiet Sunday. "Next time I'll keep more." Ahmed Al-Mathab, 4, said his father woke him up to celebrate. "He was dancing in the house," he said. Adil, his father, who has been in the United States since 1994, was thinking of family caught up in the war even as he bought candy for Ahmed. "Everyday my family there is in pain," he said. "Today, they celebrate.
