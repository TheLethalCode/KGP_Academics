<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Shah Md Abul Hossain Wednesday said Khaleda Zia had launched the recent flurry of diatribes against the "reformists" out of either grief or anger. "She [Khaleda] said something about us because of her anger or grief. But we are very near and dear to her." "Her permission will be sought for holding the party council," Hossain said. He made the remarks at the Gulshan home of BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, who is leading the reform campaign and who has been accused by Khaleda of plotting to break up the party. "Our reform proposals are aimed to make the party more democratic and to weed out all corruption from the BNP. This will not cause any divisions; rather it will make the party more united." "Our secretary general has made proposals, and so has the chairperson, although we don't know the details yet. The council will take a final decision on these matters," the little-known BNP leader said. "We, as reformists, are not thinking of anything other than the BNP. The chairperson doesn't want to divide the party either." "We cannot communicate with her due to the present situation. There are restrictions on her telephone calls." Hossain claimed about two-thirds of the party supported Bhuiyan's reform proposals. bdnews24.co
