 Pakistan, July, 30 (bdnews24.com/BBC/Reuters)Islamic militants have occupied a shrine in a tribal district of Pakistan and named it after the Red Mosque in Islamabad, eyewitnesses say. More than 70 pro-Taleban militants evicted local officials from the Haji Sahib Turangzai shrine near the Afghan border in the country's north-west. Meanwhile, in the North Waziristan tribal area militants have killed at least seven people, officials say. Three paramilitary soldiers and four civilians were killed in militant attacks and exchanges of fire on Monday in Pakistan's troubled North Waziristan tribal region near the Afghan border, a military spokesman said. The Red Mosque was the scene of a siege this month in which 100 people died. Eyewitnesses said a signboard reading Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) was put up outside the Haji Sahib Turangzai shrine, in the Lakaro area of Mohmand Agency, on Saturday night. A local journalist, Mukaram Khan Atif, who visited the shrine on Sunday, told the BBC's Urdu service that heavily armed militants wearing masks had taken up positions in the surrounding areas and were frisking everyone who entered the mosque or the shrine. He said the militants' leader, who introduced himself as Omar Khalid, told him that a seminary for boys, named after Haji Sahib Turangzai, and another for girls, named Jamia Hafsa Umme Hassan, would soon be built on the premises. The authorities' decision to storm the Red Mosque in the capital, where armed Islamic militants had been barricaded, angered religious conservatives in Pakistan. Militants vowed to create Red Mosques and Jamia Hafsa seminaries in every corner of the country. A Mohmand Agency administration official confirmed the occupation of the shrine by the militants, but made no further comment. Meanwhile, a military spokesman in Islamabad said three soldiers and four civilians had been killed in two attacks in North Waziristan. "Three paramilitary soldiers were killed when militants attacked a check post near Miranshah town," Maj Gen Wahid Arshad said. In the second incident, militants ambushed a military convoy and four civilians were killed when caught in the cross-fire, he said. Pakistan has seen a massive increase in violence ever since Pakistani troops stormed the Red Mosque in early July. Soldiers entered the mosque after its clerics and students waged an increasingly aggressive campaign to enforce strict Sharia law in Islamabad. The mosque had become a centre of radical Islamic learning and housed several thousand male and female students in seminaries attached to it. More than 100 people were killed in the siege, including 11 soldiers. The attack on the mosque was the most prominent battle fought by security forces in Pakistan since President Musharraf vowed to dismantle the jihadi network in the country in the aftermath of the 11 September, 2001 attacks on the US. About 200 people have been killed in a wave of militant attacks since the operation. On Friday, a suicide bomber killed at least 13 people near the Red Mosque in Islamabad. Violence has escalated in Pakistan recently, especially in areas in the northwest like Waziristan, following a military assault on the radical Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, in the capital Islamabad early this month. More than 100 people were killed in the assault. Pro-Taliban militants also announced early this month the scrapping of a peace deal with authorities in the North Waziristan tribal region, adding to concerns about militant violence in the conservative northwest. "Three paramilitary soldiers were killed when militants attacked a check-post near Miranshah," the military spokesman, Major-General Waheed Arshad, told Reuters, referring to the main town of North Waziristan. In a separate incident, four civilians were killed in a crossfire when militants ambushed a military convoy on a main road linking settled Bannu district with North Waziristan. Arshad said the four civilians were killed when militants fired on the convoy at a time when normal traffic was also plying the road. Militants also wounded one paramilitary soldier in an attack in Miranshah, using an improvised explosive device, and Arshad said seven suspects had been arrested. Authorities were meanwhile searching for an intelligence official kidnapped at the weekend in the Mir Ali town of North Waziristan. Pakistan's Waziristan region has long been regarded as a safe haven for al Qaeda and Taliban militants sheltered by allies among the local Pashtun tribes. Pakistani authorities struck a deal with the local militants last September in a bid to isolate the foreign groups and curb cross-border incursions into Afghanistan. But the militants denounced the agreement early this month and have since launched several attacks on security forces. The army said it killed at least 54 militants in clashes, largely in retaliatory actions, in several days of fighting that erupted on July 21. Those followed the deaths of at least 13 soldiers in two separate militant attacks between July 18-20 in North Waziristan. Pakistan has been under pressure from the United States to step up action against Taliban and al Qaeda elements in the border areas, and movement of military and paramilitary convoys in and around Miranshah and Mir Ali towns near the Afghan border has become more regular, while check-posts have been reinforc
