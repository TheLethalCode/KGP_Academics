 DUBLIN, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish annual private sector credit growth fell to a new three-year low in June, but the drop was less than some had expected, and the mortgage component was strong enough to help steady a jittery stock market. The level of growth in lending to the private sector slipped back to 20.2 percent year-on-year last month from 20.9 percent in May and a peak of 30.3 percent a year earlier, the Central Bank of Ireland said on Tuesday. The annual increase was the lowest since February 2004 when the rate stood at 19.3 percent, according to the bank, which has welcomed a recent sharp cooling in Irish house prices and the accompanying slowdown in rapid rates of borrowing growth. However, the bank said a 5.3 billion euro rise in credit from May would have been one of the largest monthly increases, at close to 7 billion euros ($9.6 billion), if an asset-backed securitisation of residential mortgages had been included. June's rise brought the outstanding level of Irish private sector credit to 342.8 billion euros. Residential mortgage borrowing grew at an annual rate of 19 percent in June, down from 20 percent the previous month and the lowest since April 2002 when the rate was 18.9 percent. However, the monthly increase in residential mortgage borrowing was slightly higher than in May, rising 1.6 billion euros to 131.8 billion including securitisations. Davy economist Rossa White said the mortgage numbers were better than he had been expecting. "The month on month annualised increase was 16.1 percent compared with 14.8 percent and 11.5 percent in the two previous months," he wrote. "That was the best since 17 percent in March." Irish house prices fell for the first time in over five years in March and have continued to decline ever since. That in turn has hurt shares in the country's main lenders but they bounced back from one year lows set on Tuesday as traders pointed to the mortgage data as a contributory factor. Shares in Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent were all between 5 and 6 percent higher at 1115 GMT. The central bank noted, however, that in the first six months of 2007 outstanding residential mortgages rose by 8.6 billion euros -- more than 25 percent lower than the increase in the same period of 2006. Credit institutions in Ireland accounted for 233.3 billion euros of the euro area's broad money supply (M3) in June, a monthly rise of 5.5 billion euros or 2.4 percent. The annual rate of increase in money supply was 31.3 percent, down from a revised 34.8 percent in M
