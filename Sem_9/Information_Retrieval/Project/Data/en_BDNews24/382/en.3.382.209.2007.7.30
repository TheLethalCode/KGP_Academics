<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The National Board of Revenue (NBR) is likely to extend the time permitted to legalise untaxed money by at least one month, an official said Monday. The planned move follows an unprecedented rush at the last minute by people wishing to formalise their tax arrangements. "We're getting a huge response at the last moment. This has encouraged us to consider extending the project," a senior NBR official told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. According to NBR figures, some 3,511 individuals had legalised their untaxed money by Monday although the number stood at only about 2,000 the previous day (Sunday). The NBR said it received Tk 94 crore in tax in one day alone. "The NBR will forward a file to the finance adviser on Tuesday for an extension of the time permitted for legalising undisclosed money," NBR member Ali Ahmed, told reporters in his office Monday. On June 5 the government allowed people to legalise any untaxed money for a two-month period, up to July 31. Under the ruling an additional 5 percent penalty was added to the standard tax rate. Ahmed added: "It has not yet been decided how much more time will be given. It depends solely on the finance adviser." "I am receiving lots of complaints against tax officials who are harassing people trying to legalise their money by the deadline." Allegations have it that some tax officials did not let people legalise the money by the deadline as the officials tried to take advantage of the situation. He cited examples from Bhola and Habiganj districts' where tax officials have refused to accept any tax money from those attempting to use the new provision. NBR chief, Badiur Rahman, previously warned people with undisclosed money that tough action would be taken against them after the deadline on July 31. He also said there would not be any extension in the time given to come forward. bdnew
