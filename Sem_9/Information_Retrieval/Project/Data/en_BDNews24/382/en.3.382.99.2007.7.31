 MADRID, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain winger Jose Antonio Reyes said he had always wanted to join Atletico Madrid since it became clear he was not going to continue with Arsenal. The 23-year-old was on the point of signing for Atletico last year, having reached a pre-agreement with the club, but ended up going to their city rivals Real Madrid on loan instead. With that loan deal over, Atletico have now secured the player on a four-year contract. "I am happy I am back in Spain again and with the club I wanted to join. The club have been interested in me a long time and tried to sign me from Sevilla 13 years ago. I owe it to them," Reyes said at his presentation. "Real wanted me right up until the last moment but Atletico made a great effort to get me." Atletico club president Enrique Cerezo was keen to play down the importance of that fact that the club appeared to have stolen the player out from under the noses of Real Madrid. Spanish media reported Atletico had bid between nine and 12 million euros to land the player, topping an offer from Real of six million. "We had an agreement with him last year but Arsenal wanted to take Real's Julio Baptista on loan and there was no choice," Cerezo said. "We have returned for the player once again and he wanted to come here." Doubting Atletico fans, who watched Reyes help their neighbours to the Primera Liga title just a month ago, have been divided over the signing, particularly as he appeared to shun them last year. "I am a little bit worried by the fans reaction, but I will have to prove my worth on the pitch, scoring goals, and by helping them to be successful," Reyes said. Just to make life more complicated for Reyes his first league match in a red and white shirt will in the Bernabeu against Real on the weekend Aug 25/26. In his last game at the Bernabeu, he scored twice as Real beat Real Mallorca 3-1 to take the league title on the season's final day. "It will be a great game, the kind every player would want to play in," he addded. ($1 = 0.73 euros
