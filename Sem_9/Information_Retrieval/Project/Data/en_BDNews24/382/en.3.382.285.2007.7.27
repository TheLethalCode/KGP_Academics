 ROME, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania defender Cristian Chivu said on Friday he will join Inter Milan after the Italian champions came to an agreement with AS Roma following weeks of talks.

It is a life choice," he told a news conference at Roma's training ground. "I would like to be remembered as a good lad. I have spent four marvellous years here, full of satisfaction." Inter had pulled out of negotiations earlier this month before an 18 million euro move to Real Madrid collapsed because of the 26-year-old's salary demands. Barcelona had also expressed an interest in the player. Roberto Mancini's Inter finally went back in for the former Ajax player this week and have wrapped up a deal despite Chivu starting pre-season training with Roma.
