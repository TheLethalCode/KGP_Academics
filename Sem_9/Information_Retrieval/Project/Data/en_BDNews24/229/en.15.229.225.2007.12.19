 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Organisers and an ex-footballer Wednesday urged the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) to stop the process of forming the district and divisional football associations (DFA) to keep their promises. "We will go for a tough movement if the BFF does not stop the process of forming the DFAs," well-known organiser Harun-or-Rashid said at a press briefing at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Wednesday. "The BFF has adopted a double standard in seeking permission from FIFA to hold the BFF election on the basis of 2003 constitution on the one hand while forcing the district and divisional sports associations to finalise the DFA committees by December 30, on the other," said Harun. He said that the BFF was doing something contrary to what its president SA Sultan had promised at a round-table discussion a few days back. Meanwhile, Badal Roy, a former national footballer, urged the BFF president to make his resignation to FIFA clear and questioned why the BFF was suffering the vacuum of a guardian. Roy warned that if football faced any trouble in the absence of a guardian, all responsibilities would go on Sultan's shoulders along with the present committee. He also asked the members of the BFF committee to step down if they were not able to run football. The former midfielder said that the BFF president had misguided the National Sports Council Chairman by providing him wrong information. "We learnt that the BFF president had said they were running all games in line with the calendar, but the real scenario is that they were able to hold premier, national, first, second and third division leagues only twice from 2003 to 2007," said Roy. Organisers and the ex-footballer also condemned Sultan's statement on the sports adviser, and expressed solidarity with journalists to boycott Sultan in the sports arena. Sheikh Russel KC president Nurul Islam Chowdhury, Victoria SC general secretary Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, former national defender Kaiser Hamid, organisers Fazlur Rahman Babul and Reazaul Kabir Kaiser were present on the occasion.
