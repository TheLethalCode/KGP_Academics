 Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevara Irgasheva has lived her entire life with Islam Karimov as president of Uzbekistan, and cannot imagine anyone else filling the role. "He united our nation, he fathered our independence, and the whole world now knows about Uzbekistan," she said as she waited to vote in a presidential election at a polling station in central Samarkand -- the city of Karimov's birth. Irgasheva, a student of French, was born the year Karimov came to power when Uzbekistan was a Soviet republic. Eighteen years on, he is still president of the now-independent Central Asian state. Karimov is expected to win another seven-year term in office in Sunday's vote and further tighten his grip on power in the impoverished nation where he brooks little dissent. Domestic television and newspapers never portray Karimov, 69, in a negative light and a lot of young people like Irgasheva do not make a link between his rule and widespread poverty. And in any case, few expect the election to make much difference to their lives in this ancient Silk Route city, whose 400,000-strong population are preoccupied with making ends meet. "I can't afford to waste time on this luxury -- voting," said Malokat, a 50-year-old grandmother of 12 who sells Samarkand's trademark flatbread. "What's going to change in the election? My husband will simply go and cast my ballot for me later today," she said. BETTER TO BUY RICE Once at the heart of the vast empire of Turkic conqueror Tamerlane, Samarkand is a city of magnificent turquoise domes, mosques and mausoleums. Yet like the rest of the country, Samarkand has been hit by unemployment and grinding poverty, which has driven many of Uzbekistan's 16 million eligible voters to seek work in Russia and Kazakhstan. "In Samarkand, I can earn just enough to fill my stomach," said Shukhrat, a 27-year-old man who spends most of the year working as a taxi driver in the Russian city of St Petersburg. Komil, who sells rice at the bustling Siyob bazaar in the oldest part of Samarkand, said he voted for Karimov -- just like he has several times before. "Karimov will stay in power, that's for certain and that's unchangeable," Komil said. "But forget about politics -- better buy this variety of rice for a good pilaf!" Karimov won the last election in 2000 with 92 percent of the vote. His sole rival got about four percent. He then won a referendum in 2002 extending his term to seven years from five. Whispers of discontent about his rule are still heard in the capital Tashkent -- but in Samarkand, residents said they were ready for another seven years with Karimov. Some said it was it was "better to live with the known evil". "Perhaps Karimov has already filled his pockets," said Shukhrat, driving past the snow-clad 14-century mausoleum of Tamerlane in central Samarkand. "Perhaps it's high time for him to finally take care of us?
