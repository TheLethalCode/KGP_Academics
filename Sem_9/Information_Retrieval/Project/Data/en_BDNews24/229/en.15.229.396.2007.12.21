 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  The government Friday shipped a second consignment of archaeological relics out of Bangladesh National Museum, en route to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum, police and witnesses said. Homebound Courier Services trucked 145 relics to Zia International Airport shortly before 4pm. Sub-inspector Azharul Islam of Shahbagh Police Station told bdnews24.com by phone that he had escorted the trucks to the airport along with other police officers. The latest move by the government drew flak from artists, sculptors and students. "Today is a happy day for Muslims. The government sacrificed invaluable national resources, pandering to French overlords," Nisar Hossain, a teacher of the Fine Arts Institute, told bdnews24.com by phone. Some campaigners locked the gate to the National Museum Friday apparently to stop the government taking the relics from the museum, witnesses said. But the police broke the lock open to allow the courier's trucks in around 3pm. The government had earlier sent off 42 artefacts in 10 cartons on Nov 30. Duty officer of Shahbagh Police Station Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com that the police had been deployed in front of the museum for security reasons. "No untoward incident took place." The shipment of the relics ran into legal snags after an archaeological researcher, Nurul Islam, petitioned to the High Court on Dec 6, which, in turn, halted the shipment until Jan 15, 2008. On Dec 13, the court rejected a government appeal to cancel the status quo. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court later put freezes on the High Court order. The artefacts from five Bangladesh museums were scheduled to be on display at the exhibition under an agreement signed between the French ambassador to Bangladesh and the cultural affairs secretary. Some 188 items were selected from Dhaka museum and the museums of Paharpur, Mahasthangarh, Mainamati and Barendra for the show. bdnews24.com/
