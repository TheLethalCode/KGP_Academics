 Baghdad, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani visited refugees on Sunday that had fled border areas of northern Iraq after Turkish air strikes pounded areas close to their villages late on Saturday. Barzani, the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, strongly condemned the attacks and renewed calls for a peaceful solution. "These daily strikes are unacceptable ... Their goal is not only the PKK but the whole idea of an autonomous Kurdish region," he told a group of families, in comments broadcast on his party's Kurdistan TV channel. "This problem is not solved militarily and we are prepared for all peaceful solutions. I have come here to thank you for your patience and assure you that we will rebuild the border areas and the situation will not remain this way," he said. Kurdish security forces said Saturday's aerial bombardment caused no casualties because the area was largely evacuated in anticipation of Turkish military action. Turkey said its warplanes had bombed separatist PKK rebel positions inside Iraq. Over the past three months, Turkey, which has massed up to 100,000 troops near its border with Iraq, has carried out occasional air and artillery strikes and small-scale raids by ground forces across the border against PKK targets. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed rebellion in 1984
