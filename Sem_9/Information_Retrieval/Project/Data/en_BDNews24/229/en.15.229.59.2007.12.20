 LONDON, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Chelsea moved into the semi-finals of the English League Cup on Wednesday with a 2-0 victory over Liverpool. They will now take on Everton over two legs while the draw also paired north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in the last four for the second year running. Frank Lampard's deflected shot just before the hour mark put the hosts in front and Andriy Shevchenko sealed the win in the final minute with a powerful low shot. Liverpool's miserable night was capped by a red card for Peter Crouch just after Lampard's opener, the tall striker dismissed for a two-footed lunge at Jon Obi Mikel. "That decision finished the game," Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez told reporters. "Crouch was kicked twice from behind, I've seen much worse tackles in the last few weeks." Liverpool were without captain Steven Gerrard while Benitez made wholesale changes to the side that was beaten by Manchester United on Sunday. Chances were few and far between in the first half, Lampard being denied by Liverpool keeper Charles Itandje while Lucas went close for Liverpool. Ricardo Carvalho's mistake almost let in Crouch after the break but Liverpool fell behind when Shevchenko chested a pass into the path of Lampard and his shot looped into the net off the leg of the unlucky Jamie Carragher. After Crouch's rush of blood to the head Liverpool never looked like finding a route back into the tie and Shevchenko crowned Chelsea's victory when he smashed a low shot past Itandje. On Tuesday a youthful Arsenal, losing finalists last year, beat Blackburn Rovers 3-2 in extra time while Tottenham won 2-0 at Manchester City
