<TITLE> Iran could revive atom bomb bid due IAEA curbs - US </TITLE>

 By Mark Heinrich VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday that what U.S. intelligence found to be a secret Iranian nuclear arms programme halted in 2003 could easily be revived because of later curbs on U.N. inspections in the country. The U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency challenged suggestions that the U.S. intelligence finding disclosed on Dec. 3 reduced the urgency of reining in Iran via IAEA investigations, U.N. sanctions and steely diplomacy. Tehran says it has never sought nuclear energy for anything but electricity. But it has a history of dodging IAEA scrutiny and is trying to stockpile enriched uranium, of possible use for bombs as well, in defiance of U.N. resolutions demanding a halt. U.S. envoy Gregory Schulte said Washington's National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) contained "new evidence" of a concerted, clandestine atom bomb project in Iran and there was no reason to relax even if it was shelved four years ago, "Iran's leaders could choose to restart that programme, just as they restarted uranium enrichment (in 2006, after a two-year pause under international pressure)," he told invited reporters. "There is no certainty that the IAEA would know, particularly with the (IAEA) director-general twice warning us that IAEA knowledge of Iran's current activities is diminishing. That is a matter of grave concern." RESTRICTIONS Schulte was referring to restrictions on IAEA inspections beyond a few declared nuclear sites imposed by Iran in early 2006 in retaliation for U.N. Security Council steps to slap the first of two sets of sanctions on Tehran. "The technology that Iran is mastering today for enrichment, a capability not necessary for Iran to have a peaceful nuclear programme, could be readily applied to building a bomb, should Iran's leaders so decide," he said. The NIE said Iran was trying to develop the technical means applicable to producing weapons but had stopped trying to build them, contradicting President George W. Bush's position that Iran is actively trying to develop an atomic weapon. Schulte also said the NIE's findings made it more, not less, urgent that Iran cooperate quickly and completely with an IAEA inquiry to resolve questions about past Iranian nuclear activity that raised suspicions of military involvement. IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei told the agency's 35-nation board of governors last month that he wanted to wrap up the transparency process by the end of the year. But IAEA diplomats said this week it would probably run into January and February. "We still expect full disclosure but now we think they have even more to disclose as a result of the NIE," said Schulte. Western diplomats said they were not surprised by the timeline's slippage but it hardened concerns Iran was rationing cooperation just enough to preserve Russian and Chinese resistance to a Western push for harsher U.N. sanctions. Analysts say the NIE's finding that there was no current Iranian atom bomb effort could delay moves t
