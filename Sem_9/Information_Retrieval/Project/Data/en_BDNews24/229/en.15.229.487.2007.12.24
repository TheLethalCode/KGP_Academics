 United Nations, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly passed a $4.17 billion budget for 2008-09 with the United States casting the only vote against because of provisions for a conference it sees as anti-Israeli. In the vote early on Saturday, following a session lasting most of the night, the assembly voted 142-1 for the two-year budget, which was slightly short of the $4.2 billion requested by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Addressing a budgetary committee meeting before the vote by the full assembly, US envoy Mark Wallace said Washington opposed the budget because it contained funding for a follow-up to a 2001 racism conference in Durban, South Africa. The United States and Israel walked out of that conference because they said it was targeting Israel as a racist state. "Our political sentiments have been clearly expressed on this revisiting of an event that was noxious to my country and a disgrace in the international community," Wallace said. He said that while his country had other reservations on the budget, the conference provision was "the straw that broke the camel's back". No country has a veto in the General Assembly, unlike the Security Council. In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Secretary-General Ban welcomed the approval of the budget but regretted it had not been adopted by consensus, breaking a 20-year tradition. Without mentioning the United States, the statement said Ban "urges all member states to return to consensus decision-making and to demonstrate a greater sense of flexibility and compromise, beyond individual national interests". TASK FORCE The General Assembly did not, as some countries had wanted, end funding for a special task force which says it has uncovered fraud and corruption associated with UN contracts worth over $600 million. The mandate of the task force was originally set to expire at the end of this year but Ban had urged member states to continue funding it for another year. The United States had also campaigned for continued funding. A report by the task force, seen by Reuters, gave details of investigations into contracts in various missions including Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya and at UN headquarters in New York. It said it had "identified multiple instances of fraud, corruption, waste and mismanagement". The General Assembly said it would look again at the task force next year, but it did require that the force itself be investigated by a board of auditors over its activities. Ban's budget proposal, which he said involved an increase of just half a percentage point, or $23 million, over the previous two-year period, aims to put more funds into heading off world conflicts by boosting the UN political department. But the United States and other big donors have criticized what they call a "piecemeal approach" involving later add-ons to the budget. The European Union has said these could bring the final budget to $4.8 billion. Washington paid 22 percent of the previous budget and the EU a combined 38 percent. The UN budget approved on Saturday does not include peacekeeping costs, forecast to rise to around $7 billion from $5 billion. But in a separate resolution the assembly approved $1.28 billion to cover the planned UN-African Union force in Darfur, Sudan, up to June 30, 2008
