 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri has said he is considering resignation after the loss of two rare artefacts. In a press briefing Monday, Quadri said: "It's me who must take the responsibility as the head of the cultural affairs ministry for the lost artefacts." Asked if he would resign by a bdnews24.com reporter, the adviser said: "What do you want?" The reporter answered back with the same question: "What do you want?" The adviser said: "I am thinking about the matter (resignation)." Two rare statues have gone missing from Zia International Airport in Dhaka, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum. One of the two terracotta images was a bust of Vishnu. A five-member committee has opened a probe into the theft of the two artefacts. The committee led by Fakhrul Islam, joint secretary of the civil aviation and tourism ministry, will submit its report in three working days. The adviser Monday said: "Personally I think the rest of the artefacts should not be sent off until the issue is settled." bdnews
