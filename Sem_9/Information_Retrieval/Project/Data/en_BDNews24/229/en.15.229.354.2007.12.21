 MELBOURNE, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rain has again thwarted India's preparations for the first test against Australia with only 10 overs of play possible on the second day of their tour match against state side Victoria on Friday. India, resuming on 110 for three after only 38 overs was possible on the first day at Junction Oval in suburban Melbourne, moved along to 133-4 with Saurav Ganguly the only wicket to fall for 59. Ganguly, who had steadied India's innings on Thursday after Allan Wise had taken three quick wickets to reduce them to 38-3, added just eight runs to his overnight score before he became Wise's fourth victim. Rahul Dravid, who had begun the day on 33, moved on to 38, while Yuvraj Singh was on six when torrential rain again swept through Melbourne bringing the day's play to a premature end. India meet Australia in the first test of their four-match series in Melbourne on Dec. 26
