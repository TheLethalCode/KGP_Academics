 JERUSALEM, Mon Dec 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli and Palestinian negotiators planned to meet on Monday for a second round of US-backed peace talks bogged down by disputes over Jewish settlement building near Jerusalem. Israeli officials said ahead of the talks that they would consider ways to relax criteria for releasing Palestinian prisoners, part of efforts to secure a swap deal with Hamas for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israel's deputy defense minister, Matan Vilnai, told Israel Radio that Marwan Barghouthi, a Palestinian uprising leader from Fatah who is seen as a possible successor to President Mahmoud Abbas, could be a candidate for release. Abbas aides said substantive talks over borders and the fate of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees would not begin until Israel committed to halting all settlement activity as called for under the long-stalled "road map" peace plan. The road map also calls on the Palestinians to rein in militants, an obligation that Israel says must be fulfilled in the occupied West Bank and Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip before a Palestinian state can be established. Hamas seized control of Gaza in June after routing Abbas's secular Fatah forces. The first round of peace talks following a U.S.-sponsored conference in Annapolis, Maryland, opened in discord on December 12 with Abbas demanding Israel drop plans to build some 300 new homes in an area near Jerusalem known to Israelis as Har Homa and to Palestinians as Abu Ghneim. On the eve of the second round of negotiations scheduled for Monday, Israel's Construction Ministry unveiled a proposal to build 740 new homes next year on occupied land near Jerusalem -- 500 in Har Homa and 240 in the Maale Adumim settlement. Abbas said he could not understand why Israel was "carrying out frenzied settlement activity during final status negotiations". Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said Israel's settlement plans were "sabotaging negotiation efforts". Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said Israel hoped "it will be possible to advance negotiations, to move them forward" despite the disputes. The Palestinians accuse Israel of ignoring the road map's explicit calls for a halt to all settlement activity, including so-called "natural growth". Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's spokesman, Mark Regev, said Israel would meet its obligations by not allowing "outward growth" of existing settlements, by preventing new settlements from being built, and by not confiscating any more Palestinian land. But Israel will allow construction within built-up areas of existing settlements. Israel wants to keep Maale Adumim and other large settlement blocs in any peace deal. Abbas is expected to meet Olmert as early as Tuesday to follow up on last month's Annapolis conference in which they set the goal of reaching a statehood deal before President George W Bush leaves office in January 2009. Bush will visit the region early next month. It is unclear how a peace agreement, if reached, would be implemented with the Palestinian territories divided between Abbas's Western-backed government in the West Bank and a rival Hamas administration running the Gaza Strip. Abbas has long urged Olmert to relax Israel's prisoner release criteria -- restricted to those with no "blood on their hands", a reference to attacks against Israelis. Israeli cabinet minister Rafi Eitan said the current criteria made it difficult to negotiate a prisoner swap. The changes under review could lead to the release of prisoners from Hamas as well as Fatah, officials said. Shalit was captured by Gaza militants in June 20
