 LONDON, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo scored an 88th-minute penalty to give Manchester United a 2-1 victory over Everton at Old Trafford on Sunday that kept them within a point of Premier League leaders Arsenal. Third-placed Chelsea also kept up the chase when a first-half Joe Cole goal gave them a 1-0 win at Blackburn Rovers. Arsenal, who beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 on Saturday, lead the way on 43 points with United second on 42 and Chelsea on 37. Manchester City, who drew 1-1 at Aston Villa, have 34 while Liverpool, 4-1 home winners over Portsmouth, are fifth on 33. Everton remain sixth on 30, ahead of Portsmouth on goal difference. Manchester United, seeking a ninth successive home league win, went ahead in the 22nd minute when Ronaldo cut in from the right and clipped in a left-footed shot. Everton hit back when Tim Cahill showed great determination to power in an excellent header. United looked lively and inventive but found Everton difficult to break down despite the wealth of attacking talent on show. PLAYGROUND TACKLE That changed when Steven Pienaar thrust out a leg behind him in a playground tackle on Ryan Giggs that handed Ronaldo the decisive penalty. Sunday's double made the Portuguese winger the league's leading scorer with 11. "This game was very tough, Everton played very well," Ronaldo told Setanta Sports TV. "It's an important win with many games to come and not too much time to rest." Everton manager David Moyes rued Pienaar's late lapse, saying: "It was a moment of madness for Steven. The players have worked really hard to take something from the game but it is just one of those things." Chelsea weathered some early Blackburn pressure before striking with a sweetly taken goal by Cole after a killer through-ball by Salomon Kalou in the 22nd minute. Both goalkeepers then made excellent first-half saves as Petr Cech pushed a Steven Reid shot on to the bar and Brad Friedel dived to tip a Frank Lampard effort against a post before Chelsea tightened up to secure the victory. In Sunday's other game bottom club Derby County secured their first point in eight matches with a 2-2 draw at Newcastle United, who twice came from behind with two goals by Mark Viduka.
