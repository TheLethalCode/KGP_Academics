 BANGKOK, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The People Power Party (PPP), a vehicle for supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, won the most seats in Sunday's Thai election, two exit polls said. However, they differed greatly on the size of the PPP victory, which was nevertheless likely to cause consternation in the ranks of the generals who booted out telecoms billionaire Thaksin in a September 2006 military coup. Bangkok's Suan Dusit College said the PPP had won 256 out of the 480 parliamentary seats, giving it a clear majority. However, Assumption University's ABAC poll said the PPP won only 202 seats -- in line with most pre-election polls -- meaning it would have to tie up with at least one other minor party to form a coalition. About 45 million Thais were eligible to vote before polls closed at 3 p.m. (0800 GMT) in an election meant to restore democracy but which looked set to prolong the deep political divisions of the past two years. On the eve of polling, PPP leaders said if they won a clear majority Thaksin would be free to return on Feb. 14. They did not explain why Valentine's Day was picked for his homecoming. PPP leader Samak Sundaravej, whose party embraced the populist policies which won Thaksin two landslide election victories, said he was confident "the vote will be on our side". "What Thaksin did for them five years ago is still in their hearts. They are thinking of him," said Samak, who freely admits being a proxy for the 58-year-old Thaksin, believed to be watching the results from Hong Kong. ARMY DISQUIET? Political convention dictates that the biggest party -- in this case PPP -- should be given first crack at cobbling together a coalition with minor parties. But the army and the royalist establishment, which Thaksin supporters blame for the coup, would do all they could to stop it by fostering allegations of electoral fraud against its candidates and potential partners, analysts said. They would prefer a coalition led by the Democrats, the main opposition during Thaksin's five years in power. Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party was dissolved this year for election fraud and he and 110 party members were barred from politics for five years. Financial markets hope the return of an elected government will signal the end of a period of disappointing economic growth, likely to fall towards four percent this year from 5.1 percent in 2006 and the lowest rate in six years. At polling stations across Bangkok, voters said they too were tired of the political mess. "It doesn't really matter which party gets in just as long as we have a government as soon as possible," said 60-year-old Anunt. But analysts say the election, held under a new constitution designed to prevent the return of single party rule, was almost certain to produce a weak coalition unlikely to last little more than a year. "I don't see this election as solving anything," US-based academic Kevin Hewison said. "The emerging political system is unlikely to be inclusive. It will be dominated by a conservative palace, the royalist military and the dead weight of the bureaucracy." Both the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps have said they will take to the streets if they felt the other side had gained an upper hand in the polls unfairly. Major street protests could trigger another military coup, analysts say. Last year's coup was the 18th in 75 years of on-off democracy in Thailand. The uncertainty has worried revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who urged soldiers and police to use their spiritual "strength" to pull the nation out of its political me
