<TITLE> Japan PM to visit China Dec 27-30 as support drops </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda will make his first visit to China next week in a bid to strengthen ties, but with a breakthrough in a natural resources dispute unlikely, he could land in the hot seat back home. The Dec. 27-30 trip, announced on Friday, comes at a time when Fukuda's support rate has dived to just over 30 percent, a level analysts say is crucial to stay in power, on outrage over mishandled pension records and a bribery scandal. "The visit is to set the tone for future Sino-Japanese relations," said Hiroshi Nakanishi, a professor of international politics at Kyoto University. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have warmed in the past year after a long chill under former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who repeatedly visited a shrine seen by many in Asia as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Beijing has welcomed Fukuda's taking over the reins as he has been an advocate of closer ties with Asian neighbours, but his critics at home have said he is too yielding towards a rising China. Fukuda held a rare lunch meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao last month on the sidelines of an Asian leaders' meeting in Singapore, and a Chinese naval destroyer made the first such visit ever to Japan in late November. Japanese officials said Fukuda did not raise the issue of China's increasing military spending, which Tokyo has long said lacks transparency, in his November meeting with Wen. "I hope that it will be meaningful for our mutually beneficial relationship," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told reporters when announcing the trip. Ties remain frayed by a number of issues, including a long-running dispute over natural gas, stemming from differences over a border separating the two countries' exclusive economic zones in the East China Sea. "Fukuda could face criticism that he's not standing up to China, telling them what needs to be told," said an aide to a former prime minister who declined to be named. China is piping gas from an area close to what Japan sees as its own economic zone, leading to concerns in Tokyo that Beijing could be siphoning resources from geological structures that stretch into the Japanese zone. Wen and then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed in April that officials should come up with a solution to the gas row by autumn, but 11 rounds of talks have failed to yield results, and ministers have already said progress was unlikely during Fukuda's visit. "The possibility is very small," Trade Minister Akira Amari said this week, and Machimura, the top government spokesman, said progress in the dispute was not a prerequisite for a visit. Few experts see a breakthrough in the dispute. "Japan and China are clashing over their basic principles of the issue, and therefore it is very difficult to reach a compromise," said Akio Takahara, a professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. But some Japanese diplomats were upbeat about ties between the two countries. "With the exception of the dispute over the gas field, everything else is bright in Sino-Japanese relations," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. Recent media surveys have shown support for Fukuda's cabinet dropping as low as 31 percent, a level seen as likely to encourage opposition parties, which hold a majority in the upper house, to put pressure on Fukuda to call a snap election.
