 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of thousands of vacationers Wednesday left the capital for home amid a huge rush of outbound vehicles ahead of the Eid-ul Azha. Chaos at bus terminals across the city continued through late Wednesday night. Buses, trucks and cars jammed many exit points. A trail of traffic stretched across the city of 10 million people. To reach their homes at lower costs, many workers boarded trucks, which were returning to districts from Dhaka after offloading cattle and goods, witnesses said. City exits turned into dizzying points of honking traffic, bdnews24.com correspondents said. Makeshift cattle markets added extra chaos to the scene. Thousands of city residents gathered at cattle markets to buy sacrificial animals, further straining the traffic system. Hundreds of vehicles, packed with passengers, were stranded at Gabtali Bus Terminal Wednesday night, bdnews24.com senior correspondent Liton Haider reported from the scene. "Everything seems to have collapsed here. Everybody got stranded." A cattle market in Gabtoli gobbled up a stretch of the road. Many trucks were parked haphazardly in the area. Cows were running around on the road obstructing traffic. bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib, who was near Sangsad Bhaban around 10:00pm, saw hundreds of vehicles stranded in the area. On Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, traffic chaos was much worse. "The vehicles were not moving," he said. Traffic jam stretched to other parts of the city. Umesh Babu, an official of Hanif Paribahan, said buses arrived late in Dhaka from district towns. "It's happening because of heavy traffic jams on highways and at the city entry points," he said. bdnews24.com/
