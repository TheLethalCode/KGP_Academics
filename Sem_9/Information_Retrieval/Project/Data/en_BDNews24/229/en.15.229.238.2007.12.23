 Dhaka/Kolkata, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Indian customs officials seized four Vishnu statues from a van on the border with Nepal, officials said Sunday, hours after Bangladesh government opened an investigation into the theft of two images of the Hindu god. No arrest was made. The development coincided with the theft of two Vishnu statues from Zia International Airport in Dhaka, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum. The route is known for easy smuggling, Sumon K Chakrabarti, chief national correspondent of Indian TV channel CNN-IBN, told bdnews24.com by phone Sunday.
