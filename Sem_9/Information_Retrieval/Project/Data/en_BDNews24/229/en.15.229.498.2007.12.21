 Washington, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democracy and anti-terrorism conditions Congress has placed on military aid to Pakistan can be met and do not represent large divisions over policy toward that key ally, a senior official said on Thursday. The conditions were included in the $556 billion bill the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday to fund most of the U.S. federal government through September 2008. The bill was cleared by the Senate late on Tuesday and is to go to President George W. Bush for his expected approval. The legislation withheld $50 million of $300 million in military aid for Pakistan until Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reports to Congress that Islamabad has restored democratic rights and an independent judiciary and was making concerted efforts to fight al Qaeda and Taliban militants. U.S. lawmakers limited use of the remaining $250 million in military aid to counterterrorism or law enforcement activities against al Qaeda and the Taliban. "We're confident that we'll be able to report to Congress on elements in the areas that they identified," said Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher. "They are the same issues that we're following very closely," added Boucher, the top U.S. diplomat for South and Central Asia. President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3, firing dozens of judges and jailing opposition politicians and activists. He revoked emergency rule and restored the constitution last weekend but has refused to reinstate the judges. In response to Musharraf's crackdown, the United States reviewed its multibillion dollar aid program to a country which borders troubled Afghanistan and which Washington sees as a key ally against Islamic extremism. That review led to a halt to the practice of sending $200 million in economic aid every year in cash transfers to the Pakistani treasury. The funds will now go to specific projects run by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Boucher said any gap between the Bush administration and Congress over democracy and counter-terrorism in Pakistan fell between "minuscule and small." Pakistan will hold a general election on Jan. 8 and Washington is working with Islamabad and Pakistani civil society "to try to keep moving towards an election that is as transparent, as fair and as free as possible," he said. Congress aid strictures do not affect Islamabad's ability to buy F-16 fighter jets, Boucher said. "The F-16 program is a Pakistani purchase -- their money, they're buying them -- and our military assistance goes for different purposes," he said. bd
