 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will defer city corporation elections as schoolteachers will remain busy with SSC examinations in March, an election commissioner said Monday. "We were determined to hold elections to four city corporations in March. But the SSC examinations have been deferred due to cyclone Sidr," election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain said, after visiting Kakoli High School and Dhanmondi Government Girls High School to oversee voter listing work. He did not announce the next schedule for polls. The deferred SSC exams will start in March and end on April 22. "So the schedule for the city corporation elections will be deferred too," he said. "Schoolteachers perform some election-related work, but they will remain busy supervising SSC exams. Besides, school buildings are used as election centres." In reply to a question on the law adviser's comment on the withdrawal of the state of emergency Shakhawat said: "I don't want to call it a state of emergency. We will ask the government to create an environment necessary for local government elections." Barrister Mainul Hosein Sunday said the council of advisers would discuss an end to the state of emergency if the chief election commissioner made a proposal for it. Shakhawat said that 1.74 crore voters have been listed across the country until Dec 19. bdnew
