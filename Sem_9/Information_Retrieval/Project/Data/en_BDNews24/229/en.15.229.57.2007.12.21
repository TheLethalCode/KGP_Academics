 WELLINGTON, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Batsman Peter Fulton has been recalled to the New Zealand cricket squad for their three-match one-day series against Bangladesh. Fulton replaces the out-of-form Lou Vincent, who struggled against Australia in the recently completed Chappell-Hadlee one-day series that Australia won 2-0. Wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins and pace bowler Michael Mason have also been released to play domestic cricket. "We welcome the return of Peter Fulton to the squad," coach John Bracewell said in a statement. "Peter has shown good form in (domestic cricket), and he has proven in the past he can translate a high standard of performance at domestic level to the international game." "The selection panel felt it was important to retain the bulk of the team from the recent series in South Africa and Australia to give them the opportunity to build on the experience of those tours and show the talent they have." New Zealand play Bangladesh in the first of their three one-day matches in Auckland on Dec. 26, before they meet again in Napier on Dec. 28 and Queenstown on Dec. 31. New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (captain), Brendon McCullum, Jamie How, Peter Fulton, Scott Styris, Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie, Chris Martin, Jeetan Patel
