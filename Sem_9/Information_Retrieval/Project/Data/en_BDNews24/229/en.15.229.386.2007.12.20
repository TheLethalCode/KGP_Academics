<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)Chances are slim that Sheikh Hasina's request to speak to her son, daughter and sister on Eid day will be granted. DIG (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com Thursday afternoon: "According to the Jail Code, there is no possibility for prisoners to call out of the country." "Up to this time, that is all the information I have; the chances of her getting this opportunity are very slim." However, higher authorities can use their discretion to make special exceptions, he added. Hasina Wednesday submitted the request to speak to son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul and sister Sheikh Rehana on Eid day. The request was made on her behalf by special assistant Hasan Mahmud by fax to the inspector general of prisons. Since her detention on July 16, Hasina was given special dispensation to speak to her son and daughter once by telephone. bdnews
