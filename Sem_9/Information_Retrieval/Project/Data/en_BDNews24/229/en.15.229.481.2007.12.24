 Singapore, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rose, lifted by technology and bank stocks as stronger-than-expected US consumer spending calmed fears the world's top economy was heading into a recession, while the dollar traded near a six-week high against the yen. Commodity and energy companies, such as Australia's Woodside Petroleum, were also firmer after copper, gold and oil prices rose. Trading activity was slowing as investors took off for the Christmas holidays. Australia's market closes early on Monday, while Japanese financial markets were shut for the Emperor's birthday, but reopen on Tuesday. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 1 percent by 0143 GMT, taking its cue from an explosive rally on Wall Street on Friday The index is about 12.5 percent below its Nov. 1 record high, but is still up about 30 percent as the year draws to a close. The gain is more than three times that for the MSCI All-Country World Index so far this year. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.6 percent on Friday, and the Nasdaq gained 1.9 percent. In Asia, equity investors snapped up banks and technology shares, such as LG Electronics Inc, heartened by a string of strong earnings reports from US bellwethers, including results on Friday from the firm behind the BlackBerry. Investors also cheered data showing US personal spending jumped more than expected in November, suggesting consumers have not been discouraged by signs of a slowdown as the subprime mortgage crisis spreads.

Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1 percent, while Taiwan's TAIEX gained 2 percent. Financial stocks -- among the worst affected by the last five months of credit market turmoil -- continued to draw strength from a report that Singapore state investor Temasek may invest $5 billion in Merrill Lynch Investors, cheered by the recent string of sovereign fund investments in the battered US banking sector, took in their stride news late on Friday that US investment banks were abandoning a plan to bail out structured investment vehicles after Citigroup and others launched independent rescues. As concerns about risk receded, investors again sold the low-yielding yen and bought higher yielding currencies in carry trades. By 0121 GMT, the dollar traded at 114.09 yen having risen to a 1-1/2-month peak of 114.16 yen in New York on Friday. The dollar was at 1.4384 against the euro. Oil eased in thin Asian trade but stayed above $93 a barrel, with US light, sweet crude for February delivery holding most of Friday's over $2 surge, to trade at $93.21 a barrel. Among commodities, Shanghai copper and zinc futures rose by their daily limit for a third session in a row, following price surges in the metals in London. Spot gold traded at about $810 an ounce, although trade was thin
