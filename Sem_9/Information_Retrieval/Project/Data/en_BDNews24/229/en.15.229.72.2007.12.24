<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  The FIFA sent the ball to the court of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) after its president SA Sultan tendered his resignation to the FIFA president Joseph S Blatter. A source outside BFF confirmed that Sultan was asked to tender his resignation in the right place that means the BFF boss has to submit his resignation to the executive committee. The source said that the BFF was going to hold an emergency meeting in a couple of days to find out the ways. On Dec 15, Sultan tendered his resignation to the FIFA president and two copies of resignation were sent to the Asian Football Confederation president and National Sports Council Chairman and Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed. A Bangladesh Olympic Association source seeking anonymity told bdnews24.com Monday that the FIFA also instructed the BFF to hold its election after forming the district and divisional football associations (DFA). On Dec 13, Sultan wrote a letter to the FIFA president, seeking permission to hold the BFF election on the basis of the constitution unveiled in 2003 as organisers and ex-footballers protested against the formation of DFAs this time. No high official of the BFF was found to confirm FIFA instructions as they have been avoiding journalists since the media leaked out the BFF president's confidential letter to the NSC chairman on Dec 13.
