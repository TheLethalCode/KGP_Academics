 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Sunday ordered arrest of Tajuddin, a fugitive accused in the case on grenade attacks on an Awami League rally on Bangabandhu Avenue. He also granted an appeal for issuing a red warrant through the Interpol for his arrest. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani issued the order after CID assistant superintendent of police Md Fazlul Kabir, the investigating officer, appealed to the court for the arrest and red warrants. In the appeal for the arrest warrant, Rabbani said several attempts to arrest Tajuddin had fizzled out. Tajuddin, son of Mohiudddin Ahmed, is accused of supplying grenades for the attacks on Aug 21, 2004 on the Awami League rally, where former prime minister Sheikh Hasina spoke. Depositions and cross-examinations confirmed that Tajuddin was one of the planners for the attack. In November, chief of the banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad (Huji) Mufti Abdul Hannan, and others in their confessional statements in the case said Tajuddin had supplied the grenades. The court asked the police to submit the investigation report in the case on Jan 30. In the case dossier submitted to the court on Dec 17, a total of 28 have been shown arrested. Some of the arrestees in jail and some others have been freed on bail.
