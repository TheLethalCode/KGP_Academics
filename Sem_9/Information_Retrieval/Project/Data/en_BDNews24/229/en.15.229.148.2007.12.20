<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saurav Ganguly scored a half century as India's first day of their tour of Australia was severely hampered by heavy rain on Thursday. Torrential rain caused a delay to the start of their match against state side Victoria and thunderstorms and heavy rain later in the day forced the abandonment after tea. The visitors were on 110 for three after only 38 overs of play. Former captain Rahul Dravid, who was promoted to open with Wassim Jaffer, crafted a patient 33 off 112 balls after left-arm fast bowler Allan Wise had torn through India's top order. Wise had Jaffer caught for a duck, then had Vangipurappu Laxman caught by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade for just one to leave India struggling at 10 for two in the fourth over at Junction Oval in suburban Melbourne. Sachin Tendulkar became Wise's third victim when he was bowled for 19, though Tendulkar had struck one boundary and a six in his short 18-ball stay, to leave India on 38 for three. Dravid then combined with Ganguly, who was the more aggressive, stroking eight boundaries to reach 51 before more torrential rain and lightning swept across the city and ended the match early. Wise had figures of three for 22 off 10 overs. The match ends on Saturday with India then facing Australia in the first test of their four-match series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Dec. 26
