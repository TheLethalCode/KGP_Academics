 WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has fallen 13 points since November and is now tied with Mitt Romney nationally in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday. According to the poll, Giuliani and the former Massachusetts governor are tied with 20 percent support among Republican primary voters. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee was in third place with 17 percent support, followed by Arizona Sen. John McCain at 14 percent and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson at 11 percent, the poll found. Giuliani had been the clear leader in all previous NBC/Journal polls and led the field with 33 percent support in the survey last month. In the past month, Giuliani's campaign faced more media scrutiny. The campaign also did not put much emphasis on Iowa and New Hampshire, where candidates next month face the first contests in the 2008 presidential race, NBC said. According to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, just 37 percent view Giuliani favorably, compared with an equal 37 percent who have a negative impression of him. In March, 58 percent viewed Giuliani favorably versus only 14 percent who saw him in a negative light, NBC report
