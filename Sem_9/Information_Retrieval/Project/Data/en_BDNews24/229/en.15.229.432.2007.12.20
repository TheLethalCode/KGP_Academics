 Pabna, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)Two holidaymakers fell to their death from the roof of a train after being struck by the overhead railings of a bridge in Pabna Thursday, police said. One of the two ill-fated passengers is 40-year-old Abdul Kader from Dhaperhat of Sundarban upazila, Gaibandha. The other is yet to be identified. At least 10 were injured and four others who fell from the train roof are missing after the accident, which occurred at 2:30 pm while they were travelling on the Sayedpur-bound Nilsagar Express train. Ishwardi government railway police (GRP) chief Mahbubur Rahman said that among the injured, six have been admitted to Pabna Sadar Hospital and the others to Bhangura Hospital. "The people who were travelling on the roof of the train did not have tickets," Mahbubur told bdnews24.com. "Most of them were low income workers. Twenty of them fell from the roof as the train reached the Shagatnagar Koinga Bridge at Bhangura." "Only four of them could manage to reach the riverbank by their own efforts. Local people rescued the others," he added. A case has been filed on the incident. The rail line was restored around 4:00pm. bdnews24
