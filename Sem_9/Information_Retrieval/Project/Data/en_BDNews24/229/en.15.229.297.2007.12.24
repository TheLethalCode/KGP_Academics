<TITLE> Australian ex-Guantanamo detainee agoraphobic: media </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sydney, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The only Guantanamo Bay inmate convicted of terrorism offences, Australian David Hicks, is due for release from jail on Saturday but is psychologically unprepared for freedom, local media reported on Monday. Hicks, who returned to Australia in May, suffers from agoraphobia and retreats to solitary confinement in his prison cell, the Sydney Morning Herald said. Hicks, 32, has only once left his Australian cell, where he has been serving the last nine months of a seven-year term. He could not cope with the open space of the prison yard, preferring his enclosed cell and artificial light, reported the newspaper. "He tried to go out but he just said everything closed in on him," his father, Terry Hicks, told the Herald. A trip to a police station in the south Australian city of Adelaide in November, as part of preparing Hicks for release, had to be aborted when Hicks suffered a panic attack, thinking he was back in the hands of the US military, said the Herald. Hicks, a convert to Islam who later abandoned the faith, was captured in Afghanistan in late 2001. He spent five years in Guantanamo before becoming the first person to be sentenced under the alternate war crimes tribunals created by the Bush administration to try non-American captives. The former kangaroo skinner admitted training with al Qaeda and meeting Osama bin Laden, who he described as "lovely", according to police evidence given to the court. When Hicks does walk free from jail he will be subjected to a strict control order, which includes a midnight-to-dawn curfew, and he will not be allowed to leave Australia. Under a plea bargain with US military authorities, Hicks agreed to a gag order barring him from talking about his experiences for a year, ending on March 26, while any money offered for interviews could be confiscated under Australian law
