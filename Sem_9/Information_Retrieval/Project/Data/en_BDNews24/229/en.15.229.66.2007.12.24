 Gaza, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel launched an air strike in the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing two Hamas militants and wounding two, the Palestinian Islamist group and medical staff said. Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in June when it routed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's forces, said the four men were travelling in a car near the border fence with Israel close to the al-Bureij refugee camp when the attack occurred. An Israeli army spokesman said he was checking the report. Israel has killed more than 20 militants in the past two weeks in increased military action in the coastal territory. The Jewish state carries out frequent raids into Gaza to try and stop militants from firing rockets at southern Israeli towns
