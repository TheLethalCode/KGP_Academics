<TITLE> Naomi Campbell visits workers' homes on Cuba trip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CIENFUEGOS, Cuba, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supermodel Naomi Campbell, in Cuba seeking an interview with Fidel Castro in her new role as political reporter, visited homes donated by Venezuela to Cuban workers on Friday. The catwalk queen has been commissioned by Britain's GQ magazine to interview high-profile political figures. Her editors believe few if any will turn her away. Campbell has already landed an interview with Venezuela's leftist President Hugo Chavez. But it is not clear if she will get to see reclusive Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has not appeared in public since mid-2006 after undergoing stomach surgery. Chavez, who looks to Castro as his ideological mentor, might be able to help her. He hosted a Caribbean energy summit in Cienfuegos on Friday and reopened a Soviet-built oil refinery that was refurbished by Venezuela. The Venezuelan president also donated three-bedroom, furnished bungalows to 100 families of Cuban workers that Campbell visited.
