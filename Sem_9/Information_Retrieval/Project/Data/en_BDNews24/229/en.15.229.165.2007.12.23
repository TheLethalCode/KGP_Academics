 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)Government offices, banks and courts reopened Sunday after a three-day Eid break. Some private businesses in the financial district of Motijheel also reopened. Full story But the hiatus was not quite over. Attendance at offices was thin as many are enjoying prolonged holidays in addition to the Eid vacation. As hundreds of thousands of vacationers had battled traffic chaos to leave the capital in the days leading up to the Eid, it seemed they were in no hurry to return Sunday as Dhaka city enjoyed another day of relative calm. The banks that have reopened however are likely to see brisk activities after the three-day closure, bankers said. Muslims in the country celebrated their second biggest religious festival, Eid-ul-Azha, Friday with the country's largest Eid congregation taking place at Sholakia in Kishoreganj in the morning. In the capital, the Dhaka City Corporation arranged 360 Eid prayer congregations or jamaats in the city's 90 wards Friday morning. The main congregation was held at the National Eidgah at 8:00am. Senior Pesh imam mufti Mohammad Nuruddin of the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque led the prayers. President Iajuddin Ahmed, speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka were among who joined the prayers. Meanwhile, it was the second Eid behind bars for former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. Relatives visited the chiefs of the two major political parties in special jail Friday, lawyers said. Hasina was visited by husband Wazed Miah and aunt Zebunnesa who brought her home-cooked food Friday afternoon. As many as 12 people sought permission from authorities for a visit to the Awami League chief, but only two were allowed in. Tarique Rahman's wife Zubaida Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco's wife Sharmila Rahman and daughters visited Khaleda in special prison at the Sangsad Bhaban. Earlier in the day, more than 50 BNP leaders and workers led by the party's joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy came to the police checkpoint near the special jail with flowers and other gifts for Khaleda. This year's celebrations were largely subdued in the cyclone-hit southern regions. As in much of the south that was battered by Sidr on Nov 15, the people of Sharankhola in Bagerhatone of the worst-hit areas in Bangladeshbegan a sombre Eid day with prayers for their loved ones, who died or went missing during the cyclone. Few were able to sacrifice any animal for Eid-ul Azha this year. UP chairman Anwar Hossain Ponchaet said not a single family sacrificed cattle in the village. They started their Eid day with Gayebana Janaza prayers for their dead relatives in the local Tafalbari mosque. Shadows of sadness lingered over the family of Khalek Hawladar of Uttar Southkhali village. Khalek lost his two daughters Mina and Mukta in the cyclone. Only Mukta's body was recovered for burial after the storm. He and his wife Buli Akhter are still mourning their loss. "Here Eid is not a joyful event this year. I sacrificed four cows last year, but this year I couldn't afford to give any sacrifice," said Khalek. bdnews24.co
