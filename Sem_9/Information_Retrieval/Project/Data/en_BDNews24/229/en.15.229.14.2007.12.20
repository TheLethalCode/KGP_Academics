 TOKYO, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has got his priorities right despite coming under fire for seeming to play down public fears over a pensions fiasco affecting millions of voters, a senior party colleague says. Fukuda has extended the parliamentary session to January to push through a bill allowing Japan to resume marine refuelling in support of U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan, in the face of stalling by the powerful opposition. But polls show voters are much more concerned about the crisis in the national pension system. The government has admitted that it might never be able to sort out some of the 50 million public pension accounts found to have been mishandled. Voter outrage over the scandal was a big factor in the huge losses suffered by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in July Upper House polls. Fukuda himself provoked public anger last week when he said that an LDP election flyer pledging to resolve the crisis by next March did not constitute a "public promise". Yuriko Koike, a high-profile former environment and defence minister often tipped to become Japan's first woman prime minister, defended Fukuda's priorities in an interview on Thursday. "Unfortunately defence issues are often invisible, especially when it comes to deterrence," Koike said. "Rather than waiting for something to happen and then taking responsibility, it is better to do something in advance." A fluent Arabic-speaker who graduated from Cairo University, Koike said that her frequent visits to the Middle East had shown her that Japan's presence in the region was welcomed. "What Japan can do under its constitution is limited, so I think we are duty bound to do what we can, rather than saying it is nothing to do with us," she said. Former television presenter Koike, 55, stepped down as defence minister in August after less than two months in the post, following a public row over her attempt to replace the ministry's long-serving top bureaucrat, Takemasa Moriya. APPARENTLY VINDICATED Her personnel decisions were apparently vindicated in November, when Moriya was arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes, including hundreds of expensive golf trips, from a defence contractor over a period of years. "The problem had come up at the Defence Ministry in the past, but I had no idea how far Mr Moriya was involved," Koike said of the scandal, which has dragged on for months. Though not directly attributable to Fukuda, scandals over corruption and mismanagement, also including the treatment of thousands of people infected with hepatitis C via tainted blood products, could sink his administration, analysts say. "None of these problems can be resolved by the Fukuda cabinet," said political analyst Minoru Morita. "It's only a matter of time before he is forced to resign or call an election," he added. Like his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, Fukuda, the son of a former prime minister, is seen by some as ill-equipped to understand the concerns of ordinary Japanese. "This is basically what you get if you have a prime minister who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth," said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Tokyo's Sophia University. "I quite simply think he doesn't understand what it means not to have a pension." Koike, whose high profile at home and abroad has led to speculation that she could stand for prime minister, said she was not sure of her own chances at the top job but did not want to see Fukuda replaced. "He will just have to overcome these problems," Koike said, adding that she thought he should stay in offi
