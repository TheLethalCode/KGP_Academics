 LONDON, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Private investors are sitting on the sidelines of the stock market but are holding their nerve, despite volatility, research shows. Shareholders invested a mere net 36 million pounds in October and November, after taking advantage of stock market weakness in August and September to buy back into equities to the tune of 1 billion pounds, according to Capita Registrars.

Cyclical stocks came into vogue during the period, while defensive sectors fell firmly out of favour.

The research is based on the trading activity of more than 1.6 million private investors, and the figures for October and November are based on over 120,000 separate trad
