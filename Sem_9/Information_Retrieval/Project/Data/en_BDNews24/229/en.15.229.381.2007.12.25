<TITLE> Merrill Lynch to raise $6.2bn from investors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tim McLaughlin NEW YORK, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Merrill Lynch, hit by huge subprime mortgage losses, said on Monday it would boost its capital by selling up to $6.2 billion worth of discounted new stock to Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Davis Selected Advisers. The investors will buy Merrill stock at $48 a share, a nearly 14 percent discount to Friday's closing price of $55.54. Merrill shares rose as much as 5 percent but then slid into negative territory, down 27 cents at $55.27, when the discounted stock terms were disclosed. Temasek will buy $4.4 billion worth of Merrill stock with an option for $600 million more by March 28. Davis Selected Advisers, a U.S.-based asset manager that also runs mutual funds, will buy $1.2 billion worth of Merrill shares. The deal's announcement likely is a prelude to another large write-down for Merrill Lynch in the fourth quarter. Some analysts estimate the hit will be bigger than the $8.4 billion write-down Merrill recorded in the third quarter. Merrill Chief Executive John Thain, on the job less than a month, but has been quick to bolster the brokerage's sagging balance sheet. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would sell most of its middle-market lending business to General Electric's commercial finance arm to free up $1.3 billion in capital. Merrill Lynch is the latest in a growing number of Wall Street firms to receive cash from sovereign wealth funds. Temasek is an investment vehicle for Singapore. Morgan Stanley said it would receive $5 billion from China after recording $9.4 billion of write-downs. Citigroup last month agreed to sell up to 4.9 percent stake to Abu Dhabi for $7.5 billion, while UBS accepted a $9.75 billion investment from a separate Singapore state fund. Merrill Lynch described the investments by Temasek and Davis as passive and said neither company will have a role in its governance. Capital infusions from the issue of new shares can reduce the value of existing shareholders' investments, but analysts say it's better than having a weak balance sheet as more mortgage-related losses loom. Merrill reported 855.4 million shares outstanding at the end of September. The shares issued for Temasek and Davis would boost that number by about 129 million, or about 15 percent. "It's very positive that Merrill Lynch is taking the steps that it needs to shore up its balance sheet," said Sean Egan, managing director of independent credit-rating firm Egan-Jones Ratings Inc. Marshall Front, chairman of Chicago's Front Barnett Associates, which has $700 million of assets under management, also applauded Merrill's move. "Historically the Fed has been the lender of last resort. Now the lenders of last resort are these sovereign entities," Front said. "And it's great."
