 Tashkent, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uzbekistan voted on Sunday in an election expected to extend President Islam Karimov's 18-year rule and condemned by the opposition as a Soviet-style one-man contest. Lying on the ancient Silk Road route linking Asia and Europe, the Muslim state is at the heart of a geopolitical power struggle between the West and Russia, which still sees former Soviet Central Asia as its traditional sphere of interest. Karimov's ties with the West have been strained since he was condemned by the United States and Europe in 2005 when troops opened fire on a protest in the Uzbek town of Andizhan. He looked relaxed as he cast his ballot at a polling station in the capital Tashkent. Western media were not allowed in. "I believe people know what they are voting for -- for tomorrow, for peace in our country, for our country's development and prosperity," he said in brief televised remarks. Karimov, who turns 70 in January, tolerates little dissent in his ex-Soviet nation and public criticism of him is taboo. He faces three other candidates in a line-up analysts say is designed to give the election a veneer of a democratic vote. Most voters expressed apathy and lack of interest as voting continued between 6 a.m. (0100 GMT) and 8 p.m. (1500 GMT) across a land stretching from western deserts near the Aral Sea to the fertile plains of the Ferghana valley. "I didn't go. What kind of election is this?" said one 50-year-old Tashkent resident called Bakhrom. "I don't expect anything from this election." Another man who asked not to be named, said: "It's more like a monarchy. We've been ruled by the same person for almost 20 years. Some people say they are running out of patience." But in the old part of Tashkent, its narrow streets lined with mud-brick huts and mosques, people said they voted for Karimov. Wrapped in traditional Uzbek dress against the frost, many cast their ballots on the way home from morning prayers. TRANSPARENT VOTE Karimov, who won the previous election in 2000 with 92 percent of the ballot, has vowed to hold a transparent vote and bring more democracy if re-elected. Reuters reporters witnessed cases of multiple voting by one person at three polling stations in Tashkent. Local election officials declined to comment. The central election commission declared the vote valid after seven hours of voting. A handful of opposition politicians left in Uzbekistan, where many people live in grinding poverty despite large natural gas and gold reserves, have cried foul ahead of the vote. "We live in an ugly and amoral regime which admits no human values," said Nigara Khidoyatova, head of the unregistered opposition Ozod Dekhkonlar party. "The election ... is just a show for Western nations." In Andizhan, witnesses said hundreds of people were killed when troops opened fire on a demonstration. Karimov blamed the unrest on Islamist rebels and the government put the death toll at 187, saying most of them were terrorists or security forces. The other candidates are Dilorom Tashmukhamedova from the Adolat party, Asliddin Rustamov from the People's Democratic party, and Akmal Saidov, a parliamentary deputy. The election monitoring arm of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has sent a small monitoring mission. Uzbekistan has never held an election judged free and fair by Western monitors. "I do not need this spectacle," said Shavkat, an unemployed 36-year-old man. "Nothing is going to change. Karimov will stick to his policies and continue to rob his people.
