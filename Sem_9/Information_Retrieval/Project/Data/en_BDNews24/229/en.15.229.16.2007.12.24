<TEXT>
 KUWAIT, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Kuwaiti Islamist lawmaker presented a request on Monday to question the Gulf Arab state's only woman minister, a liberal who has been under hardline fire for refusing to wear a head scarf. Saad al-Sharie said in the request that financial and administrative irregularities at the education ministry had raised questions about Nouriya al-Subaih's ability to head the ministry. He also accused Subaih of negligence citing a sexual attack on three boys at a primary school earlier this month by Asian labourers. Pressure had been mounting on Subaih after her ministry first denied the incident. Liberal politicians and women rights activists have dismissed the accusations against Subaih. "She is a woman and a strong woman with clear plans to reform the educational system. Some Islamists don't like this," said women rights activist Nabila al-Anjeri. Political analyst Ali al-Baghli, a former oil minister, agreed: "The grilling is personal because she is a woman and wears no veil. But she's one of the most capable ministers and if she resigns this would be a setback for the reform plans." Subaih's only woman colleague in the cabinet, Massouma al-Mubarak, stepped down as health minister in August bowing to pressure mainly from Islamist deputies after a hospital fire. Subaih had been under fire from Islamists since her appointment in April when she defied calls by some parliamentarians to cover her hair when taking the oath of office. Many women in Kuwait and other Muslim countries wear head covers in line with Islamic teachings. Women in Kuwait won the right to vote and run for office only in 2005. Parliament, which often challenges the government in a region where ruling families keep tight grip on politics, has been locked in battles with the cabinet for most of the year. The OPEC oil producer has yet to name an oil minister to replace Badr al-Humaidhi who resigned days after his appointment in November under pressure from lawmakers to his appointment. Questioning requests are often attempts to force ministers to resign before a possible no-confidence vote. The cabinet has dodged similar moves by reshuffling portfolios or resigning. Humaidhi was the second oil minister to resign this year after Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah resigned in June to avoid a no-confidence vote following a row with deputies. The cabinet, which took office after the previous line-up resigned in March after another row with parliament, has made little progress in securing the approval of deputies for a series of economic reforms. The ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who has the last say in politics, has repeatedly urged deputies and the government to work together. Baghli said there was a chance the ruler might dissolve the assembly if deputies scheduled a no-confidence vote against Subaih after the questioning. "This parliament has only brought us from crisis to crisis," he sa
