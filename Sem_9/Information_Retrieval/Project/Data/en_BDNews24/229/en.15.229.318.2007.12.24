 Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Ethiopian court on Monday convicted two rights activists, held since a disputed 2005 election, of inciting an uprising against the government. Here is a short chronology of events since that disputed election. April 27, 2005 - Opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) accuses security forces of killing eight of their followers and arresting 240 people during a campaign to frighten supporters ahead of elections. May 14 - Opposition accuses government of trying to rig elections, saying they would reject the results unless the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) stopped harassing and detaining its supporters. May 15 - Third multi-party elections held. The poll was initially regarded as Ethiopia's most open, giving the opposition 172 parliamentary seats, its largest showing in the 547-member assembly. -- But political tensions quickly rose when the opposition alleged vote rigging and 109 CUD MPs boycotted the national assembly in protest over election results that gave Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's ruling party a third term. May 16 - Government bans all demonstrations and public meetings for one month denying opposition accusations of widespread election fraud. Ruling party claimed victory. June 8 - Government confirms eight people are shot dead in violence it said was fomented by opposition. Hospital sources say at least 22 people are killed and more than 100 wounded. June 12 - Police shoot dead newly elected opposition lawmaker Tesfaye Aden Jara in Arsi town, southeast of capital. June 16 - Authorities free 336 prisoners held in crackdown on political unrest. Oct 2 - Main opposition parties call off plans for a three-day strike after Meles agrees to meet with them for talks. Oct 10 - Main opposition coalition boycotts new legislature's first sitting where Meles is re-elected by lawmakers for a third five-year term. Nov 10 - Ethiopia releases 2,417 people arrested during days of unrest which left more than 40 dead. Since June, about 200 people were killed, 800 wounded and 30,000 arrested, according to a later parliamentary inquiry. July 20, 2007 - Ethiopia frees 38 opposition members, including CUD chairman Hailu Shawel four days after they were given jail terms for trying to overthrow the government. -- Eight other defendants receive prison terms from 18 months to 18 years. Rights groups complained it was an attempt to dismantle the CUD after it gained in the 2005 elections. Aug 18 - A court frees 31 CUD members, held since 2005. None of the 31 had convictions. Dec 24 - Last two of 131 defendants originally charged, are convicted as a result of a post-2005 election violen
