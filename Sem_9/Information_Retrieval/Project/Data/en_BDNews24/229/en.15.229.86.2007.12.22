 Jonathan Wright MAKKAH, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi security forces arrested suspected al Qaeda militants planning attacks during the hajj pilgrimage, a Saudi-owned television said on Friday as Muslim pilgrims performed the last rituals in Makkah. Dubai-based Al Arabiya television quoted an unnamed security official as saying the suspects aimed to cause "security confusion" during the annual pilgrimage, in which more than 2 million Muslims were taking part. The suspects were arrested in various cities in the kingdom days before the start of the pilgrimage on Monday, the official was quoted as telling the station. The report did not say how many were being held. One of the world's biggest displays of mass religious devotion, the hajj has been marred in previous years by fires, hotel collapses, clashes between police and protesters and deadly stampedes caused by overcrowding. But as pilgrims drew to the end of their five-day mission on Friday amid strict police controls to avoid crowding, no incidents had been reported this year. A security source told Reuters attacks had not been planned in the holy city of Makkah or in other hajj sites. Pilgrims held a mass farewell visit to the Kaaba, an ancient stone shrine which all Muslims face during their daily prayers. Most of the pilgrims earlier performed their third stoning of walls representing the devil and left the Mina area for nearby Makkah. Those unable to leave by sunset were staying a third night in the area. The ritual passed without incident at the Jamarat, an accident spot during earlier pilgrimages, with its three stone "pillars" now converted into long elliptical walls which can handle a much higher turnover of pilgrims. Since some 362 people were killed in January 2006 in a crush at the Jamarat -- the worst hajj accident in 16 years -- Saudi authorities have completed more than half of a massive infrastructure project which will cost more than $1 billion. Pilgrims can now throw stones on three levels and a fourth is under construction. WARY OF ATTACKS Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter and home to Islam's holiest sites, has been wary of any militant actions. Al Qaeda-linked militants launched a campaign to destabilize the U.S.-allied monarchy in 2003, and Saudi militants opposed to the royal family seized control of Makkah's Grand Mosque in 1979. On Friday, police imposed a strict one-way system to curb crowding and insisted that people leave their bags outside. When pilgrims had thrown their seven pebbles, many shouting: "In the name of God, God is great", police urged them not to linger on the other side. But the traffic was diminishing as the evening approached and the chances of an accident looked slight. The influx had peaked in the afternoon when many pilgrims carried out the ritual, emulating the Prophet Mohammad, who threw his stones at that time. Pilgrims said they were delighted with the arrangements, and to have completed their religious obligations with relative ease. Every Muslim who has the means should complete the hajj at least once. "I feel very comforted, like a new person, and I hope that God will accept my pilgrimage," said Mahdy Abdel Halim, an Egyptian-born engineer from Connecticut doing hajj with three family members. "I feel spiritually at peace and everything went perfectly," said Abdel Karim al-Atawi, a Saudi soldier from the northern town of Tabouk. Mohamed Serajeddin, an Indian engineer living in the eastern Saudi city of Dammam, said no other country could organize such an event, because of the Saudis' experience in crowd control. He said he was at hajj with his mother and father but he had to throw stones for them because they had weak knees and could not face the long walk from the tented encampment. This year more than 1.6 million pilgrims came from abroad. Adding pilgrims from inside the country, the total was well over 2 million, maybe as many as 3 million.
