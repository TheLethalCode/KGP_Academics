<TITLE> Philippine NPA rebels to halt attacks for holidays </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Manila, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Communist rebels in the Philippines said on Sunday they would hold off from attacking military and police on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and also on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Gregorio Rosal, the main spokesman for the New People's Army (NPA), said the informal ceasefire was a tradition and, "in deference to the people's holiday celebrations". The Philippines is a largely Catholic country and the centre of Christianity in Asia. Christmas holidays in the Philippines start with dawn masses from Dec. 16 and end on Jan. 6. Earlier on Sunday, the military said NPA guerrillas had attacked a town hall in the central province of Samar, killing a part-time police man and seizing several assault weapons. The Philippine government declared a 22-day ceasefire with the NPA earlier this month but the rebels refused to recognise it and killed three marines in an ambush in the western province of Palawan on the first day of the ceasefire. The NPA, waging a protracted guerrilla warfare since the late 1960s, are active in 69 of 81 provinces. The conflict has killed about 40,000 people and stunted economic growth in the country. Manila is also battling Muslim insurgents in the south of the archipelago. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has ordered the military to wipe out the communist insurgency before she steps down in 2010. But an internal report seen by Reuters last month said the military was way behind the 2010 goal due to limited success in destroying the firepower of the NPA
