 Algiers, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Allies of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika are urging him to seek a third term, a move watchers of the country's secretive politics say suggests he plans to revise the constitution and extend his rule until 2014. Bouteflika, 70, has emerged as Algeria's most dominant head of state since 1960s military ruler Houari Boumedienne, helping stabilise the country after an undeclared civil war in the 1990s and ending the country's long isolation on the world stage. But the independence war veteran and former foreign minister stands accused by critics of being autocratic, intolerant of dissent and failing to reduce the dominant economic role played by loss-making state-owned banks and enterprises. A flurry of statements from groups linked to his National Liberation Front (FLN) party this month called on him to change the basic law to allow him to seek a fresh mandate when his second and final term expires in April 2009. Supporters say another term would mean continuity for an economic reconstruction push that has seen Bouteflika use windfall oil receipts to build homes, highways, hospitals, schools, airports and universities. Critics say it's time for new thinking, arguing curbs on political life and failure to reform a command economy have deepened a social malaise that analysts say helps al Qaeda recruit men for infrequent but devastating suicide attacks. "We are urging him to go for a third term," Bouteflika ally Prime Minister Abdelkaziz Belkhadem said recently of the 2009 polls, echoing calls by the big General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) labour federation, the National Union of Algerian Peasants (UNPA) and the National Union of Algeria Youth. The three bodies have set up a joint committee to promote a Bouteflika bid for re-election. "UP TO ALGERIANS" Belkhadem says Algeria's constitution is ill-suited to the needs of a society emerging from an armed Islamic insurrection that lasted over a decade and killed up to 200,000 people. The revolt began when the military, fearing an Iranian-style revolution, cancelled 1992 legislative elections that a radical Islamic party was poised to win. Bouteflika stirred speculation of a third term bid when he announced in 2006 that he hoped to hold a referendum on changing the constitution. But in keeping with Algeria's secretive political traditions, he did not spell out what the change would entail, and said nothing of his own future plans. Asked by Spain's El Pais newspaper in March 2007 if he wanted a third term, he replied: "That's up to Algerians." Bouteflika remains a popular figure credited with helping tame the Islamic rebellion and normalising the presidency's ties with the powerful military, which plays a key role under a 15-year-old state of emergency. But democrats say his own autocratic instincts have helped hobble any opening to full pluralism. The Islamic Salvation Front, the main vehicle of Islamists' ambitions in 1992, remains banned. Algerians say many of the permitted secular parties are discredited, aloof organisations offering no new ideas to end economic mismanagement and graft. Former Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche, a possible challenger to Bouteflika in 2009, told a public meeting that "amending the constitution is just a way to avoid a debate over democracy". But commentators say a Bouteflika candidacy looks probable. "I don't really see who can say no inside the government coalition. I am almost sure that Bouteflika will be Algeria's next President," said Mahmoud Belhimer, editor at top-selling El Khabar daily. He added: "Is this good for democracy? Not at all.
