 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)A five-member committee has opened a probe into the theft of two rare artefacts, cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri said Sunday, amid a howl of protests by campaigners at the "loss of the national treasures". The committee led by Fakhrul Islam, joint secretary of the civil aviation and tourism ministry, will submit its report in three working days. Two terracotta images of Vishnuone of them a bustwent missing from Zia International Airport, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum, police said. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of the Airport Police Station, told bdnews24.com that two boxes of artefacts and relics went missing from the airport, but one was found later near a pond. The incident came to light Saturday, according to the first information report filed with the Airport Police Station. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Naim Ahmed told reporters that the incident had taken place after the artefacts were handed over to Air France Cargo. The government Friday shipped a second consignment of archaeological relics out of Bangladesh National Museum, en route to Paris. Quadri told bdnews24.com Sunday: "I think the rest (of the artefacts) should not be sent out, unless the issue is resolved." Archaeologists and civil society representatives vented anger at the loss of the "precious artefacts" that weigh 64kg together. Reacting instantly to the incident, Professor Shah Sufi Mostafizur Rahman, chairman of the Department of Archaeology at Jahangirnagar University, said: "We are sad to learn about the loss of the artefacts." "Many set their greedy eyes on our archaeological treasures because of their historical values. But we don't know the culprits, who must be influential." The shipment of the relics ran into legal snags after an archaeological researcher, Nurul Islam, petitioned to the High Court on Dec 6, which, in turn, halted the shipment until Jan 15, 2008. On Dec 13, the court rejected a government appeal to cancel the status quo. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court later put freezes on the High Court order. Barrister Tania Amir, one of the lawyers who dealt with the case at the High Court, said: "We'll go to the French courts of law, if necessary, for this." "Before that, we'll launch a campaign to raise mass awareness in Bangladeshi schools, colleges and other educational institutions on the issue, as these assets belong to them too." Nisar Hossain, a teacher of the Fine Arts Institute, said: "We are deeply concerned." He demanded punishment to the guilty. "The matter was so much discussed in the media that it might so happen. There are so many questions to be answered," he said. "It's difficult to understand how this could happen despite beefed-up security in and around ZIA," Nisar said. The shipment of artefacts and relics by the government drew flak from artists, sculptors and students. Some campaigners locked the gate to the National Museum Friday apparently to stop the government taking the relics from the museum, witnesses said. But the police broke the lock open to allow the courier's trucks in around 3pm. The government had earlier sent off 42 artefacts in 10 cartons on Nov 30. The artefacts from five Bangladesh museums were scheduled to be on display at the exhibition under an agreement signed between the French ambassador to Bangladesh and the cultural affairs secretary. Some 188 items were selected from Dhaka museum and the museums of Paharpur, Mahasthangarh, Mainamati and Barendra for the show. bdnews24.com/
