 Islamabad, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 30 people were killed on Friday in a suspected suicide bombing at a mosque in northwest Pakistan, where a former interior minister was offering Muslim Eid festival prayers, police said. Former interior minister Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, who belonged to President Pervez Musharraf's government, was at the mosque at the time of the attack but it was unclear if he was the target. He said he escaped unharmed but his son was injured. "More than 30 people have been killed in the blast," Feroz Shah, a senior police official at Charsadda district, in North West Frontier Province, told Reuters. "We still don't have an exact figure." The blast happened at Sherpao's home village in Charsadda district. Sherpao had been injured in April in another suicide attack at a public meeting in Charsadda. There have been a rash of suicide attacks blamed on Islamist militants since a military assault on the Red Mosque, a militant stronghold, in Islamabad in July. More than 800 people have been killed in the ensuing violence across the country, with about half of them killed in suicide attacks. Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terrorism, cited growing militancy as a main reasons behind his imposition of emergency rule on Nov. 3. He lifted emergency rule on Dec 15.
