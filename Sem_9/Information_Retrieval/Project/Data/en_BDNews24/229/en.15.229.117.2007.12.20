 CONCORD, N.H., Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama said on Wednesday he would ban all toys made in China after a series of safety scares, and he called for tougher US inspections of Chinese imports. "I would stop the import of all toys from China. Now, I have to say that that's about 80 percent of toys that are being imported right now," the Illinois senator told voters in New Hampshire, which helps kick off the 2008 White House race.

A watchdog group, Public Citizen, said in a report on Wednesday that more than 87 percent of US toys are imported, a dramatic shift from the 1970s when almost 90 percent of them were produced domestically. It blamed a torrent of toy recalls this year in part on US trade agreements encouraging American toymakers to cut costs by shifting production overseas. Obama attributed much of the problem to budget and staff cuts at the US Consumer Product Safety Commission during the Bush administration. "We have just a handful of people who are inspecting all the toys that are flooding into the country," he said.
