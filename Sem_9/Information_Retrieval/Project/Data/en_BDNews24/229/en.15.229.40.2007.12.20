 Prodip Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)Eid travellers battled traffic chaos for a second day on their journeys home. A long stretch of road from Manikganj to Paturia was jammed with heavy traffic Thursday. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded on another exit routethe Dhaka-Maoa Highwayout of the capital. Up to 5,000 passengers were stuck in the traffic gridlock there. The officer in charge of Shibaloy Police Station in Manikganj, Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com that police and local administration were trying to clear the traffic jam that started building up early Wednesday. Meanwhile, Bidduyat Kumar, assistant manager of BIWTC (Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation), told bdnews24.com that ferry services at Paturia and Daulatdia were in operation. Passengers bound for at least 20 districts use the Paturia ferry services. Hafiz Khandaker, bound for Pabna, said: "I started off at 7am by bus. I was stuck in a jam in Manikganj. There was a long line of traffic ahead. I was not sure if I could reach the pier to cross the river." Hafiz said he was forced to walk to the ferry pier. The ferry services at Maoa were stalled due to lack of navigability on the river. BIWTC's deputy manager Shahdat Hossain told bdnews24.com: "We are trying to solve the problem." Hundreds of thousands of vacationers began leaving the capital Wednesday for home amid a huge rush of outbound vehicles ahead of the Eid-ul Azha. Chaos at bus terminals across the city continued through late Wednesday night. Buses, trucks and cars jammed many exit points. A trail of traffic stretched across the city of 10 million people. To reach their homes at lower costs, many boarded trucks, which were returning to districts from Dhaka after offloading cattle and goods. Makeshift cattle markets added extra chaos to the scene, as thousands of city residents gathered there to buy sacrificial animals. bdnews
