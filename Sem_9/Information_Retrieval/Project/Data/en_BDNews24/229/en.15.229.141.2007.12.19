 MADRID, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Valencia president Juan Soler has backed coach Ronald Koeman for omitting midfielder David Albelda and goalkeeper Santiago Canizares, making it clear the duo will be leaving the club. "The technical staff, the coach and sporting director have told the president it is vital to leave Canizares and Albelda out of the team," vice president Enrique Lucas told the club's Web site (www.valenciacf.es) on Wednesday. "The president has accepted the coach's decision in the understanding that everyone's professional life comes to an end." Canizares and Albelda, who between them have won 95 caps for Spain, had been left out of the squad to face Real Union in the King's Cup on Wednesday. The 38-year-old Canizares has been with Valencia since 1998 while the 30-year-old Albelda graduated from the youth system. "Santi and David have been two important players in the history of this club," added Lucas. "It is a painful decision and the president has been very hurt by it." Koeman, who took charge last month, decided to omit the duo after a run of poor results. "Valencia is a ship and those who don't want to be on board will be out," said the Dutchman on Tuesday. ARAGONES CONCERN Spain coach Luis Aragones said he was concerned the upheavals at Valencia, who provide more players for the national side than any other club, could have a negative impact on his team's Euro 2008 preparations. "I'm worried the (Valencia) players are having problems and aren't in such good form as in recent months," Aragones told the sports daily AS. "I don't want to interfere with internal matters in a club or with the decisions made by a coach but I need to be aware of what is happening in the teams who provide players for the national side." Aragones said Albelda, who has 50 caps, remained an important player for Spain. "Albelda has always performed well for the national side and has played a defensive role in midfield that has always been important for the team," he said. Valencia team mates David Villa, Fernando Morientes, David Silva, Miguel Angulo, Joaquin, Carlos Marchena and Raul Albiol have also featured in recent Spain squads. Koeman's team are seventh in the Primera Liga, 13 points behind leaders Real Madrid
