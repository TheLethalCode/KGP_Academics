<TITLE> India's Congress looks for cover after state poll loss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stung by its big loss to the Hindu nationalists in a key state vote, India's ruling Congress party is expected to switch to damage-control and populism ahead of national elections due in 2009. That could mean dumping a historic nuclear deal with the United States, delaying a much-needed increase in fuel prices and presenting a budget filled with sops to woo voters and cement ties with coalition allies, analysts said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose reformist agenda had already been sidelined by pressure from the government's communist allies, will be further weakened, with his party more worried about returning to power than running the country. "There is only one way to describe this and that is, it is a big setback for Congress," said N Bhaskara Rao, a political analyst at New Delhi's Centre for Media Studies. "It is a setback to the nuclear deal as the prime minister's hand is much weaker." "They will reconsider their priorities, there will be realignment in terms of coming closer to their allies and it will rain sops to catch voters," he said. With a series of state elections due next year, Rao said the country would be "constantly in election mode". Congress, which came to power federally in 2004, had not been expected to easily wrest control of the western state of Gujarat from the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which considers it a stronghold. But the party had hoped for an upset win -- or at least a strong enough showing to boost morale. THE RACE FOR 2009 STARTS IN EARNEST A good performance, some party leaders hoped, would give Singh the platform to push the nuclear deal through despite opposition from the communists, even if that meant an early general election. But Sunday's results from Gujarat have dashed those hopes. Congress is also expected to lose power to the BJP in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which also voted this month, with results due on Dec. 28. Besides, with at least 10 states due to elect new assemblies next year, the party's hands seem tied, one senior Congress leader, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. "I think you can safely rule out early elections now and we will focus on building and strengthening our alliances until 2009," he said. The BJP won in Gujarat on a platform which combined development and growth with aggressive Hindu nationalism, pushed by a charismatic leader who is blamed for encouraging the killing of hundreds of Muslims during riots in 2002. The party hopes its convincing victory in one of India's most communally divided states will give it fresh momentum to push for a national victory in 2009. But with Indian politics increasingly revolving around regional issues, the Gujarat formula might not work for the BJP elsewhere in the country, political analysts said. DEATH OF THE DEAL Meanwhile Congress and the communists will likely try and present a more united front again by 2009, if only because they see the BJP as their common enemy. And although the battle for 2009 is now expected to start in earnest, it could be a roller coaster ride, with the BJP forecast to take a few knocks in state assembly elections next year where it is in power. Relations between Congress and the left have been long been strained over proposals to liberalise the economy but have become increasingly ill-tempered over the nuclear deal. The communists say the deal compromises India's sovereignty and imposes American hegemony and have threatened to pull the plug on the government if it goes ahead. With Congress on the backfoot, it is not expected to have the stomach for a fight over the issue, said Mahesh Rangarajan, a political analyst who teaches at Delhi University. "The deal is over," he said. "And once that is over, the Congress and the communists will come together and the government will be stable." "But the government will just hobble along, the next budget will be a total give-away budget, and the window for early elections are close
