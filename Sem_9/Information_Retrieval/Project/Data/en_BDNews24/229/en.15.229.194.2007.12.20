<TITLE> Pele not surprised by England's choice of Capello </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pele is not surprised England have again opted for a foreign coach although he said it would have once been unthinkable for some of his former adversaries. Italian Fabio Capello was confirmed as England's second foreign coach this week after replacing Steve McClaren who was sacked last month. McClaren took over from Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson after the 2006 World Cup finals. "A long time ago I used to talk to my English friends like Bobby (Charlton) and they could not accept the idea of a foreign coach," the Brazilian said at the launch of a collection of medals portraying his 1,283 goals. Each will be auctioned to raise money for Goals for Life, a project raising funds for a Brazilian children's hospital. "But there was one with Eriksson and now there's another and England also tried to get (Luiz Felipe) Scolari two years ago don't forget. Capello is a very good coach and very experienced so let's see if he can win something for England." Pele said he could not imagine a foreign coach in charge of the Brazil national team. "It's very different," he said. "Maybe an Argentine because it's so close but I think it would be very difficult for a foreign cosch in Brazil." Asked why England cannot find a homegrown coach to entrust with the national team, Pele said there was probably not enough faith in home coaches. "I'm sure there are good young coaches in England," he said. "But I'm not surprised they don't get the job because you have to answer to the public and maybe they are not famous enough or don't have enough experience." Pele said he was a big fan of the English Premier League but said just because it was the "strongest league in the world" it was no guarantee of success on the international stage. "Look at Holland when they reached two World Cup finals but their league was not the strongest," he said. "Then look at Spain, they have great teams but don't do very well at the big tournaments. "I think with England and Germany the big problem is bringing through young players. In Germany they haven't had a good young player come through for 15 years while in England the base is not very good.
