<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luxury jeweller Van Cleef and Arpels has sued German supermodel and television star Heidi Klum's company, claiming she copied a vintage clover jewellery design. The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court on Dec 21, seeks more than $25,000 in damages from Klum's company Heidi Klum GmbH and Mouawad USA, another company she has designed jewellery for. It said both companies attempted to gain benefit from Van Cleef's esteemed reputation by creating and selling a similar clover design from Van Cleef's vintage Alhambra jewellery line. Van Cleef & Arpels Inc is owned by luxury goods group Richemont. Klum is married to British singer Seal and has three children. She hosts the Bravo reality cable television show "Project Runway," which features aspiring designers vying for a chance to get a start in the fashion world. She gained fame in the late 1990s modelling lingerie for retailer Victoria's Secret and swimsuits, most notably on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine's popular swimsuit edition.
