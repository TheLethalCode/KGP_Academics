 SINGAPORE, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rose, with Seoul and Taipei gaining more than 2 percent as strong US consumer spending calmed fears the world's top economy was heading into a recession, while the dollar traded near a six-week high against the yen. Commodity and energy companies, such as Australia's Woodside Petroleum, also firmed after copper rose and gold and oil held recent gains. European markets were expected to open higher, with financial bookmakers calling Britain's FTSE 100 up 13-15 points, Germany's DAX up 26-30 points and France's CAC down 5 to up 24 points. Trading activity was slowing as investors took off for the Christmas holidays. Australia's market closed early on Monday, while Japanese financial markets were shut for the Emperor's birthday, but reopen on Tuesday. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 1.9 percent by 0558 GMT, taking its cue from an explosive rally on Wall Street on Friday. The index is about 11 percent below its Nov. 1 record high, but is still up about 32 percent as the year draws to a close. The gain is more than three times that for the MSCI All-Country World Index so far this year. In Asia, equity investors snapped up banks and technology shares, such as LG Electronics Inc, heartened by a string of strong earnings reports from U.S. bellwethers, including results on Friday from the firm behind the BlackBerry. Investors also cheered data showing U.S. personal spending jumped more than expected in November, suggesting consumers have not been discouraged by signs of a slowdown as the subprime mortgage crisis spreads. The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 2.2 percent -- its biggest daily gain in a month -- helped by strength in technology stocks such as Samsung Electronics "Fears of a U.S. economic recession are easing after strong earnings reports from U.S. technology bellwethers, bullish consumer spending data and a series of investments in global banks by sovereign funds," said Lee Sun-yup, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1 percent, while Taiwan's TAIEX gained 2 percent. Financial stocks -- among the worst affected by the last five months of credit market turmoil -- continued to draw strength from a report that Singapore state investor Temasek may invest $5 billion in Merrill Lynch Investors, cheered by the recent string of sovereign fund investments in the battered U.S. banking sector, took in their stride news late on Friday that U.S. investment banks were abandoning a plan to bail out structured investment vehicles after Citigroup and others launched independent rescues. But some cautioned that the mood will remain cautious in the New Year, with worries about the higher cost of credit making companies more wary. "Things will be tougher because of the tightening in the credit markets. A lot of companies which have enjoyed great times and have lifted their gearing will be more cautious," said Constellation Capital Management head of research Peter Vann. As concerns about risk receded, investors again sold the low-yielding yen and bought higher yielding currencies in carry trades. By 0609 GMT, the dollar traded at 114.05 yen having risen to a 1-1/2-month peak of 114.16 yen in New York on Friday. The dollar was at 1.4384 against the euro. Oil eased in thin Asian trade but stayed above $93 a barrel, with US light, sweet crude for February delivery holding most of Friday's more than $2 surge, to trade at $93.06 a barr
