 Washington, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States called on all sides on Sunday to respect the outcome of Thailand's first parliamentary elections since a September 2006 coup prompted Washington to suspend millions of dollars in aid. Washington welcomed what it called initial reports the vote had been free and fair, said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. The party backing exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the People Power Party, declared victory in the poll and said it would seek to form a coalition government. "We call on all sides to respect the results, and for a fair and transparent process for the adjudication of any disputes or fraud claims," McCormack said in a statement. A spokesman for President George W Bush had said on Friday the United States eagerly awaits the return of democracy in Thailand "so that we may resume our close and abiding relationship with this important ally." Under a US law that curbs aid after an elected leader is deposed by a military coup, Bush suspended about $24 million in assistance to Thailand, including funds designed to promote military professionalism. "The United States welcomes initial reports indicating that Thailand's parliamentary election today was conducted in a free and fair manner and congratulates the people of Thailand on taking this crucial step toward a return to elected government," McCormack said. "The United States looks forward to engaging seriously across a range of issues with an elected Thai government," he added
