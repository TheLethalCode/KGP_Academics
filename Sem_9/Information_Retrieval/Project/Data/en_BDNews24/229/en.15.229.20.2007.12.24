 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  BTTB is thinking of allowing subscribers to pay bills in advance, the state-owned telecoms operator's chief said Monday. It also plans to let the subscribers know their latest phone bills anytime, DM Moudud Chowdhury, acting chairman of Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, told bdnews24.com. "The bill forms will be available on the internet," he said. Chowdhury said steps would be taken to remove hassles for the customers to pay the bills. The BTTB does not charge late-pay fees, said Chowdhury, who was promoted to the top office on Dec 19. He said talks were on with the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh for an alternative line to the optical fibre link that connects Dhaka with the submarine cable landing station in Cox's Bazar. He said law-enforcement agencies had been asked to secure the optical fibre cable. bdnews
