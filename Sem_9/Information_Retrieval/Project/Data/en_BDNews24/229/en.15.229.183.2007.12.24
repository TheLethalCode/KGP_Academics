<TITLE> Thailand, Indonesia to host 2008 ASEAN championships </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia and Thailand have been picked to jointly host next year's ASEAN soccer championships, the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) said on Monday. The two countries were chosen ahead of Vietnam to stage the biennial Southeast Asian tournament following the withdrawal of Malaysia and Myanmar. Formerly known as the Tiger Cup, the tournament will take place in December next year. "A secret ballot took place to decide the two hosts. Thailand and Indonesia won outright," Yap Nyim Keong, executive secretary of the AFF, told Reuters. "However, a decision on who should host has rarely been a matter for competitive bidding in the AFF. Hosts are chosen more by consensus." Military-ruled Myanmar were next in rotation to host the tournament but withdrew amid security concerns about the junta's brutal crackdown on monk-led protests in August. Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam will automatically qualify for the eight-nation contest. The region's five lowest-ranked teams -- Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, East Timor and Brunei -- will take part in qualifying tournament in Cambodia in October to decide the remaining two places. Thailand and Singapore are the only countries to have won the ASEAN championship, famed for comedy as much as controversy. When Thailand and Indonesia played each other in 1998, to avoid a semi-final with Vietnam, both teams desperately tried to lose the match and ended up defending each others' goals
