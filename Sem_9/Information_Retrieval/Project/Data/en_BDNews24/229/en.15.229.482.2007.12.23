 Des Moines, Iowa, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani, a survivor of prostate cancer, tried to allay concerns about his health on Sunday after a hospital stay he attributed to a painful headache. His staff originally said the former New York mayor had flu-like symptoms when he ordered his plane back to St. Louis last week but he cited a "headache worse than I've ever had." Giuliani, 63, was released from hospital on Thursday after an overnight stay just weeks before Jan. 3, when Iowa kicks off the state-by-state battles to nominate the Republican and Democratic candidates who will run for president in the November 2008 election. "I feel great now, I feel terrific. I've been tested out, everything came back 100 percent," Giuliani said in a taped interview with ABC News' "This Week" program. He said he did not black out and that the plane's cabin pressure had made his pain worse. Giuliani, who was back on the campaign trail on Sunday in New Hampshire, said his doctor would address the episode sometime after Christmas. "There's always the issue of cancer, so I'm going to have him put out a statement and then, you know, make everyone really comfortable that I'm OK," Giuliani said. "But they tell me I'm in very good health." Giuliani dropped out of the 2000 Senate race in New York against Hillary Clinton, then the first lady and now a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, because of his battle with prostate cancer. Giuliani insisted he was clear of cancer. In New Hampshire, whose primary vote comes five days after the Iowa caucuses, Giuliani is fighting to keep up with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who received important newspaper endorsements in the last week that invigorated his campaign. Giuliani has trailed in opinion polls in Iowa and New Hampshire -- whose early contests can give a crucial boost to presidential candidates -- but has led national surveys of Republican voters. CLINTON IN SNOWY IOWA Clinton, who won the 2000 New York Senate race and was re-elected to the Senate last year, flew from New Hampshire to Iowa in a snowstorm to make a last pitch to voters before taking two days off for Christmas. She was to join her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for a church service before they campaigned separately throughout the state. Clinton, who has comfortably led her Democratic rivals in national polls, has been in a dead heat in Iowa and New Hampshire against Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards has been a close third. Obama was campaigning in western Iowa on Sunday, while Edwards left for North Carolina to begin his Christmas break
