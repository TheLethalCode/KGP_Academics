<TITLE> France calls artefact theft a conspiracy or petty crime </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)France Monday said the theft of two rare artefacts from Zia International Airport was a conspiracy by a nexus of people or a petty crime. France also said the motive of the theft was to "embarrass France and Bangladesh". "France feels the disappearance of this crate is highly suspicious and could also be the result of a conspiracy by a very small nexus of persons to embarrass France and Bangladesh," the French embassy in Dhaka said in a statement. The statement came as the police alleged that the artefacts went missing after they were handed over to Air France officials at ZIA. "Although the inquiries are ongoing, the possibility of a mere theft by petty criminals cannot be discounted," the statement said. The exhibition of the artefacts at Guimet Museum in Paris was opposed by some campaigners in Bangladesh. "It is time for the few opponents to this event to recognise they are a tiny minority and act accordingly," it said. "Indeed, if the consignment had left on time, and without the very professional attitude of the Bangladeshi courier, the disappearance would have been noted only in Paris, with the corresponding accusations been directed against the French Republic by a small but vocal group of persons." "France condemns such acts in the strongest term," it said. The statement said the crates were left unattended on ZIA's tarmac "where neither the lending nor the borrowing institutions have any control". France also praised the government steps to recover the missing artefacts and hoped that the perpetrators would be found out and brought to book. On Dec 22, two Vishnu statues went missing from ZIA prior to the dispatch of the original artefacts from Dhaka to Paris by an Air France Cargo flight. Some campaigners in Bangladesh have been opposing the government decision of sending the artefacts to the French capital for exhibition. The protesters staged demonstrations against the government decision. bdn
