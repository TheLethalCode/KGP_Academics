 TUNCELI, Turkey, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish warplanes bombed important Kurdish guerrilla targets in northern Iraq on Saturday in a new cross-border offensive, the General Staff said. The Turkish military said the offensive against outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas inside Turkey and across the border in northern Iraq would continue. "Turkish Air Force warplanes struck important targets of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL terror group in northern Iraq ... between the hours of 14:25-15:00," the General Staff statement, posted on its website, said. The military said Turkish warplanes returned safely to bases. It said it was too early to give any casualty figures. Iraqi Kurdish security forces said they had suffered no casualties in the bombing. "The aerial bombardment didn't result in any people killed because the area is almost deserted because of fear of aerial and mortar attacks from the Turkish side," Jabbar Yawer, spokesman for Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga security forces, said. The Turkish military said its ground forces fired on the same targets a few hours later. Turkey has stepped up its offensive against Kurdish guerrillas based in northern Iraq this month, launching two offensives, one involving 50 fighter jets and the other several hundred ground troops. Turkey says it has a right to use force to combat separatist rebels who shelter in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq but the United States and the European Union fear a further escalation in tension could destabilise the region.
