<TITLE> South Korea's next leader faces economic challenges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean president elect Lee Myung-bak will struggle to fulfil his promise to revitalise the economy as emerging Asian rivals steal manufacturing jobs and markets in the developed world are buffeted by credit problems. Growth has averaged just over 4 percent a year over the past five years -- not bad for one of Asia's wealthiest economies, but far short of the expectations of South Koreans used to more than 7 percent for decades. Analysts say Lee must, as a priority, chart a long-term growth strategy for the country, strive to create better-quality jobs, bridge the divide between rich and poor, and develop service sectors that have been neglected by his predecessors. South Koreans are particularly nervous over whether their economy, Asia's fourth-largest, can pick up at a time when fast-growing countries with low labour costs such as China and India are taking over the production of a variety of goods. "(Korean companies) face the prospect of having to run just to stay still in an increasingly competitive and globalised manufacturing industry. These developments will pose challenges for Korea going forward," said Daniel Melser, an economist at Moody's Economy.com in Sydney. "With the country now wealthier, and the economy bigger and more diverse, just growing exports won't be enough. A greater focus will be required on the domestic economy and in particular on productivity in the services sector." In Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motor and POSCO, South Korea boasts leading brands for computer chips, mobile phones, flat screens, cars and steel products, but it has nothing to compare with them in financial and business services. QUALITY JOBS NEEDED South Korea's unemployment rate stands just above 3 percent, among the lowest in the world, but the quality of jobs has deteriorated, with fewer people than in the past lucky enough to have full-time positions. "Also the unemployment rate is low because Koreans opted to drop out of the labour force for want of adequate jobs," said Frederic Newmann, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. "The incoming administration should focus its energy on liberalising the labour market, strengthen vocational training, and provide incentives to employers to hire more aggressively." Foreign companies have urged South Korea to make the labour market less rigid, so that employers can hire workers and lay them off more easily when business conditions deteriorate. Lee may find it hard to reconcile the conflicting demands of companies needing flexibility and workers craving security. People are increasingly worried as employers become reluctant to hire full-time, permanent workers as they try to compete with countries flush with cheap labour such as China and India. Government data shows almost 9 percent of those in employment worked for 30 hours or less per week last year, up from about 7 percent five years earlier and about 4 percent 10 years before. Economists argue that removing regulations in financial and other service sectors and making the labour market more flexible will help South Korea become a more mature economy, with strong domestic demand offering a foundation for sustained growth. "There are many issues which haven't progressed much during President Roh Moo-hyun's term, such as labour relations, reform of the support for small and medium-sized enterprises, rationalisation of public corporations," said Takahira Ogawa, a director at Standard & Poor's Ratings Service in Singapore. The government's policy on small and medium-sized firms is mostly aimed at ensuring larger manufacturing companies have a secure chain of suppliers at home. Economists say this should change, to focus on helping small firms find their own markets. At the same time, the government should loosen controls in the financial sector, analysts say, allowing financial institutions to innovate with products and accept more risk, and easing a ban on industrial capital holding large stakes in ban
