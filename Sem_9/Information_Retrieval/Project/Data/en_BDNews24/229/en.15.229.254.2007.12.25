<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said on Tuesday he wanted to return to politics after the party he backed emerged from weekend general elections as the largest, then promptly reversed himself. Thaksin told a news conference in Hong Kong he expected to return to Thailand from exile "by April at the latest" and prove himself innocent of corruption charges brought by investigators appointed by the military after the September 2006 coup. Then he said; "I want to go back to politics and go back and live my life as a normal citizen," he said, reversing frequent statements since the bloodless coup that he was finished with politics, comments which few in Thailand believed. However, later in the news conference, Thaksin, who had said in exile his wife would divorce him if he went back into politics, said he was done with politics. "I don't want to go back to politics," he said when asked to clarify his position in view of the earlier statement. "I want to go back to live my life peacefully in Thailand as a normal citizen.
