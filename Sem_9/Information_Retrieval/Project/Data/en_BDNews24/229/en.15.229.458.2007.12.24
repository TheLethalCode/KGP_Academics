<TITLE> The nightmare before Christmas for Ronaldinho, Rijkaard </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho were in the media's crosshairs on Monday after Real Madrid's psychologically crushing 1-0 victory at the Nou Camp sent them seven points clear in the Primera Liga. Brazilian international Julio Baptista scored the game's only goal after 36 minutes as the Spanish champions out-fought and out-thought a Barca side short on confidence and ideas. "Real won through their tactics and physical condition, not because of their superior play," said Barcelona-based daily Sport on Monday, while El Pais talked of Barca being past their sell-by date. After keeping Ronaldinho on the bench for the 3-0 win at Valencia the previous weekend, Rijkaard surprised many by playing the Brazilian from the start. A further change saw Deco, only recently returned from injury, preferred to Eidur Gudjohnsen in midfield despite impressive performances from the Icelander in recent games. Rijkaard's reliance on two players who had helped the side to consecutive league titles in 2005 and 2006 regardless of form drew criticism as they failed to make an impact. "Rijkaard's insistence on always turning to his big name players burdened Barca for the 'clasico'," said sports daily AS. An out-of-shape Ronaldinho was reduced to throwing himself to the floor looking for dead-ball opportunities -- a far cry from the player who had the Bernabeu on their feet applauding when Barca hammered Real 3-0 there in 2005. "This is the Ronaldinho of 2007 -- he wants to but he can't, he tries but it doesn't happen," Sport added. The future of both Ronaldinho and Rijkaard has taken up acres of newspaper space recently, and will continue to do so after this reverse. WHITE CHRISTMAS For Real coach Bernd Schuster it was a relatively smooth first return to a club he represented as a player in charge of their arch-rivals. His side were solid in defence, dominant in midfield and a constant threat on the counter attack as Barca tried to take the game to them. "This game has proved to us that the key is to hold our positions well on the pitch. We are doing phenomenal work in training and slowly getting into the way Schuster wants us to play," said goalkeeper Iker Casillas. "I think it's a style we all enjoy." Spanish media were full of festive references to a "white Christmas" for Real fans. Barcelona-based Mundo Deportivo understandably went for the darker "nightmare before Christmas" with the outlook for their team in the title race looking distinctly bleak
