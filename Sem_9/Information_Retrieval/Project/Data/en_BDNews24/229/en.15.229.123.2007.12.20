 CAPE TOWN, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The political future of Jacob Zuma, the new leader of South Africa's ruling ANC, may hinge on corruption allegations still haunting him. Zuma humiliated party and state President Thabo Mbeki in the leadership contest. The results were announced on Tuesday at a party conference in the northern town of Polokwane. He is almost certain to become South Africa's president in 2009, when Mbeki steps down, because of the ANC's political dominance. Zuma was charged with bribery and fraud in 2005 in connection with a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal. The case was dismissed on a technicality. On Thursday, South Africa's top prosecutor said there is enough evidence to prosecute Zuma on allegations of corruption. Talk Radio 702 reported that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) acting director Mokotedi Mpshe "says a final decision on when to take action against the newly-elected ANC leader is imminent." Last week authorities filed an affidavit to the Constitutional Court containing what they call substantial new evidence that he had received larger illegal payments than originally thought. PROSPECT OF JAIL "In the end, his fate is not only in the hands of the court, but also in the ANC. Before he is convicted I think it's highly unlikely they will act against him, but if he is convicted then all bets are off," said Pierre de Vos, a constitutional law expert at the University of the Western Cape. Zuma, who denies any wrongdoing, says he would only step down if a court found him guilty. His supporters say he is the victim of a political witch-hunt staged by Mbeki's backers. While graft allegations concern South Africans, the case could drag on for years, giving Zuma room to manoeuvre while preparing for office in 2009. Zuma's lawyer, Michael Hulley, was unavailable for immediate comment. De Vos said if Zuma was elected South African president in 2009, he would not automatically lose his position. "While there might be an ethical issue, there is no legal-constitutional impediment to becoming president unless you have been convicted of a crime carrying a sentence longer than one year without the option of a fine," said De Vos. De Vos said a conviction within the next 18 months would carry a mandatory 15-year sentence. Zuma would be "automatically disqualified" from becoming president in that scenario, he said. Either way, it would be a sensitive issue. Zuma was cleared of rape charges in an unrelated case but was tarnished. Zuma's supporters accuse Mbeki of using state institutions to protect allies and purge opponents, allegations he denies. "Taking into account the history of the country, where we've never had a president with a criminal record, in particular corruption, the ANC will have to act and remove him from office. That is, if he is found guilty," said Themba Maseko, a senior law lecturer at the University of South Afri
