<TITLE> Just A Minute With: Francis Ford Coppola on wine and film </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Iain Blair LOS ANGELES, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five-time Oscar winner Francis Ford Coppola, whose work ranges from "The Godfather" to "Apocalypse Now," long ago cemented his place as a master writer and director but in recent years he has also built a reputation as a top California winemaker. Now he's back with his first movie in about eight years, "Youth Without Youth," which stars Tim Roth as a man who grows mysteriously younger after being struck by lightning. Coppola spoke about the film, his love of wine and women: Q: You made "Youth Without Youth" in Romania. I hear the food's not great there, and I assume you enjoy a good meal. A: "I do and it's not great. The only good food there is the Turkish-influenced cuisine. You can go to restaurants and get decent Italian, but the Romanian food I was not nuts about." Q: Are you a good cook? A: "I'm a very good cook. Not that I'm schooled, but I have a good feel for food and I love food and I like to handle it. Now, I have to cook more in a way that's good for me, so I'm becoming more adept at cooking fish. I love to do pasta and all that, but it's not good for me to eat it, so I focus on things that are more healthy. You can't go wrong eating seafood." Q: Have you done better financially in wine than in film? A: "There's no comparison. The wine business is like having a $100 million (box office) hit every year. The wine business is really a business. The film business isn't a business. It's a very screwy arrangement where you do all this work and the money all gets emptied into this hopper called distribution, and then it slowly trickles down. When it gets to the people who actually make the film, there's little left. You can't become really wealthy today in the film business." Q: Would you ever retire from filmmaking? A: "No. I'd retire from all the other stuff before I did that. But making films is a lot of effort and you have to get up so early, and I like to have some fun!" Q: What do you do for fun? A: "I love to read. I have wonderful children I get a big kick out of being with. I now have a beautiful grand-daughter of 21, and one of 1, so there's a big discrepancy. I've been married to the same woman for 45 years." Q: How did you manage that? A: "Probably by taking my family with me every time I went on a location. I didn't want my children not to be with me, even if it meant taking them out of school." Q: What's your biggest vice? A: "Probably eating. I know it's bad for me and I know I'm overweight, but I love to eat and drink wine, though I'm not a big drinker. My life doesn't allow me to be in that kind of life where I could run around with a lot of girls, though I've always been girl-crazy my whole life. Now, they're lower on my priorities." Q: So just how low have women sunk? A: "Well, they used to be the No.1 most beautiful thing. Then after that it was children and so on. Now, they're like No. 4. Women are a dream, they're so interesting." Q: Is it true that you financed "Youth Without Youth" with your wine? A: "Yes, I financed it with my own money, which is only because I have a big wine company." Q: Is it also true that you paid some people with wine? A: "Yes, that's how we did it. At least I gave them something of value. Dollars aren't very valuable anymore." Q: "Youth Without Youth" is your first film in many years. Why wait so long? A: "About 12 years ago, I finally finished paying off all my debts and I was suddenly in a position where I didn't have to just go looking to get jobs, as we all do, and I thought, 'Well, now's the time for me to make the dream project.' But it took time to find the right one.
