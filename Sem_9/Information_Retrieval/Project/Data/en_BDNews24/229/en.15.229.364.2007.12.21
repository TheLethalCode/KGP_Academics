 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  The country's two detained former prime ministers spend another Eid day in jail, with prison authorities having once again arranged a special menu, including rui fish, beef, mutton and chicken. In addition, over the three days of Eid-ul Azha, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia may have food brought to them from home. DIG (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com Thursday that Hasina and Khaleda would start their day with a breakfast of vermicelli and puffed rice. "For lunch they will have rice, rui fish, potatoes and a piece of fruit." "For dinner the menu will offer pilau, beef and mutton. One dessert will also be given." Siddiqui said that prison authorities had asked the two former prime ministers if they had any special food preferences for Eid. "But they did not inform us of any." Siddiqui also said the two VIP prisoners may receive food from home or relatives on this special occasion. However, such food would be checked by the prison authorities before being served to the two former prime ministers in special jail. This is the second Eid that Hasina and Khaleda will be spending behind bars following their arrests on charges of extortion and corruption. The DIG, prisons, said, "All prisoners are receiving an extra ten taka in food for Eid. The allocation for ordinary prisoners will be Tk 39 from the usual Tk 29." Similarly, the VIP prisoners' allocation has been increased from Tk 69 to Tk 79, he added. bdnews24.
