<TITLE> Abid error hands Thailand King's Cup win over Iraq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bizarre own goal seven minutes from time by Iraq's Ahmad Abid gave Thailand a 2-1 victory on Monday and a place in the final of the King's Cup tournament. With the score locked at 1-1, Abid tried to clear a powerful low cross from Narongchai Vachiraban with a spectacular diving header but found his own net instead, handing the Thais a place in the final with one round-robin game remaining. The hosts took the lead on 43 minutes when in-form striker Surayuth Chaikamdee broke free on the right and floated an inch-perfect cross on to the head of the onrushing Nattaporn Phanrit, who buried the ball in the roof of the net. Iraq came back fighting in the second half and took just five minutes to find the equaliser when forward Mubarak Almas brought down a looping cross and beat the Thai keeper from close range. In the earlier game, Kim Kum-il scored an 87th-minute equaliser to earn North Korea a 2-2 draw with Asian Cup quarter-finalists Uzbekistan. The Koreans went ahead just before the break through An Chol-hyok but that lead vanished in the 53rd minute when Pavel Solomin levelled the score. Timur Yafarov put the Uzbeks in front 12 minutes later before the Koreans clawed their way back into the match to share the points with one match remaining. Thai coach Charnwit Polcheewin said luck had been on his side but that his team were also the deserved winners. "This is football, if you cross the ball that hard, it's like a shot and sometimes they go in," Charnwit told reporters. "We made a mistake too, it cost us a goal, so it was a fair outcome." Thailand lead the four-team tournament with six points, followed by Iraq on three, with North Korea and Uzbekistan on a point each
