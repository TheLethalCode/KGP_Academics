<TITLE> Religion, health loom large in US election </TITLE>

 Waterloo, Iowa, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With less than two weeks until Iowa kicks off the US presidential nomination battles, several contenders took their campaigns to church on Sunday and a leading Republican tried to allay concerns about his health. Front-running Democrat Hillary Clinton, a New York senator seeking to be the first female president, won an effusive welcome at a mainly black Baptist church in snowy Waterloo, Iowa, where she criticized the Bush administration for failing to expand health care coverage and alienating foreign allies. "Do we take a leap of faith and once again bind the wounds of those who hurt, create a country that we're proud of, assume the leadership and moral authority of the world that we should or will we continue to just slowly but surely fall backwards?" she said, also touching on the upcoming Christmas holiday. Religion plays a big role in politics in the United States, where levels of belief and church attendance are much higher than in Europe. Other issues weighing on the minds of voters in the run-up to the November 2008 presidential election include health care, immigration, the war in Iraq and a mortgage crisis. Clinton's main rival, Sen. Barack Obama, also toured Iowa, bolstered by a new poll showing him alongside her in New Hampshire -- another early contest in the state-by-state process to nominate both parties' candidates for president. Republican hopeful Rudy Giuliani, a survivor of prostate cancer, returned to the campaign trail in New Hampshire after being hospitalized overnight last week with what he said was a "headache worse than I've ever had." "I feel great now, I feel terrific. I've been tested out, everything came back 100 percent," Giuliani, a former New York mayor, said on ABC News' "This Week" program, adding his doctor would address the episode after Christmas. "There's always the issue of cancer, so I'm going to have him put out a statement and then, you know, make everyone really comfortable that I'm OK." Giuliani's battle with prostate cancer prompted him to drop out of the 2000 Senate race in New York against Clinton. OBAMA SURGES, GIULIANI SLIPS Giuliani, who plays heavily on his leadership in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, has led national polls of Republican voters but trails in New Hampshire and Iowa, which holds the nation's first nomination contest on Jan. 3. In New Hampshire's primary vote on Jan. 8, Giuliani is fighting to keep up with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain of Arizona. A poll published by the Boston Globe on Sunday showed McCain closing on Romney in New Hampshire with support of 25 percent of Republican voters versus Romney's 28 percent. The survey, which had a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points, showed Giuliani slipping from second place in New Hampshire last month into third, with 14 percent support. Among Democrats, Obama -- striving to be the first black U.S. president -- was neck-and-neck with Clinton in New Hampshire, with 30 percent to her 28 percent. That was a big shift from a Globe survey last month when Clinton had a 14-point advantage in the state. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards was a steady third at 14 percent. Clinton was warmly received at the church in Iowa along with her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who had widespread support from the African-American community. But Clinton will not necessarily be able to count on such strong backing from the black community in her fight against Obama during the nomination process. "It's time for an African-American to be in office," church-goer Betty Greer said. "She hasn't taken a true stance on specific items." Rising Republican contender Mike Huckabee, a folksy former Arkansas governor and former Baptist preacher, risked his standing with Catholic voters by courting his evangelical Christian base at the church of a controversial pastor. Huckabee gave a Christmas season sermon at John Hagee's Cornerstone "mega-church" in San Antonio, Texas, calling him "one of the great Christian leaders of our nation." The Catholic League says Hagee, a fiery preacher known for his writings on the Middle East, is virulently anti-Catholic -- a charge he denies. Earlier on Sunday, Huckabee told the CBS show "Face the Nation" he was running to be president of the entire United States, not just the Christian community. "That's how I served as governor," he said. "People look at my record and they didn't see that I put a tent out on the capital grounds and had healing services and I didn't replace the dome with a steeple.
