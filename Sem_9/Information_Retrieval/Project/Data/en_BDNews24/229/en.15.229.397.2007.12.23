 Darren Schuettler BANGKOK, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thais voted on Sunday in a general election meant to restore democracy after last year's military coup but which is unlikely to heal Thailand's deep political divisions. Some 45 million Thais were eligible to cast their ballots as polls opened at 8 a.m. (0100 GMT), but few expect the country's third election in two years will solve the country's problems. Voting is due to end seven hours later with unofficial results expected by midnight. All opinion polls suggest a sizeable victory, but not an outright majority, for the People Power Party (PPP), a vehicle for supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted in a bloodless putsch 15 months ago. The PPP, which has made Thaksin's return from self-exile in London its main priority, said on Friday he could be back in February if voters handed the party a majority in the 480-seat parliament. Analysts say the army and the royalist establishment, which Thaksin supporters blame for the coup, will try to stymie a PPP-led government by seeking to disqualify its candidates or tie up the party in legal challenges. The army and its proxies are expected to push for a coalition led by the Democrats, the main opposition during Thaksin's five years in power. Coup maker General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, now deputy prime minister in the interim government he appointed after the September 2006 coup, urged Thais on Saturday to vote for "good people and those who are loyal" to the monarchy. MORE UNCERTAINTY Financial markets hope the return of an elected government will signal the end of a period of disappointing economic growth, likely to fall towards four percent this year from 5.1 percent in 2006 and the lowest rate in six years. But any coalition government is unlikely to last more than a year, analysts say. "I don't see this election as solving anything," U.S.-based academic Kevin Hewison said. "The emerging political system is unlikely to be inclusive. It will be dominated by a conservative palace, the royalist military and the dead weight of the bureaucracy." Both the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps have said they will take to the streets if they feel the other side has unfairly gained an upper hand in Sunday's polls. Vote buying is rampant in Thai elections and the Nation newspaper reported on Sunday authorities were investigating nearly 160 cases of alleged vote fraud. Major street protests could trigger another military coup, analysts say. The uncertainty has worried the country's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who urged soldiers and police to use their spiritual "strength" to pull the nation out of its political mess. Last year's coup -- the 18th in 75 years of on-off democracy -- failed to kill off Thaksin, an ethnic Chinese telecoms billionaire who won landslides in 2001 and 2005 on the back of cheap healthcare and handouts to farmers. An election Thaksin called in 2006 to rout street protests against him was later annulled. Despite his lengthy exile, the banning of his party Thai Rak Thai and inconclusive attempts to prosecute him for corruption, Thaksin remains the central figure in the political arena. Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, whose party may win only 120 seats according to polls, alluded to Thaksin in his final campaign speech on Friday, saying a vote for the PPP was a vote for someone who had "cheated the nation".
