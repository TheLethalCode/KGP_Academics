 DERA ALLAH YAR, Pakistan, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said on Thursday the government had ordered security forces to close her offices, while intelligence agents were pressuring candidates to drop out of a January election. But Bhutto said despite that, Pakistanis were so fed up with inflation and unemployment it would be difficult for supporters of President Pervez Musharraf to rig a victory in the Jan. 8 parliamentary poll. "The government is scared and is sending the Frontier Constabulary to close our party offices, it is sending MI (Military Intelligence) officials to go and ask candidates to withdraw." The constabulary is a paramilitary force. Pakistan's allies hope the election will help bring stability to the nuclear-armed country, seen as vital to U.S. efforts to combat terrorism, after months of turmoil over Musharraf's manoeuvring to hold on to power. Musharraf stepped down as army chief last month and lifted a six-week state of emergency on Dec. 15. Next month's election is for assemblies in the country's four provinces and a national assembly from which a prime minister and a government will be drawn. The vote is a three-way race between Bhutto, another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and the party that has ruled under Musharraf and backs him. Analysts expect a hung parliament with no one party winning a majority. That would likely mean two of the three main parties having to forge an alliance. Sharif, who Musharraf ousted in 1999, was allowed back from seven years of exile last month and has been campaigning for the election despite a ban on his running because of past criminal convictions he says were politically motivated. "NO ROOM FOR FRAUD" Both Bhutto and Sharif have complained that a caretaker government set up last month to oversee the polls is packed with Musharraf's supporters and the Election Commission is failing to act on complaints. Musharraf has called for a fair election, and he reiterated that on Wednesday saying the intelligence agencies would never be used to manipulate the vote. "I think there is no room for fraud, as there is a caretaker set-up in place," he told a meeting of Pakistani Americans. "The returning officers in each constituency, as against the previous practice, will announce the results on the spot and the election results would be put on Web site," he said. Pakistan is also using transparent ballot boxes for the first time. But Bhutto said criminals were being recruited as policemen in order to disrupt the polls. She said the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League, which ruled until last month, would suffer at the polls because of anger over prices and jobs, despite efforts to rig the result. "Even if the former government tries to rig, it would be difficult for them to do so," she said. "There is a flood of people who are sick of unemployment and inflation and want a better lif
