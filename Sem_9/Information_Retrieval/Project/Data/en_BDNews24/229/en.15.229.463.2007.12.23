 London, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British police said on Sunday detectives had charged a man from Birmingham with a suspected terrorism offence. The 38-year-old, from the Small Heath area of the city, was charged with one offence under the Terrorism Act 2006, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said. "The charge relates to alleged engagement in conduct for the preparation of the intention to commit an act of terrorism," the spokeswoman said. "Although the threat for terrorism is real there is no cause for concern over this matter which has been appropriately managed as a serious criminal investigation." Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the matter, the spokeswoman added. The man is due to appear before Westminster magistrates in central London on Monday
