<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday said the council of advisers would discuss the possibility of lifting the state of emergency if the chief election commissioner asked for it to facilitate local government elections. "The caretaker government doesn't need the state of emergency. We'll lift the emergency rule when we feel the time is right," Mainul said. "However, many countries continued the state of emergency for more than one year," he said, replying to a question from reporters on whether the emergency rule would be withdrawn during elections to municipalities and city corporations. Mainul said, "We interact with ordinary people. They have full support to the government. They are in peace." "It's true that we couldn't solve all problems. It's also true that people don't want to go back to the pre-1/11 state of affairs." The adviser stressed changes in politics and said: "Changes must be brought to politics. There can be difference of opinion in politics but hatred and clashes in the name of politics cannot be accepted." The adviser said: "Only elections should not be the goal. We want to hear less about elections from those who failed to make a voter list. We want elections in a peaceful environment free from hatred and clashes." On the UK minister's recent comment on the withdrawal of the emergency rule, Mainul said: "What foreigners want to know is not very important. If there is no peace and discipline in the country, dream for a better future is meaningless." Describing his experience from his recent visit to Thailand, the adviser said that 121 former lawmakers including former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra had been barred from the election. "But there were no clashes in Thailand," he said. bdnews24.c
