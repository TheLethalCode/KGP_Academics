 LONDON, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks closed more than 1 percent higher on Friday, as US personal spending data gave investors more reason to mop up recently battered banking and commodity stocks. Banks were the best-performing sector, with the DJ Stoxx sector index up 1.1 percent, helped by news that Merrill Lynch & Co Inc may get up to $5 billion in a capital injection from Singapore state investor Temasek. The FTSEurofirst closed 1.4 percent higher at 1,507.08 points and US indexes all stood with gains of above 1 percent, as strong results from Research in Motion lifted the technology sector. Investors were also encouraged by data showing US spending jumped a much bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in November, the sharpest rise in more than two years, alleviating some concerns that the recent market turmoil was denting consumer demand. Stocks gained despite the data also showing prices were rising suggesting the Federal Reserve has limited room to continue cutting interest rates. BP gained 0.7 percent, Royal Dutch Shell rose 0.8 percent and Total put on 1.1 percent as oil majors benefited from crude prices which rose to $92 a barrel. "Now the question is, do we expect a rally early next year? I think maybe there is a good chance of a technical rally early next year because just looking at it sector by sector, a lot of the cyclical sectors in particular look very oversold," said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas. Technology shares were also on the rise, adding to the previous session's lofty gains sparked by reassuring quarterly results and outlook from U.S. firm Oracle. Nokia gained 4 percent, Ericsson rose 3.9 percent, and Capgemini added 1.2 percent. CREDIT TROUBLES The Wall Street Journal reported that Temasek is in advanced talks with Merrill Lynch, the largest U.S. brokerage, and its board has given preliminary approval for the investment. The capital infusion would be the latest in a series by sovereign wealth funds into U.S. and European banks, which have seen their stock prices plunge over the past few months as investors fretted about the impact of the squeeze in the credit market and the debacle in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. Credit Agricole became the latest casualty of the crisis on Thursday, unveiling an estimated 2.5 billion euros ($3.6 billion) pretax writedown. Credit Agricole's stock was up 0.9 percent, however, recovering from early losses as investors were relieved that the bad news was now behind the bank. The stock is still down about 27 percent on the year. Elsewhere in the sector, BNP Paribas rose 0.8 percent, Banco Santander gained 1.9 percent, and HSBC advanced 1 percent. In other news, Saudi Arabian investors bought a large stake in UBS with the Singapore government, the Financial Times reported, amid rising shareholder discontent over the Swiss bank's losses. UBS was down 0.9 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index and France's CAC 40 rose 1.7 percent, while the UK's FTSE 100 index gained 1.4 percent. Mining shares rose along with copper prices and on mergers and acquisitions activity. Anglo American, which said it has bought a 70 percent stake in Foxleigh coal mine in Queensland, Australia, for $620 million, was up 4.5 percent, Xstrata was up 3 percent, and Rio Tinto up 2.9 perce
