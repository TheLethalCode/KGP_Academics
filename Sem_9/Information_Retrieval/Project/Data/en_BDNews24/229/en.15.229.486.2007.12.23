<TEXT>
 Paris, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Julien Gracq, a reclusive French writer known for surrealism and who famously turned down France's highest literary award, died at age 97 on Saturday.

Fiercely private, he stunned France for declining the Goncourt prize in 1951 for his masterpiece novel "The Opposite Shore" ('Rivage des Syrtes') -- a tale about collective suicide in an imaginary landscape.

He spent much of his life there in the house of his grand father and died in a hospital in Angers. He had been living alone since his sister died in 1996. Gracq, a school teacher, was a rare writer to be published in the prestigious 'Pleiade' series while he was still alive. "The work of Julien Gracq is haughty but Louis Poirier is humble," said Jerome Garcin, one of the few people to have obtained an interview with Poirier in Saint-Florent
