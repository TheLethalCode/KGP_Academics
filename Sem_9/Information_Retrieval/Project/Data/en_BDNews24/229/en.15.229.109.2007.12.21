 ISLAMABAD, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 30 people were killed on Friday in a suspected suicide bombing at a mosque in northwest Pakistan, where a former interior minister was offering Eid prayers, police said. Former interior minister Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, who belonged to President Pervez Musharraf's government, was at the mosque at the time of the attack but it was unclear if he was the target. He said he escaped unharmed but his son was injured. "More than 30 people have been killed in the blast," Feroz Shah, a senior police official at Charsadda district, in North West Frontier Province, told Reuters. "We still don't have an exact figure." The blast happened at Sherpao's home village in Charsadda district. Sherpao had been injured in April in another suicide attack at a public meeting in Charsadda. There have been a rash of suicide attacks blamed on Islamist militants since a military assault on the Red Mosque, a militant stronghold, in Islamabad in July. More than 800 people have been killed in the ensuing violence across the country, with about half of them killed in suicide attacks. Musharraf, a key ally in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, cited growing militancy as a main reasons behind his imposition of emergency rule on November 3. He lifted emergency rule on Dec 15. There has been a surge of violence in north-western Pakistan since troops ousted armed militants from the radical Red Mosque in Islamabad in July. Troops have driven the militants from a series of small towns and villages where they had tried to implement strict Islamic law. The army says it has killed nearly 300 pro-Taleban militants in the restive Swat region in Swat in North West Frontier Province. The fighting in Swat is the first serious insurgent threat from pro-Taleban forces in what is considered a settled area of Pakistan. bdnew
