<TEXT>
 MADRID, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronald Koeman's Valencia came from two goals down to scramble a 2-2 Primera Liga draw at Real Zaragoza on Saturday to put the brakes on their recent slump. Valencia were in trouble after a penalty from Argentine striker Diego Milito and an own goal by keeper Juan Luis Mora put Zaragoza 2-0 up at the break. Serbian striker Nikola Zigic put them back in the game when he headed in 14 minutes from time and winger David Silva earned the visitors their second point in five outings with a fine solo effort soon after. Dutch coach Koeman, who controversially omitted three experienced players from the first team this week, had to watch most of the second half from the stands after he was sent off for losing his cool on the touchline. Valencia remain in seventh place, but are just three points ahead of Sevilla who claimed their second win in five with a high-class 4-1 victory at home to sixth-placed Racing Santander. Mali striker Frederic Kanoute gave Sevilla the lead with his eighth goal of the season when he put the finishing touch to a gleaming passing move featuring great work from Daniel Alves and a defence-splitting back heel from Enzo Maresca. Racing defender Ezequiel Garay equalised with a diving header at the start of the second half, but substitute Ernesto Chevanton restored Sevilla's lead when he curled in a superbly struck freekick three minutes after stepping onto the pitch. Garay was sent off 11 minutes from time and Sevilla took full advantage, Jesus Navas completing a lightning break by driving an angled shot into the corner and Adriano Correia wrapping up when he drilled home after surging through the Racing defence. POOR START Koeman's new-look Valencia made a poor start at La Romareda, third-choice keeper Mora giving away a penalty after clattering into striker Ricardo Oliveira in the 16th minute. Milito took his tally for the season to nine goals when he sent Mora the wrong way from the spot. Mora, in the team in place of the excluded Santiago Canizares, made another gaffe on the half hour when he palmed a swirling cross from Sergio Garcia into his own net. Valencia were lucky not to concede a third before the break, but their fortunes changed when Koeman threw on Zigic at the start of the second half, the giant Serb scoring their first league goal in five outings in the 76th minute. Silva then weaved his way past two players and sent a curling shot into the far corner with eight minutes to go
