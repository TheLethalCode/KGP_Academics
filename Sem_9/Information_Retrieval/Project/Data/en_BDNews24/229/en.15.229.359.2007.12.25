 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  A fire broke out Monday night in the BSEC building in Karwan Bazar in the city that houses private TV stations NTV and RTV, fire fighters said. But the flames were doused an hour later and no damage or injury had been reported, they added. Khandakar Shamsuzzahan, deputy assistant director of the Fire Service and Civil Defence, told bdnews24.com that the fire broke at 10:40pm on the ground floor that houses the security room. The flames originated from the piles of papers in the security room that caught fire from a burning cigarette, he said. The fire then raced to the second and third floors. The building was almost evacuated. "People panicked and ran when the smoke reached the second and third floor," Shamsuzzahan said. The fire fighters who arrived at 11.10pm put out the blaze at 11:45pm, Shamsuzzahan said. A huge plume of smoke from burning papers billowed from the building, he added. It took 15 minutes for the firemen to trace the origin of the fire as the security room was under lock and key. The firemen broke open the lock, entered the room and doused the fire, Aminul Haque, deputy general manager of BSEC building, told bdnews24.com. He added that the building was being painted when the incident happened and that the contractor was allowed to use that room. Aminul said he was informed at 11:00 pm about the fire and was also told that the flames had been tamed. Transmission of the TV stations was unhampered. bdnews24.
