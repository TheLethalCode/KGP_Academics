 St petersburg, Russia, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's Constitutional Court on Sunday to complete its move to St Petersburg from Moscow by May, saying it would help his home town regain its former imperial glory. Putin met the court's judges at their new headquarters -- a renovated classical 18th-century building overlooking the Neva River where the Senate and the Holy Synod, two important institutions under the tsars, were located until the 1917 revolution. "St Petersburg does not have a single function of a national capital," he told the judges. "Now, with the Constitutional Court's relocation, we have every right to say that St Petersburg is again Russia's second capital." St Petersburg, founded by tsar Peter the Great in the early 18th century, remained the imperial capital until 1918, when the Bolshevik government moved back to Moscow. The city was later renamed Leningrad after Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. Under the Soviets, Leningrad was referred to as a "cradle of the revolution", but in fact was no more than a regional centre chronically short of cash and resources. Things changed for the city when Putin, who began his career as a KGB officer and later became a city hall official in St Petersburg, became president in 2000. Hundreds of his St Petersburg associates moved to top government posts in Moscow. Putin has picked a former St Petersburg lawyer, Dmitry Medvedev, as the man he wants to replace him after March 2 presidential elections. In return, the Kremlin has encouraged many big Russian companies to re-register in St Petersburg, boosting the city's budget with their taxes and helping to revive its economy. Putin has held several important international meetings in St Petersburg, including the summit of the Group of Eight industrialised nations last year. Many Constitutional court judges resisted the plan to move them to St Petersburg, saying it could create logistical problems and complicate their work. "This project would have never been realised without the strong will of the president," the court's chairman, Valery Zorkin, told the meeting. In the presence of judges, Putin signed a decree ordering them to complete the relocation of the court by May 20 so that it can start working the next day. The Constitutional Court is the first, but may not be the last, in a string of important offices which will move to St Petersburg from Moscow. St Petersburg governor Valentina Matviyenko has said that the navy staff will soon relocate to new headquarters in the city, just few hundred metres from the Constitutional court
