 Ellen Wulfhorst NEW YORK, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hillary Clinton is not only battling for the U.S. presidency but, as a controversy over insulting remarks on a conservative radio programme showed, she is also combating female stereotypes still prevalent in the United States. Influential talk show host Rush Limbaugh, noting his country was obsessed with appearances, exposed the old prejudices when he launched a salvo at the front-runner for the Democratic nomination and former U.S. first lady. Referring to an unflattering photograph of a haggard, wrinkled Clinton, Limbaugh questioned whether America would want to see a woman age, as presidents tend to do, while serving in the White House. "Will Americans want to watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?" said Limbaugh, known for popularising the phrase "feminazis" to describe feminists. "This is a country obsessed with appearance," he said. His remarks reflected how far the country has yet to go toward women's equality as Americans prepare for an election in November 2008 to choose a new president, experts say. "We've come a little way," said Kathleen Dolan, political science professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of "Voting for Women: How the Public Evaluates Women Candidates." "We've come far enough that it's OK for Hillary to run for president, but we've not come far enough for it to be OK for her to run as a creature without gender," Dolan said. "She's still a woman running for president and brings all that baggage about stereotypes and image and attractiveness." Clinton has faced comments during a presidential debate about her choice of jacket and newspaper coverage about how much cleavage she showed one day on Capitol Hill. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was the topic of endless attention over her hair styles and skirt lengths. "There is no question that the slams against her are hypocritical and come because she's a woman," wrote blogger Matt Littman this week on the Huffington Post. "I'm disappointed to see that this misogyny has gone from attacking celebrities to attacking presidential candidates." Looks have always mattered in politics, particularly since television has provided a stream of close-ups of candidates, starting with the first TV presidential debate in which Richard Nixon debated a younger and handsome John Kennedy in 1960. Clinton is not the only woman to face such a harsh glare. German Chancellor Angela Merkel got plenty of unwelcome attention last year after an unflattering photograph appeared of her changing into a bathing suit while on vacation. Such attention on women is one of the last vestiges of men's resistance to sharing power, said Eleanor Smeal, head of the Feminist Majority Foundation. "I don't think it has anything to do with wrinkles. I think there's a hesitancy among men to share power," said Smeal. "What the Clinton race shows is that women now are a force to be reckoned with as candidates." Men in politics too get criticised for their looks. Former President Bill Clinton or Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy were ridiculed for their weight. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is lampooned for his stylized hair. The double standard for men and women is more about aging than looks, said Kristi Andersen, political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. "The gray-haired nice-looking man is a symbol of authority, and we haven't gotten there for women," she said. Remarks such as Limbaugh's have little influence among voters, said Susan Carroll, political scientist at Rutgers University and the Center for American Women and Politics. "People who support Hillary Clinton will continue to support her, and I don't think a few wrinkles will scare them off, and people who listen to Rush Limbaugh by and large are not Hillary Clinton supporters," she said.
