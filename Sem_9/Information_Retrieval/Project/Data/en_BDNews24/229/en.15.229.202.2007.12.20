 London, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Strain in the money markets eased on Thursday, following a concerted central bank pump priming operation, but looming results from a key US investment bank could easily shatter the tentative improvement in sentiment. London interbank offered rates for sterling, euros and dollars all fell. Benchmark sterling rates dropped for the sixth session running, while dollar rates have now been falling for over two weeks. Coordinated central bank cash offers were eagerly snapped up on Wednesday by banks seeking funds. Bids for the US Federal Reserve's unprecedented $20 billion auction of 28-day money outstripped the amount on offer more than three times, and parallel dollar auctions by the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were gobbled up. The Fed will offer another $20 billion later on Thursday, the results of which will be known next week. But many experts believe that while the joint central bank action will help to reduce the liquidity squeeze, it will not solve the underlying problems. "There still is a lot of nervousness and although (the central banks) are providing a short-term salve to the interbank (market), the underlying question is still one of confidence in the markets," said Justin Urquart Stewart, a director at 7 Investment Management. The drip-drip of bad news from major banks continues to erode what little investor confidence has been re-established. Morgan Stanley, the second largest U.S. investment bank, on Wednesday reported an additional $5.7 billion mortgage-related write-down in November and said it had written off a total of about $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Bear Stearns, already hard-hit, reports its results on Thursday, which are expected to show a loss. "Bear Stearns is going to be a very big catalyst. They're really one of the ones that started this whole mess with the collapse of their hedge funds over the summer," said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. U.S. subprime mortgages -- lent to people ill-equipped to pay them back -- were bundled up into complex financial products and sold on around the globe. Only when uncertainty about where the exposure lies is resolved are commercial banks likely to lend money freely to each other again on the interbank market. Banks in Britain, France and Germany have also been damaged while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said late on Wednesday there was a "reasonably high probability" that it will report a large charge in its first-quarter results, as pain from its exposure to the U.S. subprime home loan market deepens. NEW SUPERFUND DOUBT Fresh doubt has also been cast on a planned "superfund" to bail out investment vehicles tied to the subprime mortgage market. Japan's top three banks plan to reject a request to help finance the U.S.-led rescue fund, financial sources said on Thursday. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Mizuho Financial Group had each been asked to commit $5 billion to the U.S.-led fund. Reports have circulated that some U.S. banks which had been expected to help out were also losing interest as they doubted its ability to provide a solution to the credit crunch. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent on Thursday and a policy hawk dropped his lone call for a rate rise with the nation's growth prospects looking murky. Many investors think the central bank will not raise rates until the middle of next year as the global credit crisis and lacklustre domestic demand raise concern about Japan's growth. The Fed, Bank of Canada and Bank of England have all lowered official interest rates, in the face of the credit crunch, but the European Central Bank has not followed su
