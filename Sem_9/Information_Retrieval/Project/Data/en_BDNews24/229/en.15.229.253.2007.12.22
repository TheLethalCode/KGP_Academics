 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday said the government should hand over power to elected representatives at the earliest. "The nation expects that the Election Commission will hold a free and fair election after it is done with the preparation of the voter list in line with the election roadmap it has announced," Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com by telephone from Shibpur, Narsinghdi. "We want that the government will hand over power as early as possible to the elected leaders." He travelled to Shibpur to exchange Eid greetings with the people of his constituency. About the unity of the party, the former BNP secretary general said: "I want unity as well as reform in the party. There's no alternative to unity to win the elections. "Reforms are needed to strengthen the party and make it democratic. Party leaders and workers become more united when democracy is practiced within the party." On party chief Khaleda Zia's detention in prison, Bhuiyan said: "I've not enjoyed this Eid so much since [Khaleda] is in jail. My mood is not supposed to be upbeat. I believe she'll be freed through legal process." Bhuiyan went by road to Narsinghdi in the morning and started back for Dhaka in the afternoon. bdne
