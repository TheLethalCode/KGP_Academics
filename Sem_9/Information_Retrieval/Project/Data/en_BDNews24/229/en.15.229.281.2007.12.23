 Kabul, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi held talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday and was expected to meet Italian troops serving with the NATO force in the country. His Christmas trip comes a day after the leaders of France and Australia also visited and pledged military and financial support for the fight against a growing insurgency led by Taliban militants. After arriving in Kabul, Prodi was expected to travel to the relatively secure western city of Herat where most of Italy's 2,000 soldiers are stationed. "I thanked our soldiers, our administrators, all of the Italians present here because their work is truly precious," Prodi told reporters. "It's a contribution to peace, not just for this country but for the whole region." Italy is among several NATO nations that have been hesitant to send soldiers to the restive southern and eastern areas where the insurgents are most active and clash regularly with foreign troops under NATO and US military command. More than 330 foreign soldiers have been killed in the past two years, the bloodiest period since US-led troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001. The violence has also claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians and hampered development projects in large parts of the south and east from where the largely ethnic Pashtun Taliban draw most of their support. Under public pressure, Canada and the Netherlands, which have troops in the south, have hinted at not extending the mandate of their stay beyond 2008. The United States, which forms the bulk of the foreign force in Afghanistan, has been pushing alliance members to take more responsibility in the war against the al Qaeda-backed Taliban. "The fact that some NATO member nations show disinterest in keeping their forces in Afghanistan beyond 2008 is really worrisome," the English-language Kabul Times said in an editorial on Sunday. "While the Taliban are gaining more strength as indicated by the increase in the number of suicide bombings in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, the withdrawal of some NATO forces may weaken the morale all around," it added. The United States needed to expedite equipping Afghan forces as an option, the daily said, a point that has been repeatedly proposed by Karzai whose power does not extend beyond major cities
