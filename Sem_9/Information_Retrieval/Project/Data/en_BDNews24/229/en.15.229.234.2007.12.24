<TITLE> India seizes four Vishnu statues as hunt on for lost artefacts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka/Kolkata/New Delhi, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Indian customs officials seized four Vishnu statues from a van on the border with Nepal, officials said Sunday, as Bangladesh government opened an investigation into the theft of two images of the Hindu god. No arrests were made. The development coincided with the theft of two Vishnu statues from Zia International Airport in Dhaka, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum. One of the two terracotta images was a bust of Vishnu. Authorities did not find immediate links between the two incidents. The route through Shiliguri is known for easy smuggling, Sumon K Chakrabarti, chief national correspondent of Indian TV channel CNN-IBN, told bdnews24.com by phone Sunday. The customs officials said the van was found early Saturday in an area locally known as the "Panitanki border" between India and Nepal. Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri told bdnews24.com Sunday afternoon that a five-member committee had opened a probe into the theft of the two rare artefacts. The committee led by Fakhrul Islam, joint secretary of the civil aviation and tourism ministry, will submit its report in three working days. Bangladesh National Museum director general Samar Chandra Paul filed a case with the Airport Police Station but did not name the accused. Reports from Kolkata said suspected smugglers had escaped arrest after the van, chased by the Indian police, ran into an accident. The statues were seized from under the seats of the van, Indian customs official Chandra Bhan was quoted to have told reporters. In Dhaka, Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of the Airport Police Station, had earlier told bdnews24.com that two boxes of artefacts and relics went missing from the airport, but one was found later near a pond. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Naim Ahmed told reporters that the incident had taken place after the artefacts were handed over to officials of Air France, which was to carry all the 13 boxes of the second shipment on a delayed flight. The authorities Friday cleared the second consignment of archaeological relics out of Bangladesh National Museum, en route to Paris. As one of the 13 boxes went missing, the government halted the entire shipment. "I think the rest (of the artefacts) should not be sent out, unless the issue is resolved," Quadri told bdnews24.com Sunday. Archaeologists and civil society representatives vented anger at the loss of the "precious artefacts" that weigh 64kg together. Reacting instantly to the incident, Professor Shah Sufi Mostafizur Rahman, chairman of the Department of Archaeology at Jahangirnagar University, said: "We are sad to know about the loss of the artefacts." "Many set their greedy eyes on our archaeological treasures because of their historical values. But we don't know the culprits, who must be influential." The shipment of the relics ran into legal snags after an archaeological researcher, Nurul Islam, petitioned to the High Court on Dec 6, which, in turn, halted the shipment until Jan 15, 2008. On Dec 13, the court rejected a government appeal to cancel the status quo. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court later put freezes on the High Court order. Nisar Hossain, a teacher of the Fine Arts Institute, said: "We are deeply concerned." He demanded punishment to the guilty. "It's difficult to understand how this could happen despite beefed-up security in and around ZIA," Nisar said. The shipment of artefacts and relics by the government drew flak from artists, sculptors and students. Some campaigners locked the gate to the National Museum Friday apparently to stop the government taking the relics from the museum, witnesses said. But the police broke the lock open to allow the courier's trucks in around 3pm. The government had earlier sent off 42 artefacts in 10 cartons on Nov 30. The artefacts from five Bangladesh museums were scheduled to be on display at the exhibition under an agreement signed between Bangladesh and French governments. The items were selected from Dhaka museum and the museums of Paharpur, Mahasthangarh, Mainamati and Barendra. bdnews24.com/skc/fwc/
