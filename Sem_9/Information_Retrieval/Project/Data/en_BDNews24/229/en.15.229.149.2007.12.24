<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  The crisis over the theft of two rare relics destined for display at a Paris museum threatened Monday to snowball into a huge national embarrassment with cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri considering calling it quits. The police said the archaeological relics went missing from the custody of Air France at the Zia International Airport on Dec 22. France said it was a conspiracy or petty crime. In a news briefing Monday, Quadri said: "It's me who must take the responsibility as the head of the cultural affairs ministry for the lost artefacts." Asked if he would resign by a bdnews24.com reporter, the adviser said: "What do you want?" The reporter answered back with the same question: "What do you want?" The adviser said: "I am thinking about the matter (resignation)." Two boxes of artefacts and relics, including two rare terracotta statues of Hindu god Vishnu, were stolen prior to the dispatch of the original artefacts by an Air France Cargo flight. The rare relics were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum. One carton was found later near a pond. A five-member committee has opened a probe into the theft of the two artefacts. The adviser said: "Personally I think the rest of the artefacts should not be sent off until the issue is settled." Police Monday said the carton loaded with the artefacts went missing between 3am and 6am Friday after the archaeological relics had been handed over to Air France officials. Homebound Courier Services trucked 145 relics in 13 cartons to ZIA. Deputy police commissioner for Uttara zone Khondakar Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com Monday that another suspect, a Biman Bangladesh Airlines employee, was arrested in Bhola Sunday night. Among the 11 arrested Sunday, two Ansar members were released after interrogation and the number of arrestees stood at 10. Rafiqul said Biman employee Shankar Chandra Dey was arrested in Bhola Sunday night and had been brought to Dhaka. He also said an intensive search in the Cargo Village failed to find the carton. On the status of the investigation, Rafiqul said, "There has been no success until now. The Police Headquarters have sent a message to the Interpol." In the case filed with Airport Police Station by director general of Bangladesh National Museum Samar Chandra Paul, Shankar and nine others detained Sunday have been shown arrested. The arrestees are members of Air France Cargo, Voyager Airlines and Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB). They are Jamiul Abedin (loader), Masud Rana Saiful (loading supervisor), Abu Bakar (assistant loader), Afsar (Biman security), Abul Hossain (ground support equipment officer), Md Al Momin (Voyager Airlines staff), Shahjahan Ali (loader, operation department), Shariful Islam Manik (Voyager Airlines staff) Billal Hossain (loader) and Shankar. The two Ansar members who have been released are Md Sobhan and Mizanur Rahman. An on-duty Biman official said the Air France aircraft was still at the airport and the remaining 12 cartons had been kept at the Cargo Village area. Indian customs officials seized four Vishnu statues from a van on the border with Nepal, but the authorities did not find links between the two incidents. Meanwhile, France said the theft was a conspiracy by a nexus of people or a petty crime. It also said the motive of the theft was to "embarrass France and Bangladesh". "France feels the disappearance of this crate is highly suspicious and could also be the result of a conspiracy by a very small nexus of persons to embarrass France and Bangladesh," the French embassy in Dhaka said in a statement. "Although the inquiries are ongoing, the possibility of a mere theft by petty criminals cannot be discounted," the statement said. The exhibition of the artefacts at Guimet Museum in Paris was opposed by some campaigners in Bangladesh. "It is time for the few opponents to this event to recognise they are a tiny minority and act accordingly," the statement said. "Indeed, if the consignment had left on time, and without the very professional attitude of the Bangladeshi courier, the disappearance would have been noted only in Paris, with the corresponding accusations been directed against the French Republic by a small but vocal group of persons." "France condemns such acts in the strongest term," it said. The statement said the crates were left unattended on ZIA's tarmac "where neither the lending nor the borrowing institutions have any control". France also praised the government steps to recover the missing artefacts and hoped that the perpetrators would be found out and brought to book. Some campaigners in Bangladesh have been opposing the government decision of sending the artefacts to the French capital for exhibition. The protesters staged demonstrations against the government decision. The government had earlier sent off 42 artefacts in 10 cartons on Nov 30. The shipment of the relics ran into legal snags after an archaeological researcher, Nurul Islam, petitioned to the High Court on Dec 6, which, in turn, halted the shipment until Jan 15, 2008. On Dec 13, the court rejected a government appeal to cancel the status quo. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court later put freezes on the High Court order. The artefacts from five Bangladesh museums were scheduled to be on display at the exhibition under an agreement signed between the French ambassador to Bangladesh and the cultural affairs secretary. The items were selected from Dhaka museum and the museums of Paharpur, Mahasthangarh, Mainamati and Barendra. The exhibition is scheduled to start in Paris on Jan 9 and run through to March 31. bdnews24.com/gm/a
