<TITLE> Thai parties start coalition deal-making </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's political parties got down to hard bargaining on Monday after voters roundly rejected last year's military coup but failed to give supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra an outright majority. The deal-making was likely to be long, complex and fraught with tension after Sunday's vote showed a country polarised between Thaksin supporters in the People Power Party (PPP) and opponents represented mostly by the Democrat Party. "There is still plenty of room for mischief," the English-language Bangkok Post said in an editorial. "Other groups, including the military, must abide by the election decision." PPP leader Samak Sundaravej, who says openly he is a proxy for Thaksin, said he would "certainly" be prime minister and invited small parties to join his own 228 seats in the 480-member parliament to form a coalition government. Two of the crucial minor parties -- Chart Thai (Thai Nation) and Puea Pandin (Motherland), with 65 seats between them -- would act together and take their time making a decision, Chart Thai leader and former prime minister Banharn Silpa-archa said. In the Thai system, parliament must meet within 30 days of the election and then has a month to elect a prime minister, with Samak the clear front-runner as all the non-PPP parties together would have only 252 seats, a razor thin majority. In the meantime, the Election Commission appointed by the military after the September 2006 bloodless coup that ousted Thaksin can disqualify winning candidates for abuse of election rules and says it will probe about 160 serious complaints. The fear, analysts say, is that the army and Thailand's old elite are likely to be calling in every favour possible to stop Thaksin making a comeback by proxy, including putting pressure on the Election Commission to whittle down PPP numbers. "At every step in coming days and weeks, the EC must be seen to be doing exactly the right thing in every decision," the Bangkok Post said. FEAR OF TROUBLE Underlying the political bargaining is the fear of trouble on the streets of Bangkok, where Samak was once governor and left office highly unpopular in a city that helped oust Thaksin through mass protests and voted heavily against the PPP. Samak shrugged off fears that the installation of a PPP-led government would lead to fresh protests which could, in turn, lead to another coup by a military whose campaign to consign Thaksin to political oblivion ended in tatters on Sunday. "It is a victory for this country," Samak said, adding he would "certainly be prime minister". Samak said he did not foresee another coup since new army chief Anupong Paochinda was a "good guy" committed to keeping out of politics. But the military would prefer a government led by the Democrats, the main opposition during Thaksin's five years in power, even though most analysts say such a weak coalition was unlikely to last beyond a year. With the Democrat Party holding 166 seats, PPP's possible partners are five small middle-ground parties -- Chart Thai, Peua Pandin, Ruam Jai Thai, Matchima and Pracharat -- none of which stand out as obvious bedfellows. Financial markets hope the return of an elected administration will signal the end of a period of disappointing economic growth, likely to fall from 5.1 percent in 2006 towards 4 percent this year, the lowest rate in six years
