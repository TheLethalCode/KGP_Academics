 LONDON, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - London Olympic organisers ended the year on a positive note on Wednesday when they announced that demolition work on the sites of the "big five" venues for the 2012 Games was complete. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) said construction work on the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre, International Broadcast and Media Centre, Velopark and Olympic Village will begin in earnest in 2008. "In a project of this scale and complexity, we have to make the most of every day, and we have done just that this year, making excellent progress," London organising committee chairman Sebastian Coe said on Wednesday. "We enter 2008 excited about the prospect of Beijing 2008, and of the beginning of our own Olympiad. As the eyes of the world turn to London after Beijing, we will be ready, and we won't disappoint." More than 150 buildings have been demolished on the 2.5 square kilometre site just east of the City, much of which is contaminated by a century of industrial use. While early progress has been praised by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge this year, although rising budgets have sparked criticism at home. Olympic Minister Tessa Jowell announced in March that the overall budget had more than doubled to 9.3 billion pounds ($18.65 billion). The cost of the stadium also rose to 496 million pounds from the 280 million pounds stated during the bidding process
