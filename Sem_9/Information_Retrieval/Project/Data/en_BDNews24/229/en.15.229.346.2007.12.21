<TITLE> Diana inquest: was it true love or summer fling? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Her confidante weeps in the witness box, her stepmother quivers with emotion, "Dearest Papa" and "Darling Dodi" letters are flashed up on screen. Did she truly love him or was it just a summer fling? At the inquest into the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi al-Fayed, the evidence at times reads more like a soap opera script than solemn testimony from the Royal Courts of Justice. For tabloid newspapers, who once revelled in every twist and turn in the love life of the world's most photographed woman, it is just like old times. A decade after her death, Diana is headline news again as a jury has to decide whether her death in a Paris car crash was an accident or part of a plot. Dodi's father, luxury storeowner Mohamed al-Fayed, alleges that his son and Diana were killed by British security services on the orders of Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's husband and Diana's former father-in-law. Fayed believes her killing was ordered because the royal family did not want the mother of the future king having a child with his son. He alleges that Diana's body was embalmed to cover up evidence she was expecting a baby. French and British police investigations concluded that Diana and Dodi died because their chauffeur, Henri Paul, was inebriated and driving too fast. For the jury, which headed on Thursday into a Christmas break from an inquest expected to last six months, the choice lies between these two sharply differing conclusions. And, as they try to make up their minds, a rich panoply of characters is paraded before them. Diana's stepmother, Countess Spencer, resplendent in black hat and veil, talked like a character from the pages of a romantic novel by her own mother, author Barbara Cartland. "Affairs of the heart are impossible to fathom," she said, launching into an impassioned plea to "solve this mystery". TEARFUL WITNESS Close friend Rosa Monckton, who went on holiday in Greece with Diana just days before she died, broke down and wept when grilled by Mohammed al-Fayed's lawyer Michael Mansfield. Grainy security images from the Ritz Hotel in Paris relived the last day of the star-crossed lovers. A list of her other lovers, from British army officer James Hewitt to former England rugby captain Will Carling, was read out in court. But what really riveted the court were intimate glimpses into the private life of a compulsive, effusive letter-writer. Princess Diana thanked her father-in-law Prince Philip for trying to save her crumbling marriage and praised his skills as a counsellor in heavily edited letters presented to the court. In one handwritten reply, Diana said: "Dearest Pa, I was particularly touched by your most recent letter which proved to me, if I didn't already know it, that you really do care. "You are very modest about your marriage guidance skills and I disagree with you," she said in the letter released by Buckingham Palace to prove their relations were not bitter. Then, in turn, Mohammed al-Fayed released letters between his son and Diana to try to prove this was true love. In one letter, Diana thanks "Darling Dodi" for a holiday on his yacht, adding "This comes with all the love in the world and as always a million heartfelt thanks for bringing such joy into this chick's life." The jury will spend another three months scouring through every detail of Diana's private life -- and there looks certain to be plenty more twists and turns to come.
