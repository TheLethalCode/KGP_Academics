 MADRID, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch will spend the night in hospital after collapsing at a promotional event in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. Medical staff said the 87-year-old had responded well to treatment after fainting because of an increase in arterial blood pressure. "The patient's situation remains stable and controlled," said Doctor Raquel del Valle of the cardiology department at the Clinico hospital. "As a consequence, and in agreement with the family, we will not be issuing another report until tomorrow." Witnesses reported that Samaranch was rushed to hospital after fainting shortly before he was due to attend the presentation of a fund-raising event organised by Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas and tennis player Rafael Nadal. Samaranch was head of the IOC between 1980 and 2001 and is now an honorary life president of the organisation. He remains an active figure in Spanish and international sports administration and is often present at high-profile events such as Wednesday's presentation. He was in Lausanne last week at an IOC Executive Board meeting. Samaranch spent several weeks in hospitals in Lausanne and Barcelona after suffering from fatigue shortly after stepping down as IOC president in 2001
