 Brussels, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The jailed al Qaeda suspect at the centre of a security scare in Belgium has insisted he had no plans to launch an attack on the country, a newspaper reported on Sunday. La Derniere Heure said it received a letter from Tunisian suspect Nizar Trabelsi accusing the authorities who raised a security alarm on Friday of "installing panic in the hearts of thousands for nothing". "I would like to know why I should be preparing an attack on your territory," the newspaper quoted Trabelsi as saying in a letter it said had been handed to its offices by his partner. "Neither Trabelsi, nor anyone has plans to do anything," added Trabelsi, held in a prison just south of Brussels after his arrest in September 2001, when he told a radio station he was plotting attacks on US targets in Belgium. Belgium hosts NATO, the European Union institutions and the offices of a raft of multinational companies. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said on Friday there were signs a possible terrorist attack was being prepared after police thwarted what they believed was an attempt by Islamic militants to free Trabelsi from jail. Belgian authorities said on Saturday they had released all 14 suspected Islamic militants detained the day earlier after not finding sufficient proof to detain them further. But officials said the reinforced police presence at Brussels international airport, rail networks and shopping centres would remain in place until January 2 as planned
