<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Prices of most daily essentials, including fine rice, edible oil and spice, have increased ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, according to a one-day market survey by bdnews24.com. Shoppers Wednesday said the prices of edible oil rose 10 percent in the last one and a half months. Fine rice also became pricier. Although spice prices are high, it does not hurt their budget since they buy spices before this Eid and once or twice a year. Edible oil is marketed by a number of companies and a five-litre bottle selling at Tk 445 to Tk 450. The price is more or less the same in the New Market kitchen market, Mohammadpur Town Hall market, Kanthalbagan, Karwan Bazaar, Thanthari Bazaar and Moulavi Bazaar. In other markets, the price difference varies from Tk 5 to Tk 10. Ghee (unpacked) sells at Tk 360 per kg, down from Tk 420 to Tk 430, the prices of packed ghee. Fine rice costs Tk 75 to Tk 85 per kg, with new rice priced at Tk 75 and old rice at Tk 85. However, the upmarket prices of rice are Tk 90. Shoppers put the blame for the price rise largely on the media. The bdnews24.com correspondent received a price list posing as a shopper, which was different from the one he was handed as a newsman. Retailers deny the complaint. Mohammed Dulal, a retailer, said the price list of the media became permanent. The prices of spice do not have a major impact on shoppers. Nazma Amin, a housewife, said she bought spices once or twice a year. "That's why the price rise is not noticeable." "But every time we have to buy them at prices higher than we did last time," she added. The prices of onion vary. Local onions cost Tk 40 while the Indian variety sells at Tk 25 to Tk 27 per kg. Garlic and ginger are selling at Tk 40 and turmeric at Tk 65 to Tk 70 a kg. Spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, cumin and coriander are selling at Tk 90, Tk 20, Tk 38 and Tk 20 respectively. A visit to a number of kitchen markets revealed that prices are cheaper in the small markets than in the big ones. bdnews
