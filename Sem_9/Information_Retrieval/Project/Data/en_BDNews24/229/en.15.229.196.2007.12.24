 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  The carton loaded with rare artefacts en route to Paris went missing from Zia International Airport between 3am and 6am Friday after the archaeological relics had been handed over to Air France officials, the police said Monday. Homebound Courier Services trucked 145 relics in 13 cartons to ZIA to be put on display at the Guimet Museum in France's capital Paris. Deputy police commissioner for Uttara zone Khondakar Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com Monday that another suspect, a Biman Bangladesh Airlines employee, was arrested in Bhola Sunday night. Among the 11 arrested Sunday, two Ansar members were released after interrogation and the number of arrestees stood at 10. Rafiqul said Biman employee Shankar Dey was arrested in Bhola Sunday night and had been brought to Dhaka. He also said an intensive search in the Cargo Village failed to find the carton. On the status of the investigation, Rafiqul said, "There has been no success until now. The Police Headquarters have sent a message to the Interpol." In the case filed with Airport Police Station by director general of Bangladesh National Museum Samar Chandra Paul, Shankar and nine others detained Sunday have been shown arrested. The arrestees are members of Air France Cargo, Voyager Airlines and Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB). They are Jamiul Abedin (loader), Masud Rana Saiful (loading supervisor), Abu Bakar (assistant loader), Afsar (Biman security), Abul Hossain (ground support equipment officer), Md Al Momin (Voyager Airlines staff), Shahjahan Ali (loader, operation department), Shariful Islam Manik (Voyager Airlines staff) Billal Hossain (loader) and Shankar. The two Ansar members who have been released are Md Sobhan and Mizanur Rahman. An on-duty Biman official said the Air France aircraft was still in the airport and the remaining 12 cartons had been kept at the Cargo Village area. The government Friday shipped a second consignment of archaeological relics out of Bangladesh National Museum. Two boxes of artefacts and relics went missing from the airport Friday night, but one was found later near a pond. Indian customs officials seized four Vishnu statues from a van on the border with Nepal, officials said Sunday, as Bangladesh government opened an investigation into the theft of two images of the Hindu god. The government had earlier sent off 42 artefacts in 10 cartons on Nov 30. The shipment of the relics ran into legal snags after an archaeological researcher, Nurul Islam, petitioned to the High Court on Dec 6, which, in turn, halted the shipment until Jan 15, 2008. On Dec 13, the court rejected a government appeal to cancel the status quo. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court later put freezes on the High Court order. The artefacts from five Bangladesh museums were scheduled to be on display at the exhibition under an agreement signed between the French ambassador to Bangladesh and the cultural affairs secretary. The items were selected from Dhaka museum and the museums of Paharpur, Mahasthangarh, Mainamati and Barendra. The exhibition is scheduled to start in Paris on Jan 9 and run through to March 31. bdnews2
