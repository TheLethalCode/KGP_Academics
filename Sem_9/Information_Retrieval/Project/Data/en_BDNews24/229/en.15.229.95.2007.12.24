 LONDON, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index ticked up early on Monday in a shortened Christmas Eve trading session as firmer raw materials prices lifted commodity shares, while battered banking stocks stayed on their recovery path. By 0828 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 27.4 points, or 0.4 percent at 6,461.5, after gaining 0.6 percent last week. Activity was light, with the market due to close at 1230 GMT before the Christmas holiday. The FTSE 100 will reopen on Thursday. The UK blue-chip index has gained 3.9 percent so far this year, putting it on track to record its worst yearly performance since the bull run began four years ago. "The initial boost is largely driven by Friday's Wall Street, which filtered through in Asia. It's an upbeat open to the shortened, disrupted week," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index, adding that higher copper prices aided miners.

Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered, HSBC, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Alliance & Leicester advanced between 0.2 and 1.2 percent. Also underpinning banks, the Financial Times reported Saudi Arabia plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund that may exceed $900 billion. Northern Rock eased 0.6 percent. The Sunday Times said the board of the embattled bank was considering mounting a rescue plan to save the lender from nationalisation or takeover. BT Group and Enterprise Inns fell after trading without dividend rights. Among midcaps, UK Coal jumped 20 percent after industry sources said Austria's Meinl International Power had told UK Coal it was interested in buying its mining assets, but that Britain's largest coal miner was unlikely to enter talks at this ti
