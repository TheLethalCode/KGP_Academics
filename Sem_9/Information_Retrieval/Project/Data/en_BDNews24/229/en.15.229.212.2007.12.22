 MELBOURNE, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India head into their first test against Australia on Wednesday with little match practice under their belts after their tour match against state side Victoria was abandoned without a ball being bowled on Saturday. The match had already been badly effected by torrential rain throughout Melbourne over the past three days with just 38 overs achievable on Thursday and only 10 overs on Friday. Umpires Paul Reiffel and John Ward abandoned play at the Junction Oval in suburban Melbourne before play because of a wet field and steady rain overnight and throughout the morning. India ended the match on 133 for four with Rahul Dravid on 38 and Yuvraj Singh on six. Saurav Ganguly top scored with 59 while Victoria pace bowler Allan Wise finished with four for 37. The tourists have spent much of the last three days practicing in the indoor nets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the venue for the first test, which begins on Dec. 26
