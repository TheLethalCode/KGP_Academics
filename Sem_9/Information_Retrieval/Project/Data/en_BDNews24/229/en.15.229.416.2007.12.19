 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Middle-order batsman Rajin Saleh will join the injury-hit Bangladesh squad in New Zealand for the rest of the tour after Tushar Imran injured his left shoulder. "The decision was taken in light of Tushar Imran's injury condition. Middle order batsman Tushar sat out the second warm-up match with a sore left shoulder and he will appear for the fitness test on December 28," the Bangladesh Cricket Board said in press statement Wednesday. "After analysing the overall situation, the BCB has decided to send a batsman as Tushar is almost certain to miss up to the 2nd one-day international against New Zealand which is scheduled to be held on December 28 and the selectors picked Rajin Saleh," added the statement. Rajin is expected to leave here for New Zealand on Dec 24. Earlier, the selection committee picked uncapped left-arm pacer Sajidul Islam in place of injured Syed Rasel, who dislocated his collarbone in the first warm-up match against Northern Knights at Seddon Park. b
