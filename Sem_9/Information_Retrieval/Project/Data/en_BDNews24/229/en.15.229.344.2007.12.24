<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)Politicians will have the opportunity to appear before the Truth Commission, as well as businessmen, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Monday. "The government is actively considering the Truth Commission proposal at the moment, which should be accessible to politicians as well as the business communitythis much I can tell you," said Mainul while speaking to reporters at the law ministry in the morning. He added that public debate over the issue will not deter the government in going ahead with the initiative. "Personally speaking, the commission should have been established sometime back. The ping-pong diplomacy adopted by some in this regard is not a positive approach though," the law adviser said. "The Truth Commission will prove helpful in retrieving our stolen wealth from abroad. It will also help resolve multifarious complaints raised by our business community and streamline economic activities." In the face of opposing views expressed in recent months, Mainul said, the government is "actively" considering a plan to allow politicians to access the Truth Commission's services. The adviser said the draft proposal for the establishing the commission has yet to reach the law ministry. bdnews24.com/ahd
