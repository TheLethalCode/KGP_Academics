 MADRID, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch is in no danger following his collapse on Wednesday, but will spend another day in hospital to conclude his treatment for high blood pressure. The 87-year-old, who was head of the IOC between 1980 and 2001, spent the night in a Madrid hospital after collapsing at a promotional event in the Spanish capital. "The patient has responded favourably to the treatment given to deal with his high blood pressure," a spokesman for the Clinico hospital said in a statement on Thursday. "He is stable and has been conscious at all times. We've controlled his high blood pressure but the cardiologists have decided that he should remain in hospital for another day as they want to adjust his usual treatment before he is discharged tomorrow. "Given that his situation is normal and that he is not in any danger we will not give any further medical bulletins before he leaves hospital." Samaranch was rushed to hospital on Wednesday after fainting shortly before he was due to attend a fundraising event organised by Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas and tennis player Rafael Nadal. Now an honorary life president of the IOC, Samaranch remains an active figure in Spanish and international sports administration. He is often present at high-profile events such as Wednesday's presentation and frequently attends IOC events. Samaranch spent 10 days in hospital in Lausanne and then two further weeks in a clinic in Barcelona because of fatigue shortly after stepping down as IOC president in 2001. "He is an 87-year-old man trying to cope with the schedule of a 40-year-old," Samaranch's son Juan Antonio was quoted as saying in the Spanish media on Thursday
