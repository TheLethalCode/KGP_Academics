<TITLE> Thaksin looms over Thailand's post-coup vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Sun Dec 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thais voted on Sunday in a post-coup general election that supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra sought to turn into a referendum on his return from exile. Some 45 million Thais were eligible to vote before polls closed at 3 p m (0800 GMT). The election meant to restore democracy after last year's military coup looked set to prolong the deep political divisions of the last two years. Opinion polls suggested a sizeable victory, but not an outright majority, for the openly pro-Thaksin People Power Party (PPP), which says he could return on Feb. 14 if the party controlled the 480-seat parliament. "What Thaksin did for them five years ago is still in their hearts. They are thinking of him," said PPP leader Samak Sundaravej, who freely admits he is a proxy for the 58-year-old Thaksin, believed to be watching the results from Hong Kong. Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party was dissolved after being found guilty of election fraud. Samak, whose PPP embraced the populist policies which won Thaksin two landslide election victories, said he was confident "the vote will be on our side". If the PPP emerged as the biggest party, it should be given first crack at cobbling together a coalition with minor parties. But the army and the royalist establishment, which Thaksin supporters blame for the coup, would do everything they could to stop the PPP by fostering allegations of electoral fraud against its candidates and potential partners, analysts said. They would prefer a coalition led by the Democrats, the main opposition during Thaksin's five years in power. POLITICAL MESS Financial markets hope the return of an elected government will signal the end of a period of disappointing economic growth, likely to fall towards four percent this year from 5.1 percent in 2006 and the lowest rate in six years. At polling stations across Bangkok, voters said they too were tired of the political mess. "It doesn't really matter which party gets in just as long as we have a government as soon as possible," said 60-year-old Anunt. But analysts say the election, held under a new constitution designed to prevent the return of single party rule, is almost certain to produce a weak coalition unlikely to last more than a year. "I don't see this election as solving anything," U.S.-based academic Kevin Hewison said. "The emerging political system is unlikely to be inclusive. It will be dominated by a conservative palace, the royalist military and the dead weight of the bureaucracy." Both the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps have said they would take to the streets if they felt the other side had gained an upper hand in the polls unfairly. Major street protests could trigger another military coup, analysts say. Last year's coup was the 18th in 75 years of on-off democracy in Thailand. The uncertainty has worried revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who urged soldiers and police to use their spiritual "strength" to pull the nation out of its political me
