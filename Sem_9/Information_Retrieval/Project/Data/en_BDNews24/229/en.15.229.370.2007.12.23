 Bangkok, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The People Power Party backing former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra won the most seats in Sunday's Thai election according to two exit polls, a likely cause of concern to the generals who ousted him in 2006. Bangkok's Suan Dusit College said the PPP had won 256 out of the 480 parliamentary seats, giving it a clear majority. Assumption University's ABAC poll said the PPP won only 202 seats -- in line with most pre-election forecasts -- meaning it would have to tie up with at least one other minor party to form a coalition. The big question was how the army and the royalist establishment, whom the Thaksin camp say were behind the bloodless September 2006 coup, would react to the results, which show how badly their campaign to sideline Thaksin has failed. Prior to the poll, many analysts suspected a flurry of electoral fraud claims against PPP candidates, leading to their disqualification. However, the bigger the margin of the PPP win, the harder that will be to pull off. "It depends how many red cards they have to issue," said Kevin Hewison, a Thai expert at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "If it's 40 or 50, it may be difficult, but if it's only 10 or 20, they might be able to do it." The Election Commission said it had received around 750 complaints, but was taking only 157 of them seriously. It was not clear how many of these could lead to disqualifications. ARMY DISQUIET? PPP leader Samak Sundaravej, whose party embraced the populist policies which won Thaksin landslide victories in 2001 and 2005, said Thailand's 45 million voters were just following their emotions. "What Thaksin did for them five years ago is still in their hearts. They are thinking of him," said Samak, who freely admits to being a proxy for the 58-year-old telecoms billionaire, believed to be watching the results from Hong Kong. Political convention dictates that the biggest party gets first crack at cobbling together a coalition with minor parties. The army would prefer a coalition led by the Democrats, the main opposition during Thaksin's five years in power, although most analysts agree such a government would be weak and unlikely to last beyond a year. Financial markets hope the return of an elected government will signal the end of a period of disappointing economic growth, likely to fall towards four percent this year from 5.1 percent in 2006 and the lowest rate in six years. At polling stations across Bangkok, voters said they were just tired of the political mess. "It doesn't really matter which party gets in just as long as we have a government as soon as possible," said 60-year-old Anunt. Both the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps have said they would take to the streets if they felt the other side had gained an upper hand in the polls unfairly. Major street protests could trigger another military coup, analysts say. Last year's coup was the 18th in 75 years of on-off democracy in Thailand. Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party has since been dissolved and he and 110 party members were barred from politics for five years. The uncertainty has worried revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who urged soldiers and police to use their spiritual "strength" to pull the nation out of the long running crisis
