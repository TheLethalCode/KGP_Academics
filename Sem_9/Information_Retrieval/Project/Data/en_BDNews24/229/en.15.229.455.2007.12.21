 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Relatives visited former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia in special jail Friday, lawyers said. It was a second Eid for the chiefs of the two major political parties behind bars. Hasina was visited by husband Wazed Miah and aunt Zebunnesa who brought her home-cooked food Friday afternoon. As many as 12 people sought permission from authorities for a visit to the Awami League chief, but only two were allowed in. Tarique Rahman's wife Zubaida Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco's wife Sharmila Rahman and their daughters visited Khaleda in special prison at the Sangsad Bhaban. They stayed there for two hours. Khaleda's tax lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told reporters that the relatives had exchanged Eid greetings with Khaleda. Earlier in the day, more than 50 BNP leaders and workers led by the party's joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy came to the police checkpoint near the special jail with flowers and other gifts for Khaleda. Gayeshwar gave the items to the police to hand them over to Khaleda. Gayeswar said: "I demand the release of the two leaders (Khaleda and Hasina). I believe their freedom will add speed to development activities in the country." Zubaida and daughter Jaima Rahman met Tarique in Dhaka Central Jail at 10am. Sharmila along with her daughters met Coco at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital at 10:30am. Joint forces arrested Khaleda with her second son Coco at their cantonment home on Sep 3. Tarique was arrested in a predawn raid on March 8. Joint forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in a corruption case. bdnew
