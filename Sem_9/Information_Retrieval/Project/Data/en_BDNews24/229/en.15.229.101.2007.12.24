 JUBA, Sudan, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Militias supported by Khartoum's army have attacked southern Sudanese soldiers near the north-south border killing dozens of people, southern army officials said on Monday. "Combined forces of the Murahaleen and the Popular Defence Forces (PDF) supported by elements of SAF (Sudan Armed Forces) attacked," said James Hoth, a major-general in the former rebel southern Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Hoth said the first fighting lasted for most of Saturday morning, after the armed group attacked an SPLA battalion on foot. "They were repulsed, (then) yesterday they attacked again. (Now) our people are expecting them to attack again." Hoth said the SPLA believe the attack was due to local tensions. "Somebody told them that we have gone beyond the border; that we are in the north," said Hoth. "They told the Murahaleen that we will not allow people to go to the south." The northern Sudanese Armed Forces denied they or the PDF took part in any attack. "This is a tribal issue. The nomadic Misseriya tribe had confrontations with some members of the SPLA which then escalated into clashes," the army spokesman said. The Murahaleen are drawn from northern nomadic tribes and access to southern pastures is vital for their cattle. Numbers of dead are not confirmed but SPLA spokesman Kuol Diem Kuol said soldiers at the scene told him 70 people had died. "Many deaths. More than 20 on our side and more than 50 from the other side," said Kuol. The northern army spokesman said they had reports of two Misseriya killed and 11 from the SPLA. Hoth told Reuters that although tension had been building along this border area, Saturday's attack had been a surprise. The SPLA signed a peace deal with Khartoum in 2005, ending decades of north-south war that claimed 2 million lives. Northern militias, including the PDF and Murahaleen forces, were mobilised by Khartoum in the south to support its war efforts. Under the deal armed groups had to join either the northern or southern army. The fighting follows a political crisis that threatened the 2005 peace deal. The former southern rebels walked out of the national coalition government in October accusing the northern National Congress Party of not implementing key parts of the deal, including demarcating the north-south border where many of Sudan's oil fields lie. In November Sudanese President Omar Hassan al Bashir called for the PDF to rearm, a move that sparked concern from the SPLA. The former rebels have said they planned to rejoin government on Dec. 27 after weeks of talks. The north-south conflict, which forced at least 4 million people to flee their homes, was Africa's longe
