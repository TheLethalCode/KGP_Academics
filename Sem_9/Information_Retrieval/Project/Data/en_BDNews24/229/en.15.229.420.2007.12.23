 Arun Devnath bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Climate change is faceless. Journalists put faces on it. Critics say the media often use apocalyptic visions of climate change. The media are blamed for using a loud voice to talk about cyclones, floods and droughts but suggesting solutions on a low-pitched note. Last month, the BBC took a different approachnever too loud but clearly audible: asking questions on climate change in Bangladesh, which ultimately guide people to the answer. What does climate change mean to ordinary people such as fishermen and farmers, who are the most vulnerable but seemingly unaware of it? In search of the answer in a community living apart from climate experts, BBC's Nazes Afroz took a trip to Bangladesh. The voyage under the broad heading "Taking the temperature", was an attempt to take a close look at how a heating planet is changing people's lives. "Does it matter (to people) if there is climate change?" Afroz, executive editor for BBC World Service's Asia and Pacific Region, said in an interview with bdnews24.com when he was in Dhaka. It was an attempt to tell simple stories free from climate change jargon. "These are all simple stories to tell," he said, explaining the purpose of the programme, "Bangladesh by river", which was launched ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali, Indonesia. "Climate change is a question about the existence of mankind," Afroz said, explaining the broader perspective of the programme, which pulled in journalists from 17 languagesthe first of its kind in BBC's history. The people who are affected by climate change know it for sure that changes are going on. And the BBC tried to find out how these changes relate to climate change. "We are not taking sides, but the fact remains that climate change is affecting not only Bangladesh, but other countries as well," he said. The BBC team started the month-long journey without knowing what was lurking aheadthe Nov 15 cyclone that killed more that 3,000 people and left a trail of devastation in its wake. The cyclone, known as Sidr, struck Bangladesh days before the UN Climate Change Conference began in Bali. The summit ended with an agreement to start negotiations for a new treaty on global warming as the United States fell into line, dropping opposition at the last minute. TANGIBLE STORIES At the journey's end on Nov 25, another BBC correspondent said: "The month-long BBC Bangladesh boat trip has come to an end, and what a momentous four weeks it's been!" Hours before the cyclone struck the costal Bangladesh, the BBC team arrived at a hotel in Bhuapur to escape the ravages of storm surges. Siobhann Tighe from BBC World Service's Outlook, who was on the team, spoke to some families who had lost their homes to the river Meghna. "Soil erosion is so visible here," Tighe reported from Ilisha Ghat, an area extremely vulnerable to river erosion and rising sea level. "It has to be said that soil erosion has happened since time began. But it's widely acknowledged now that soil erosion is becoming more rapid and is really swallowing up homes and property," she said. Nurul Islam Farazi, who has been living for 75 years close to the Meghna, shifted his home several times away from the river as it crept in. Farazi, interviewed by Tighe said: "The river has taken away a lot of things. The river is now touching my house." "There is no difference between life and death here, really. What can I do?" The effects of climate change loom large. Climate expert Saleemul Huq, who was aboard MV Aboshar with the BBC team, said Bangladeshis are "extremely resilient" to natural disasters. What can the rest of the world do to solve the problems? The first thing to do is, those who caused the problemsnamely those who are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions have to take the responsibility to reduce the emissions, he said. Is there any possibility of the people helping themselves? "They are helping themselves. They are not sitting idle. They are doing what they can. But there are limits to what they can do and that's where the rest of the world has the responsibility to do whatever they canto help," Huq said. Resilience is seen in the struggle of Ruma Akhter, 25, who lives with her family on the bank of the Meghna. She said she had seen two villages disappear into the river. Ruma was worried about her family as she lost farmlands to the river. But she did not give up the fight. "There are faces with the river," said Afroz who conceived the programme and led the BBC team. "These are all tangible stories." bdn
