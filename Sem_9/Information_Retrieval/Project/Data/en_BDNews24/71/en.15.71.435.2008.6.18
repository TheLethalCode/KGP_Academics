 Kushtia, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  The leader of a banned militant party died in an exchange of gunfire with Rapid Action Battalion in Kushtia early Wednesday, a RAB official said. RAB-12 Kushtia unit in-charge Maj Amzad Hossain said a woman known as Rikta also died with leader of Purbo Bangla Communist Party (MLA-Janajuddha) Abdur Rashid Malita, alias 'Dada Tapan'. A joint force of RAB-12, RAB-6 and detective branch police launched a search operation for Tapan, on a tip off, at Baradi Schoolpara village around 5.0 am. Tapan and his associates were said to be staying at Rikta's house. As the joint forces closed in, Tapan and his men began firing. RAB returned fire. Tapan died in the exchange of gunfire, though others managed to flee the scene. RAB also recovered Rikta's body and one AK-47 assault weapon, a handgun and ammunition from the scene, Maj Amzad said. The bodies were sent to Kushtia General Hospital for autopsy. Kushtia Sadar police chief Babul Uddin Sarder said there were around two dozen cases against the top leader of the banned party. RAB could not confirm whether Rikta was the wife of Tapan. Local villagers said they had seen her in the area for several days, but had never set eyes on Tapan. bdnews24.co
