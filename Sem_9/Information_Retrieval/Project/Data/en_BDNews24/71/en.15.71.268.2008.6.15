 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday ordered the government to explain why the sections of the Emergency Powers Ordinance and Emergency Powers Rules, which curb judicial powers and people's right to bail, would not be declared unconstitutional and illegal. The law secretary and the home secretary have been asked to turn in responses to the rule nisi in four weeks from now. But the HC did not stay the effectiveness of the Emergency Powers Ordinance or the Emergency Powers Rules. Justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Farid Ahmed ruled on public interest litigation by former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, New Age editor Nurul Kabir and Dhaka University teacher Sheikh Hafizur Rahman. They filed the petition with the HC on June 5, challenging the controversial sections of the ordinance and rules. Section 15 of the Emergency Powers Ordinance provides for trial of the cases filed before the promulgation of the state of emergency under the Emergency Powers Rules, barrister Amir-ul Islam, counsel for the writ petitioners, told reporters, after the court order. "In the rules, the tenure of punishment has been fixed. In other words, the authority of handing down punishment to the guilty has been given to the executive branch. It has created an imbalance," he said. The rules that deny bail are against the constitution and curb the powers of the judiciary, the lawyer said. The constitution and the laws have given the High Court powers to accept or consider bail appeals, barrister Amir-ul pointed out. "But this ordinance snatched bail powers from the court. The High Court's powers cannot be curbed by promulgating an ordinance. People have the right to bail. Curbing the right with the rules is not legal." bdnew
