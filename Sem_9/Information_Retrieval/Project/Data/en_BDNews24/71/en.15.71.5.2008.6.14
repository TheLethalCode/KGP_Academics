 BERNE, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dazzling Dutch qualified for the quarter-finals of Euro 2008 with a 4-1 destruction of France that left the World Cup runners-up hovering over the tournament trapdoor on Friday. Four days after crushing world champions Italy 3-0, Marco van Basten's side ripped the French apart with another superb performance based on their counter-attacking game. Dirk Kuyt, Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder scored for Netherlands, with Thierry Henry replying as France slid to their heaviest defeat in a major tournament finals since losing 5-2 to Brazil at the 1958 World Cup. The Dutch clinched first place in Group C with six points, four ahead of Romania. France and Italy, who meet in Zurich on Tuesday, have a point apiece with one game left. "We are very happy to have beaten the world champions and the World Cup finalists in the same week," said Van Basten. "We started well but then we were too passive under French pressure towards the end of the first half. "In the second we were dangerous even under French pressure. (Substitutes) Robben and Van Persie helped us do that." Kuyt opened the scoring with a powerful header in the ninth minute following a Rafael van der Vaart corner and poor marking by the defense. CHASING DEFENDERS The second goal after 59 minutes capped a swift counter attack involving Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robben who raced away from the chasing defenders before crossing low and hard for Van Persie, who had only been on the field for four minutes, to volley in. Henry, France's all-time leading scorer, had been guilty of the miss of the match five minutes earlier when he lobbed way over the bar with only Edwin van der Sar to beat. But he pulled one back after 71 minutes with his 45th goal for France in his 101st international. His joy was short-lived as 30 seconds later Robben scored from an almost impossible angle, lashing the ball past Coupet. Sneijder, who netted a superb goal against the Italians on Monday, produced an even better one when he completed the rout with a long-range shot in stoppage time. "The scoreline is tough if you look at the match but they did the same as they did against Italy, they relied on counter attacks," said Henry after France suffered their heaviest defeat since losing 4-0 to Poland in a friendly in 1982. "We created some chances but the Dutch took theirs beautifully. We played quite well ... now we have to beat Italy and hope Romania don't beat the Dutch
