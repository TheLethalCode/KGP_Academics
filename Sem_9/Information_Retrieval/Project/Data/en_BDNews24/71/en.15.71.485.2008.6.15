 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Saturday named a nine- member delegation to the dialogue with the government to be led by the party's acting president Zillur Rahman. The final decision came at a meeting of the party's central working committee, at the AL president's office in Dhanmondi. The party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam briefed reporters on the decision. The delegates to the dialogue would be Zillur Rahman, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser and Syed Ahsraful Islam. Sajeda Chowdhury presided over the meeting. Replying to a question, Ashraful said the party would give the government the names of its delegates in a letter in a day or two, after completion of formalities. Earlier, the Awami League had decided not to join dialogue, but changed its mind after the release of party chief Sheikh Hasina. The ALCWC meeting expressed satisfaction over the release of Hasina. At the same time, it thanked the people for building up public opinion for her release. The party demanded permanent release of the former prime minister. Expressing concern at the increase in the prices of potatoes after the budget, he said: "Presenting two consecutive budgets outside parliament has created a bad practice. We want that such an incident does not recur." The meeting also set the Awami League founding anniversary programme for June 23. bdnews
