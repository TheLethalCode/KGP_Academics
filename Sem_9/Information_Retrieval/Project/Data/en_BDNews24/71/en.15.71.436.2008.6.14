 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)- Prof M Tamim, special aide to the chief adviser, said Saturday fuel subsidy would stand at Tk 16,000 crore in the forthcoming fiscal year, if fuel prices remained high on the world market. The amount of subsidy in all sectors will reach about Tk 26,000 crore, which is higher than the allocation for the annual development programme set at Tk 25,600 crore for the next fiscal year, Tamim said in his speech to a seminar on energy. The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources, said: "Ensuring energy security is not possible if fuel prices are not adjusted." Tamin stressed the need for the prices to be adjusted in line with the purchasing power of people. "We are selling Tk 90 worth of diesel for Tk 40. If the present price of liquid fuel remains unchanged, we will have to give subsidy of Tk 16,000 crore in this sector for the next fiscal year," he explained. "We will also have to give another Tk 2,000 crore subsidy in the power sector. Subsidy on fertiliser will stand at about Tk 5,000 crore. Food subsidy will be Tk 3,000 crore to Tk 4,000 crore." "In total we will have to count subsidy to the tune of more than Tk 26,000 crore." Tamim said, "Twenty-five percent of the population gets power. Of them, 80 percent live in towns and enjoy power subsidy." The chief adviser's special assistant said BAPEX would have to spend Tk 70 per cubic metre to discover new gas. International oil companies will have to spend up to Tk 110. "If gas sells at a price lower than Tk 150, the companies will suffer losses," he said. "Keeping this reality in mind, the price has to be fixed to ensure energy security." Energy Division secretary Mohammad Mohsin said: "Dependence on gas is so deep that we cannot concentrate on other things. We now realise the paucity of gas." "We should search for an alternative. Coal can be the only alternative." Power Division secretary Fouzul Kabir Khan said: "Production has not increased keeping pace with demand." "At present, the government is working with a merchant power plant policy. Private entrepreneurs will produce power and sell. The government will assist in transmission and distribution." Dhaka University Prof Badrul Imam said the prospective blocks were being given to foreign firms instead of BAPEX, which would force the government to buy gas from IOCs at higher prices. BUET professor Ijaz Hossain said: "For energy security, we will have to take a regional initiative. Electricity can be imported from India. In that case, India can demand a transit. I don't know what the problem is, if transit is approved for them." The Forum for Energy Reporters, Bangladesh organised the seminar. bdnews
