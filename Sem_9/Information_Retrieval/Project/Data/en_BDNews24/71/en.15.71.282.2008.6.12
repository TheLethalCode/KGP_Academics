 HARARE, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean police arrested opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai on Thursday while he was campaigning for the country's June 27 presidential run-off election, his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said. It is the third time in little more than a week that Tsvangirai has been detained by police. Earlier on Thursday, police arrested the party's secretary general at Harare airport as he flew in from South Africa. The opposition and human rights groups accuse President Robert Mugabe's government of waging a campaign of arrests and violent intimidation ahead of the run-off with Tsvangirai. "Morgan Tsvangirai has been arrested by Zimbabwean police and is currently being held at Kwekwe police station. He and his entourage of 20 people were detained at a roadblock outside of Kwekwe while conducting a campaign tour through Midlands province," the MDC said in a statement. Tsvangirai was leaving Kwekwe, 200 km (125 miles) west of Harare when he and his convoy were stopped at a roadblock and taken to a police station. There were more than 20 cars in the convoy, including a tour bus. "We have been detained at the police station and they are saying they want to search for something," Tsvangirai's spokesman George Sibotshiwe told Reuters by telephone. "This is just a deliberate attempt to delay us, it is just harassment." On the phone, Tsvangirai could be heard asking a police officer what crime he had committed and saying that the bus, on which a large poster of the MDC leader's face was displayed, was part of the opposition campaign strategy. PREMATURE ANNOUCEMENT Police said MDC secretary general Biti was wanted in connection with prematurely announcing the results of the first round of voting. Biti, the party's number three, left the country soon after disputed March 29 elections to gather African support. "He was wanted in connection with the premature announcement of results before the official announcement of results by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission," said police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena. Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the first round of elections in March but not by enough to avoid a run-off, according to official figures. The MDC says ZANU-PF activists have killed 66 opposition supporters to try to intimidate voters before the run-off. The ruling party blames the opposition for the political violence. Observers from southern African regional body SADC said monitoring the elections would be a big challenge. Monitors from Western countries critical of Mugabe will not be allowed. "It is a mammoth task," SADC official Tanki Mothae said before the deployment of 120 observers out of 400. Mothae said SADC wanted to help Zimbabwe run a free and fair poll: "This is to help the people of Zimbabwe go through this election as peacefully as possible." Mugabe's support has been eroded by the economic collapse of the once prosperous country, which he has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980. Critics blame Zimbabwe's decline on Mugabe's policies, including the seizure of white-owned farms. Some of the most fertile farms have gone to supporters who were ill-equipped to properly engage in agriculture. The official Herald newspaper quoted Mugabe as saying only 42 percent of the land was under full use and renewing threats to re-possess farms that were not being properly used in a country suffering food shortages and economic collapse.
