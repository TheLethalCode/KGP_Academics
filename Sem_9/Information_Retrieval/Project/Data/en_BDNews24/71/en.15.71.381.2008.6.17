 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Tuesday the caretaker government was working to bring stability to the country's politics. "Our work should be viewed from a broader perspective," the adviser told reporters after the dialogue with Samyabadi Dal at the Chief Adviser's Office. On whether the government showed an overly humanitarian attitude to those "responsible for 1/11", the adviser said: "I would like to remind you all of our responsibility. We are working with a sense of responsibility and have a huge task of achieving a stable situation in politics." "Our viewpoint is not isolated. We have a broader perspective." On whether former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her sons would be released and whether there would be any condition attached, the adviser said: "We have a clear stand. The government has taken two points into accountthe legal process and humanitarian grounds." "There is no change in it. We are thinking of a solution. All of us should think the same way." On the dialogue with the Awami League, Hossain Zillur said: "The Awami League has sent us a list of delegates. We will set the schedule at a convenient time." "We have invited the BNP as well. Now we are waiting for its response. We want to proceed with all." Samyabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua said his party had placed a 29-point charter of demands during the dialogue with cabinet members. The demands include lifting the ban on trade union, withdrawal of the state of emergency and an effort to continue the anticorruption drive. The party also asked the government to bar corrupt people from contesting the elections, announcing an election date, holding national elections prior to local government polls and introducing a rationing system for rural people. bdnews24.c
