<TITLE> Scolari ready to make five changes v Switzerland </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari will probably make five changes and use all three substitutes for Sunday's final Euro 2008 Group A match against eliminated Switzerland. He said, however, that stability would still be his main aim for what is effectively a warm-up before his group winners take on the runners-up from Group B in a quarter-final on Thursday. "We have to think of the coming matches. To get the best results we can use the reserves in our bank account," Scolari told reporters on the eve of the Swiss game in Basel. "I will make about five changes before the match and the standard three (substitutions) during it," said Scolari, whose team reached the quarter-finals with a game to spare after beating Czech Republic 3-1 on Wednesday. "I can't make 10 or 11 changes because I need a stable team but it is an opportunity to give some players playing time. "We still have to get through two more phases to get to the final," he said. Germany look likely quarter-final rivals in Basel on June 19 but Scolari said they had yet to take the other qualifying berth in Group B behind Croatia and so he was not preparing specifically to meet the Germans. "I'm not preparing for Germany, they have not yet qualified, I have them in mind because I'm watching matches but we have to wait. "I like Germany, they are very well organised, they have good tactics, they're well prepared but at this moment there is no certainty," he said. "There is still Austria, who are a home team. They had a revival after their last match. We have a plan A and B (for the quarter-finals)." Germany still need to beat Austria in Vienna on Monday to make sure of runners-up spot behind Group B winners Croatia
