<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Tue Jun 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful South Korean labor group on Tuesday announced a one-day strike next month to protest against President Lee Myung-bak's economic reform plans, adding pressure on the embattled leader facing calls for his ouster. The move by the more than 600,000-strong Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which represents auto, healthcare and financial service workers, comes as Lee is trying to resolve a truckers' strike over soaring fuel costs that has paralyzed the export-dependent country's ports. "We will be going on a full-out strike for one day on July 2," a KCTU spokesman said. "Following that, individual member unions will be holding separate strikes." The one-day strike is not as drastic as a plan some leaders of the militant KCTU had previously unveiled to local media, which called for an escalating series of work stoppages from this week that would increasingly hurt the economy. About 70 percent of KCTU members voted to strike against Lee's privatization plans, pro-business economic reforms and the deal his government signed to resume imports of U.S. beef, the group said in a statement. The KCTU-affiliated union at the country's largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor, said it would join the one-day strike. "Our battle fully complies with the will of the people and is a judgment against the Lee Myung-bak government's drive to deepen social disparity with 'the market-knows-best' policy," the KCTU statement said. SUPPORT DIVES Lee, who scored a landslide victory in a December election, has seen his support rate nosedive due to mass street protests that started in response to a U.S. beef import deal struck in April and have grown into rallies denouncing his policy plans. Analysts said the truckers' strike could begin to cause major damage to exporters in a matter of days as supplies run out and finished goods pile up. A leading trade agency said lost business from the strike amounted to $4.3 billion as of Monday. Lee ended a decade of left-leaning rule when came into office in February with pledges to grow Asia's fourth-largest economy by 6 percent this year. That now seems overly ambitious in the face of record high oil prices and a global slowdown. Prolonged labor stoppages would only make matter worse, economists said. The truckers were joined by KCTU-affiliated construction workers on Monday, who walked off the job demanding higher pay and cheaper fuel for their equipment. That sent shares of builders down on Tuesday on concerns that projects would suffer. "Sectors that are directly affected by the walkout in construction and manufacturing sectors are under a lot of pressure as the strike seems set to be prolonged," said Kim Joon-kie, a market analyst at SK Securities. In Washington, top South Korean and US trade officials worked to defuse public anger in South Korea over the beef deal by trying to find a way to limit the shipment of U.S. beef from cattle older than 30 months. A new parliament, where Lee's conservative Grand National Party commands a majority, has not been able to start due to a boycott by opposition lawmakers, delaying Lee's plans for tax cuts and pension reforming. Lee, who sits for a single, five-year term, has faced street protests since early May, with many South Koreans saying the former Hyundai Construction CEO seems more concerned about pushing through his plans than listening to the public. Lee, who last week pledged to make a fresh start, is expected to soon announce in a few days a cabinet reshuffle and a new line-up for his inner circle at the presidential Blue House. "The key to solving this problem is himself," said Jeong Chan-soo, Min Political Consulting executive director
