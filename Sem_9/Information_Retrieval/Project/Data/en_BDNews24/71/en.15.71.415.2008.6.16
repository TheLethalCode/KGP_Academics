 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The prosecution in the Niko graft case, filed against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others, presented the charges brought against the accused in court Monday. State prosecutors ABM Sharfuddin Ahmed and Syed Shamim Ahsan Habib told the Special Judge's Court-2, presided over by judge Amar Kumar Roy, that they had adequate documents to prove the charges in the case. Defence counsel will reply to the charges when proceedings resume on June 22. Advocate Sahara Khatun was present in court on Hasina's behalf Monday as the former prime minster has been exempted from personally appearing in court while she seeks medical treatment overseas. Former energy secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury and former state minister for power Rafiqul Islam were also present in the court. Hasina's lawyer, Syed Rezaur Rahman, told the court the defence could not reply to the charges on Monday as barrister Shafik Ahmed, one of the chief defence lawyers, was not present in court. The defence would present its arguments for acquittal at the next hearing, advocate Rezaur said. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year, and pressed charges against the Awami League president and nine others on May 7. Hasina stands accused of approving a deal with Niko Resources Ltd in 2001, during her term as a prime minister, which cost the government Tk 13,630.50 crore in losses. The case details allege that Canadian firm Niko was "very inefficient" in different aspects of its operations, including technical expertise in oil exploration, but the deal was approved in violation of proper procedure. Other charged in the case are former principal secretary of the prime minister's office SA Samad, former energy secretary M Akmal Hossain, former chairman of Petro Bangla Md Mosharraf Hossain, Niko Resources Bangladesh Ltd vice president Kashem Sharif, former secretary of external resources division AKM Mashiur Rahman and former director of Petro Bangla Syed Anwarul Haque. bdnews24.
