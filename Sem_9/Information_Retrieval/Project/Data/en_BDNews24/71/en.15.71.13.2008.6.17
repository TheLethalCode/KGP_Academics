<TITLE> Ballack fires Germany into next round </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Klagenfurt, June 16 (bdnews24.com)----- Michael Ballack's spectacular second-half strike handed Germany a last eight tie against Portugal at the expense of Austria who exited Euro 2008. The Chelsea midfielder scored the only goal of the match when he fired in a powerful 30-yard shot from a free-kick won by Philipp Lahm. Austria's best chance fell to Andreas Ivanschitz whose shot was blocked. Germany edged the opening 45 minutes but it appeared Joachim Low's Plan A - asking his men to give prominence to their defensive duties - was a risky strategy. The cliche that the best form of defence is attack would have been a better tactic for the German side to apply because they were often caught dithering on the ball in the first half. And when they were not dithering, they were guilty of giving the ball away. Fortunately, for the three times European champions Austria have been unable to make the most of the gifts that have come their way in the previous two games and against their neighbours little had changed. For all their attacking endeavour, largely orchestrated by Umit Korkmaz and Erwin Hoffer, they only once managed to pierce a flimsy German defence when Hoffer found himself clear in the area only to let himself down with a poor first touch. Low joined Germany chancellor Angela Merkel in the stands The Germans were not much better but they did look more threatening and should have taken the lead early on with one of the easiest chances any player will get at this championship. The guilty party was Gomez, later substituted, who mis-kicked from two yards after great work from Miroslav Klose down the right. Their other chance was created and despatched by the more potent Lukas Podolski who stung the hands of Jurgen Macho from 25 yards. Although the atmosphere was highly charged most of the players kept their cool, which could not be said for coaches Low and Josef Hickersberger who were sent to the stands shortly before the break by referee Manuel Mejuto Gonzalez for what appeared to be an ongoing spat between the pair. Whatever effect that had on the German team appeared to be positive as they came out after the interval with a roaring fire in their bellies. That new found venom was symbolised by Ballack's strike which eased the worries for his side. The marauding Lahm won a free-kick when he was fouled after a tremendous run towards the penalty area. Chelsea midfielder Ballack stepped up to the mark and launched a torpedo-like effort into Macho's top-left corner. From that point on Germany looked odds-on to seal their ninth win in 12 competitive matches against Austria.
