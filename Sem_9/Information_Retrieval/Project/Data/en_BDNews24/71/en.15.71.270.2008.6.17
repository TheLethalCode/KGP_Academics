<TITLE> Podolski doubtful for quarter final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TENERO, Switzerland, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lukas Podolski injured his calf in Germany's 1-0 win over Austria and is a doubt for the Euro 2008 quarter-final against Portugal. "He definitely won't train today and it's going to be tight for Thursday," coach Joachim Loew told a news conference on Tuesday. "The medical department will do everything they can to get him fit but he had real problems in the second half against Austria (on Monday)." Playing as a midfielder, Podolski has scored three of Germany's four goals in the tournament and with forwards Mario Gomez and Miroslav Klose in poor form his absence would be a significant blow for Loew's side. Loew said Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was suspended against Austria, would probably return on Thursday. "He didn't start in either of the first two games but when he came on he gave us pace and creativity," said the coach. "I expect him to be back in the team on Thursday." Loew also expressed confidence in Gomez. "I'm sure we can still benefit from his abilities at this tournament," he said. "His finishing has been disappointing so far but he's not just standing there. He's working hard and helping the team.
