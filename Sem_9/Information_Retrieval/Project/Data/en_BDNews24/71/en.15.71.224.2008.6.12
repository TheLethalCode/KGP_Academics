 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)A buying spree led Dhaka stocks to finish higher on the closing day of the week after witnessing a massive fall Wednesday. Investors were in buying across the day as prices witnessed a fall the previous day due to panic-selling caused by fears that the market regulator might impose some restrictions on trading, according to brokerage houses. Meanwhile, market watchers said scrips were still highly-overpriced. "Although the market went through a price correction Wednesday, scrips are still overpriced," said DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed. The overheated situation will lead to huge losses for small-scale investors, he added.
