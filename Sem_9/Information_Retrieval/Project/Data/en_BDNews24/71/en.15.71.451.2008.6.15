<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)Awami League is ready to make reforms within the party in preparation for registration by the Election Commission, a senior AL leader said Sunday. "But the regulations regarding registration of political parties remain in draft form. The (electoral reform) law has not yet been passed," acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after a meeting with the German ambassador. "If the law is passed, reforms will take place in the parties. We have to change our party constitution. Otherwise we will not get registered." German ambassador Frank Meike had earlier met with acting AL president Zillur Rahman at the latter's Gulshan home. Ashraful was also present. Frank Meike told reporters after the meeting that Awami League was very positive on reforms in the party. The German envoy said parties should reform with a view to ending to political conflict. He said the investors of his country wanted to see a sustained democracy in Bangladesh for the sake of investment. Ashraful also said German investors were awaiting a green signal. "They want an end to the current situation," he said. The AL leader hoped the caretaker government would create a congenial environment for reforms of political parties. On the dialogue with the government, he said: "The dialogue will not be successful if the parties attend for the sake of mere participation." "The dialogue will continue until a consensus is created on issues including the election date, lifting of emergency, how the elections will be held and how a favourable environment will be created." The AL will hold discussions with its 14 alliance partners prior to joining the dialogue, Ashraful said. He told bdnews24.com that the party president Sheikh Hasina, who was released the previous week to seek medical treatment abroad, would go from Boston to Florida for ear treatment. Hasina would return to Bangladesh as early as possible after treatment, Ashraful added. bdnews
