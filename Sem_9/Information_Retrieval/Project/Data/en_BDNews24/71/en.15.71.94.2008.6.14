<TITLE> Don't lump Hasina with corrupt people: Menon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon said Saturday the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina must not be lumped with the release of corrupt people. The comment came a day after Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain urged the caretaker government not to wilt under pressure or rush the trials of those accused of graft. The veiled criticism of the government's decision of releasing Hasina apparently irked the Awami League. Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam held a meeting Saturday with Menon and the Workers Party's general secretary Bimal Biswas to build a consensus ahead of AL's dialogue with the caretaker government. Menon said: "It won't be right to compare Sheikh Hasina's release with the release of corrupt people. We did not demand the release of any corrupt person." Ashraful said, "Dr Kamal Hossain is a respected person. He is like a guardian. What he said was a personal comment. But we expect decent comments from him." On Friday, Dr Kamal also urged law adviser AF Hassan Ariff not to falter in dispensing justice. The meeting between the AL and WP, held at the latter's central office on Topkhana Road, discussed the latest political development. On behalf of his party, Menon welcomed the release of Hasina, chief of AL. Menon said: "The Awami League and Workers Party have the same stand. The Awami League made a significant decision by agreeing to participate in dialogue." "We have discussed efforts to take dialogue forward. We had discussed with the Awami League before going to dialogue. Now they are discussing with us before they go to the talks," Menon said. Both parties demand withdrawal of the state of emergency before the election and the national polls before all other elections. "A free election is not possible under the state of emergency. The emergency must be withdrawn completely." "We demand that the government prioritise national elections," Menon said. Ashraful said, "I express gratitude to the Workers Party for its role in the release of Sheikh Hasina. We are going to take part in the dialogue. We have come here to build a consensus. We will sit with other allies as well." The AL leader said the party would raise the issues of withdrawal of the emergency rule and national elections ahead of all other polls, during the dialogue. bdnews
