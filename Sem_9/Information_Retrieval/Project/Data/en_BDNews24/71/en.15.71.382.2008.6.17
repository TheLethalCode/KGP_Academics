 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)- The World Bank Tuesday approved $320 million in two budget support operations to assist Bangladesh in implementing governance issues, economic policy and energy reform agenda. The $200 million in transitional support credit is designed to help reduce pressure on the coming fiscal year budget, which is staggering under the weight of adverse external shocks that include the twin floods and cyclone Sidr as well as rising prices of commodities, particularly oil, food, and fertiliser. The $120 million power sector development policy credit aims to enhance governance and accountability, and promote financial stability in the power sector. "It will support the government's overall power sector reform programme, including procurement of privately financed power generation, corporatisation of state-owned operating companies, and institutional strengthening of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission," the WB said in a statement. The WB's total concessionary lending to Bangladesh in 2007-08 was $683 million, up from $379 million in 2006-2007. Of the total resources provided by the lending agency in 2007-08, $495 million was in budget support. "These budget support loans helped the caretaker government in managing its FY07-08 budgetary finances, particularly following successive floods, cyclone Sidr, and increasing global food and petroleum prices." bdnews
