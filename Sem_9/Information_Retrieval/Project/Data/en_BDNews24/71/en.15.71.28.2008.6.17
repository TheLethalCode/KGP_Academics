<TITLE> Giant Vieira model adds to glum Zurich mood </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZURICH, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 17-metre high model of Patrick Vieira at Zurich train station gave arriving France fans a stark and unwelcome reminder that their injured captain would miss Tuesday's Group C clash with Italy. The enormous plastic figure, held up by strings alongside other statues of top Euro 2008 players, helped to further subdue the mood ahead of what should have been an eagerly-anticipated repeat of the last World Cup final. The nervous tension was already palpable given that both Italy and France could be eliminated later whatever the result. If Romania win against already-qualified Netherlands in the other final group match in Berne, the game between the under-performing world champions and France becomes meaningless. The dreary Swiss weather also led to the slightly sombre atmosphere with just a smattering of fans wandering Zurich's streets, occasionally hooting horns. Unlike the boisterous and colourful Dutch, Italian and French fans are more reserved and never travel in huge numbers to watch their national teams abroad. However, a sizeable contingent was expected to liven up proceedings later with Zurich just a few hours by train from both countries. "There's going to be an exceptionally good atmosphere. Two years ago they played in the World Cup final and here everything is at stake again," retired former Italy midfielder Roberto Di Matteo told Reuters in Zurich. The professional ticket touts swarming the station certainly see it as one of the biggest games of the tournament. LESS FLAGS Touts have come from England just to make money from buying and selling tickets with the average price for a seat at Tuesday's game around 1,000 euros ($1,551). For the best spot in the Letzigrund, a mad keen fan would have to pay 1,600 euros. One man searching for a ticket needed to brush up on his language skills if he was going to have success. His sign read: "Ainid tikit." The Swiss locals are steering well clear of the touts with their interest in the tournament waning now that co-hosts Switzerland and Austria have been knocked out. There are noticeably fewer flags fluttering from buildings and car aerials in Zurich compared to the start of the month. Italy fans waved a few tricolours but generally they believe fate is against them after controversial refereeing decisions in the 3-0 defeat by the Dutch and 1-1 draw with Romania. "They need some luck. At the end of the day it can make or break you," Di Matteo said at a McDonald's even
