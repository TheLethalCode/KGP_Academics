 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Tuesday urged "nationalist forces" and like-minded parties to unite in an effort to ensure a fair election. Speaking at an indoor rally, the first by the four-party alliance after the ban on indoor politics was lifted, the BNP leader said: "Nationalist forces must unite to form a democratic government through a fair election. We don't want a confrontation and bloodshed. We want a fair election." Delwar demanded freedom for former prime minister Khaleda Zia and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami for creating "an environment for dialogue and a fair election". The BNP leader called for an immediate release of Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco to send them abroad for medical treatment. The four-party alliance plans to roll out more programmes to press home its demands. The BNP secretary general termed the trial of the accused under emergency powers rules farce. Tuesday's rally was organised at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh to press the demand for release of Khaleda and Nizami. The last rally of the alliance was held in front of BNP central office at Naya Paltan on Oct 27, 2006. Khaleda and Nizami had been present there. Delwar questioned the legality of the caretaker government staying in power and said: "This government itself is illegal. But it is making laws one after another. These are also illegal." Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency. "It is a curse for the country. Withdraw emergency rule by June 30. A conspiracy is going on to destroy Ziaur Rahman's family and make the country a vassal state. It has to be resisted." Khelafat Majlish chairman Maulana Mohammad Ishaque said the government is trying to bring anti-Islam force to power. "People won't accept it." Bangladesh Jatiya party (BJP) chairman barrister Andalib Rahman Partha also spoke. bdnew
