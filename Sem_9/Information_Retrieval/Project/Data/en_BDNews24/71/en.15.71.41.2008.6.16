 BADEN, Austria, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World champions Italy hope the bad luck they feel they have suffered at Euro 2008 will not return in Tuesday's crunch match with France. The world champions felt hard done by in Friday's 1-1 Group C draw with Romania when Luca Toni had a goal wrongly flagged offside and Tom Henning Ovrebo awarded a disputed late penalty, which Gianluigi Buffon saved to keep Italy in the tournament. A controversial opening goal by Ruud van Nistelrooy led to the Netherlands beating Italy 3-0 in their first game, where an Italy defence bereft of an injured Fabio Cannavaro was exposed. Despite their misfortunes, Italy could still reach the last eight with a draw, depending on the result of the game between Romania, who have two points, and already-qualified Netherlands. "Up to now the referees have made us feel unlucky both against Netherlands and Romania. I hope we have used up the errors coming to us," defender Giorgio Chiellini told reporters. Slovakian referee Lubos Michel has been put in charge of Tuesday's rematch of the 2006 World Cup final, a choice which made Buffon feel their luck could be changing. "It give some guarantees. We deserve a respected referee for a decisive game," the goalkeeper told a news conference. However, the Azzurri know they shoulder most of the blame for having just one point. Roberto Donadoni's side thoroughly deserved to lose against the rampant Dutch and although they created more chances in the Romania game they were far from stylish in their slightly desperate approach. "We can not hide behind (referees' decisions). We must play the game of our lives against France," Buffon added as he prepared for the game in Zurich. "France, like us, are a bit surprised to have one point after two matches. But it is only two games which have gone. We all know the qualities of my team mates.
