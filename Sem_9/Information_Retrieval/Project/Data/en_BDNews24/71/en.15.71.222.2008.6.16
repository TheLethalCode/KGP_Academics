<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government has moved to roll out a new ordinance to govern the Zila Parishad, which will keep a provision for a chairman and two vice-chairmen to be elected by direct vote, an adviser said Monday. Of the two vice-chairmen, one must be a woman in a plan modelled on the Upazila Parishad Ordinance 2008. The drafts of Zila Parishad Ordinance and Union Parishad Ordinance will be presented at a cabinet meeting soon, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal said. "The two ordinances have been fianlised." Iqbal said the system of nominating advisers for the Upazila Parishad from local lawmakers has been eliminated thanks to a new ordinance. "Local government bodies will be able to work independently." The Election Commission can announce the local government polls schedule at a convenient time, Iqbal said. bdnew
