 SALZBURG, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia coach Guus Hiddink said Saturday's 1-0 win over Greece that knocked the holders out of Euro 2008 was the result of some tough sessions with his squad. Having branded his team naive after a 4-1 defeat by Spain in their first Group D match, the Dutchman said they had now proved that they could step up to the mark. "I'm very proud of the team. We had some good sessions and some tense sessions caused by me to see how the players would react," he told a news conference. "I am happy with the reaction because the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but based on everyone doing his job defensively very well." "They showed tonight that they know what international high standard football is." Hiddink said it had not all been perfect and there were still plenty of things to work on before they face Sweden in their final group match on Wednesday in Innsbruck. Russia must win to join group winners Spain in the quarter-finals while Sweden will qualify with a draw. SOME MISTAKES "There were some mistakes which could have caused all sorts of problems, but that's football. We gave away in the first half too many unnecessary free kicks," he said. "We should have killed the game before  if you create on an international level five or six chances, which is not easy, you must at least have a score of 50 percent." The match-winning goal came from Konstantin Zyryanov in the first half and Russia had chances to extend their lead with striker Roman Pavlyuchenko missing out several times. Hiddink said he had some injury concerns following what he deemed to have been a very physical game. "I think we have some damage," he said. "There were problems with (midfield pair) Yuri Zhirkov and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov, I don't know if it will be solved in a few days." However, they can look forward to the return from suspension of playmaker Andrei Arshavin, who missed the first two matches. "I think we have to step up because Sweden is even stronger," said Hiddink. "We are outsiders of course but outsiders can do a good job, we proved that tonight.
