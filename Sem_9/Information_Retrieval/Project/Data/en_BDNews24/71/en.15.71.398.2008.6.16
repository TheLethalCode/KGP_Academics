<TITLE> Bush contemplates writing his memoir </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush, scrutinised in books by former colleagues including a blistering critique by his ex-spokesman, is considering writing a memoir of his own. Bush has been silent on former spokesman Scott McClellan's book, which said the White House shaded the truth and conducted a propaganda campaign to make its case to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. Asked if he planned to pen his own book after leaving office in January, Bush said it was a possibility. "I'm going to think about that, yes -- writing a book," Bush said in an interview with Britain's Observer newspaper published on Sunday. The White House and former Bush aides have dismissed McClellan's book and allegations and have also questioned why he did not speak up if he disagreed with policy decisions or the way events were presented. Bush's predecessor Bill Clinton wrote a best-selling book after leaving office that chronicled his life as well as his eight years in the White House. He has made more than $23 million from his memoir "My Life". Bush also said he never saw the award-winning network television show "The West Wing" about a fictitious U.S. president, preferring instead to watch sports and read books. "I seriously don't watch TV. You know, I watch sports, but I'd much rather read books. And I do. I read a lot," he said according to a transcript released by the White House.
