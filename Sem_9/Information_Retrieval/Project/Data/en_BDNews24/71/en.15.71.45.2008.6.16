<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Past results and an ability to communicate with players have made coach Luiz Felipe Scolari confident about his new Premier League career with Chelsea. Scolari, who will end a five and a half year stint with Portugal when their campaign at Euro 2008 comes to an end, will take over at Chelsea on July 1. "I think I'm a relatively good coach because of all I've done for teams up to nowthe results speak for themselves," said Scolari, who steered his native Brazil to World Cup glory in 2002. "I likea good atmosphere, to feel comfortable anywhere, to establish good working relations," he said on Saturday night. "I speak English, German, Italian, French," he joked on being asked if he spoke English or when he would start learning it. "The language of football is only one language, so don't worry, I communicate." Scolari has been a national team coach since 2000 when he took charge of Brazil. Having steered them to their fifth World Cup, he then increased Portugal's growing international standing by steering them to the final of Euro 2004 as hosts and the 2006 World Cup semi-finals. However, he pointed a his vast experience at club level, saying: "I coached club sides for 18 to 20 years so I know the ins and outs, so there's no problem." Scolari won the Libertadores Cup, South America's equivalent of the Champions League, with Gremio and Palmeiras in the 1990s. CHELSEA OBJECTIVE The chief objective facing the 59-year-old at Chelsea is to win the Champions League. Chelsea lost last month's final to Manchester United on penalties. Scolari, who had a reputation for pragmatic football in the Brazilian league, brushed off the suggestion he might be a hard driving and temperamental man, saying "if you want to know what I'm really like ask my wife." Personality was something important he looked for in players. "First I look for technical qualities, then personal qualities and how they work as a unit because we are a team," he said. "In the national squad you have to accept certain realities, learn to live with other players, make some concessions so we can all reach our objective. Personal qualities are vital for a team." Scolari said the news that he would no longer be in charge of Portugal after Euro 2008 had not affected the harmony of his squad who reached the last eight with a match to spare in their group. Portugal players have said they respect Scolari, will miss him as coach and had not lost sight of their aim at the tournament. "Part of being a coach is to be a friend for the player," captain Nuno Gomes said. "It's important to have those human qualities, he's a good psychologist and that for us is also important.
