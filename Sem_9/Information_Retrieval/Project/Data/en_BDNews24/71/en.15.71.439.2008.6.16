 ZURICH, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heavyweights Italy and France, used to battling it out with a trophy at stake, will face each other on Tuesday with the prize of merely surviving the group stage at Euro 2008 to fight for. The final act in Group C will see one of the last two World Cup finalists, or maybe both, on the tournament scrapheap after their showdown on Zurich's Letzigrund pitch. The pair's fate is out of their hands with unfancied Romania certain to qualify if they beat Netherlands. The Dutch outplayed Italy and France in quick succession to make sure of winning the group. France, struggling to find the right mix between ageing stalwarts and promising youngsters, will go through only if they overcome their Latin rivals and Romania do not beat the Dutch. Apart from a win, Italy, who have also looked rusty and surprisingly vulnerable at the back, might just squeeze through with a scoring draw, or even with a goalless draw, providing Romania lose 3-0 or by a four-goal margin. The match would have been dramatic enough in any circumstances, Italy having beaten France on penalties in the 2006 World Cup final featuring Zinedine Zidane's infamous headbutt, to name just one episode in their colourful history. Italian and French media are both worried that Netherlands will field a weakened side against Romania or the players will pull out of tackles to avoid injury. "We have put ourselves in that situation and only have ourselves to blame for it," said France coach Raymond Domenech. "We should not worry about the Dutch, nor should they worry about us." CASSANO CONSIDERED Domenech, who could be excused for feeling let down by his old guard in general and his defence in particular, could opt for a revamped side with Lilian Thuram and Willy Sagnol likely to lose their places at the back. His Italian counterpart Roberto Donadoni is not expected to be so radical but has hinted he was considering bringing forward Antonio Cassano into the side. "The fact I have played him for a little bit of the two games against Netherlands and Romania shows that he impresses me," Donadoni told reporters. "I think he is a top player, I have brought him with me and it is possible he will play." While Donadoni will hope for some Cassano wizardry to brighten Italy's horizons, Domenech might give young striker Karim Benzema, confined to the bench against the Dutch, a chance to show off his skills. The two coaches' jobs could be threatened if they were to be send packing from a tournament they both aspired to win so early. Domenech, however, did his best to sound excited rather than worried before what is likely to be a tense affair. "It's a fantastic opportunity", he said. "I'm not saying we'll win but I know we'll fight. The players have a lot to prove. Not making the most of it would be stupid.
