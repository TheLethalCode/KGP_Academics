 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  The wife and daughter of Tarique Rahman, elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, formally petitioned the government Sunday to send him abroad for better medical treatment. Tarique's lawyers submitted the application to the home ministry on behalf of Zubaida Rahman; daughter Zaima Rahman also signed the application. The petition cited a series of ailments, including upper back pain, right hip arthopathy (a disease of a joint), narrow-angle glaucoma and chest pain. Tarique has also been suffering from severe pain during stepping, limping gait, neck pain and severe back muscle spasm, according to the petition. Barrister Nawshad Zamir, emerging from the meeting told reporters: "We have submitted an application to the home adviser and home secretary on behalf of Tariqu'e wife and daughter." "We have requested the government to approve the application, considering his health reports, and make arrangements for better treatment." "We have informed the home adviser and secretary that Tarique needs overseas treatment as he is not showing any improvement here," Nawshad said. The lawyer said both the home adviser and home secretary had assured him that they would take necessary steps on the matter. No separate appeal will be made on the treatment of Khaleda Zia, Nawshad said. The BNP secretary general has made a statement on the issue, he added. On whether any appeal was made on Coco's behalf, he said: "We have not applied for Coco's treatment. His family might do it." Tarique, senior BNP joint secretary general, was arrested on Mar 8 last year, and faces a series of graft cases. He is currently under detention and receiving treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. bdnews24.com/mk/a
