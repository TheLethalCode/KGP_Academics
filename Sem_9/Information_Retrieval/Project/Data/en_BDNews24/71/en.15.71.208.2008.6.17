 KLAGENFURT, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Otto Beenhakker offered no excuses for Poland's poor showing at Euro 2008 after Monday's 1-0 defeat by Croatia and was happy to name the players who had not come up to scratch. "We have tried and it was not enough, and this is what we've seen in the whole tournament," he told a news conference following their group stage exit. "It's no secret that very important players like Ebi Smolarek (dropped on Monday), Jacek Krzynowek and Mariusz Lewandowski played at a much higher level in qualifying." In the last two World Cups and now in their debut European Championship, Poland have qualified well but performed like rabbits caught in the headlights once the real action starts. Monday's loss left them with a return of one point and one goal from three games and though they have complained about the late penalty that denied them victory over Austria, Beenhakker was wise enough not to hide behind that. "Everyone is very disappointed as we had ambition to do better of course, and that was a realistic thing because we showed in most of the qualifying matches that we can do much better," he said. "But during this tournament we were not good enough, we have to see what everybody knows, that several important players were not in the best shape, in top form." "Over the three matches, despite a few unlucky moments or whatever, we were not good enough to handle this level." Poland qualified impressively, finishing above Portugal, to spark a wave of optimism that Beenhakker had finally moulded a team capable of holding their own on the big stage. But in Austria they have looked badly off the pace and the experienced Dutch coach said the reason was clear. "The players who gave us something extra in qualifying, that wasn't happening here," he said. "All players have periods when they are in top form and everything goes well and sometimes they have periods when they don't reach that level. "I don't blame them, they came here with high ambition too, but every player has his downs and if those downs are during a tournament, especially against such strong opponents, then you are in trouble
