 PARIS, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Saturday he expects a security pact to be reached with Iraq, despite Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's assertion that talks are deadlocked. "If I were a betting man, we'll reach an agreement with the Iraqis," Bush told a joint news conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. He reiterated such a deal would not commit future U.S. presidents to troop levels or establish permanent bases. Maliki said on Friday talks with the United States on a long-term security pact were at a stalemate because of U.S. demands that encroached on Iraq's sovereignty.
