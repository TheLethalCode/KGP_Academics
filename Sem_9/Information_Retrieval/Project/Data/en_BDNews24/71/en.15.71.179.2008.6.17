 BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina will attempt to end a miserable run of three successive three-goal defeats against Brazil when the neighbours and arch-rivals meet in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Brazil themselves go into the match under pressure after losing 2-0 away to Paraguay in a qualifier on Sunday and by the same score against Venezuela in a friendly 10 days previously. Coach Dunga's team were lambasted for their overcautious approach in Asuncion, where they barely troubled Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar despite facing 10 men for nearly the entire second half. Argentina also failed to impress their critics when they needed an injury-time equaliser to hold Ecuador 1-1 at home on Sunday. Argentina are second in the 10-team South American qualifying group with 10 points from five games while Brazil are a modest fourth with eight points. The timing of the match has taken away some of its shine with the eyes of the football world focused on Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. The last three meetings have ended in emphatic wins for Brazil. A 4-1 success at the Confederations Cup final in 2005 was followed by two 3-0 winsin a friendly in 2006 and the Copa America final last Julyin which Dunga and current Argentina coach Alfio Basile were in charge of the respective teams. Argentina had gone into the latter match as hot favourites after sweeping their way to the Copa America final with five stylish wins while Brazil stuttered through the tournament. Brazil will be hoping to pull off a repeat of that match, when they muscled Argentina out of their passing game and then hit them with lethal counter-attacks. As on that occasion, Brazil will be missing Ronaldinho and Kaka, who both have fitness problems. NATURAL CRITICISM Dunga has shrugged off the criticism which followed the Paraguay defeat, saying: "It's natural when you don't win. "When we won the Copa America, nobody said anything because it was our obligation. When we lose, somebody has to be held responsible and that's the coach." Argentina defender Martin Demichelis is suspended on two yellow cards while midfielders Javier Mascherano and Juan Sebastian Veron are doubtful because of injury. Argentine critics are wondering whether Basile will field mercurial playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme, who appears to adversely affect the whole team's performance when he has an off day. Possible teams: Brazil - Julio Cesar; Maicon, Lucio, Juan, Gilberto: Mineiro, Anderson, Julio Baptista, Diego; Robinho, Luis Fabiano Argentina - Roberto Abbondanzieri; Javier Zanetti, Nicolas Burdisso, Fabricio Coloccini, Gabriel Heinze; Sebastian Battaglia, Fernando Gago, Maxi Rodriguez, Juan Roman Riquelme; Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero Referee: Oscar Ruiz (Colombia
