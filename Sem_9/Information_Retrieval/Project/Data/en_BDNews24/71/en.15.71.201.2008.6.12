 GENEVA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo lived up to expectations he could be the player to dominate Euro 2008 with his match-winning performance in Portugal's 3-1 victory over Czech Republic on Wednesday. He scored the all-important second goal, a superbly crisp, low strike that sped under keeper Petr Cech just past the hour, having been involved in the move that led to Deco's opening goal in the first half.

Ronaldo has now beaten the great Czech goalkeeper twice in less than a month having headed past him during the Champions League final in Moscow. "Yes, that's the second time I've beaten him. He's a great goalkeeper, one of the best," Ronaldo said.
