 INNSBRUCK, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been training on his own and defender Niclas Alexandersson is a doubt for their decisive Euro 2008 Group D match against Russia, coach Lars Lagerback said on Tuesday. Ibrahimovic, who has scored twice in the championship, has been struggling with a chronic knee problem and was substituted at halftime in their 2-1 defeat by Spain on Saturday but could still be fit for Wednesday's match. Lagerback seemed more doubtful about Alexandersson, who had been expected to return at full back after missing the 2-1 defeat by Spain because of a leg strain. "As for Alexandersson, we're not completely sure. He's going to give it a go at training this evening to try himself out but I think there are some question marks as he has not performed at maximum training so far," Lagerback told a news conference. "For Zlatan it's more or less similar as after the previous two games." ALREADY QUALIFIED Sweden need a draw against Russia to progress to the quarter-finals. Spain have already qualified from the group, while holders Greece have been eliminated. Lagerback denied Sweden were the clear favourites that his opposite number Guus Hiddink had made them but admitted their experience could be important against a young Russian side if they were either winning or drawing near the end of the match. "This is where it's so good to have experienced players. If it's a good (score) when it gets close to 90 minutes, you need to make sure you don't go crazy pushing everything forward, you don't have to rush your game in any way," he said. "We are two fairly equal teams with slightly different approaches to the game. It's 50-50 or so. I don't see us as a major or clear favourite." Sweden captain Fredrik Ljungberg said he expected a very open game. "The Russians will want to attack a lot, which suits us," he said. "I think we'll have an even game but hopefully we can attack a bit more than we did against Spain.
