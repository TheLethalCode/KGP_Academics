 INNSBRUCK, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain have developed a habit of bemoaning their ill fortune at major championships but their progress at Euro 2008 suggests that they have decided to take matters into their own hands and make their own luck. Their 2-1 victory over Sweden in Innsbruck on Saturday ensured them a place in the quarter-finals as group winners and will help erase the memory of their painful first-round exit in Portugal four years ago. Spain took a deserved lead through a clever improvised shot from Fernando Torres, only to see Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalise 11 minutes before the break. They then had a strong penalty appeal turned down just before halftime. In the past the frustration might have got the better of Spain but not this time. They kept plugging away in the second half and finally got their reward deep into stoppage time. The in-form David Villa, who struck a hat-trick in Spain's opening 4-1 win over Russia, outwitted two defenders as he chased down a hopeful upfield hoof and then produced a characteristically cool finish to steer the ball home. Villa's opportunism and his side's refusal to settle for a draw is testament to the team's powerful self belief, patience and determination. The winning goals in five out of Spain's last six games have come in the last 13 minutes. CONFIDENCE BOOST "If you are going to win these type of competitions you have to suffer and this team knows how to suffer," Torres told reporters. Midfielder Xavi agreed. "These tournaments are decided by tiny details and it was one of those that helped us today," he said. "We suffered out there but this is the European Championship and that is what is going to happen. "Winning like this gives us a big boost and tremendous confidence for the future. We hope it carries on like this and that once and for all we can do something important." Another positive is the fact that this Spain side has such a depth of talent in midfield that Luis Aragones can afford to shuffle his pack in the middle of a game with little disruption. Against Sweden, midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta were replaced by Cesc Fabregas and Santi Cazorla just before the hour. The changes only served to add new spark to the midfield and create more problems for the Swedish defence. Once again the defence suffered from the odd lapse of concentration, especially after centre-back Carles Puyol went off injured but this Spain side has proved they have the ability to overcome such setbacks. Spain are unbeaten in 18 matches and have won their last eight on the trot. Their quarter-final opponents will need to produce something special to end that run
