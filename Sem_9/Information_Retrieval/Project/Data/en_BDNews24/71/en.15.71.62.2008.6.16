 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Monday sent a list of nine dialogue delegates to the Chief Adviser's Office. AL office secretary advocate Abdul Mannan Khan, accompanied by deputy office secretary ABM Mozammel Hoq, handed the list to Kazi Md Aminul Islam, secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office. "We have decided to join the dialogue to make it meaningful," Khan told reporters, emerging from the CA's office. On whether the dialogue date has been set, Khan said: "The date and time will be fixed later." The list of the delegates was finalised at the party's central working committee meeting on Saturday. The delegates to the dialogue are Zillur Rahman, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser and Syed Ahsraful Islam.
