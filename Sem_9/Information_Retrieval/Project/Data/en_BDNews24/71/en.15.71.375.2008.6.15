 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Sunday the media had been 'used' to spread rumours that he was stepping down. "The media have been used to spread the rumours. You know better who did it and why?" the ACC boss said to reporters, when he was heading home from work. "We will keep you posted on whatever we do. It's a long way to go. I hope nobody will obstruct our way. Our drive against corruption will go on." "We will complete our mission in a collective effort." Chowdhury came back home on June 10 after a month-long private tour of Australia, New Zealand and UAE, accompanied by his wife. Several newspapers published reports on his "resignation" when he was abroad. Later, the commission rubbished the reports as baseless. Asked to comment on the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, he said: "As I know, everything went through a legal procedure." bdnews
