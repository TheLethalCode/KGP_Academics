 TOKYO, Fri Jun 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's cabinet rose in a public opinion poll released on Friday, but more than half wanted the leader to call an early election after he suffered a non-binding censure motion. Approval for the cabinet stood at 25 percent, up 5.2 points from May, thanks to a compromise Fukuda clinched with the main opposition party on a bill to reform bureaucracy, Kyodo news agency said of its poll taken on Thursday and Friday. But a separate poll by Jiji news agency showed support at 19.1 percent, down 0.8 point, renewing a low for his nine-month premiership. Fukuda's support ratings have been on the decline on doubts about his ability to cope with a divided parliament, which has delayed legislation and blocked key appointments, including the government's first two choices for Bank of Japan governor. The Kyodo poll also showed that 56.2 percent of respondents wanted Fukuda to call an early election after opposition parties passed an embarrassing but non-binding censure motion this week in parliament's upper house, which they control. Fukuda said after the move that he was not thinking about a snap poll, but the main opposition Democratic Party is seeking to force an election in a bid to oust Fukuda's conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of the past six decades. No election for the powerful lower chamber need be held until September 2009. Both polls showed support for the opposition Democratic Party down, showing the party had not improved its standing despite the censure motion. Speculation persists that Fukuda could step down after hosting the G8 summit in northern Japan in early July or that the LDP may replace him with former Foreign Minister Taro Aso or some other potentially more popular rival, perhaps later this year or early in 2009
