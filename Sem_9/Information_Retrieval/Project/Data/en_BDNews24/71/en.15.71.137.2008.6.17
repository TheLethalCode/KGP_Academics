 KOHAT, Pakistan, Tue Jun 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected pro-Taliban militants shot and killed four Shia Muslims in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday in what appeared to be the second deadly sectarian attack in two days. Pakistan has a bloody history of violence between militants from the majority Sunni community and minority Shia and a recent spate of attacks could be the work of pro-Taliban militants seeking to open a new front, a Shia leader said. In Tuesday's attack, gunmen opened fire from a car at a group of men in the main market of the town of Hangu. "The men were from the same family and were killed on the spot. It appears to be a sectarian attack," said senior Hangu police official Quresh Khan. The attack came a day after four Shia Muslims were killed in a bomb attack on a mosque in the northwestern town of Dera Ismail Khan, where four Shia and a policemen were killed in a drive-by shooting late last month. Separately on Tuesday, police in Hangu found the body of a Shia Muslim taxi driver who was kidnapped last week. A Shia political leader said pro-Taliban militants based in tribal regions on the Afghan border, who are hardline Sunnis, were likely behind the violence. "It's shocking ... It could be the work of militants fighting in tribal areas who may want to open a new front or foreign hands who want uncertainty in Pakistan," said Abdul Jalil Naqvi, a leader of a Shia party, the Islami Tehrik. Thousand of people have been killed in tit-for-tat sectarian attacks in Pakistan over nearly three decades. Shia make up about 15 percent of Pakistan's population of 160 million people. The huge majority of ordinary members of the two Muslim sects live together peacefully
