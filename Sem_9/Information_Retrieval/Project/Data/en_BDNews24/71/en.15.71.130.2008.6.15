<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan Cricket Board president Nasim Ashraf claimed Sunday that an e-mail he sent to management and players helped the Pakistan team to secure the Kitply tri-nation series title. "I sent the mail to gear up the boys ahead of the final, and you saw their positive play during the match," Ashraf told reporters at the Sheraton Hotel. Pakistan clinched the Kitply tri-nation series title, as archrivals India fell 25 runs short of the target chasing Pakistan's impressive 315 for three at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur Saturday. After Pakistan's worst-ever 140-run drubbing from India in their group-stage match, the Pakistan board president lashed out the team's management and players by e-mail. Ashraf grilled them about Shoaib Malik's captaincy, keeper Kamran Akmal's unsporting behaviour during the match and the team's apparent lack of resolve and commitment. But following the e-mail's leak to the media, it became apparent that Shoaib Malik's side was under immense pressure before the final game. "The e-mail helped the players to assess their performance after their drubbing from India in the group-stage match," claimed Ashraf on Sunday, "and I am pleased with their performance in the final." The PCB boss thought the triumph against India would boost the players ahead of the Asia Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy. Their preparation for both tournaments had already got underway during the Kitply series. Indian's South African coach Garry Kristen also talked to the reporters before their departure and said that he was happy the way the boys fought. "I congratulate the boys for putting up a fight," Kristen said. "The outcome could have been different had they applied themselves a little more." But, the former South African opener said, they were now concentrating on the Asia Cup Except for seven Pakistani players, all the Indian and Pakistani cricketers left Dhaka Sunday. Pakistan captain Malik travelled to Delhi, along with the Indian players, for personal reasons. The rest of the Pakistan team are scheduled to leave Dhaka Monday. bd
