<TEXT>
 Dhaka , June 15 (bdnews24.com)A senior BNP leader said Sunday that foreign diplomats were in favour of the government allowing Khaleda Zia's two sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco to go abroad for better treatment. Khaleda's adviser and BNP pro-reform leader Enam Ahmed Chowdhury briefed diplomats about the importance of BNP's participation in the upcoming elections, at a party at his residence Saturday night. "We have stressed that BNP's participation in the dialogue and the election is very important," Enam Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Sunday. He said US ambassador James F Moriarty, the Canadian high commissioner and Japanese ambassador among other diplomats attended the party at his residence. "They seemed supportive of overseas treatment for Tarique and Coco, if necessary," Chowdhury said. "We have also stressed that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's medical treatment must be ensured abroad or at home according to her choice." He said medical boards had recommended that Tarique and Coco should be treated abroad as there was no proper facility for their treatment in Bangladesh. Senior party leaders have hinted that BNP would not participate in political dialogue with the government or election by the third week of December if certain demands were not met. bdn
