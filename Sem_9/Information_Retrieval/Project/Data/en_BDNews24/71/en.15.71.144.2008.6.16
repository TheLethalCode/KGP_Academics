<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia said Monday that she "cannot go abroad", but would receive medical treatment at home without any conditions attached. She also blamed the government for the failing health of her two sons, Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco, demanding that they should be sent overseas for better medical treatment. "I cannot go abroad leaving people in distress. I will receive treatment here without any conditions attached," the BNP chairperson told her lawyers in the presence of reporters in special court Monday. "The government should send my two sons abroad. The law should be the same for all," she claimed. Khaleda, her younger son Coco, and former ministers Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar and Motiur Rahman Nizami appeared in Special Judge's Court-3 earlier for charge framing proceedings in the Gatco graft case. Coco was taken to the court from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital in an ambulance. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station. The ACC later pressed charges, on May 13 this year, against 25 people in all. The name of former shipping minister Akbar Hossain, one of the original accused, was dropped from the chargesheet after his death. Seven people accused in the case are still absconding. The case was initially set for trial under metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque, but the case proceedings were later shifted to the special court on security grounds. bdnews24.com/
