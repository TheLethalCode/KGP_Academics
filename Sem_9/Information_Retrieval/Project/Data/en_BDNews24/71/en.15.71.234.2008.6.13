 LONDON Fri Jun 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inflation concerns undermined European stocks and lifted the dollar on Friday as financial markets eyed key US consumer price data due later in the day. Euro zone government bond yields also rose to their highest in nearly a year. May's Consumer Price Index (1230 GMT) will be more closely watched than usual following a series of warnings from U.S. Federal Reserve officials about inflationary pressures. The warnings have prompted expectations of rate hikes by the end of the year. Other central banks, including in the euro zone, have been similarly hawkish. Also fixing attention was a Group of 8 finance ministers meeting in Japan over the weekend, which could underpin some recent strength in the dollar. European stocks fell ahead of the U.S. data. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1 percent. It gained 0.9 percent on Thursday, snapping a six-session losing run. "Inflation is a major negative factor for equities, no matter the source, so any good news on either lower oil prices or (macroeconomic) data would be a tremendous support," said Arthur van Slooten, strategist at Societe Generale, in Paris. Oil was down slightly in the day but still above a heady $136 a barrel. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average .N225 rose 0.6 percent, primarily on the back of exporters who would benefit from a weaker yen if the dollar rises. Still, the benchmark Nikkei average posted its worst weekly drop in three months as worries about rising inflation and interest rate hikes dampened investor appetite. The Nikkei ended the day up 85.13 points at 13,973.73. For the week, it lost 3.6 percent. DOLLAR, BONDS The dollar rose against the euro and was flat against the yen and was on track for its best week in over three years against a basket of currencies. "If the tone of (the G8) statement is unchanged from the last meeting when coordinated action was mentioned, this would give more support to the dollar," said Michael Klawitter, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. The euro was down 0.25 percent at $1.5409. The dollar index -- against major currencies -- was up 0.15 percent at 73.928, up more than 2 percent on the week and heading for its biggest weekly gain since April 2005 .DXY. The yen was steady at 108.00, but close to a three month high set the previous session. Inflation worries continued to hit fixed income. Bund futures hit their lowest price since July and the 10-year euro zone government bond yield was at 4.6350 percent, the highest since July
