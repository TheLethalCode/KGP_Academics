<TEXT>
 MALABO, Tue Jun 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea's state prosecutor asked a court on Tuesday to sentence British mercenary Simon Mann to nearly 32 years in prison for his role in a failed 2004 coup. On the first day of Mann's trial in Malabo, the case presented by the West African state's public prosecutor Jose Olo Obono also named Mark Thatcher, son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, as one of the organizers of the abortive plot to topple President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Mann, an Eton-educated former special forces officer, was arrested in Zimbabwe in 2004 with 70 mercenaries en route to Equatorial Guinea. He was extradited from Zimbabwe to Malabo earlier this year. He said in a TV interview broadcast in Britain in March that he plotted to oust Obiang. He is charged with crimes against the head of state, crimes against the government and crimes against the peace and independence of the Equatorial Guinean state. Mann's lawyer, Jose Pablo Nuo, said his client was a "mere instrument" in the coup and not one of the principal organizers. The hearing was adjourned and would resume on Wednesday
