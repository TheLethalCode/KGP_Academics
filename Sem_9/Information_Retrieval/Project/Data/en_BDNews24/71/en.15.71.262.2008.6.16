 GAZA, Mon Jun 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Monday a successful end was in sight in Egyptian-sponsored talks on a truce in the Gaza Strip between his Islamist group and Israel. In separate remarks, a Palestinian official familiar with the Egyptian mediation efforts said a declaration on a ceasefire, or a period of calm, was very near. "The talks under way in Egypt on calm are nearing an end, an end that would bring about what the Palestinian people aspire to -- a lifting of the siege, the opening of the crossings and an end to the aggression," Haniyeh told a gathering in Gaza. "We are committed to these demands ... A reciprocal and simultaneous calm that begins in Gaza and then extends to the West Bank," Haniyeh said. Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip a year ago, and Israel have been locked in violence along the border that includes frequent rocket attacks on southern Israel and Israeli raids and air strikes in the coastal territory. Israel tightened restrictions on the flow of goods and people across the Gaza frontier after the Hamas takeover. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said Gazans should not expect to lead normal lives while Israelis are under attack. But unable to end cross-border rocket salvoes and wary of launching a broad ground offensive in the densely populated Gaza Strip that could cause heavy casualties on both sides, Israel has given Egypt the green light to negotiate a truce. "We're giving a very serious chance to the initiative of the Egyptians. It's the preferred outcome from the point of view of the government," said Mark Regev, an Olmert spokesman
