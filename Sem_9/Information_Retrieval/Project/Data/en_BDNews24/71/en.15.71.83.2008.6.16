<TITLE> Bangladesh cuts child mortality by half: Unicef </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is one of the six developing countries to have halved the number of under-five child deaths since 1990, says a Unicef report. This success will help Bangladesh achieve the millennium development goals, said the 2008 report with the theme "Child Survival". Despite positive developments, Bangladesh faces the challenges of improving nutritional status and removing disparities in education, income and access to services. "Among the developing countries, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress by cutting by half the number of under-five child deaths since 1990. Only six countries have achieved such a rapid reduction," Unicef representative in Dhaka David Bassiouni told reporters at the report launching ceremony at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel Monday. "Today Bangladesh is on the track to achieve the millennium development goal on child mortality," he said. According to the millennium development goal 4, every country needs to reduce by two-thirds its under-five child mortality rate below the 1990 level. The report said that the under-five child death rate is now 69 per 1,000 while it was 155 per thousand in 1990. Bassiouni said Bangladesh's success could be attributed to a high coverage of immunisation, oral- rehydration therapy and safe hygiene and sanitation practices. "Despite these very positive results, disparities in education, income and access to services are still affecting child survival," the report said. "One of the most formidable challenges before us is the nutrition status of Bangladeshi children," Unicef's Bangladesh chief quoted the report as saying. "It is sad to note that 48 percent or eight million of the children under five years are underweight in Bangladesh," the report said. "A national food and nutrition policy exists, but a framework needs to be developed for nutrition in order to ensure a consolidated approach to cover all aspects of nutrition," Bassiouni said. The report, however, has not mentioned the impact of food price hike on child mortality. "The issue of price hike is a latest trend. It needs some time to see its impact. Hopefully, the Unicef 2009 report would include the issue," Bassiouni told bdnews24.com in reply to a question. The report said: "Everyday, more than 26,000 children under the age of five die around the world, mostly from preventable causes." "Nearly all of them live in the developing countries. More than one-third of these children die during the first month of life. Under-nutrition is an underlying cause for about half of these deaths." "One neonate dies every three to four minutes in Bangladesh accounting for 14 neonatal deaths every hour. So, 1 lakh 20 thousand neonates die every year," Md Abul Faiz, head of the Directorate of Health Services, told the ceremony. bdn
