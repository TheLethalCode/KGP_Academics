<TITLE> Ronaldinho, Deco, Eto'o not needed at Barca </TITLE>

 MADRID, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho, Deco and Samuel Eto'o do not feature in Pep Guardiola's plans at Barcelona, the Primera Liga club's new coach said on Tuesday. "We are putting a team together and they aren't in our thoughts but we'll see what happens," Guardiola said at his official presentation. "This comes from analysing questions of performance, seasons they have had in the team, and other intangibles." The 37-year-old former Spain and Barca midfielder has signed a two-year contract with the club, replacing Frank Rijkaard who was sacked at the end of last season. After two years without silverware, and a disappointing third-place finish last season, an overhaul was always on the cards. Brazil forward Ronaldinho, 28, who shone for the club when they won back-to-back league titles and a European Cup in 2006, suffered a string of injury and fitness problems last year and started only 13 of 38 league matches. He has been courted by Manchester City and AC Milan. "If it was felt Ronaldinho wanted to return to be the player he was, he would be here," Guardiola said. "But there has been a deterioration in the situation and I want to forge a strong dressing room." Like Ronaldinho, Portugal midfielder Deco, 30, who joined from Porto in 2004, has struggled to recapture his early form at Barca and has been linked with Chelsea and Inter Milan. Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o', 27, has been their first-choice striker since 2004 but has missed a large part of the last two seasons through injury. His outspoken approach saw him have run-ins with team mates and Rijkaard. "We are looking for a number nine who will complement Thierry Henry and Bojan Krkic, so that the three will all feel like first choices." Guardiola said. MODERN FOOTBALL Guardiola was a member of Johan Cruyff's so-called "Dream team", who won four consecutive league titles between 1991 and 1994 and the European Cup in 1992, but his managerial experience extends to leading Barca B to promotion to the Segunda B (third tier) last weekend. "I understand the doubts people may have over my experience. I know I am here because of my past as a player," he said. "I feel the doubts will start to recede in a couple of months because I am convinced in my abilities. "I would like to promise titles but I can't and I think it would be a mistake. I know we don't have time to lose. I want us to dominate games, I am a big fan of attacking football and prefer to see the ball in the other team's half." President Joan Laporta, who is facing a vote of confidence in his administration from club members, was unstinting in his backing for a former fans favourite. "He combines all the conditions necessary to be the best coach in the history of Barcelona football club," Laporta said. "He knows enough about football and the club, and will assure us of modern, attacking football.
