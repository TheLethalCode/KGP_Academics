 AMMAN, Fri Jun 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said on Friday talks with the United States on a new long-term security pact had reached a "dead end" because of US demands that infringed Iraq's sovereignty. "We have reached a dead end, because when we started the talks, we found that the US demands hugely infringe on the sovereignty of Iraq, and this we can never accept," Maliki told journalists during a visit to neighboring Jordan. The United States and Iraq are negotiating a new agreement to provide a legal basis for US troops to stay in Iraq after December 31, when their United Nations mandate expires. They are also negotiating a strategic framework agreement on long-term political, diplomatic, economic, security and cultural ties between the two countries. In his first detailed comments on the talks, which are taking place behind closed doors, Maliki said Iraq objected to Washington's insistence on giving its troops immunity from prosecution in Iraq and freedom to conduct operations independent of Iraqi control. "We can't extend the US forces permission to arrest Iraqis or to undertake the responsibility of fighting terrorism in an independent way, or to keep Iraqi skies and waters open for themselves whenever they want," he said. "One of the important issues that the US is asking for is immunity for its soldiers and those contracting with it. We reject this totally." Responding to Maliki's comments, a US embassy spokesman in Baghdad said: "Talks are ongoing. We respect Iraq's sovereignty and that's the basis of the negotiations. We are still in dialogue with the Iraqis on this." US President George W Bush said on Wednesday he was confident of reaching an agreement with Iraq. US officials say they hope to reach a deal by July, but Iraqi officials have been more cautious and have suggested that date may be missed
