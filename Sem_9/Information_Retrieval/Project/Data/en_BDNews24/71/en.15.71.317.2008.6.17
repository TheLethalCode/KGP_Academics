 NEUCHATEL, Switzerland, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After a welcome rest Portugal have begun detailed preparations for Thursday's Euro 2008 quarter-final while opponents Germany are counting the cost of their belated qualification on Monday night. Luiz Felipe Scolari's first-choice players go into the match in Basel having had a great deal more rest than three times champions Germany after securing their berth in the last eight on Wednesday with a game to spare in Group A. Since then Portugal's usual lineup have mostly enjoyed a restful five days with a majority of the reserves being called on to play in their meaningless final group game last Sunday against already eliminated co-hosts Switzerland, losing 2-0. The only real concern for the Portuguese was who they would face in the quarter-finals and that was decided with Germany's laboured 1-0 win over co-hosts Austria in Vienna on Monday. Germany coach Joachim Loew summed up his team's disadvantage when he told reporters in Vienna: "It's three days until our next match. Of course, we would have loved to have had another day but that's just not the way it is." FULLY FIT Portugal have a fully fit squad to choose from and no suspensions although five players, including first-choice fullbacks Paulo Ferreira and Jose Bosingwa, are on one yellow card and risk missing a possible semi-final if booked again. Germany's only consolation as underdogs was summed up by Ballack, who told reporters: "Maybe it's a good thing for the German team that Portugal should be favourites". Ballack's team faced Croatia as favourites in their second Group B game and their defeat sent Slaven Bilic's team through to the last eight while Germany had to fight for their place, this time as even bigger favourites, against Austria. Portugal believe they can play the better football and that the result will depend on their team spirit and concentration. "I think that for Portugal's type of game, Germany will be more favourable (to play against than Croatia)," midfield creator Deco said in an interview with Mundo Deportivo. Germany have a better overall head-to-head record but Portugal have not lost in their two European Championship encounters, a 0-0 draw in 1984 and a 3-0 victory in 2000. However, the last match went to Germany, who won 3-1 in the third-place playoff as hosts of the 2006 World Cu
