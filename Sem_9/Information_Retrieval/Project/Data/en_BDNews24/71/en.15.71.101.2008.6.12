<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Gautam Gambhir's fifth ODI hundred powered India to a convincing seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the group last match of the Kitply one-day international series Thursday. India raced to 223 for three in 35.1 overs in reply to Bangladesh's modest total of 222 all out in 49.5 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Bangladesh's second loss in as many outings means India will play the final Saturday against archrivals Pakistan, who thrashed Bangladesh in the series opener. Gambhir, dropped on six by Alok Kapali off Farhad Reza, finally remained unbeaten on 107 off 101 balls with the help 13 fours and one six. It was Gambhir's second hundred against Bangladesh. The left-handed opener along with explosive Virender Sehwag gave a brisk start to India putting 85 runs in 10 overs before Sehwag pulled pacer Dollar Mahmud to Tamim Iqbal at deep square leg. Sehwag, who survived a bold leg before appeal by Mashrafee Bin Mortaza on five, smashed Dollar for two sixes and two fours in an over before Dollar removed him in the last delivery of his first over. By then, Sehwag blazed a 32-ball 59 featuring seven fours and two sixes. Afterwards, Gambhir put on 56 along with Rohit Sharma (26) for the second wicket and added another 75 runs for the third wicket with Yuvraj Singh (26), bowled by Farhad with India needing another seven runs to reach the target. Gambhir along with Suresh Raina reached home facing next eight deliveries. Earlier, Roqibul Hasan struck his career-best 89 to help Bangladesh manage a moderate total though Bangladesh had a slow start in the beginning. Roqibul, whose previous best was 63 against South Africa at home, played patiently to hit five fours facing 117 balls, and had a fine job with skipper Mohammad Ashraful repairing the initial damage. The tigers found them in tatters after choosing to bat first as both openers Tamim Iqbal (0) and Shahriar Nafees (9) were dismissed inside six overs with scoreboard reading just 17. Ashraful and Roqibul recovered their slow start to put on 76 runs for the fourth wicket before the Bangladesh skipper gave a return catch leaving the side at 93 for three in 25 overs. Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni changed the bowling attack several times and had success when four-change bowler Yusuf Pathan sent Ashraful back with a return catch in the last delivery of his first over. Ashraful played 67-ball 36 hitting only two boundaries. Thereafter, Roqibul put on another 46 runs for the fourth wicket with Alok Kapali, who was bowled by Irfan Pathan for 20 off 26 balls, and added another 35 runs with Mahmudullah for the sixth wicket before being caught by Praveen Kumar off RP Singh. The right-handed batsman with a muscular cramp fell just 11 runs short of his maiden ODI century. Late order batsmen Mahmudullah and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza quickfired 24 and 13 respectively to take the hosts beyond the 200-mark. RP Singh grabbed three wickets for 46 while Irfan Pathan chipped in with two for 48. bdnews24.com
