<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)The country's prime bourse Thursday asked the government to withdraw an additional 7 percent charge in penalty for legalising undeclared income. "Undeclared income which has been already invested in industries should be exempted from the penalty," chief executive of Dhaka Stock Exchange Salahuddin Ahmed Khan told a press briefing. Khan also asked for an arrangement to pay due taxes in instalments to prevent industries from falling into a liquidity crisis. "The government may take taxes in the form of shares and sell them to the market which may lead to more income than taxes," said the prime bourse's CEO. DSE senior vice-president Saiful Islam echoed him and said the government should take the matter under "soft consideration". At a press conference held at the DSE in the financial district of Motijheel, Salahuddin also asked for withdrawal of double-taxation on dividend incomes. "Dividend givers and takers are not taxed simultaneously anywhere in the world. For instance, companies in India are taxed at 10 percent of their declared dividends but shareholders are not taxed at all," he said. The government's zero-coupon bonds have an advance income tax (AIT) at 10 percent while the treasury bills issued by the government are exempted. Salahuddin said the government should not maintain such discrimination. The DSE CEO also asked for lowering 0.015 percent tax at source for brokerage houses to 0.0125 percent in a bid to cut service charges paid by investors. Speaking on the current market situation, the DSE chief executive said the prices of scrips were "highly overvalued". "We are concerned about new investors as the market will go for a correction. In this case, new investors will face huge losses." Replying queries about a possible liquidity crisis in the next four or five months as a couple of upcoming listings is expected to fetch about Tk 12,000 crore from the market, the prime bourse's CEO said the market was capable to absorb the shock. "If investors take a cautious stance on investing then there would be no problem." bdn
