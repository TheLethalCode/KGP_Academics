 SALZBURG, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eliminated Greece now have their sights set on scoring their first Euro 2008 goal and leaving with their heads held high with a win against Spain in their final Group D match on Wednesday. The 2004 champions crashed out of the tournament with a 1-0 defeat to Russia on Saturday, ending their hopes of successfully defending the title they won in surprise fashion four years ago. They also lost their opening match against Sweden 2-0. "We will chase a win against Spain and hopefully we are luckier than we were against Russia and score a goal," captain Angelos Basinas said. Spain have already qualified with two victories while Sweden and Russia will battle it out between themselves for the second qualification spot. Greece, among the oldest teams in the tournament, came into the competition having scored more than two goals per qualifying match. GOAL-DRY But their performances have so far been goal-dry, disappointing thousands of Greek fans who travelled to watch them play. In both their group matches Greece failed to create more than just a few scoring chances, playing defensively and hoping to catch their opponents on the break. Giorgios Karagounis said it was time for Greece to put on a good show. "The next thing on our minds is the match on Wednesday against Spain," the midfielder said. "We will keep on trying and do everything possible to get a positive result. We owe it to ourselves." Greece coach Otto Rehhagel, who guided the team to their second consecutive Euro tournament, said his players had a duty to play well against Spain. He is likely to make several changes to the team, bringing on some of the younger players featuring in the squad who have yet to play in the tournament. "For the fans, the organisers and ourselves we have the responsibility to put in a flawless 90-minute performance and enjoy it," Rehhagel said. "We are focusing on that match and that match alone. That is what we will do.
