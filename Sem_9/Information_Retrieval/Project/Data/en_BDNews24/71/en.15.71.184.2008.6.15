 SALZBURG, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia coach Guus Hiddink has told his players they will need to step up another gear when they face Sweden for a place in the Euro 2008 quarter-finals. By beating Greece 1-0 in their Group D match on Saturday, Russia both eliminated the holders and put themselves firmly in the mix for a place in the last eight alongside Spain who have already qualified from the group. Hiddink said the victory had proved his players had reacted well to some harsh training sessions after their 4-1 drubbing by Spain in their opening game and now needed to build on what they had learnt by challenging each other to perform better. "To win against Sweden is two steps more," the Dutchman told a news conference. 'EVEN BETTER' "I have passed on in the last days that playersall the playersshould talk. It can be even better, we have to learn as Russian players the fact that we demand 100 percent from each other and then they can do a lot." Russia must win on Wednesday to go through while Sweden will qualify with a draw. Hiddink said Russia needed to be more consistent and also take their chances more, having wasted several clear-cut goal-scoring opportunities against the Greeks, and they would definitely be the underdogs against Sweden. "I hope the irregularity can go out of the team," he said, adding that one of the main improvements compared to the Spain match had been recognising the smell of danger and defending better. He added that he hoped the team's exploits at the championship would encourage Russian authorities to invest more in new training centres and stadiums, which could eventually lead to more success on the pitch. "It's important that the team performs well because then it has its influence on what I think is very needed in Russia  the improvement of the infrastructure," said Hiddink. "With that I hope that this huge country, with 140 million people, if you have organised things well in scouting, in youth development then step by step this county can be a powerhouse but it's not yet.
