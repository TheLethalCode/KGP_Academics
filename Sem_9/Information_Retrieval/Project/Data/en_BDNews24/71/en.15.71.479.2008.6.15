 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka Sunday pressed his demand to bring Dhaka City Corporation under the office of the head of government to make it an effective organisation in the style of "metropolitan government". For fiscal 2008-09, the mayor announced a Tk 1,009.41 crore budget for DCC. As in previous years, the budget did not impose new tax. It was Khoka's seventh budget as a mayor since May 15, 2002. His tenure as mayor expired on May 14, 2006, but he continued the mayoral job as no election to DCC was held. In the budget speech, Khoka spoke of formulating a new master plan considering the population of Dhaka city. Differing with the government's promulgation of an ordinance bringing all city corporations under the same law, Khoka said: "Balanced development has become impossible due to lack of coordination among different divisions, offices and directorates in the city." "It's necessary to build a beautiful city for the future." At the same time, he said, expansion of the organisational structure of DCC was an "urgent need". Khoka backed the Election Commission's initiative to increase the number of electoral constituencies in the city. In the budget, the target of own income has been fixed at Tk 536.51 crore. Of the spending, Tk 170.40 crore has been marked for development and maintenance of roads and infrastructure, Tk 10 crore for development of graveyards and crematoriums, Tk 11.50 crore for development of parks and playgrounds, Tk 8.7 crore for environment, Tk 2 crore for development of wetlands and other water bodies and Tk 4 crore for construction of dustbins and toilets. bdnew
