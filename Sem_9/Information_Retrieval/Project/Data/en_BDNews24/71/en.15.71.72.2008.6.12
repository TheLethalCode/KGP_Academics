 HARARE,Thu Jun 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe police arrested the opposition MDC's secretary general as he flew in on Thursday ahead of a June 27 presidential run-off vote and detained party leader Morgan Tsvangirai for the third time this month. The opposition and human rights groups accuse President Robert Mugabe's government of waging a campaign of arrests and violent intimidation ahead of the run-off against Tsvangirai. MDC officials said party secretary general Tendai Biti was detained as he stepped off a plane at Harare airport. Biti, the party's number three, left the country soon after disputed March 29 elections to gather African support. Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said Biti had been arrested over the opposition's early announcement of results from the elections. "He was wanted in connection with the premature announcement of results before the official announcement of results by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission," he said. Chris Mhike, a lawyer acting for the MDC, said an urgent court application would be made to force authorities to bring Biti to court as soon as possible. Tsvangirai was detained at a roadblock on his way to address a campaign rally on Thursday, the party said. He was detained by police twice last week and held for several hours on both occasions. POLITICAL VIOLENCE Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the first round of elections in March but not by enough to avoid a run-off, according to official figures. The MDC says ZANU-PF activists have killed 66 opposition supporters to try to intimidate voters before the run-off, and police have detained Tsvangirai twice over the past week while trying to campaign. The ruling party blames the opposition for the political violence. Observers from southern African regional body SADC said monitoring the elections would be a big challenge. Monitors from Western countries critical of Mugabe will not be allowed. "It is a mammoth task," SADC official Tanki Mothae said before the deployment of 120 observers out of 400. Mothae said the SADC wanted to help Zimbabwe run a free and fair poll: "This is to help the people of Zimbabwe go through this election as peacefully as possible." Mugabe's support has been eroded by the economic collapse of the once prosperous country, which he has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980. Mugabe has conceded that beneficiaries of his controversial farm seizures are using less than half the land and threatened to take it off them, state media said on Thursday. Critics say the veteran leader has used the land reforms to help sustain his rule, rewarding supporters with fertile farms seized from whites -- although many are ill-equipped to properly engage in agriculture. The official Herald newspaper quoted Mugabe as saying only 42 percent of the land was under full use and renewing threats to re-possess farms that were not being properly used in a country suffering food shortages and economic collapse
