It complicated our plans because Baros did not play as a straight centre-forward, but roamed in midfield," Scolari said. "We had a very hard time during the first half.

They did exactly what I wanted them to do. "We weren't bad in that first half, we did create chances but we were definitely better in the second half." Scolari said he would only decide after Switzerland's match against Turkey later on Wednesday how he would prepare for Portugal's last match with the Swiss in Basel on Sunday given that he wants his team to win the group
