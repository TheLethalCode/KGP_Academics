<TITLE> Bush, Sarkozy looking to bury 'freedom fries' era </TITLE>

 Paris, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush and French President Nicolas Sarkozy met to showcase their countries' reconciliation on Saturday as they move past tension over Iraq and try to forge a common front against Iran. As part of Bush's farewell tour of Europe, the leaders were expected to coordinate strategy for increasing international pressure on the Islamic Republic over its nuclear programme and for shoring up NATO's role in the war in Afghanistan. Bush's warm personal bond with Sarkozy -- nicknamed "Sarko the American" -- stands in marked contrast to the chilly relationship the U.S. leader had with his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, a staunch critic of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. But Bush remains deeply unpopular in France, with many people indifferent to his visit and looking to his successor who will be elected in November. Bush sat down for talks with Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace after a welcoming ceremony on the steps outside, complete with a military honour guard with swords drawn and music playing. Likely to top the agenda was Iran's rejection, just minutes earlier, of any suspension of uranium enrichment, after the European Union's top diplomat handed Tehran a world powers' offer of economic incentives to persuade it to stop such work. Bush and allies he has met during his weeklong trip have warned Tehran of further sanctions if it remains defiant. REACHING OUT Bush tried to reach out to the French on Friday. "Recent history has made clear that no disagreement can diminish the deep ties between our nations," he said in a speech, apparently referring to the differences over Iraq. He was effusive in his praise of Sarkozy, who has won favour in Washington especially for taking a harder line against Iran than Chirac's former government. Iran denies trying to build a nuclear bomb and insists its programme is strictly for electricity generation. Bush also hailed Sarkozy for pledging to send more troops to Afghanistan and for sponsoring a donors' conference that yielded $20 billion for rebuilding the war-battered country. Sarkozy, considered France's most pro-American president in decades, was treated to hamburgers and hot dogs at the Bush family estate in August and received a warm welcome on his first official visit to Washington in November. Returning the favour, Sarkozy hosted Bush at a private dinner at the palace on Friday. Sarkozy's new wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni, greeted U.S. first lady Laura Bush separately, away from the cameras' glare. Since taking office last year, Sarkozy has done much to roll back the legacy of French-U.S. relations left by Chirac, who had angered the Bush administration with his outspoken opposition to military action against Iraq. That prompted some indignant Americans to rename French fries "freedom fries" and boycott products such as French cheese, drawing heavy publicity but only a modest following. France, like the rest of Europe, is already looking beyond Bush and wondering what a new administration under Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain would do to rebuild America's damaged image abroad. A commentary in the Le Monde newspaper by the foreign ministers of France, Spain and Portugal said the end of the Bush era would provide a "historic opportunity" to forge a new U.S.-European partnership "on equal footing." Allies bristled at what they saw as "cowboy diplomacy" in Bush's first term, but they have seen improved cooperation recently as he seeks to salvage his foreign policy record.
