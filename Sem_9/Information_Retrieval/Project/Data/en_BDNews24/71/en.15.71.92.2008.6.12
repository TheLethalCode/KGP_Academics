 Paris, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Donors led by the United States pledged more than $13 billion in aid for Afghanistan on Thursday but said Kabul must do more to fight corruption and aid must be better coordinated. At a conference in Paris, Washington promised $10.2 billion to help one of the world's poorest countries deal with an insurgency, poverty, drug trafficking and corruption 6-1/2 years after the Taliban was ousted from power. About 6,000 people were killed last year in the insurgency by a rejuvenated Taliban, which sheltered al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden until it was toppled by U.S.-led forces in 2001. "Afghanistan was taken hostage by a regime allied to terrorism, a regime that represents the very negation of the values of Islam," French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at the start of the conference of 68 countries, including Afghanistan. "It is the duty of all democrats to help you," Sarkozy told Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the start of the conference, attended by representatives from more than 15 international organizations, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Afghanistan asked the donors to help fund a $50 billion five-year development plan and Karzai told the conference that his country needed aid to be better coordinated aid and help in institution building to fight corruption. "The current development process that is marred by confusion and parallel structures undermines institution building," Karzai said. "While Afghanistan needs large amounts of aid, precisely how aid is spent is just as important." Donors are not expected to pledge a full $50 billion but the meeting is intended to be a show of support for Afghanistan after a NATO summit in April examined military strategy for the more than 50,000 foreign troops stationed there. FOCUS ON CORRUPTION A U.S. official on Tuesday told Reuters that he expected the conference to raise more than $15 billion. It was unclear, however, how much of this represented fresh money. The U.S. pledge, for example, consists of sums that the Bush administration has already made public in its budget requests to the U.S. Congress. Among the pledges, the World Bank said it would provide around $1.1 billion over five years, Britain said it would give about 600 million pounds through 2012/2013 and Japan said it would provide an extra $550 million. Sarkozy said France would more than double its aid and his office said the French government would offer $107 million euros ($165 million) from 2008 to 2010. Envoys pledged to improve coordination of an aid effort often criticized as chaotic and inefficient and demanded greater efforts by Afghanistan to fight corruption. "There must be a greater determination on the Afghan side to improve the quality of administration, pursue -- secure -- greater accountability and to combat corruption more vigorously, the U.N.'s special envoy for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said. Afghanistan depends on aid for 90 percent of its spending. But international donors have fallen behind in paying what they have already pledged, and much of the money goes straight back to donor countries in salaries, purchase of goods and profits. The lag in aid is partly due to concerns about corruption. Of the $25 billion pledged for Afghanistan from 2001 until now, only around $15 billion has been spent, aid agencies say.
