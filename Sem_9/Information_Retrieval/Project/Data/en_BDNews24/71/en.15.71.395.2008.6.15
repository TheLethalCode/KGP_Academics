<TEXT>
 INNSBRUCK, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Euro 2008 top scorer David Villa said he was more jittery about the impending fate of his former club Sporting Gijon than he had been about Spain's Group D match against Sweden on Saturday. Gijon can gain promotion to the Spanish Primera Liga in their final match of the season against Eibar on Sunday. "I will definitely suffer more tomorrow than today because you don't get so nervous when you are on the pitch," he told reporters after his stoppage-time goal gave Spain a 2-1 win over Sweden and a 100 percent record from two matches. "I hope Sporting win as quickly as possible and they get back in the top division which is something we deserve after so long out." Gijon is a city in the north of Spain in the region of Asturias, the area where Villa was born. The 26-year-old Valencia player scored a hat-trick in Spain's opening game of the tournament against Russia on Tuesday but said he took more satisfaction from his last-gasp winner against Sweden. LAST MINUTE "I'm prouder of today's goal than the three the other day," said Villa after being named man of the match for the second game in a row. "I'm much happier to have scored in the last minute and given us the win even though it was just one goal. "I'm really proud to have taken part in helping Spain earn another three points and take them to the verge of the next phase." Villa took the ball round defender Petter Hansson before sliding the ball beyond keeper Andreas Isaksson. "The finish was the easiest part because the keeper came out in desperation and a one-on-one is only difficult when the keeper stands his ground," he said. Villa has netted 18 goals in 33 appearances for Spain and is desperate to help his country reach the Euro 2008 final. "I just hope I keep scoring to help the team win each game but I'm not worried about becoming the top scorer in the tournament," he said. "This was another collective triumph and my only aim is help the team get to the final day of the competition.
