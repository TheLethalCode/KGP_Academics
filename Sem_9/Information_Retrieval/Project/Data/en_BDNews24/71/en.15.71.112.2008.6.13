<TITLE> Pakistan lawyers 'to besiege parliament' over judges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Lahore, Pakistan, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A convoy of Pakistani lawyers set off on Thursday on the last leg of a cross-country rally, vowing to lay siege to parliament unless judges fired by President Pervez Musharraf last year get their jobs back. Lawyers have been at the forefront of opposition to staunch U.S. ally Musharraf since he tried to dismiss the then Supreme Court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in March last year. Chaudhry and dozens of other judges were purged when former army chief Musharraf declared emergency rule in November. "If the judges are not restored ... we will lay siege to parliament," a leader of the lawyers' movement, Ali Ahmed Kurd, told a rally of several thousand lawyers and political activists in the city of Lahore. The protest, called a "long march" even though the lawyers are traveling in a fleet of about 200 vehicles, set off from the southeastern city of Multan on Wednesday. They are due to reach the capital Islamabad on Friday. The protest is increasing pressure on Musharraf to step down. Isolated since his allies were trounced in a February election, opponents are demanding he quit and face trial. It is also a challenge to the two-month-old coalition government led by the party of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and a threat to its tenuous unity. The coalition has been almost completely preoccupied with the question of the judges and the related issue of Musharraf's fate despite a looming economic crisis and militant threat. Analysts say if Chaudhry were reinstated, he would be expected to take up legal challenges to Musharraf's presidency that could lead to his ouster. But Chaudhry might also review an amnesty that wiped out corruption cases against Bhutto, her husband Asif Ali Zardari, who has led her party since she was assassinated in December, and other party politicians. That, critics say, is why Zardari has been reluctant to restore Chaudhry and his colleagues. He says he wants to see them get their jobs back as part of a package of constitutional changes that would also strip Musharraf of his powers. But the package will take months to pass and the lawyers and Zardari's junior coalition partner, the party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, want to see the judges restored immediately through a parliamentary resolution. "MUSHARRAF, GO" Sharif also addressed the Lahore rally and, in veiled criticism of Zardari, said: "It is so sad and regrettable that even though we have democracy we are still demanding the restoration of the judges ... We won't let anyone sit in peace until the judges are restored." Protesters chanting "Go Musharraf, go" burnt an effigy of the unpopular president, who overthrew Sharif in a 1999 coup. Both the government and lawyers have vowed the protest will be peaceful. But nuclear-armed Pakistan has endured a wave of militant attacks and, while the lawyers would not appear to be an obvious target, a blast last year at a lawyers' protest in Islamabad killed 16 people. Many ordinary people say they support an independent judiciary, but many are more worried about inflation. "I don't care about it," Azhar Ali Shah, selling envelopes on a Lahore street, said of the protest. "What will they give us? My worry is to feed my family." The uneasy coalition partners are also divided on how to handle Musharraf. Zardari says he does not recognize Musharraf as a constitutional president and would reduce him to a figurehead under the proposed constitutional changes. Sharif wants Musharraf impeached and tried for treason.
