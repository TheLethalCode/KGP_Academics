 INNSBRUCK, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden blamed referee Pieter Vink for their 2-1 Euro 2008 defeat on Saturday, saying David Villa's stoppage-time winner should have been disallowed and the Dutch official was pressurised by Spain. "It's a bitter way to lose. I am standing 20 metres away from (Sweden substitute) Markus Rosenberg being kicked and then Spain go on and score. I hope the referee is dealt with," coach Lars Lagerback told reporters. Rosenberg agreed Sweden should have been awarded a free kick for the foul on him earlier in the move. "We didn't get any free kicks in the last 20 or 25 minutes," said the substitute. "The referee  cost us the game." Captain Fredrik Ljungberg also criticised Spain for pressurising the referee, notably at halftime after Vink had dismissed a penalty claim for handball. "They did complain a lot at halftime and put pressure on. If that's allowed then maybe we should do the same," said Ljungberg. "I think they might have had a shout for a penalty in the first half but they started to get a bit of conversation into it in the second and got free kicks for everything. "There is a lot of talk about fair play but maybe we should look at the way a group of Spanish players acted with the referee at halftime," added Ljungberg. Fernando Torres put Spain ahead in the 15th minute. Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalised in the 34th before Villa pounced to secure Spain's second successive win. Sweden and Russia, who both have three points, meet in their final group game in Innsbruck on Wednesday
