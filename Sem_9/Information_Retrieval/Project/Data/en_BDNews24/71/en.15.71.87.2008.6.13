 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina reached Boston, Massachusetts, in the early hours of Friday, after being freed from jail earlier in the week to seek medical treatment abroad. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, based in Boston, was awaiting his mother's arrival at the airport and told BBC Radio: "Hundreds of local Bangladeshis are thronging the airport here to receive my mother." Asked where she would be heading from the airport, Joy said his mother would be spending some days with him at his apartment. Asked if Hasina would be talking to the media, he said: "It all will depend on her health condition." On how he was feeling about meeting his mother after a year, the son said: "We've been waiting for so long for this reunion. I can't tell you how joyous I am at the prospect of meeting my mother." Speaking of the schedule for Hasina's treatment in the US, Joy said: "I'll take her to the doctors when she's rested enough. She has open appointments with her medics." BBC reported that more than 500 people from New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington DC among other cities and states thronged the airport to receive Sheikh Hasina. Humayun K Chowdhury, Bangladesh ambassador in the US was also present. Hasina was seen waving to the waiting crowd. Before leaving the airport, she said: "Awami League in Bangladesh will work towards ensuring civic rights, food and franchise for the Bangladeshis." "We've decided to join the dialogue with a view to re-establishing democracy. The caretaker government too should be concerned about making the dialogue meaningful." The Awami League chief left Dhaka for the US Thursday morning on a British Airways flight. Her younger sister Sheikh Rehana and her daughter Saima Wazed Putul met Hasina at Heathrow airport the same evening, where she had a four-hour stopover. bdnews24.com/gna
