 BERLIN, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The German press hailed its team's advance to the quarter-finals of Euro 2008 on Tuesday but fretted about a less-than-sharp performance which saw them scrape by unfancied co-hosts Austria 1-0. Top-selling Bild newspaper applauded captain Michael Ballack for "redeeming" Germany with his powerful 25-metre free kick at the start of the second half but criticised virtually every other aspect of the German game. "The manner in which Germany scraped past the third-rate Austrians should give pause for thought," the paper said. "Until the Ballack goal it was a battle of nerves full of individual mistakes." In a commentary for the paper, former soccer great Franz Beckenbauer said Joachim Loew's team would have to raise its game significantly if it were to have any hopes in the next round against Portugal and their star striker. "Do we have a chance with such a performance against Cristiano Ronaldo and his Portuguese side? No, definitely not!" Beckenbauer wrote. Germany play Portugal in the last eight in Basel on Thursday. NERVOUS START Needing to avoid defeat to stay in the tournament, Germany had a nervous start against the hosts, with striker Mario Gomez botching a shot from one-metre out. Ballack's rocket free kick four minutes into the second half calmed the German team, but Austria kept up the pressure throughout, even if they mounted few serious threats to keeper Jens Lehmann's goal. Most of the major German newspapers plastered pictures of a screaming Ballack, swamped by teammates, on their front pages and said the victory had banished the ghosts of Cordoba, scene of a shock 3-2 Austrian win over West Germany at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. "Cordoba is forgotten with the win in Vienna," the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said in a special Euro 2008 section. The Financial Times Deutschland described it as a match of "Pure Nerves". "The German team stuttered to a 1-0 win against Austria and finds itself in the quarter-finals despite a disappointing performance," the paper said. Papers also devoted space to the sending off of Loew and his Austrian counterpart Josef Hickersberger shortly before half-time. Spanish referee Manuel Mejuto ordered the coaches to leave their pitchside areas after verbal exchanges with the fourth official. Both were forced to watch the second half from the stands, Loew finding a seat near Chancellor Angela Merkel and the other German ministers who travelled to Vienna to watch the match. "Loew showed for the first time just how heavy the pressure on his shoulders is," Bild said. "How else to explain his ejection?
