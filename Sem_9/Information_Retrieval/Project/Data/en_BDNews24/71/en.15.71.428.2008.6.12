<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) - Four organisations of primary teachers have declined an offer by BRAC founder and boss Fazle Hasan Abed to sit across the table and end the hostility over a government project to train primary school teachers under the non-governmental organisation. At a joint press briefing at Topkhana Road Thursday, general secretary of a faction of the Bangladesh Primary Teachers Association, BM Asadullah read out a written statement on behalf of the four organisations "On behalf of BRAC, a proposal has been made to hold talks with all teachers' organisations. But we completely reject such talks," said Asadullah. The four organisations are a faction of Bangladesh Primary Teachers Association, Bangladesh Graduate Primary Teachers Association, a faction of Bangladesh Private Primary Teachers Association, and Bangladesh Community Primary Teachers Association. Fazle Hasan Abed, at a press conference at Dhaka's Sheraton Hotel on Wednesday, offered to sit with the teachers organisations to resolve any difference of opinion. The government decided to run the pilot training project at primary schools in 20 upazilas of the country under BRAC. Government and non-government primary teachers associations are opposing the decision, saying BRAC has failed to ensure the quality of education in their own non-formal schools. In the press conference Thursday they said their opposition would continue until the government cancels its project. They also said they had sent a memorandum to the chief adviser of their demand for its cancellation. Asadullah, on behalf of the four organisations, announced a new programme to realise their demand. The programme includes meetings with the management committees and guardians of government, non-government and community primary schools from June 15 to 25. They will also hold meetings with educationists, civil society, representatives of the press, professionals and politicians from June 28 to July 3 to gain support for their views. Teachers rallies will be held countrywide at district level on July 10, and a rally of the representatives of all teachers organisations in Dhaka on July 17. Any fresh programme will be announced on the day, said Asadullah. President of a faction of Bangladesh Primary Teachers Association, Md Wahiduzzaman, president of Bangladesh Graduate Primary Teachers Association, Abdul Khaleque, president of a faction of Bangladesh Non-government Primary Teachers Association, Muhammad Shamsul Alam, and president of Bangladesh Community Primary Teachers Association, Hafizur Rahman Khan, were present at the press conference. bdnews
