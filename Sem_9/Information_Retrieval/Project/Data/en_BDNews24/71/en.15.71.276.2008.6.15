<TEXT>
 SALZBURG, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece coach Otto Rehhagel praised his players' passion and fighting spirit despite going down 1-0 to Russia in the Euro 2008 Group D match which ended the champions' defence of their title on Saturday. Greece have lost both their group matches, including their opener against Sweden, and next face Spain, who are through to the quarter-finals, on Wednesday. Rehhagel told a news conference it was unrealistic to expect Greece to have a similar performance as four years ago when, as 80-1 outsiders, they won the trophy.

Rehhagel extended his contract earlier this year until 2010 and he brushed aside a question about the national team's future. "The Acropolis has been standing for 3,000 years and in 20 years when I'm gone it will still be standing." The 69-year-old said his team now had a duty to prepare for the match against Spain. "For the fans, the organisers and ourselves we have the responsibility to put in a flawless 90-minute performance and enjoy it," he said. MOUNTING CRITICISM "That's what we will do," he added, ignoring questions about whether mounting criticism in Greece was a concern for him. He continued: "Today we played two times better than against Sweden. I want to applaud my boys' passion and perseverance and I cannot accuse anyone of not giving their all." Rehhagel said the Russian side, that dominated the game, were outstanding and just hanging in there until the very end was a major credit to his players. "We lost against a first class team, they were all top players today." Russia, who had a string of good chances, deserved more than the one goal they scored in the 33rd minute through Konstantin Zyryanov. "The Russians were absolutely super today, amazing sprinters who played their combinations and we gave them a run until the last second but we are not a team that can score many goals in every match," Rehhagel said. "I had hoped for one, though
