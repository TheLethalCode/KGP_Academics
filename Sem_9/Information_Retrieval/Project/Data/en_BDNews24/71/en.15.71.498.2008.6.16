<TITLE> Italy's Buffon befuddled by group permutations </TITLE>

 BADEN, Austria, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has left his calculator at home and is relying on others to explain the complicated permutations in Euro 2008 Group C. Netherlands have already reached the quarter-finals and won the group after big wins over Italy and France. Second place is far from simple, however, with Romania and the two World Cup finalists all still having a chance of going through from Tuesday's final round of matches. "I didn't understand everything but from what they tell me we have a slightly better chance than France," a sheepish Buffon told a news conference on Sunday. The World Cup-winning goalkeeper is generally regarded as one of the most switched-on characters in the Azzurri dressing room. To be fair, the maths required to work out Tuesday's permutations is testing even the most devoted of fans. Romania, second on two points, will qualify by beating the Dutch in Berne on Tuesday but a draw would not be enough if Italy or France win their tussle at the same time in Zurich. OTHER PERMUTATIONS With Romania having drawn 0-0 with France and 1-1 with Italy, head-to-heads can not come into play so goal difference and goals scored between the three teams becomes decisive. Should Romania lose, Italy would definitely go through with a scoring draw but other permutations are possible. Buffon said Italy should ignore the mathematics and stick to making sure they beat France. "The first thing to think about is ourselves," said the keeper, who will captain the side if Alessandro Del Piero is not picked. "Definitely I think we have to concentrate on France and not pay attention to the other match." Italy hope Netherlands remain motivated for the Romania game having suffered heartbreak at Euro 2004 when a last-minute Sweden goal in a 2-2 draw with Denmark sent the Azzurri home as the two Scandinavian teams went through. "The reason for not packing our suitcases is that anything can happen in football. In Euro 2004 we went out with five points which was amazing, yet we can go through with two in 2008," Buffon said. "Netherlands can just enjoy their football.
