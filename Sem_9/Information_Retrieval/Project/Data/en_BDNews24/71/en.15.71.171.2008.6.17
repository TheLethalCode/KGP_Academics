 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Customs officers recovered digital goods worth about Tk 1 crore from abandoned luggage at Zia International Airport on Tuesday, an official said. Airport customs assistant commissioner Neamul Islam told bdnews24.com that the haul included about 1,000 mobile phone sets, 1,177 digital music players, 197 mobile phone batteries and 8,140 memory cards. The goods, valued at about Tk 1 crore, were recovered from four abandoned bags, the customs official said. They were probably left by unidentified passengers on a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight, which arrived from Hong Kong at about 5.15 am, Neamul added. About a dozen passengers, suspected of trying to smuggle in the valuables, managed to escape from the scene. On a tip-off, assistant commissioner of customs Abu Noor Rashed had attempted to question a group of passengers, at the Balaka Restaurant on the second floor of the main airport building, Neamul said. When Abu Noor approached one of the group, the man and about a dozen of his fellow passengers ran off. Neamul and other customs officers joined the chase as the fleeing passengers entered an under-construction extension building and locked it from inside. The customs officer said civil aviation authorities were informed, and their people eventually tracked down a key to the extension building. When the door was unlocked, about two hours after the suspect passengers had locked it, none of them were found inside. A number of bags were later recovered from a bathroom on the second floor of the main airport building. As there were no tags on the luggage, the identity of the passengers could not be established. A case has been filed on the incident, assistant commissioner Neamul said. bdnew
