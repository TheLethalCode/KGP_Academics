 TOKYO, Tue Jun 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japanese warship is set to arrive in China next week in the first such visit since World War Two, Japan's Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday. The trip is the latest in a series of events aimed at improving the relationship between the two Asian giants, long at odds over a range of issues, many relating to Japan's invasion and occupation of much of China in the early 20th century. "China is an important neighbor, and improving defense and other ties will be beneficial not only for us but for peace and stability in the region," a spokeswoman quoted Ishiba as telling reporters. Though the two governments are keen to present a united front, concerns remain among ordinary people on both sides. A proposed Japanese military flight to transport tents and other equipment to victims of the massive quake in China in May was abandoned after an outcry on the Internet in China. President Hu Jintao's visit to Japan last month was marked by demonstrations against China's crackdown in Tibet. Japan's ship, the Sazanami, is set to dock at a naval port in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, from June 24-28, the ministry spokeswoman said. During that time the crew will take part in friendship events, including a joint concert in the city, Kyodo news agency said. The visit follows a similar trip by a Chinese missile destroyer to Tokyo in November. Japan and China are also pushing to resolve other bilateral issues, and both sides said on Tuesday they were making progress on a row over development of natural gas in disputed waters between the two countries
