 BERNE, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second-half goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Robin van Persie gave Netherlands a 2-0 win over Romania at Euro 2008 on Tuesday. Huntelaar sidefooted home in the 54th minute from a right-wing cross by Ibrahim Afellay. Van Persie then made sure of victory with a fierce left-foot drive into the roof of the net with three minutes to go. The Dutch finished with a 100 percent record at the top of Group C and will play Sweden or Russia in the quarter-finals. Romania needed to beat the Dutch to reach the last eight but after gritty and determined draws against the world champions and France earlier in the tournament, Victor Piturca's side lacked imagination and creativity against a Dutch side showing nine changes. A poor first half ended scoreless with a nervous and edgy Romania forced to shoot from long range. Captain Cristian Chivu fired over a free kick in a good central position after nine minutes before Adrian Mutu and Gabriel Tamas went close with 25-metre drives. Arjen Robben should have snatched the lead for the Dutch in the 36th minute when he latched on to a through ball from Huntelaar but slipped the ball wide from six metres with only the keeper to beat. Van Persie also had a good second-half opportunity when he turned defender Sorin Ghionea inside out before his shot was parried away superbly by an outstretched Bogdan Lobont in the Romania goal
