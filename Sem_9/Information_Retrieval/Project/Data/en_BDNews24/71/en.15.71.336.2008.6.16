 Neha Singh and Tenzin Pema BANGALORE, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wall Street analysts have forecast a huge drop in second-quarter earnings for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, while Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc is expected to post its first-ever quarterly loss, mainly on hedging losses. Analysts expect the three Wall Street investment banks reporting results this week to record losses mainly from ineffective hedging, amid an overall tough operating environment. Lehman is projected to take the worst hit. "Business conditions appear to be among the worst in several years, bulk asset sales have provided price transparency that should trigger more asset write-downs, and hedging was noticeably less effective," David Trone, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, said in note last week. Goldman's earnings are expected to be $3.03 to $3.70 per share, while Morgan Stanley's earnings are seen at 75 cents to $1.08 a share, according to analysts' data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Last week, Lehman said it expects a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, or $5.14 a share, mainly due to poor trading results and hedging losses. Lehman's second-quarter loss estimate was more than 10 times the analysts' average expectation. HEDGING LOSSES "In the current quarter, it appears that the brokers have not judged risk appropriately once again," Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co analyst Richard Bove said. "The hedge is not working," wrote Bove, who had nearly a year ago recommended that investors sell financial stocks as credit market problems began. Brokers for several years had benefited from growth of hedge funds as well as the expansion of the mortgage markets, trends no longer fueling Wall Street earnings. In more recent months, pressures on the brokerage industry have risen because of the economy, slowing investment banking activity and, perhaps most importantly, more evidence of faulty risk management. A MESSY QUARTER According to Fox-Pitt's Trone, the three investment banks are expected to incur gross writedowns of $9 billion on their "problem assets." Net writedowns for the quarter is expected to be "the worst since the bust began," and only marginally smaller than the gross estimate, Trone said. Exposure to subprime mortgage debt and structured finance products have already resulted in more than $400 billion of write-downs and credit losses industrywide since the middle of last year. In the second quarter, investment banks are also expected to incur further losses on "Alt-A" paper, even as writedowns across all other asset classes are projected to be lesser than those in the past quarters. "Alt-A" loans are usually given to those with clean credit histories but who have limited income documentation. "Unfortunately, we expect gains to be short-lived, as we believe the slowing economy will remain the key overhang over the stocks," said Roger Freeman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "Effectively, the second quarter is looking to be a messy quarter." Shares of Goldman Sachs closed at $178.29 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley closed at $41.04, and Lehman at $25.81. Through Friday, Lehman shares have plunged nearly 61 percent this year, compared with a 22 percent drop in the Amex Securities Broker-Dealer Index. Shares of Goldman have fallen 17 percent this year, while those of Morgan Stanley are down 23 percent.
