<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)The four-party alliance has announced programmes for June 17 and June 19 to demand the release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, son Tarique Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain announced the programme after a meeting of the alliance in his NAM flat. Delwar said the alliance leaders were pledge-bound on freedom for their leader and hoped the government would not create any obstacle during their programme. "We will go to the dialogue after our leader is freed." Without mentioning the Awami League, he said, "We hope they (Awami League) will not repeat what happened in '86 and will be with people." Delwar also asked for an election to be joined by all political parties. "We won't take part in any stage-managed dialogue," he added. Delwar demanded an arrangement to be made to send Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco abroad for medical treatment. "It is not acceptable if someone is freed and sent abroad while others are not." The four-party alliance has demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency by the end of June and elections by October. The alliance rejected the budget saying it was meant to "bash the poor" and demanded withdrawal of a decision to increase fertiliser prices. bdnews
