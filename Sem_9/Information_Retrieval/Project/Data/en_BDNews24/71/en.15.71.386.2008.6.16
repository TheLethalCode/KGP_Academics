<TITLE> Cech says costly blunder summed up awful season </TITLE>

 GENEVA, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Czech Republic's Petr Cech said the howler that gifted Turkey their equaliser in Sunday's make-or-break Euro 2008 match summed up his miserable season. Cech, one of the world's top goalkeepers, dropped the ball at the feet of Nihat Kahveci in the 87th minute and the Turkey captain stroked it into the empty net to make it 2-2. Nihat then added the winning third goal two minutes later, sending the Czechs sliding out of the tournament after they had been 2-0 up with 15 minutes left and seemingly headed for a quarter-final tie against Group B winners Croatia on Friday. "I know the mistake I made for their second goal is the reason we are going home," Cech told reporters after the Group A thriller. "That incident for me sums up my whole season." Playing for Chelsea in the League Cup final at Wembley he diverted the ball on to Jonathan Woodgate's head to hand London rivals Tottenham Hotspur a 2-1 victory. Uncharacteristic errors also cost points in Premier League games against Arsenal and Bolton Wanderers. The Champions League final defeat on penalties to Manchester United in Moscow was a further slap in the face, said Cech before adding the atmosphere in the dressing room after the Turkey game was subdued. "There wasn't complete silence but there wasn't much to say," he said. "We were almost there and suddenly we were out." The 26-year-old said he had no intention of quitting international football. "Of course I plan to carry on playing for the national team," said Cech. "I'm not the age yet to think about retiring. "I still have a lot of motivation and it's a wonderful thing to be able to play for your country. The quality of Czech football is still there and there is a bright future for us.
