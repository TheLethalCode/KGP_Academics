 HARARE, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The army's commander has urged Zimbabweans to defend the country against a "treacherous opposition" that threatened its sovereignty, a state newspaper reported on Saturday. General Constantine Chiwenga, who the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says is coordinating President Robert Mugabe's re-election campaign, said Western forces led by Britain were trying to seize control of Zimbabwe. Mugabe and MDC head Morgan Tsvangirai contest a run-off presidential election on June 27. The opposition leader won a first ballot in March but without the necessary majority. According to the Chronicle, the general said it was "imperative to Zimbabweans (to) remain resolute in defending their sovereignty" after freeing themselves from British occupation, oppression and exploitation at independence in 1980. "The raising of a new flag meant reclamation of independence and sovereignty and we should guard these jealously. "The former colonial power is manifesting itself through (economic) sanctions and a treacherous opposition, and threatens these values that we hold so dearly," he said. Chiwenga did not mention the MDC or Tsvangirai by name, but he and Zimbabwe's other security chiefs have previously branded them puppets of the West who should never be allowed to rule. "This treacherous act of reducing Africa and her people to mere spoils for powerful European countries is replaying itself in the present standoff between, on one hand, the United Kingdom and her allies and Zimbabwe on the other hand," Chiwenga said. The MDC claims 66 of its followers have been killed in attacks since the March poll, while some of the party's leaders, including Tsvangirai, have been detained. Zimbabwe's High Court ordered police to bring to court MDC secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is facing a treason charge, after police questioned the authenticity of a previous order, his lawyer Lewis Uriri told Reuters. Biti was arrested on his return to the country on Thursday.
