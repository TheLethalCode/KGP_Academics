<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)The release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is a just demand, not a favour, said the party's secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday. Delwar also urged the government to allow Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco to go abroad for better medical treatment. "Let them go abroad for better treatment," he urged the government. "The cases filed against her (Khaleda) are false. Her release is no favour, rather a just demand," Delwar told a discussion meeting, organised by the BNP's front organisation Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal at the Diploma Engineers Institute auditorium. The discussion was organised to mark the death anniversary of the late president Ziaur Rahman, founder of the BNP. On recent arrests of the political leaders and activists, the BNP secretary-general appointed by Khaleda before her arrest alleged that the government has arrested 400,000 people. "The government has created an awful situation by arresting people en masse. Thousands of people have been absconding fearing arrests," Delwar said. He demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency by June 30. "The power of the judiciary is being curbed by the emergency power rules." BNP's joint-secretary Nazrul Islam Khan said: "We want Khaleda Zia's release for political causenot only for her treatment. She must be released for a meaningful dialogue and election." bdnews
