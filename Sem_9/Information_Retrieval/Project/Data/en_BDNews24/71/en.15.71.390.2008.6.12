<TITLE> Little-known Casson poses new test for Windies batters </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm spinner Beau Casson will make his debut for Australia in the third test against West Indies at the Kensington Oval on Thursday, with his opponents knowing little about the 25-year-old. The New South Wales spinner bowls 'chinamen' or unorthodox left-arm wrist spin which turns into the right-hand batsman - a relatively rare sight in test cricket and one West Indies skipper Chris Gayle admits he hasn't prepared for. "I haven't done any homework on him, I am sure the coach will have something to discuss though at the team meeting," Gayle said on Wednesday. After last week's drawn second test in Antigua, West Indies in-form batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul said he had never seen footage of Casson bowling and the only glimpse he had of the new face was as he warmed up. It is hardly surprising that the host batsmen have yet to familiarise themselves with the man who has been given his chance by Stuart MacGill's decision to call an end to his career mid-tour. With Shane Warne and then MacGill so prolific in wicket-taking, Australia have had no need to throw youngsters in early. Apart from this season's Pura Cup final, the last time Australia captain Ricky Ponting saw Casson bowl was when the spinner was a rookie at the Australian cricket academy. "I remember years ago at the cricket academy, Tassie went on a tour to South Australia pre-season and he was in the academy team," Ponting said. "I faced a bit of him then and realised he was a kid with a bit of a future. He's very eager to learn but he's pretty well sorted to tell you the truth, he knows his stuff," Ponting told reporters. Casson's knowledge is a product of his obsession with the sport. "I'm a cricket tragic so I don't miss too many balls. I'm making sure I am watching every ball out there. There have been brief notes in my head, nothing written down on paper or things like that," he said. "I can't get enough whether I am playing it or not, I'm watching dvd's in my room or things like that. I don't think there's any magical dvd or book that's done it for me. It's just loving the game." For such a student of the game his debut, when he will become the 401st player to wear the baggy green cap, is likely to be an emotional occasion. "You try to be all macho and manly, but it certainly did have its toll on me. Thinking about 401 still brings a tear to me eye and I'm not ashamed to admit that
