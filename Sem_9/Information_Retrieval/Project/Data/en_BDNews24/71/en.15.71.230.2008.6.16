<TEXT>
 NEUSTIFT, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain coach Luis Aragones plans to ring the changes for his team's final Group D game against eliminated Greece on Wednesday with their place in the quarter-finals as group winners already assured. "My initial thought is to change almost everyone and give some of the other players a chance to show they are ready," Aragones told a news conference on Sunday. "At least that is my thought right now, but it could change when I sleep on it." Spain followed up their 4-1 victory over Russia with a last-gasp 2-1 win against Sweden in Innsbruck on Saturday and will now meet Romania, France or Italy in the last eight. Defender Carles Puyol picked up an injury to the sole of his right foot, Xavi and Santi Cazorla have minor knocks and fellow midfielder David Silva has a problem with a toe nail. Aragones was pleased with the team's performances in the first two games but added that it was important for the players to keep their feet on the ground. "We've worked hard to build our morale," he said. "We're confident in our own ability but it's my job to ensure it doesn't go any further than that. We still haven't achieved anything. "Most of our players have been in a big tournament before and they've seen that things are decided by small details. They are a young group of players and have learned that quickly." Fernando Torres, who scored the opener against Sweden, said they could not yet be classed among the tournament favourites. "We've done our job so far but it is from the quarter-finals onwards that it really counts," said the Spain striker. "Teams prove themselves by what they do on the pitch. We've been in this situation many times before and for one reason or another we haven't achieved anything so we don't feel like favourites nor do we want to be.
