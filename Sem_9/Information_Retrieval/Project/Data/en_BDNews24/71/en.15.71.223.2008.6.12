 BRIDGETOWN, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Chris Gayle boosted West Indies's hopes of levelling their three-test series against Australia by declaring himself fit for the decisive third test starting Thursday at the Kensington Oval. Gayle has been out of action for nearly two months with a groin injury. "I am at 90 percent but I will be able to cope and will definitely play," Gayle told a news conference after practice on Wednesday. The left-hander will retake the reigns of the side from vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan with the series standing at 1-0 to Australia. Gayle watched the first two tests from the sidelines but the popular skipper has been a fixture in the dressing room and was close to a return for the drawn second test in Antigua. "In Antigua the physio said I was about 70 percent, I didn't want to risk it so we gave it some more time. Worked in between the test matches and I am feeling a bit better now," he said, adding that running between the wickets would be his biggest challenge. "That is a bit difficult but otherwise batting is comfortable, no problem," said the Jamaican. Gayle also welcomes back Guyanese batsman Sewnarine Chattergoon and with Xavier Marshall likely to keep his place after a half-century in Antigua, he has three opening batsmen to choose from. With right-hander Marshall offering a right-left combination for the opening pairing, it is likely to be Chattergoon, who impressed in the recent series against Sri Lanka before picking up a shoulder injury, who drops down the order. Gayle was full of praise for the Guyanese and believes the middle order is where the biggest improvement needs to be if West Indies are to level the series. "He is very stable and is a very good player, definitely one for the future. He got a good start against Sri Lanka but unfortunately injury came in for him as well. "He catches well in the slips and he may be small but he is a gutsy batsman with a good technique as well. Whenever he gets a start he will definitely bat for a long time," said Gayle. "We need the stability in the middle there to actually win games even though opening is important as well to give the team a good start. All in all, it is getting there, but hopefully it can get better still," he added of his team's displays in the first two tests. The trickiest test in selection will be whether to stick with all-rounder Darren Sammy's medium pace or to gamble on left-arm spinner Suliemann Benn on his home ground
