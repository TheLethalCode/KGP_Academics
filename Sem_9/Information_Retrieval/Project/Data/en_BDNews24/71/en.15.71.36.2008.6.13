<TITLE> Dejected Pakistan to face confident India in Kitply final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  A disheartened Pakistan team will look to heal the wounds they suffered in their group match against India as they face their rivals again in the final of the Kitply one-day international series Saturday. The match, starting at 3.00pm (Bangladesh Standard Time), will be broadcast live on satellite channels Neo Sports and Geo TV, as well as Bangladesh's state run television from the capital's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. After their worst-ever 140-run drubbing from India, the Pakistani cricketers appear under immense pressure as Nasim Ashraf, chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board, lashed out the team's management after the embarrassing loss. Ashraf grilled them about Shoaib Malik's captaincy, keeper Kamran Akmal's unsporting behaviour during the match and the team's apparent lack of resolve and commitment. Shrugging off the poor performance coach Geoff Lawson, however, was looking forward to a come back in the final with a win against India. "We will certainly go to win the match; a loss doesn't stop everything and you should remember it's a one-day international," said the Australian coach, who nevertheless looked irritated when he was asked about Nasim Ashraf's letter. The coach said the players will have to make a little extra effort with batting and bowling if they want to win the final. But terming their defeat to India as 'in the past', Lawson said the players had been toiling hard for the last two days and eager to show better form in the final. He did not want to rate any team as favourite in the final, however. Indian opener Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir trounce the Pakistani bowlers to put on 155 runs in an opening stand that led India to rack an imposing 333/8 against their perennial foes. The Pakistani coach said they would have to grab all opportunities against Sehwag. Sehwag scored 89 and 59 in India's first two matches with the help of some luck. India are apparently high with confidence after thrashing Pakistan and Bangladesh to go to the final. India's South African coach Garry Kristen was not worrying whether openers Sehwag and Gambhir would give India a flying start as in the previous two matches. "They (Sehwag and Gambhir) have been playing pretty good cricket and I won't impose any burden on them to make such a brisk start in the final, as our middle order is good enough to recover any initial damage if the openers fail tomorrow," said Kristen. India saw 155 and 85 runs between Sehwag and Gambhir for the opening stand against Pakistan and Bangladesh respectively. Kristen said that the players were very keen and motivated and hopefully will play some good cricket in the final. The Indian coach thought that Pakistan would also be more motivated to do better after the loss to India in the group-stage match. But, Kristen said, that they were concentrating on their own game instead of thinking about the opponents. bd
