 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad, an umbrella organisation of labour rights groups, has disputed the finance adviser's comment that 'government managed industries cannot thrive' due to the attitude of state-employed workers. "The government is just passing the buck, that is, shifting the responsibilities on to the workers," SKOP members said in a statement Monday. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Saturday industrial units cannot run effectively under government management. "The employees of government-run companies do not work properly," the adviser said, addressing a discussion on the proposed budget and development of the northern region. "They just wait for the salary at the end of the month, although government-owned industries are making huge losses year after year." "If we want to save the sugar industry in the north there is no alternative to privatising," said Mirza Aziz. The labour leaders in their statement Monday said: "Many of our denationalised industries, once reputed, are on the verge of ruination today." "It's because our past governments had adopted erratic industrial policies, as advised by the World Bank and the IMF, that our jute, steel, machinery and other flagship industries have lost their shine following nationalisation, which is also being upheld by the present government," the SKOP members said. "The finance adviser's opinion only substantiates our allegations." "Erratic policies, administrative failures, unwarranted interference by the ministries, corruption and bureaucratic glitches have almost destroyed the nationalised industry sector." "The denationalised industrial units have also faced closures without exception, which has resulted in exacerbating unemployment instead of creating job opportunities," said the labour leaders in their statement. The statement was signed by SKOP coordinator Wazedul Islam Khan, and leaders of Jatiya Sramik Federation, Jatiya Sramik League, Jatiya Sramik Jote, Jatiya Sramik Federation Bangladesh, Mukto Sramik Federation, Labour Federation, Shamajtantrik Sramik Front, Trade Union Shangho and Free Trade Union Congress. bdnews
