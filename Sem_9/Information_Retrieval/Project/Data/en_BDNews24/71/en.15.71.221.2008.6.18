 BIRMINGHAM, England, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealander Scott Styris, slogged for two sixes by Kevin Pietersen when the England batsman switched stances in the first one-day international on Sunday, has endorsed the revolutionary shot. Right-hander Pietersen changed to a left-hander's stance and altered his grip on the bat to hit Styris over the boundary twice during his match-winning 110 not out. The tactic was approved by the Marylebone Cricket Club on Tuesday. "There's nothing wrong with what he's doing," Styris told reporters at Edgbaston. "As a bowler you have to think on your feet but it's nothing different to a guy coming down the wicket at you. "Sometimes you just have to take your hat off and say 'well played'. We all admire good cricket and I think that is what it was." Styris said New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram, who bats left-handed, had experimented with a changed stance. "I know he has hit balls out of the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) batting right-handed," he said. "It crossed my mind briefly when I was out there (batting) to play it but if I would have got out it would have been a double blow." Off-spinner Graeme Swann, who impressed for England in convincing wins over the Kiwis in Friday's Twenty20 International and Sunday's first of five one-day matches, also backed Pietersen. "It's brilliant, I can't understand the furore it has caused," Swann said. "It got 16,000 people leaving the ground talking about it. It's a freak of nature how he can do it. Those hits didn't just dribble over the line, they cleared it by a distance. "Had he been caught people would have said 'what an idiot', like when (Mike) Gatting reverse swept and lost the World Cup in '87. For Kev to pull it off and to hit it as far as he did was laughable, it was pure KP. He does try it in the nets and he is almost impossible to bowl to when he decides to try things. "I'm sure there will be other people trying it but I'm willing to bet there won't be another person in the world who could play that shot like Kev. We were gob-smacked in the dressing room." England recalled Andrew Strauss to their squad after opener Alastair Cook was ruled out of Wednesday's second one-day international with a shoulder injury. New Zealand make one change with Grant Elliott set to make his debut in place of James Marshal
