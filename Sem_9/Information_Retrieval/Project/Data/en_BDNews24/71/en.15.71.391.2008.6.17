<TITLE> Tiny Swiss brewer plans own Euro 2008 giant-killing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tiny local brewer in the Swiss city of Basel has set itself up as a David taking on the Goliath of official Euro 2008 beer provider Carlsberg and says it has seen a huge jump in sales as a result. "Unser Bier" has had thousands of t-shirts, beer mats and bottle labels printed up with the slogan: "Basel. Mehr als nur Calrsbreg", or "Basel. More than only Calrsbreg", a pun on the city's official Euro 2008 motto: "Basel. More than 90 minutes". The mis-spelling of Carlsberg's name is deliberate. The campaign was prompted by sponsorship rules which dictate that only beer produced by Carlsberg , the world's fifth-biggest brewer, can be sold at official Euro 2008 venues such as the stadiums and fan zones. Unser Bier co-founder Istvan Akos said sales figures for June are not yet available but he expected a new record with double the amount of revenue compared with a year earlier. "We are brewing around the clock to keep up with demand," Akos, who founded the company in 1997, said in a telephone interview. With thousands of German and Dutch fans heading to the city for the Euro 2008 quarter-finals later this week there will probably be a further big boost to sales, he added. "A lot of people have expressed sympathy for our campaign. We are the local answer to globalisation," he said. "What we are doing is essentially ambush marketing. UEFA is the street car and we are riding without a ticket." MEAGRE SALES Some traders in fan zones in the host cities have complained of meagre beer sales and there is evidence that Swiss drinkers prefer to throw down a few glasses of the local ale before heading to watch matches on the big screens. Organisers have even fenced off three bars next to the central fan zone in Basel because they opted not to sell Carlsberg during the three-week tournament co-hosted by Switzerland and Austria. Denmark's Carlsberg had sales of around 5.9 billion euros ($9.15 billion) in 2007 and shifted 95 million bottles of beer every day in more than 100 countries, according to its own figures. Unser Bier, by contrast, had revenue of about 1.1 million euros last year, producing some 4,000 hectolitres (88,000 gallons). Carlsberg spokesman Steen Laursen said the company welcomes competition from small local brewers and is not bothered by the Unser Bier campaign. "We appreciate competition because it keeps us on our toes," he said. On its web site (www.carlsberggroup.com), the company says it would not be economical to attempt to brand other beers alongside Carlsberg at Euro 2008. "This would significantly water down the effect of Carlsberg's sponsorship investment," it says, adding that it is "not at liberty to disclose the financial details" of its agreement with UEFA, European soccer's governing body. "Carlsberg has great respect for local tradition and taste of beer, and itself markets many, many brilliant local and regional brands," the company adds. "However, for this special occasion we believe and hope that Carlsberg should be the fans' preferred choice." At one of the bars fenced off from the fan zone in central Basel, 54-year-old local beer drinker Esther Maurer said the needs of the city's brewers should be taken more into account. "It's stupid that such a marketing cartel is allowed to exist," she said over a glass of the local Ueli Bier
