 JERUSALEM, Mon Jun 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert proposes leaving hard decisions on Jerusalem's future out of any agreement that may be reached this year with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, his office said on Monday. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ended her sixth trip to the region this year with little sign of progress in nudging both sides toward a peace deal by the end of 2008 -- a goal widely viewed as unrealistic. She held three-way talks on Monday morning with Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Disputes over Jewish settlement expansion and a corruption scandal that may topple Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have undercut US efforts to reach a statehood deal before President George W. Bush steps down in January, officials in the region said. "The goal is still to reach an agreement with the Palestinians by the end of Bush's term," Mark Regev, Olmert's spokesman, told reporters during a visit to Israel's border with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. But Regev added that Olmert believed it would be "difficult" to reach agreement on the sensitive issue of Jerusalem by the end of the year. He suggested that any joint document look at ways of moving forward with negotiations over the future of the Holy City. "You could have an agreed framework -- methodology on how to move forward -- so Jerusalem would be mentioned but mentioned in the sense of how to move forward," Regev said. "We don't want to see that issue (Jerusalem) torpedoing the chances of getting a document," Regev said, adding that Jerusalem was the most divisive issue facing negotiators. Commenting on Regev's remarks, Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the Palestinian negotiating team and a top aide to Abbas, told Reuters: "There won't be an agreement without Jerusalem. The Israelis know that very well." During her visit, Rice warned Israel that its continued settlement building was harming the peace negotiations. Israel insists its settlement projects are consistent with long-standing policies that do not contradict the peace efforts. Palestinians fear the enclaves will deny them a viable state. A spokesman for the Jerusalem municipality announced on Sunday that a regional planning board had authorized building at least 2,550 new homes by 2020 in the occupied West Bank in areas that Israel considers part of Jerusalem
