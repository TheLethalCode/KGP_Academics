 SYDNEY, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia allrounder Andrew Symonds has been fined after sleeping in and missing the team bus to a training session in Barbados. Symonds was 10 minutes late for the bus but did not miss any part of practice after finding his own way to Kensington Oval, the Australian Associated Press reported. He was fined an undisclosed amount by the team's leadership group consisting of skipper Ricky Ponting, vice-captain Michael Clarke, coach Tim Nielsen and manager Steve Bernard. Symonds is the second Australian player to be fined on their tour of West Indies after sleeping in. Spinner Stuart MacGill was also fined for turning up late on day two of the second test in Antigua. Symonds was also fined and suspended for two one-day games after arriving drunk on the morning of a one-day match against Bangladesh on the 2005 Ashes tour
