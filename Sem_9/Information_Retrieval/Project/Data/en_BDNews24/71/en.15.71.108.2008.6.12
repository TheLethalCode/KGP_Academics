 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)--Lieutenant general Abu Tayeb Muhammad Zahirul Alam joined the foreign ministry Thursday to take up his new assignment. Zahirul was transferred from the National Defence College as its commandant on June 2 in a major army shuffle. Tipped to be Bangladesh's high commissioner to Australia, Zahirul met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his office Thursday. "He came and spent some time in my office. He has joined the foreign ministry," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. But the adviser could not specify when Zahirul would be tasked with his new assignment and sent to Australia. "There are some formalities in appointing high commissioners or ambassadors. It takes some time." The adviser said lieutenant general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, also placed under the foreign ministry, had not seen him. General Masud did not join the foreign ministry yet, foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Masud only met Touhid in his office on Tuesday. bdn
