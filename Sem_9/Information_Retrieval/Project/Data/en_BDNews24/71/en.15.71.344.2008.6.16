<TITLE> South Korea warns of crisis as truckers strike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean construction workers joined striking truckers on Monday in the latest blow to new President Lee Myung-bak, whose repeated policy stumbles have seen his popularity plunge after less than four months in office. Piling pressure on Lee, there was no progress in talks overnight in Washington where South Korean officials were trying to revise an April agreement to import U.S. beef -- public opposition to which triggered the recent wave of street protests at home against Lee's government. Criticism of the beef deal, which stemmed from mad cow disease fears, has mushroomed into a wider attack against the pro-business policies that helped give the conservative leader his landslide victory in December's presidential election and ended a decade of left-of-centre rule in Asia's fourth largest economy. The striking construction workers are pressing for cheaper fuel and higher pay. The militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions is expected later to announce that it will call on its more than 600,000 members to stage a walkout to demonstrate opposition to Lee's privatization and pension reform plans. Lee's multiple missteps since his election win, such as having to withdraw his nominations for some top posts and the beef import debacle, have unleashed a torrent of criticism which has clearly caught the government off-guard. Lee is widely expected to ditch a number of top aides and ministers soon and may even face the humiliating prospect of inviting his chief conservative rival to become prime minister to help raise his popularity, which has tumbled to under 20 percent. The protests have come as a global economic softening and surging inflation have combined to dash Lee's hopes for 6 percent economic growth this year, part of his election campaign vow to bring South Koreans greater wealth. Most economists say he will be lucky to even match last year's 5 percent rise. Speaking to Asian and European finance ministers on the resort island of Jeju, Lee warned that the world was facing its biggest economic crisis in 30 years. "It's no overstatement to say that the world is faced with the gravest crisis since the oil shock in the 1970s, with oil, food and raw materials prices skyrocketing," he said. On Sunday, Finance Minister Kang Man-soo said the government was reviewing its policies in the face of mounting public anger. But he did not say how far the government might be prepared to water down the sweeping reforms it said it would enact to boost local and foreign investment and make the country of 50 million people better able to compete with neighboring giants Japan and China. So far, local financial markets have been prepared to weather the political storm. "(The truckers) strike is having little impact on the stock market today. But if it drags on longer -- say two weeks or more -- it will certainly affect sectors that rely heavily on road transport," said Juhn Chong-kyu, a market analyst at Samsung Securities. The latest round of beef talks between South Korean and U.S. officials ended without agreement but the two sides have said they want more talks. The negotiations are addressing South Korea's request to block shipments of U.S. beef from cattle older than 30 months, which are believed to carry a higher risk of mad-cow disease. "The two sides agreed to cooperate in seeking a mutually satisfactory solution...and noted that more time was needed to come up with practical steps," South Korea's trade ministry said in a statement.
