 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government must not bow down to pressure or hasten through the trials of those accused of graft, Gano Forum president Kamal Hossain said Friday, calling on the law adviser not to falter in dispensing justice. He said the graft cases so far filed against political figures and others must be seen through to the final stage by due process. "These cases should not be ended under anybody's pressure or without following proper procedures," Kamal Hossain said, speaking at an extended meeting of the Jubo Gano Forum central committee, held at the Gano Forum office in Arambagh, "Of course some quarters are creating pressure on the government on behalf of those under trial." Calling on the government, he said: "You are facing a test of firmness, honesty. Fifteen crore people are with you. You must give priority to the national interest." Urging the nation to elect honest and competent candidates in the next election the renowned lawyer urged people to remain alert "so that those who have been ejected from the political field due to their corruption can not return." "We do not want to see those old faces." Addressing the Jubo Gano Forum leaders, he said: "You must enter politics for the true welfare of the people instead of being involved in politics for personal ambition." bdnew
