<TEXT>
 INNSBRUCK, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be fit enough to play in his team's crunch Euro 2008 match against Russia despite being substituted at halftime against Spain on Saturday with a sore knee. Coach Lars Lagerback also said Ibrahimovic's strike partner Henrik Larsson, who came off late in the game holding the back of his leg in the 2-1 defeat to Spain, would also recover in time for Wednesday's Group D game. "Zlatan said his knee was sore. He could have gone on for a little bit more but we decided to make the substitution and not take the risk. But he will be okay for the next game," coach Lars Lagerback told reporters after the game in Innsbruck. "Henrik will also bounce back. He has worked tirelessly as always and he felt a little tired and sore. But he will be back." Before being substituted, Ibrahimovic scored his second goal in as many games to level matters for Sweden after Spain's Fernando Torres had put his side in front. David Villa snatched victory for the Spaniards late into stoppage time. A team spokesman later said utility player Niclas Alexandersson would return to training on Sunday after missing the Spain game with a calf strain. "He has recovered well and is expected to train tomorrow. We will see about his availability for the Russia game after that," Thomas Saleteg told Reuters. Spain, who beat Russia in their opening match, play Greece in their final group game on Wednesday in Salzburg
