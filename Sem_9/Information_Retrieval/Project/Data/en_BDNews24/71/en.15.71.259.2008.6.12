 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) - The government has reset fares for CNG-run buses and minibuses in Dhaka and Chittagong cities against the backdrop of the price hike of compressed natural gas. The fare for CNG-run buses in the two cities will be Tk 1.20 per passenger per kilometre, the government said in a statement Thursday. The fare for CNG-run minibuses in the same cities has been fixed at Tk 1.10 per passenger per kilometre. The minimum fare for CNG-run buses (except for minibuses) in Dhaka and Chittagong cities has been fixed at Tk 5. Diesel-run buses in Dhaka and Chittagong cities have been directed to undergo CNG conversion in three months from now. The government took the decision Thursday on the basis of recommendations of a nine-member committee formed on May 21 to reset bus fares. The government statement also said that on each route, a passenger will have to be given a fare ticket with route number, route name, fare amount, telephone number of the company or owner and law-enforcement agencies for lodging complaints. Every bus must show the fare chart, according to the decision. bd
