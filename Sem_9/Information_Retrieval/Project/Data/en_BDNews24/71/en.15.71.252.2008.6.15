 INNSBRUCK, June 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's last-gasp defeat to Spain on Saturday showed they will need an injection of pace and imagination if they are to progress at Euro 2008. David Villa's winner for Spain in added time means the Scandinavians must beat Russia in their final Group D match on Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals. "Our destiny is still in our own hands," Sweden coach Lars Lagerback said after the match in Innsbruck. "We will recharge our batteries and bounce back. This team has enough character. We still have a realistic chance to qualify." On Saturday's evidence just how real Sweden's chance to progress against a hungry-looking Russian side is debatable. They have character, grit, determination and lots of experience but lack ambition and a real cutting edge. For most of the Spain match, Sweden looked one-dimensional and predictable in their approach. Their set pieces, which Lagerback prides himself on, were poor to say the least.

Wilhelmsson's replacement Johan Elmander was better in the second half but found himself drifting towards the centre to cover up a lack of quality in the middle of midfield. Fullbacks Mikael Nilsson and the inexperienced Fredrik Stoor were roasted by Spain's two wide players and Fernando Torres waltzed in behind them on too many occasions for Lagerback's comfort. Expect the return of injured Niclas Alexandersson in place of Stoor for the Russia game. But of most concern is Sweden's reliance on striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic who scored a second wonderful individual goal in as many games. "If we are too dependent on Zlatan, I don't know. He is a world class player and our chances are improved when he is on the pitch," Lagerback said. Once Ibrahimovic, who has a long-standing knee complaint, was substituted at half time, Sweden never looked like scoring again. Without his favoured strike partner, 36-year-old Henrik Larsson showed his age and looked very tired and frustrated. Sweden again ran out of steam in the final quarter of an hour just as they did in their win over Greece and Spain's last gasp winner was not a total surprise. But with a squad dominated by 30-somethings, it is difficult to know how Lagerback can address a problem which could prove to be t
