 BAD TATZMANNSDORF, Austria, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Slaven Bilic warned Croatia on Tuesday to be wary of another stunning late comeback by Turkey in their Euro 2008 quarter-final. Turkey booked their place in Friday's match in Vienna after coming from behind to beat Switzerland 2-1 with a stoppage-time winner and defeating Czech Republic 3-2 after trailing 2-1 with 87 minutes on the clock in their final Group A game. "Their comebacks in those two games were quite remarkable and showed they are a force to be reckoned with," Bilic told a news conference. "Turkey are quick and aggressive and have several very skilful players, so I am really not surprised that they progressed to the quarter-finals. "We will take nothing for granted although we would certainly like to score first because they are by no means invincible. Like all teams in the tournament, they have weaknesses too." Croatia qualified for the last eight with a game to spare after Group B victories over co-hosts Austria and pre-tournament favourites Germany
