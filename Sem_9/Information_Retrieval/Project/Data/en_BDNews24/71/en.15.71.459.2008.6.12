<TITLE> Britain's Brown faces rough ride over terrorism law </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's narrow victory in a vote on extending the time terrorism suspects can be held without charge has failed to end doubts about his authority. Brown, his popularity at record lows in opinion polls, won a parliamentary vote on Wednesday with a majority reduced from 65 to just nine. He had to rely on Northern Irish lawmakers to secure victory and offered concessions to rebels in his governing Labour Party, but 36 Labour lawmakers still voted against the measure. The slim majority is unlikely to reassure Labour members of parliament about his suitability to lead them into the next parliamentary election, due by 2010. A Labour lawmaker in the House of Lords said Brown would face a tough time when the upper chamber meets, probably before the end of July, to debate his plan to extend the time terrorism suspects can be held from 28 days to 42. "The prime minister might find he's getting a bit of a roasting at the other end of parliament because the House of Lords will actually chew this up," Baroness Helena Kennedy told the BBC. "I will be a rebel." The House of Lords can stall legislation but cannot prevent it from becoming law. However its opposition could drag on the process for months, proving a major embarrassment to Brown. Labour did badly in local councils and lost a parliamentary seat to the opposition Conservative Party in May. Brown is also grappling with an economic slowdown, rising inflation and anxiety over a housing market slump. "We won the argument, the government bought the votes," David Davies, Conservative home affairs spokesman, said of Wednesday's vote. "Ministers utterly failed to provide the evidence in favour of 42 days in the Commons and the measure is likely to be rejected in the House of Lords." One opinion poll this week showed a majority of Britons back extending the pre-charge detention time limit to 42 days. Home Office Minister Tony McNulty said Wednesday "was a squeaky day all round" but vowed to ensure the legislation is not watered down. "I don't think this marks the beginning of the end or whatever else for the prime minister," he told Sky News television. Human rights organisations and opposition politicians have condemned the measure, saying it is arbitrary, unworkable and an affront to civil liberties. In an embarrassing incident for the government, the BBC said on Wednesday a top intelligence official had left a file with secret documents about Iraq and al Qaeda on a train. A passenger found the orange folder and handed it in to the BBC, which said it contained top secret documents on Iraq and al Qaeda. The official has been suspended.
