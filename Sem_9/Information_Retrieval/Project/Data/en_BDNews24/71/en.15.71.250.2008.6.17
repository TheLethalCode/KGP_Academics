<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of at least two garment factories in Mirpur were involved in clashes with police Tuesday, a police official said. The angry workers, protesting 'closure of a factory' and demanding unpaid dues, vandalised a number of vehicles. Police arrested 12 workers from the scene, Mirpur police chief Mohiuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Babul Ali, a worker of SQ Garments, told bdnews24.com that workers at his factory had been demanding overdue salaries for several days, after the owners had retrenched some 1,200 employees in several phases with varying explanations. "The owners are procrastinating over the payment of dues to those that have been laid-off," Babul said. He claimed that employees coming to the factory Tuesday morning saw that the owners had closed the factory, with no warning, for an indefinite period, whereupon they took to the streets. They went to the neighbouring TS Garments and asked the workers there to extend their support. At least 25 garment workers were injured as police charged with batons, and were taken to different hospitals, said Babul. TS Garments worker Omar Ali claimed the police had charged them with unnecessary force. Kafrul police officer Fazlul Haque said SQ Garments' knitwear section had been closed temporarily after the knitwear workers had been protesting for several days, but other sections of the factory remained open and workers were carrying on with their work. bdnews24
