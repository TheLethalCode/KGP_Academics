 SEEKIRCHEN, Austria, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece keeper Antonis Nikopolidis and defender Paraskevas Antzas on Sunday announced their international retirements after their final Euro 2008 Group D match against Spain on Wednesday. Nikopolidis, 37, who was a member of the victorious Euro 2004 team and has won 89 caps, and 31-year-old Antzas, who has 25 caps, said it was time for younger players to come into the squad. "For me the match on Wednesday will be the last match," Nikopolidis said. "We lived through a great time and bad times but the important thing is we always were a family." Greece are already certain to make a group stage exit from the tournament after Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Russia
