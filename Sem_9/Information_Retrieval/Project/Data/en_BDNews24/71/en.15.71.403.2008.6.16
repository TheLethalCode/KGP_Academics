<TITLE> Dr Kamal says Hasina release legal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Gano Forum president Kamal Hossain said Monday that former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's temporary release was legal. Earlier at a party meeting Friday, Dr Kamal without mentioning Hasina's name said he suspected that some agents were working inside the caretaker government to execute the release of corrupt politicians. He also demanded an investigation. While his comments created a stir in political circles, Monday's remark stood as a shift from his previous position. Hasina's personal physician Prof Modasser Ali had criticised Kamal and said the release occurred in line with the recommendations by a medical board. Kamal told reporters at the party's central office in Arambagh Monday: "Now, I have come to know that following the decision of the medical board, Sheikh Hasina has been released on parole legally. I have nothing else to say." He made the comment after the reporters sought his explanation about his comment at the news briefing. Replying to a question regarding reports on the release process of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her two sons, he said, "I later read in newspapers that law was being changed in favour of those who are on trial. What worries me is that it is being demanded that some persons be released without any appeal." "How can it be done legally without appeal? This process is not constitutional, not legal." Dr Kamal urged all to build a broader unity to face national challenges. He said people expected that the caretaker government would work neutrally. bdnew
