<TITLE> Govt management failing to run industries: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Saturday industrial units cannot run effectively under government management. The employees of government-run companies do not work properly, said the adviser, speaking at a discussion on 'Budget for fiscal 2008-09 and development of northern region', organised by North Bengal Development Council at CIRDAP auditorium. "They just wait for the salary at the end of the month, although government-owned industries are making huge losses year after year." "If we want to save the sugar industry in the North there is no alternative to privatising them," said Mirza Aziz. In the budget for the outgoing current year, import duty on raw and refined sugar had been fixed in a way that local sugar enjoyed an advantage amounting to Tk 7 to Tk 8 per kg, the adviser said. "Despite all, local sugar mills are failing to survive in the competition." The adviser said a budget cannot only look at the interest of businessmen and industrialists. "It has to consider the interest of all consumers." If high duty is imposed on the import of sugar to protect the local sugar industry, sugar will sell at Tk 40 to Tk 50 a kg. "That's why tolerable duty has been imposed on the import of sugar, considering the interest of consumers in the new budget," he said. "The present caretaker government has officially recognised regional inequality. The government formed a high-level committee to remove the inequality." "The committee has already submitted its report, which will be published soon. Necessary steps will be taken to remove regional inequality," the adviser said. "The caretaker government will create a solid base for the next elected government so that it can implement recommendations made by the committee." Another committee has been formed to remove the monga in the northern region with commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman as its head. The new budget proposed steps to bring down inflation to a tolerable level, the finance adviser said. "Not only Bangladesh, the whole world is experiencing high inflation. In India, inflation has reached 8.7 percent, highest in seven years," said Mirza Aziz. "In the new budget we have fixed a target of bringing down average inflation to 9 percent," he said. The government has taken steps to increase power generation, Mirza said. "By December, several hundred megawatts of electricity will be added to the national grid." bdnews24.c
