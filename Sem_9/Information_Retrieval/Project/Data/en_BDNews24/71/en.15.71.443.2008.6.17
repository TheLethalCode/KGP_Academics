<TITLE> UEFA to rule on coaches on Wednesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA will decide on Wednesday whether coach Joachim Loew can sit on the bench in Germany's Euro 2008 quarter-final against Portugal, following the double sending-off in Monday's Group B match against Austria. Loew and his Austrian counterpart Josef Hickersberger were sent to the stands by Spanish referee Manuel Mejuto shortly before half-time in Germany's 1-0 win, after repeated exchanges involving the fourth official. UEFA rules state that an automatic suspension should follow but spokesman William Gaillard said on Tuesday a disciplinary committee would meet to decide whether to invoke the rule. If Loew does receive a ban for the "sending-off" he will be unable to contact his players once they arrive at the stadium in Basel for Thursday's quarter-final. As Austria were knocked out, any suspension for Hickersberger would apply to his next official match in charge, whether for Austria or any other nation. Loew said on Tuesday he did not expect to be suspended. "I expect to be vindicated and absolved," he told a news conference at the team's training base in Tenero. "I haven't offended anyone. I didn't transgress any serious rules." Loew said the incident arose from the fourth official's attempts to stop the coaches using their technical areas. "All I said was that my colleague and I had every right to be in the technical zone and use it to its full," Loew said. "From the start he kept telling me to go and sit down. "Maybe I stepped over the line but I want to be clear that there was no argument between me and the Austrian coach." SEEING PLAYERS Loew said he had briefly seen his players and assistant coach Hansi Flick at halftime before being told he was not allowed in the dressing room. Hickersberger told a news conference in Vienna he had also been down to see his players. "I heard that as a coach if I am sent off by a referee, then I am not allowed into the dressing room," he said with his customary dry humour. "That is what I heard, then I thought to myself, 'I must have misheard,' so of course I went to my team. "I think it is a first in the history of football that the managers of both teams in a big tournament must leave the field at the same time. In some way we must congratulate the fourth official for this unique feathe has gone down in history." The double dismissal was greeted by jeers by both sets of fans at Vienna's Ernst Happel stadium. "It seems the two coaches were bickering and left their technical areas," Gaillard said at a news conference. "The fourth official alerted the referee and the second time he came over he sent them off." If suspended, Loew would have the right to appeal and a hearing could be arranged very quickly, Gaillard said. Loew joked that he had enjoyed the view from the stands so much that he might stay away from the touchline in future. "You get a fantastic view," he said
