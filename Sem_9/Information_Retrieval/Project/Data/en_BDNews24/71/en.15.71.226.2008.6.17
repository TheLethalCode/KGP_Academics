 Rajbari, June 16 (bdnews24.com)  At least two passengers died after a trawler caught in an evening storm capsized on the river Padma off Rajbari town Monday, an official said. The dead have been identified as Jahanara Begum, 27, and Bhanu Begum, 55. About 30 passengers went missing after the trawler had turned upside down with about 100 people on board. The rest of the passengers swam ashore. Deputy commissioner for Rajbari district Md Mahfuzur Rahman, who visited the scene, told bdnews24.com that stormy weather slowed rescue efforts. The district administration pressed two trawlers into a rescue operation, which was hampered by strong winds and river currents. The trawler was carrying the passengers from Char Moukali in Sadar upazila to Lal Gola area. bdne
