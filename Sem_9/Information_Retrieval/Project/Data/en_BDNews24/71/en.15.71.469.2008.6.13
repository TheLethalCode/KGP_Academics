 MUMBAI, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares swung between losses and gains on Friday ahead of inflation data, but drug maker Ranbaxy Laboratories rose more than 4 percent on a newspaper report Pfizer Inc may launch a bid. Traders said investors were worried about rising interest rates, which could hurt consumer spending and slow down earnings growth for companies. There was also market talk that weekly inflation could come in higher than expected. A Reuters poll on Thursday had forecast the annual inflation rate at end-May at 8.28 percent, its highest in 3- years. The data is due at noon. "It is clear that the rising headline inflation rates should not be ignored," DBS said in a research note. "At some point, the economy would have to factor in rising oil prices and raise rates." At 11:30 a.m., the benchmark BSE 30-share index was down 0.31 percent, or 47.09 points at 15,203.11 with 22 components in the red, after rising as much as 0.6 percent in early trade. Shares in Ranbaxy were up 3.1 percent at 560.50 rupees, after rising as high as 566, after the Business Standard newspaper reported that Pfizer may make a bid, countering a $4.6 billion offer by Japan's Daiichi Sankyo for the Indian drug maker. Top lender State Bank of India was up 1 percent at 1,353.15 rupees, after flipping between negative and positive territory ahead of its review of interest rates. The government-run bank's chairman had said it would review its rates on Friday after the central bank raised its key lending rate by a quarter point to 8 percent on Wednesday to contain inflation expectations. A Reuters poll of economists on Thursday forecast the central bank may again raise rates in 2008. Top mobile operator Bharti Airtel Ltd fell 1.2 percent to 809.95 rupees, mostly on selling by foreign funds, traders said. In the broader market, gainers led losers 1,240 to 880 on volume of 98 million shares. The 50-share NSE index was down 0.71 percent at 4,506.90. Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-Share index dropped 0.5 percent to 12,958.89, while Colombo's All-Share index was up 0.08 at 2,461.88. STOCKS ON THE MOVE State-run lender IFCI Ltd fell 2.7 percent to 57.70 rupees after it said it would initiate legal process to pare Life Insurance Corp's stake to 8.39 percent from 11.35 percent now, but did not make any announcement relating to induction of a strategic investor. Lok Housing & Constructions Ltd rose 5.11 percent to 106 rupees ahead of a board meeting to consider fund-raising options from both foreign and local markets, including an institutional placement.
