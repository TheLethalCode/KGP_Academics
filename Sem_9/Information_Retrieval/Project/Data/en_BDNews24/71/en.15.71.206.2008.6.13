 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)Direct allocation for women in the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year should be increased, suggests a 'gender analysis'. At a seminar titled "Gender analysis of the proposed budget", Dhaka University professor Atiur Rahman said that 'gender responsive budgeting', or GRB, was an important process for reducing gender gaps in every sphere of life. "GRB should guide the budget regime to address the social, political and economic scenario as a whole for a more gender harmonious society," he said. An economist and chairman of Unnayan Samunnayan organisation for 'equal development'Atiur suggested that, as in India, the overall allocation for women in the budget should be made clear. The allocation for women and children was 26 percent of the proposed budget (Tk 26,272 crore), he said. Of this, less than half (Tk 10,796 crore) was proposed as specific women-focused expenditure. But of the other 15 percent, Prof Atiur said, as the allocation for women and children was mixed up, it was not clear who would get what percentage. Proposing an increase in the direct spending for women's development, he demanded a separate allocation for training women to make them competent in decision-making in all spheres of life. "In the proposed budget most of the allocation for women is given under non-development expenditure for women who work," said the economist. But, he said, given that the government has prposed raising the limit on tax-free income for women to Tk 1,65,000 (from the current Tk 1,50,000), it should have been raised still further to Tk 2 lakh Moreover even under non-development expenditure, a very small part of the allocation would be spent to support women entrepreneurs or give them greater incentives, Atiur pointed out. Women entrepreneurs should enjoy more tax holidays, for example, he said. He also proposed a special economic or export zone with special facilities for women who bring in export earnings. The DU professor proposed spending for women in other sectors too, such as setting up nursing institutes to give women who go abroad for jobs more skills, increasing facilities and training for women farmers, increasing expenditure in lagging areas like the chars, haors and Chittagong Hill Tracts. The discussion jointly organised were Steps Towards Development, Unnayan Samunnay, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha, Unifem Bangladesh, ActionAid Bangladesh and the Canadian International Development Agency. Executive director of Steps Towards Development Ranjan Karmakar, executive director of Nari Progati Sangha Rokeya Kabir, Unifem Bangladesh National Programme Manager Nahid Ahmed and ActionAid Bangladesh Advancing Women's Rights Theme manager Nigar Sultana were present. bdne
