 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The budget proposed for fiscal 2008-09 will not see any major change, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday. Some minor changes may be possible. Speaking to bdnews24.com in his office, the adviser said: "After a great deal of analysis and consultation with businessmen, industrialists and economists, I presented a business-friendly budget." Five organisations gave their opinions in discussion meetings, while many others posted theirs on the website of the finance ministry. "I have examined the opinions that came to me, but nobody spoke of any big change. On behalf of some business organisations, some taxpayers proposed a tax-free income limit of up to Tk 2 lakh from the existing Tk 1.5 lakh." FBCCI demanded making undisclosed income legal for investment in the productive sector without fine. "On this proposal, I want to say clearly without leaving any option for questiona, that no scope will be given to make undisclosed income legal without fine." "A respectable taxpayer is regularly paying income tax in time at a fixed rate whereas another does not pay for long. Now it is said that an opportunity has to be given to make undisclosed income legal without fine. This cannot be accepted under any circumstances," Mirza Aziz asserted. On the enhancement of the tax-free income limit, the adviser said: "In the ongoing budget, the limit of individual taxpayers has been extended to Tk 1.5 lakh from Tk 1.2 lakh." "It is not proper to extend this limit every time." "One has to take into consideration the revenue side. Considering all aspects, the limit of tax-free income was not increased. But for the first time, the limits of tax-free income for women and the elderly (over 70) have been raised to Tk 1.65 lakh." The finance adviser presented the budget on June 9 a second time on behalf of the caretaker government. Opinions were accepted from people in different professions until June 16. bdnews
