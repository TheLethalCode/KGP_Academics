 HARARE, Mon Jun 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has accused foreign aid agencies of using food as a weapon to try to remove him from power and will investigate their operations, state media reported on Monday. Mugabe, whose government ordered aid agencies to stop work on June 4, has himself been accused by Western countries and human rights groups of using food as a political tool ahead a June 27 presidential election re-run. The state-controlled Herald newspaper said Mugabe told a rally on Sunday that in the absence of the agencies, his government would strive to provide food aid, badly needed in a once prosperous country that now faces economic collapse. Mugabe said aid agencies had worked against his ZANU-PF in March 29 elections, when the ruling party lost its majority in parliament and opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the presidential ballot -- but without the majority needed to avoid a run-off, according to official results. "Food aid is needed and the government is focusing on that. That is a need the NGOs exploited, saying 'we are feeding you, so do not vote for ZANU-PF, vote for the MDC'," Mugabe said, referring to the non-governmental organizations. "So we suspended them and are investigating their operations." Aid agencies deny interfering in the country's politics, saying the government's decision to suspend humanitarian programs has left millions in dire need of food. Mugabe, 84, is fighting to keep power which he has held since independence from Britain in 1980. Critics say the economy has been ruined by his policies, such as seizing white-owned farms to give to landless blacks. He blames Western sanctions. The opposition and rights groups say ZANU-PF has launched a campaign of violence which has killed at least 66 MDC activists, wounded hundreds others and displaced tens of thousands since the March 29 ballot. Tsvangirai has been arrested repeatedly during his campaign and one of his top lieutenants has been arrested and faces treason charges. Mugabe blames his foes for violence. A United Nations senior envoy, assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Haile Menkerios, arrives in Zimbabwe later on Monday for a five-day visit to assess Zimbabwe's political and humanitarian crisis ahead of the run-off vote
