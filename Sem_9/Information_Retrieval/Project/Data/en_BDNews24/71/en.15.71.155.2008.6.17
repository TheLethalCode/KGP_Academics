 NEUCHATEL, Switzerland, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal can beat Germany in their Euro 2008 quarter-final with an inspired Cristiano Ronaldo, midfielder Armando Petit said on Tuesday. "It's good to have this kid on our side. We know he can settle a match when he's on an inspired day," the 31-year-old said with Ronaldo beside him at a joint news conference. Ronaldo himself added: "It's true matches are decided on small details and I hope that it can be on our side, that I can do something good, that I can score." Portugal meet Germany at Basel's St Jakob Park stadium on Thursday in the tournament's first quarter-final. Ronaldo, who scored in the 3-1 win over Czech Republic last week, said he was motivated to add the European Championship to the titles he has won with Manchester United in a remarkable season in which he scored 46 goals for club and country. "Of course, I think of all those titles," Ronaldo said of the Premier League, Champions League and English Player of the Year awards. "It's a dream to win the European Championship," said the 23-year-old, tipped to be player of the tournament. "I'm on the right track but we have to respect the other teams who also want to reach the final." MUSCLE TENSION Ronaldo did not join in practice with the rest of the squad after the news conference, instead getting special treatment for calf muscle tension, but team spokesman Onofre Costa said it was not a serious problem. Looking at the German side, Ronaldo said: "They are a strong team, I was watching them against Austria (on TV), they play nice football, they're a mature team." Ronaldo said there was little to choose between the sides. "Both teams have a chancePortugal are more technical, Germany more physical. For me who is favourite doesn't count. I just hope Portugal can play their best game." Asked if he thought Germany might suffer from a short preparation period after only securing their place in the last eight with a 1-0 win over Austria on Monday, Ronaldo said: "They are going to get there (the quarter-final) in good shape." Ricardo's quality as Portugal's first-choice goalkeeper, especially in a season where he lost his place at Real Betis, has been questioned, even though he had no chance with the goals in the 2-0 defeat by Switzerland in Sunday's last group game. Ronaldo backed the keeper, though, saying: "There are no weak players in the Portugal squad. I think Ricardo's had a good championship, he's experienced.
