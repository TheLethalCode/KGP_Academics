 GENEVA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari told his squad at Euro 2008 of his decision to take charge of Chelsea next season after his team's 3-1 win over Czech Republic, the Portuguese federation (FPF) said. Chelsea announced a few hours after the match in Geneva that secured Portugal's berth in the quarter-finals as Group A winners that Scolari would become their manager on July 1. The FPF thanked Scolari for his work over the past five years in a statement on their Web site (www.fpf.pt) and published a photo of him and FPF president Gilberto Madail announcing the decision to an applauding squad after Wednesday's match. The statement said the FPF was "sure the whole technical team, players and remaining staff will be as committed or more so in reaching the objective planned for Euro 2008. "Given the superior interests of the national team (Madail and Scolari) will not make any comments on the matter until the end of the (team's) participation at Euro 2008," it added. Chelsea added they would not be making any further comment until Scolari joined them. The Sports daily A Bola said Chelsea had told Scolari they could not delay naming him as their new coach until the end of the tournament and that the Brazilian would sign a three-year contract worth 6.0 million euros ($9.31 million) per season. It also said on its Web site (www.abola.pt) that Scolari had told Chelsea he would only agree to the advanced announcement when Portugal secured their passage to the knockout stage. Scolari is unlikely to speak to media again until his next news conference on Saturday, eve of the last Group A match against eliminated co-hosts Switzerland. Scolari has been in charge of Portugal since 2003 and steered them to the final of Euro 2004 as hosts and the 2006 World Cup semi-finals
