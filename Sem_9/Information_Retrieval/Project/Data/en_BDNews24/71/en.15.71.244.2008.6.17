 VIENNA, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Euro 2008 organisers will examine a referee's report on Tuesday before deciding on any disciplinary action against the Germany and Austria coaches who were both 'sent off' during their Group B match, UEFA said. In an extraordinary episode just before halftime in Germany's 1-0 win in Vienna on Monday, Spanish referee Manuel Mejuto banished Joachim Loew of Germany and his Austrian opposite number Josef Hickersberger to the stands. The double dismissal, which Loew said was due to a dispute with the fourth official, was greeted by jeers from both sets of fans in the capacity 50,000 crowd at Ernst Happel stadium.ADVERTISEMENT "The referee doesn't have to show a red card to the coach  he will write a report which will be sent to the controlling disciplinary body which will be clear tomorrow morning," UEFA spokesman William Gaillard told a news conference. Usually a red card means a player misses at least one match but Gaillard said it would be up to the disciplinary body whether Loew would be suspended for Germany's next match, a quarter-final against Portugal in Basel on Thursday. OFFICIAL BLAMED The reason for the referee's decision was not immediately apparent but Loew put the blame for the dispute on the fourth official, Damir Skomina of Slovenia, who he said was unfairly preventing Hickersberger from instructing his players. "I saw the situation with Josef Hickersberger and tried for the umpteenth time to calm down the fourth referee," Loew told reporters. "But we're the coaches, we just want to be able to work in our coaching zone and do our job, give instructions to the players. That's our job. The referee then ejected us." He denied either had left the 'coaching zone', a technical area marked off by the side of the pitch for use by the coaches. "I didn't leave the coaching zone. I was only trying to explain to the fourth referee that we wanted to give our instructions," added Loew. "We're in an important match and we want to get into the quarter-finals." Hickersberger said: "I have experienced a lot, but nothing like thatnormally I did something wrong but this time round I don't know why the fourth referee called the top referee (Mejuto) and sent Yogi (Joachim) Loew and myself off. "We probably coached too excessively, we did our job too often. There were no insults, neither from Yogi Loew nor from myself, towards the four gentlemen. "But the gods in black have spoken and we need to heed their judgement. Of course, it is easier to send a trainer off the bench than to judge correctly on an offside or a foul." The German players said later that Loew only made a brief appearance in the changing room at halftime and had left the team talk to his assistant Hansi Flick. German Finance Minister, Peer Steinbrueck, added that the episode had been watched by Chancellor Angela Merkel in the stands who later spoke to Loew about the inciden
