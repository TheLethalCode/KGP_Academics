 LONDON, Fri Jun 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil dropped below $136 a barrel on Friday after volatile trading in the previous session, helped by a strong US dollar and OPEC's reduction of its oil demand growth forecasts. US crude oil was $1.28 down at $135.46 a barrel by 1205 GMT (8:05 EDT) It recouped a $4 fall on Thursday, ending 36 cents higher at $136.74 a barrel, after concerns emerged about a possible strike in Nigeria, the world's eighth-largest oil producer. Brent crude, whose July contract expires later in the day, was down $1.26 at $134.83 a barrel. Nigeria's senior oil workers' union, which wants the expatriate managing director of Chevron's local unit to be transferred out of the country, said on Thursday talks to avert a lockout were not going well and renewed its strike threat.. "Certainly, we're worried about Nigeria, we're still very mindful of the situation," said Peter McGuire, managing director of Commodity Warrants Australia. A strike would further dent oil output in Nigeria, where a fifth of capacity has already been shut since early 2006, when militants in the Niger Delta began a violent campaign of sabotage against oil installations. Analysts say Chevron produces around 350,000 barrels a day out of Nigeria, which could be hit in a strike. Oil, which hit a record high of $139.12 last Friday, has tested new peaks despite growing signs that high prices may be starting to hit demand. OPEC on Friday became the latest group to cut its forecast for global growth in oil demand in 2008 for the third time this year, adding also that it is pumping more than the forecast demand for its oil. Oil prices have risen around 40 percent so far this year, relentlessly boosted by fears of tight supplies, and weakness in the US dollar which has triggered investor buying of commodities as a hedge against inflation. The dollar headed for its best week in over three years against a basket of currencies on Friday as the Federal Reserve and the US government turned their fire on inflation and its impact on the dollar, raising the prospect of dollar-buying intervention. Later on Friday, traders will watch US consumer price data for May and real earnings for further signs of the economic health of the world's top oil consumer. The market will also keep an eye on moves by regulators in the United States and Britain to rein in speculative crude futures trading, which OPEC has said is the main cause of the spikes in oil prices
