<TITLE> Russia may leave out playmaker Arshavin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 INNSBRUCK, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Playmaker Andrei Arshavin could be left out for Russia's decisive Euro 2008 tie against Sweden on Wednesday even though he is available again after a two-match ban. "There is a lack of game fitness, game rhythm, because he has not played many games recently," coach Guus Hiddink told reporters on Tuesday. "I don't know if he will start." Sweden coach Lars Lagerback was full of praise for the skills of Arshavin, who helped Zenit St Petersburg win the UEFA Cup last season, but said his players were ready to take on the job of trying to keep him quiet if he made the starting lineup. "He has been one of their dominant players, we are very familiar with him, what he's done for the Russian team previously and what he has done with his club," said Lagerback. "We know what role he would play in the team if he is picked and we are 100 percent prepared to face him." Hiddink said there was little reason to make many changes to his side but has question marks over the fitness of Yuri Zhirkov and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov, who picked up knocks in the 1-0 win over Group D rivals Greece on Saturday. "They (Zhirkov and Bilyaletdinov) have practised and today we will see  if they are fit enough to start. They did very slight training yesterday," said the coach. TOUGHEN UP The Dutchman also took time to defend his no-nonsense approach to training, saying his inexperienced team needed to toughen up to progress at the tournament. After criticising his players for their naivety when they lost 4-1 to Spain in their opening match, Hiddink took a hard line in training and Russia reaped the rewards against Greece. That result means a win against Sweden would put Hiddink's men in the quarter-finals although a draw would allow the Scandinavians to go through. "I'm not their enemy, the only thing is demanding a little bit more of players is one of my targets," said the Dutchman. "A lot of people and players can do a little bit more than they might think sometimes. "When a team wants to make progress then it must be a habit, as it is a habit in other teams, to play tough games every three or four days. "It won't work every day if you try to quarrel (with players) when there is no reason to but sometimes I will do it, maybe individually if necessary.
