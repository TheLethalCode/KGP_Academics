 JERUSALEM Wed Jun 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel said on Wednesday it accepted an Egyptian-brokered truce with Hamas Islamists ruling the Gaza Strip but voiced skepticism the ceasefire involving all Palestinian militant groups in the territory would hold. Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defense official, said after returning from talks in Cairo that "an understanding" had been reached. Egypt and Hamas said on Tuesday a ceasefire would go into effect at 6 a.m. (11 p.m. EDT) on Thursday. Gilad told Israeli stations that Israel was prepared to give a ceasefire a chance -- while continuing preparations for possible military action should it fall apart. A ceasefire would aim to end frequent rocket and mortar bomb attacks on Israel from the coastal enclave and Israeli raids and air strikes in the territory. Israeli and Palestinian officials said that under the truce, the blockade Israel imposed on the Gaza Strip after Hamas seized the territory a year ago would be eased gradually and partially. The United States pressed for a truce to remove an obstacle in slow-moving peace talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas, which has said all Gaza factions had agreed to the deal, hopes a halt to hostilities will lead to the lifting of the economically crippling blockade. A truce could also give Hamas an opportunity to upgrade weaponry and train fighters. Meir Sheetrit, Israel's interior minister and member of its security cabinet, said on Army Radio he was "very skeptical" that Hamas could enforce a complete ceasefire among the militant groups. "The idea is a complete ceasefire -- no fire from anyone ... if there is any violation of the agreement, the government is free to return to act with full force," Sheetrit said. HAMAS LEADER In an interview with Reuters in the United Arab Emirates, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said a lasting truce would be good for 1.5 million Palestinians who have suffered from the Israeli blockade. The Damascus-based leader also said any Israeli violation of the deal would not go unanswered. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Olmert, said that after a few days of calm, there would be a "substantial increase" in the amount of supplies that Israel allows into the Gaza Strip. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said that in the first phase, imports into the territory would be set at approximately one-third of the level before the Hamas takeover. If the truce holds, that percentage will grow gradually, Mekel said. Israel has allowed in humanitarian aid but has cut back on the supply of non-essential goods, such as construction materials, as well as fuel, saying Gazans could not expect to lead normal lives while Israelis were under rocket attack. Israeli officials said the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt -- Gazans' only gateway to the outside world that does not pass through Israel -- was conditioned on a deal to free a captured Israeli soldier. "We expect the negotiations on him to resume in the near future," Mekel said of Gilad Shalit, who was seized by Gaza militants who tunneled into Israel two years ago. Meshaal said negotiations over Rafah would continue between Egypt, Hamas, Abbas's Fatah faction and the Europeans, who had stationed monitors at the crossing. But he insisted that Shalit would not be released unless Israel freed Palestinian prisoners on a list compiled by Hamas
