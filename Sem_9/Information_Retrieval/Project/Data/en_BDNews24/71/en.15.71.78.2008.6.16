 LAUSANNE, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania always thought their best chance of a win in Group C would be against Netherlands and on Tuesday they can seal a quarter-final place at Euro 2008 with a victory over the already-qualified Dutch. A draw in Berne and a stalemate between World Cup winners Italy and runners-up France in the other group game would also be enough for Romania to secure a quarter-final with Spain. The Dutch have already won the group with six points, followed by Romania on two with France and Italy on one apiece, although they have said they would try their hardest to win. "The fact we have qualified already is nice but we still want to perform at our best," said Dutch coach Marco van Basten. But Romania are confident they can beat Netherlands, having won 1-0 in Constanta last October after drawing 0-0 in Rotterdam in March to reach Euro 2008 as qualifying group winners. "When we looked at this group our main aim against Italy and France was not to be beaten. We beat Holland in qualification, so we believed we could do that again," defender Cosmin Contra told reporters before Friday's 1-1 draw with Italy. Having started with a goalless draw against France, Romania have achieved their goal so far and can finish the job against a Dutch side certain to feature changes after winning the group with superb 3-0 and 4-1 victories over Italy and France. NO RISKS Romanian journalists turned up at the Netherlands' training session in Lausanne on Sunday with flags and team shirts bearing the plea 'Let us win' on the front in Dutch. It was not clear if Netherlands coach Marco van Basten had seen them. At his news conference, the Dutchman hinted he would take no risks with defender Andre Ooijer and midfielder Nigel de Jong, who have been booked and would be banned for their quarter-final with Russia or Sweden if they got another yellow card. They will be replaced by John Heitinga and Demy de Zeeuw respectively and there could also be a few other changes. Ooijer reaffirmed the Dutch desire to continue their hot streak, saying: "We just have to start like we did in the two previous matches and if we could beat Romania and go through with nine points from three games that would be fantastic." However, the Dutch are unlikely to have reassured France and Italy, both of whom they would rather avoid in the semi-finals if the teams get that far in the tournament. Romania coach Victor Piturca is expected to stick with the more attacking formation he used against Italy but must make at least two changes to the team which started that game. Defensive midfielder Mirel Radoi has been ruled out of the tournament with a serious head injury sustained in that match, while central defender Dorin Goian is suspended. Captain Cristian Chivu could move back into Goian's position after playing in midfield in the first two games with playmaker Nicolae Dica and wide man Banel Nicolita coming into midfield. "It's normal to get injuries and suspensions as you go along in tournaments. We have the players to come in and play as well as, if not better than, the ones we are without," said striker Ciprian Marica. Piturca will hope he is right
