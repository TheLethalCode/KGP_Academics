 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser MA Matin Tuesday revealed dismal details about human traffickinga growing problem he vowed to combat. "Trafficking exists for forced labour and prostitution. Although exact figures on the problem vary widely, the consensus is that trafficking is growing rapidly," Matin said in his speech to the inauguration of a special police unit, designed to fight trafficking in human beings (THB). About 400,000 women trafficked into India from Bangladesh have so far been forced into prostitution, the adviser said. About 300,000 boys were also trafficked in different times into India that shares 4,222 kilometres of border with 28 districts of Bangladesh, Matin said. From January 2000 to June 2003, an estimated 2,405 Bangladeshi children disappeared. "Of them, 510 boys and 451 girls were confirmed to have been trafficked." The special police team has been designed with technical cooperation under the police reform programme of the United Nations Development Programme and UK's DFID, and financed by the European Commission. The European Commission has so far given 20 lakh euros to buy equipment. An 11-member team took training in prevention of human trafficking in several countries, including Thailand, Indonesia and Vienna. The main office of the unit has been set up at the CID headquarters for the time being. Home secretary Abdul Karim, who attended the ceremony at Radisson, said: "Not only in Bangladesh, in all South Asian countries, women and children are being separated from their families due to poverty, breakdown of traditional living, lack of education, natural disasters and war." "Women's weaker social status and gender discrepancy are responsible for human trafficking. Loopholes in law and weak enforcement of laws relating to human trafficking are also responsible." Inspector general of police Nur Mohammad said: "The incidents of human trafficking are increasing rapidly. About 90 percent of the trafficked women are forced into prostitution." bdnews
