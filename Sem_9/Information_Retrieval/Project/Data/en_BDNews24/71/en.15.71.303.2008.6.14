 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty says the "process of compromise" has begun on all sides to smooth the path to the next general elections. The diplomat has described the "compromise" as a positive development and said compromise means everybody will not get all of what they want. "I think it would be a personal call for a compromise among all the sides. I think this process is beginning," Moriarty told reporters Saturday after inaugurating new counters for US visa applications at the US embassy. "So, we take it as a positive development." The envoy was asked how he assessed Bangladesh's political development, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's temporary release and subsequent visit abroad. "We do want to see further discussion and further compromise that would be necessary for a free, fair and credible election. It's a good start," he said. On the probable release of another former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, the US envoy said: "The caretaker government and the people of Bangladesh would decide it." Moriarty said Washington was interested in watching what the next government would do after holding the ninth parliamentary election. "We are in favour of holding the election by December. We are watching under what conditions the elections are held and  what conditions will be afterwards." Moriarty made it clear that the US companies would not invest in Bangladesh if the people within the government demanded bribes. "Corruption is a big factor in investment decisions. If people within the government, people within the structure running the country receive bribes, the American companies are not allowed to do it," he told bdnews24.com. "If they do it and I find out, I will have to report to the Department of Justice against them." Moriarty stressed that the anticorruption drive must go on in a transparent manner. "Certainly we don't want to see the drive against corruption diminish. We also do hope that there will be a transparent process." The diplomat said corruption charges against the people must be investigated "thoroughly and transparently". The US ambassador inaugurated three new counters to speed up visa processing, taking the number of counters to 11. bdn
