 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Development Bank has committed $130 million (Tk 890.50 crore) in food aid to Bangladesh, to help finance the government's food security programmes over the coming fiscal year (2008-09), ADB's South Asia regional director general Kunio Senga said Monday. The aid is aimed at food security programmes being undertaken by the government in a bid to expand the country's social security net over the next year, Senga said, following a meeting with finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. "The amount may be increased further, if necessary," said the visiting director general, who is heading a seven-member delegation. The finance adviser told reporters after the meeting: "We had asked the ADB to provide us 200 million dollars in food aid for the coming year." ADB in response agreed to provide 130 million dollars worth of food aid on an emergency basis, Mirza Aziz said. "The bank has assured us of more assistance in the sector," he added. "The total ADB food security assistance will eventually amount to about 200 million dollars, or a little less," the adviser said. The ADB director general said a huge proportion of the world's poor are suffering from the acute food scarcity affecting countries such as Bangladesh. To alleviate their suffering, the ADB has committed to provide emergency food aid to Bangladesh under the government's social security net expansion programmes to be implemented through the next financial year. The funds will be released by July, Senga said. At the same time as giving direct aid to Bangladesh, the ADB will also channel similar assistance from other donor agencies and countries, such as the World Bank, Japan and the US. The ADB official was hopeful that Bangladesh would receive substantial amounts of food aid from the different donors. Other senior officials present in Monday's meeting included the ERD secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan and ADB resident representative Hua Du. bdnews24.co
