 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  The government is viewing the matter of better treatment for the two detained sons of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, the communications adviser said Sunday. Adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters "We are considering the matter on humanitarian grounds." On whether the government is considering the matter of releasing Khaleda Zia, following Sheikh Hasina's release on medical grounds, the adviser said: "I am not aware whether anybody has appealed to the government for bail or parole on behalf of Khaleda Zia." "The government is considering the matter of Tarique Rahman and Arfat Rahman Coco," he said. On whether Sheikh Hasina would be allowed permanent bail, Ghulam Quader said: "I cannot say anything for sure about the matter." "It is difficult to say anything about permanent bail as it is a matter of legal procedure," he said. bdnews24
