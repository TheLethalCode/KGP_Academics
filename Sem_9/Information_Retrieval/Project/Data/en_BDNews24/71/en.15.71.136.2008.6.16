<TITLE> No siesta for defenders with Villa, Torres on song </TITLE>

 NEUSTIFT, Austria, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's David Villa and Fernando Torres are emerging as the strike pair likeliest to cause most sleepness nights for Euro 2008 defenders. Villa has stolen the headlines for his coolly taken hat-trick in Spain's opening 4-1 victory over Group D rivals Russia and an excellent stoppage-time goal in Saturday's 2-1 win over Sweden. Torres also netted against the Swedes with a cleverly improvised shot from a David Silva cross as Luis Aragones's team clinched their place in the quarter-finals. "There is no doubt it's a massive advantage to have two players like Torres and Villa up front," Aragones told reporters on Sunday. "They combine well, they've got great pace and have contrasting characteristics. "Great players can always play well together and I hope they carry on as they have done in the first two matches." Villa's tally of 18 goals in 33 games has finally laid to rest the national debate over whether former captain Raul should have been included in Spain's squad. The 26-year-old Villa possesses the same opportunist streak as Raul did at his peak, is speedier and has the knack of scoring winning goals. TRAUMATIC SEASON Valencia had a traumatic season, changing coach on three occasions and dicing with relegation, however Villa still managed to notch 18 goals in 28 games for the club. A muscle strain kept him out for several weeks at the business end of the season but meant he arrived at Euro 2008 fresher than most. After shouldering the burden of expectation at Atletico Madrid since he was 17, Torres appears to have been liberated since his move to Liverpool. The 24-year-old won the hearts of the Anfield faithful by racking up 33 goals in his first season and the service he gets from Liverpool's midfield has allowed him to make the most of his ability to run at defences. Playing for Spain he has encountered more difficulties, scoring only three times since the 2006 World Cup. But the statistics do not tell the whole story. Torres has been a handful at Euro 2008, pulling defenders from one side to another with his galloping runs and laying the ball off to his team mates whenever he runs out of space
