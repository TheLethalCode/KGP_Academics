 BRIDGETOWN, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia set West Indies a target of 475 to win after declaring at 439-5 at lunch on the fourth day of the third test on Sunday. With five sessions and 150 overs to dismiss the home batting line-up, Australia captain Ricky Ponting will be backing his bowlers to secure a 2-0 series victory. The tourists may need only nine wickets to win as West Indies are likely to be without batsman Sewnarine Chattergoon who suffered a badly sprained ankle while fielding on Saturday. Chattergoon can only walk with the aid of a support stick and did not field on Sunday - Xavier Marshall was opening the batting with skipper Chris Gayle. Australia lost century-maker Simon Katich early on Sunday after the left-hander added just nine runs to his overnight score of 148. Sulieman Benn finally got rid off Katich, after 488 minutes at the crease, for 157, with substitute Darren Sammy taking a catch at short extra-cover. Benn struck again to get rid of Andrew Symonds for two, the all-rounder driving a well-flighted delivery to Shivnarine Chanderpaul at cover. But then Michael Clarke (48) and Brad Haddin (45) continued the Australian advance, adding 79 before lunch. West Indies would need to break their own record of 418, the highest fourth innings total to win a test match - set in Antigua against Australia in 2003
