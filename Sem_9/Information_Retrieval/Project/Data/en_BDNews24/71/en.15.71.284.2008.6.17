 BRIDGETOWN, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting, pleased with 2-0 series victory over West Indies secured with victory in the third test on Monday, said they remained a team that knows how to win. The retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist, who had helped Australia dominate world cricket for more than a decade, led some to question whether Ponting's side would be able to stay at the top of the sport. "I'm really happy. Everyone's been talking about this transition phase that our team's been going through," Ponting told reporters. "It's right, we are going through that sort of transition, we've lost six or seven players in the last 12 months. "But ...we're still beating teams. We're still winning test matches and winning series. "We're probably not demolishing sides like we might have two years ago, but we're grinding teams down and winning test matches, and we're doing it well. "That's a really pleasing thing for me and the rest of the guys going forward." Ponting said Australia's domestic competition ensured players reached the test side with the right mentality. "I think it's pretty good in our state system. "I think a lot of the guys come into international cricket knowing a certain way to play their cricket. "You couldn't ask for a better start for (wicketkeeper) Brad Haddin and (new spinner) Beau Casson and even Simon Katich coming back in the side. "I'm really happy with where we're at, at the moment." The Tasmanian singled out Katich, who scored centuries in the second and third test, pace bowler Stuart Clark, who bowled consistently and took crucial wickets, as well as allrounder Andrew Symonds had all shown improvement in this series. Ponting, whose team now face West Indies in a Twenty20 game on Friday at the Kensington Oval before a series of five one day internationals, said that he personally was enjoying being part of a new dressing room. "I actually said when some of the more senior guys moved on that it was going to be one of the more exciting periods in my career to have some new fresher faces around the team. "I enjoy having some guys who have made their debuts and some guys who have played just a handful of tests in the side because I feel I've got a lot that I can offer to those guys. "It's a different time for the team, you go in the changing room and you look at the team and it is a bit different to four years ago but we are winning games and that's something I am really happy about
