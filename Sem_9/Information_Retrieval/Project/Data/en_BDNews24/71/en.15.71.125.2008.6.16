 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The telecoms regulator Monday cut submarine cable bandwidth charges, paving the way for government primary schools to get internet connections for free. Internet connections will also be provided at reduced rates for public universities, colleges, schools, madrasas and other educational institutions under "monthly payment order". Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission issued a letter re-fixing bandwidth charges to increase the use of the internet in educational institutions. The BTRC directed internet service providers to make the reset charges effective. According to the re-fixed bandwidth charges, government primary schools will be given connection up to 64kbps free of cost. Public universities, colleges, schools, madrasas and other educational institutions under MPO would get bandwidth at 75 percent reduced costs. Different government, semi-government, autonomous organisations and call centres will get bandwidth at 20-60 percent less prices. Bandwidth fees for the call centres in May had been reduced by 60 per cent. Software exporters, medical transcription services, IT-enabled service providers and international internet gateway will get the same discount facility. "In the changing world a huge change was taking place in the field of information technology along with other communications. But the benefits of information technology had not reached people to the expected level," BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com. The bandwidth charge of the submarine cable had been reduced to reach information technology to villages. Internet providers will have to take steps to make sure the people benefit from the reduced rates. bdnews
