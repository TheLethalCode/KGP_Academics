<TITLE> Loew calls for big improvement against Portugal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TENERO, Switzerland, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Joachim Loew was relieved to see Germany come through a test of nerve to reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2008 but to go any further he recognised they would need to play a lot better. Michael Ballack's perfectly struck free-kick saw Germany to a 1-0 win over co-hosts Austria in Vienna on Monday. It was just enough to take them through as Group B runners-up behind Croatia and set up a quarter-final against Portugal in Basel on Thursday but it was far from enough to satisfy Loew. "We knocked the host country out of the tournament, have advanced to the next round and got six points," Loew told German TV network ARD. "But it's also clear to me that we have to make an enormous improvement for the quarter-finals. "We are pleased that we showed today that we belong in the quarter-finals even if we haven't played as convincingly as we would have liked to. "I am sure, though, that the team will now get the lift we need, and that we can play competitively against Portugal." Germany looked comfortable enough in defence but strikers Mario Gomez and Miroslav Klose both played badly again. FURTHER PROGRESS All Germany's goals at the tournament so far have come from midfieldersthree from Lukas Podolski and one from Ballack  and unless they find some form in front of goal further progress looks unlikely. "Ballack's goal was an important one, no matter who got it," Loew said. "But we should have been ahead at the start of the match, with chances from Gomez and Klose. "We have to admit that we didn't create enough chances over the whole match. Our attack wasn't as good as it should have been." Looking ahead to the Portugal game, Loew added: "They are technically very strong, both as individuals and as a team. "They want to score goals. They are definitely one of the favourites but we both want to advance.
