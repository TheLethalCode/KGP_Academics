 VIENNA, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Austrians despairing at their team's Euro 2008 exit can seek solace in a mock documentary charting their stunning title victory. The film also offers comfort for co-hosts Switzerland, who survive until the quarter-finals instead of tumbling out of the tournament proper after the group stage like Austria. Austrian broadcaster ORF commissioned the film 'The Miracle of Vienna' and screened it on the eve of the finals, attracting a large television audience. "The more I worked on the film, the more convinced I became that it would actually happen," said film maker David Schalko. In the mock drama Austria defeat Netherlands in the final. While the Dutch have shone in the tournament proper, thrashing world champions Italy and France, Austria failed to win any matches so did Schalko jinx it for the co-hosts? "I don't think you can blame the film," he laughed. "It was always meant to be a satirical piece and I think it helped generate some excitement and a good atmosphere." The film mirrors the real tournament draw and shows Austria knocking out Switzerland in the quarter-finals before causing an upset with a win over Germany in the semis. Television presenters and former footballers contributed to the film including Austria coach Josef Hickersberger
