 SINGAPORE, Tue Jun 17, (Reuters) - Internet media firm Yahoo Inc said on Tuesday that its mobile search service will be offered by six more telecom companies in Asia. It now has 60 such partnerships worldwide, including with Mahanagar Telephon Nigam (MTNL) in India, Hong CSL Limited, Smart Communications and Digital Mobile Phlis (Sun Cellular) in the Philippines and Vibo Telecom in Taiwan. "We are now able to reach 600 million subscribers," David Ko, Asia managing director and vice president of Yahoo's mobile division, told reporters at a media briefing. "This creates the scale to make mobile advertising attractive."
