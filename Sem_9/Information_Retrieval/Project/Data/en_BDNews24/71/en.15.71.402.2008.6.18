<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government is likely to declare a relaxation of the state of emergency on Friday, to ease the way for upcoming local government polls, the LGRD adviser said Wednesday. "The Election Commission is likely to announce the local government polls schedule on Friday," adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters after a seminar at Hotel Sonargaon. "The government is mulling which sections of emergency rules and in which places the state of emergency can be relaxed; the announcement will also come the same day," the adviser said. Replying to a reporter's question about objections by some parties over the holding of local polls, the adviser said: "No party has opposed the local government elections." "The parties have asked the government to be cautious so that the election does not hamper the national elections. The government has assured all that the national elections will not be hampered," he said. "The EC is set to hold the elections in line with the roadmap. The government is assisting the commission in this regard," he added. Anwarul had earlier attended a seminar on 'Geo-Information and Digital Mapping in Bangladesh: Present and Future' organised by Survey of Bangladesh, the national surveying and mapping agnecy. Geo-information is one of the crucial primary data sources for analysing and planning for critical national issues of development, disaster management, adaptability and resilience to climate change, said the adviser. "It can play a vital role to help the decision makers and government departments by providing land-use information and assist in adopting appropriate policies," he said. Anwarul singled out Japan's assistance and contributions to Survey of Bangladesh in modernising the mapping and survey systems of the national agency. bdnew
