 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Cable Operators Association of Bangladesh Saturday demanded withdrawal of a proposed 35 percent supplementary duty on foreign satellite pay channels. Speaking at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity, the association's president SM Anwar Parvez said, "We demand a complete withdrawal of the duty for the interest of subscribers and operators." On June 9, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam proposed to hike the rate of supplementary duty for satellite channel distributors to 35 percent from 15 percent now. The adviser said in his budget speech for fiscal 2008-09, "The proprietors or distributors of foreign TV channels are not paying the VAT applicable on commercials depriving the government from its fair share of revenue." The local satellite TV channels now pay 15 percent VAT on the commercials telecast. But the foreign TV channels pay no VAT on commercials. The general secretary of the cable operators association, Nizam Uddin Masud, said, "The proposal for imposing a 35 percent duty is a threat to the entrepreneurs of this sector." bdnews
