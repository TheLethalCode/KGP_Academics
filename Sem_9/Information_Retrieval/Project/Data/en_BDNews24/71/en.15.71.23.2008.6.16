<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Switzerland salvaged some honour from the Euro 2008 tournament they are co-hosting by finishing with a 2-0 victory over Group A winners Portugal on Sunday. Hakan Yakin scored both goals for the Swiss, already sure of finishing bottom of the four-team group after losing their first two games against Czech Republic and Turkey, netting in the 71st minute and in the 84th from a penalty. Portugal rested most of their regular players, including Cristiano Ronaldo, and went close to scoring with Nani twice striking the woodwork. Portugal meet the runners-up of Group B, either Germany, Austria or Poland, in the quarter-finals in Basel on Thursday
