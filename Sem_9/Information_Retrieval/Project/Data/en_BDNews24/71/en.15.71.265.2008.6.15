 JERUSALEM, Sun Jun 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday Israel's continued settlement building could hurt Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Rice, on her sixth trip to the Middle East this year to try and advance Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, spoke before meeting Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. "At a time when we need to build confidence between the parties, the continued building and the settlement activity has the potential to harm the negotiations," she told reporters. Israel said on Saturday it planned to construct 1,300 new homes in the occupied West Bank, in an area that Israel considers part of Jerusalem. A 2003 "road map" peace plan, reaffirmed by Israeli and Palestinian leaders at a conference hosted by U.S. President George W Bush in November, requires a halt to all settlement activity on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood. It also calls on Palestinians to crack down on militants. Bitter disputes over settlement building and a corruption scandal that could force Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert out of office have undercut efforts to reach a peace agreement this year before Bush leaves office. Olmert has vowed to keep major settlement blocs in any deal. After seeing Livni, Rice planned to meet Palestinian leaders in the West Bank city of Ramallah
