 BRIDGETOWN, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shivnarine Chanderpaul carried his bat for the third consecutive innings but once again lacked support from his team mates as West Indies were dismissed for 216 on the second day of the third test on Friday. Although Chanderpaul compiled 79 not out Australia, who are 1-0 up in the three-match series, still took a first innings lead of 35 runs with left-arm pace bowler Mitchell Johnson capturing four for 41. Australian openers Simon Katich and Phil Jaques safely negotiated 14 overs in the final session, adding 35 without loss. Left-hander Chanderpaul has scored two centuries against the Australians and only once in five innings has he failed to make at least a half century. He has scored 392 runs so far in the series for an average of 196. The Australians added just 25 runs to their overnight 226 for seven but Ricky Ponting's side soon bounced back with the ball. Brett Lee removed both openers, captain Chris Gayle (14) along with opener Sewnarine Chattergoon (6) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (20) was a victim of Stuart Clark before lunch, caught brilliantly by Mike Hussey at backward point. After the interval, Xavier Marshall continued to a lively 39 before he went caught by debutant Beau Casson off Andrew Symonds, a soft dismissal for a batsman who had looked settled. Chanderpaul and Bravo consolidated, putting on 60 for the fifth wicket before Bravo once again failed to build on a solid start. The Trinidad all-rounder had made 29 before he was caught behind, flicking a leg-side delivery from Johnson. Then came the by now traditional lower order collapse. Denish Ramdin, Sulieman Benn, Jerome Taylor, Daren Powell, and Fidel Edwards all went without reaching double figures as the last five wickets fell for just 28 runs
