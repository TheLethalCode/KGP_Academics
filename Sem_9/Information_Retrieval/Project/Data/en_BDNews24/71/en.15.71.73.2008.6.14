<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  Centuries from Salman Butt and Younis Khan propelled Pakistan to the Kitply one-day international series title with a fine 25-run win over India in the final at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. Umar Gul returned four for 57 as India folded at 290 with 10 balls to spare after Pakistan racked up an impressive 315 for three in 50 overs. Pakistan, who went a massive 140-run down against India in the group stage, were superb with both bat and ball as the bowlers did their job excellently after the top order batsmen gave them a defendable total. India received the first blow when their explosive opener Virender Sewhag (2) was dismissed by pacer Sohail Tanvir to leave India eight for one in 1.5 overs. In-form opener Gautam Gambhir and one-down Rahit Sharma (24) repaired the damage to take the side to 67 in 10.3 overs before the latter was the first victim of pacer Umar Gul, who also soon sent back Gambhir (40) to reduce India to 79 for three in 12.2 overs. Middle orders Yusuf Pathan (25 off 25 balls), Yuvraj Singh (56 off 59 balls) and Suresh Raina (24 off 32 balls) kept India in hunt, but dismissals of Yuvraj and Raina in quick succession slowed the Indians. Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck 64 off 59 balls and put on 60 runs for the seventh wicket along with Irfan Pathan (28), but his effort was not enough to reach the target as he was the last Indian batsman out. Pacer Iftikhar Anjam and spinner Shaid Afridi chipped in with two wickets each for 58 and 56 respectively. Salman Butt and Younis Khan each struck hundreds to power Pakistan to an impressive total. Butt and Younis together put on 205 runs in 32.3 overs after Pakistan had a shaky start winning the toss in face of some tight bowling from Indian pacers Praveen Kumar and Ishant Sharma. Younis joined Butt in the 10th over after first-change pacer Irfan Pathan had Kamran Akmal (15) caught by keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to reduce Pakistan to 34 for one in 9.3 overs. They played the Indian bowlers cautiously and gradually picked up the match the half-way mark by attempting to innovate and put the Indian bowlers off rhythm. The Indian bowlers were impressive in line and length in the beginning with Praveen giving away just 10 runs in his first six-over spell, but they failed to keep the momentum in face of some aggressive batting display from Butt and Younis. Dhoni used eight bowlers to break the Butt-Younis stand and was able to stop them in the 42nd over, but not before both batsmen struck their centuries. Pacer Ishant Sharma removed Younis, but by then Pakistan crossed the 200-mark and Younis, who hit back-to-back duck in previous two matches, finally struck his fourth ODI hundred to make 108 off 99 balls with the help of eight fours and three sixes. India gave price heavily when Butt was dropped on 19 at cover point by Rohit Sharman off Praveen Kumar, and the opener finally hit 129, his seventh ODI hundred, before retiring hurt following a muscular cramp, leaving the side at 282 for two in 46th over. His 136-ball innings was studded with 12 fours and three sixes. Misbah-ul-Haq fired a 21-ball 33 while Shoaib Malik (11) and Shahid Afridi (10) remained unbeaten to take Pakistan beyond the 300-mark. bdn
