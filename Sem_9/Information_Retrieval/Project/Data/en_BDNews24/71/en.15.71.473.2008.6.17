Protesters called off the strike for a few days last week and forced tourists to leave Darjeeling. But on Tuesday, they shut down hotels again and asked local residents to stock up on food.

The region's vast tea gardens ship highly prized and fragrant brews around the world, churning out about 10 million kg a year.
