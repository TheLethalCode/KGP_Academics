 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)The government Thursday decided to list items for duty-free and quota-free access to the US that made a commitment at a World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting to open up further to the products from the least-developed countries. The decision to make the priority list was taken at the sixth meeting of the government's high-powered committee on WTO at the commerce ministry, chaired by commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. The committee will complete the list in one month. The meeting also discussed the services sector and non-agriculture market access to the US. "The committee has decided to make a priority list of commodities for duty-free and quota-free access to the US market," Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue and a member of the committee, told reporters after the meeting. In a declaration at the WTO meeting in Hong Kong in 2005, the US promised to allow market access to 97 percent of products it imports from Bangladesh and other least-developed countries. "I have asked the committee to prepare a vision paper on Bangladesh's position on agriculture and services sector," Dr Zillur said. bdn
