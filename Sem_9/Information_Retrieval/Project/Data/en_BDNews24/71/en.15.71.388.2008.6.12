<TITLE> BNP expected to attend dialogue: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Thursday that BNP was expected to participate in dialogue with the government. "The caretaker government is addressing the issue of political dialogue with both Awami League and BNP in a balanced manner," Iftekhar told journalists at the foreign ministry. "Since a favourable atmosphere has been created, BNP will very soon join in the dialogue process. Endeavours to that end are already under way", he said after meeting Myanmar ambassador U Nyan Lynn. Lynn came to the foreign ministry to make his farewell call to the adviser. "The dialogue between the caretaker government and the political parties is a process and not an event." "Very soon it is hoped that all parties with all viewpoints will participate in the same," the foreign adviser said. Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury was one of the four advisers who met with Awami League chief and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wednesday night, following her temporary release from jail, to discuss AL's participation in the ongoing political dialogue. He said the meeting with Sheikh Hasina was itself a part of the dialogue process in which chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed had also taken part by telephoning the freed AL president. The caretaker government initiated the dialogue process with political parties with a view to holding the ninth parliamentary election by the third week of December. But the two major political parties, BNP and Awami League, have been threatening to boycott the dialogue unless the chiefs of the two parties were not released before the talks. The government released Sheikh Hasina for 8 weeks Wednesday to seek medical treatment abroad. The government also hinted at the release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in a statement Wednesday. bdn
