 NEW DELHI, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The decision to allow players to refer on-field decisions to the television umpire will ease tension between teams, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday. The system using television technology will be tried out in Sri Lanka during their three-test home series against India in July-August before the ICC decides whether to ratify it. Under the system, the batsman involved or the fielding team captain can call for a review of the original decision with each team allowed to make three referrals per innings, other than "timed out", with successful appeals not counted as a chance. The ICC allayed concerns it could further hold up play and denied it could undermine the role of on-field umpires saying he would only consult his colleague and not leave the decision to the TV umpire which is done to judge clean catches or run outs. "Our umpires already ensure the vast majority of decisions made in any test or ODI are correct but we want to see if we can enhance the game further by reducing or removing the few clearly incorrect ones," acting chief executive officer Dave Richardson said in a statement. "The fact that each side is allowed only three unsuccessful requests to review in each innings should mean that players will not make frivolous challenges and, instead, only seek a referral to decisions that, it is quickly clear, are highly likely to be incorrect. "By seeking to reduce these potentially contentious decisions we believe we can help remove a source of tension and frustration among players and spectators as well as any resultant pressure on umpires." Slow-motion replays, the wicket-to-wicket "mat", stump microphones and ball-tracking technology up to the point of impact on the pad will be available for use by the TV umpire. Snick-detecting devices and "hot-spot" technology to focus on the point of impact will not be used in this trial, ICC said. The ICC had scrapped a contentious move to refer leg before appeals, to confirm the line of the delivery, soon after it was first tried in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. The ICC has shown urgency to embrace more technology in the wake of the uproar witnessed during India's acrimonious test tour of Australia after the second test in Sydney featured many dubious decisions
