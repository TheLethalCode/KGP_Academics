 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, June 18 (bdnews24.com) -- The Law Commission of India is actively considering to implement a revolutionary proposal that will make it mandatory for Muslims to register their marriage. The commission envisages enactment of a central law making registration mandatory for all marriages in the country, including those among Muslims. "It's a huge step forward, especially for our community. We need to adapt ourselves to the modern world," says Tahir Mahmood, a member of the Law Commission, who has prepared the proposal. The proposal needs to be accepted by the Indian government to make registration of all marriages in the country compulsory. Draft reports have also been prepared suggesting changes in the Special Marriage Act of 1954 to facilitate civil marriages among the Muslims. As per the existing laws, Muslims face difficulties opting for "civil marriages" with cousins. Mahmood is a former chairman of National Minorities Commission in India. He had earlier prepared another controversial draft report suggesting replacement of the old Shariat Application Act of 1937 by a new central Act to be uniformly applicable to all Muslims throughout the country. His new proposal is seen as fallout of an order by the Supreme Court of India last year, where the registration of marriages of couples belonging to all religions across the country was made compulsory. Experts felt it can be the first step to prevent child marriage, a practice that is still prevalent in parts of India.
