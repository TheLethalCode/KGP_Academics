 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government has moved to amend the Emergency Powers Ordinance and Emergency Powers Rules to shore up "confidence of political parties" ahead of the year-end elections, said an ACC commissioner Thursday. The government has formed a committee, led by law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, to review the legal aspects of the probable amendments, Habibur Rahman of the Anticorruption Commission, told reporters after a meeting. The committee held its first meeting at the law ministry. It will review the sections of emergency rule, which deal with property attachment, terms of investigation and sentencing in cases of filing false statements. Rahman, also a member of the new committee, said other members are home adviser MA Matin, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and acting law secretary Habibul Awal. The committee will evaluate any scope for bail to the people after arrest and the possibility of activating inactive provisions in the EPR. But the ACC commissioner did not comment on whether the state of emergency would be lifted anytime soon. "The government is trying to build an appropriate atmosphere for the elections and confidence among people," Hossain Zillur Rahman said. The government has already opened the door to indoor politics across the country, he said. "The new committee has been formed to find ways to do more." bd
