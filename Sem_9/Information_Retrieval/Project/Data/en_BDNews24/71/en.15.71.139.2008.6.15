 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has shifted the documents pertaining to the extortion case filed against Sheikh Hasina by businessman Azam J Chowdhury, to the special court located on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque made the transfer order Sunday. State prosecutor Shahidul Islam told bdnews24.com the documents were transferred after the government requested the trial court on Thursday to resume the case proceedings. On May 8, on a government appeal, the Supreme Court overturned a previous High Court order that scrapped the extortion case for being tried under emergency powers rules. The High Court had ruled on Feb 6 that the case filed against Hasina was illegal after it was brought under EPR. Businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the Tk 3 crore extortion case against the former prime minister on June 13 last year. Hasina was arrested on July 16 and was shown arrested in the case, the same day, after the case was brought under EPR. bdnews24
