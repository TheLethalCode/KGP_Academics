<TITLE> Third Croatia win leaves Bilic spoilt for choice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KLAGENFURT, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's 1-0 win over Poland in their Euro 2008 Group B match on Monday has left coach Slaven Bilic spoilt for choice over team selection ahead of Friday's quarter-final against Turkey in Vienna. With only pride to play for, already-qualified Croatia started with nine reserves but still notched a third victory in a row after Ivan Klasnic, back in top level football after a kidney transplant last year, hit the second-half winner. "Our performance showed we are all here for a reason as every single player in the squad has played some excellent football in the group stage," said forward Ivan Rakitic. "I think I have shown the coach that he can have complete faith in my abilities and I am very happy for it," he said. Fuming after being left out of the opening 1-0 win over Austria, the 20-year-old Rakitic appears to have won Bilic's confidence with superb performances in the 2-1 defeat of Germany and the Poland game. The Poles had everything to play for but it was Croatia who dominated the match from start to finish and the final score did not flatter Bilic's men. NOT AFRAID "We were not afraid to throw the reserves into action because many of them had proved themselves in pre-tournament friendlies," a delighted Bilic said. "They all try to make an impact in every training session and the hard work is now starting to bear fruit." Apart from official man-of-the-match Klasnic, particularly impressive were goalkeeper Vedran Runje who stood in for Stipe Pletikosa as well as central midfielders Ognjen Vukojevic and Nikola Pokrivac. Left back Danijel Pranjic found his form after a poor opening game against the Austrians and was a constant threat with raids down his flank while Jerko Leko proved to be a worthy replacement for Darijo Srna on the right. "The only clear-cut chance Poland created came right at the end, when Runje denied them an equaliser with an excellent save," Bilic said. "We are proud of having the ability to delight our fans one match after another and we are aware that we can beat anybody in this tournament.
