 KUALA LUMPUR,Fri Jun 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said on Friday he had reached an agreement with his deputy over the timing of a leadership change, state media reported, as hundreds of people marched to protest against fuel price hikes. Abdullah has been widely expected to hand power to his anointed successor and Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak, but has not spelt out the timing of the transition. "Datuk Seri Najib and I have decided on the right time for me to hand over premiership to him. We have no problems and we enjoy good working relations," state news agency Bernama quoted Abdullah as telling government officials in the northeastern state of Kelantan. Abdullah has faced mounting public anger since ordering a steep increase in fuel prices in line with a global surge in oil prices, which touched a record $139 a barrel last week. The measure will drive Malaysia's inflation rate to a 10-year high of 4.2 percent in 2008. On Friday, hundreds of people marched in the capital demanding the government withdraw the fuel price rise or resign, in the biggest protest yet against Abdullah's coalition. "Down with PM, long live the people," the protesters shouted as they left a mosque in a poor part of Kuala Lumpur after prayers and headed to the iconic Petronas Towers in the city centre to underline anger against the state energy giant. The protest was much smaller than the 20,000 people the organizers had hoped to draw, but bigger than any of the other demonstrations so far. The protest ended peacefully after police prevented the activists from marching to city centre and they dispersed at the headquarters of the Islamist opposition party Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) party, one of the organizers. "The people are angry. They say the fuel price is very high so they want to say something," said Safarizal Saleh, a leader of the youth wing of the PAS. Hundreds of police in full riot gear stood guard on the march while a helicopter hovered overheard, reflecting government fears over the protests' gathering momentum. There are tight restrictions on public gatherings in Malaysia, and ahead of the rally police warned they would arrest anyone taking part. PUBLIC OUTCRY Malaysia joined India, Indonesia, Taiwan and Sri Lanka in raising pump prices last week, provoking a public outcry in the oil producing country. Soaring global fuel costs have triggered strikes by truckers from Thailand to Spain. The fuel price hike, together with uncertainties about when Abdullah would hand over power to Najib, have raised Malaysia's political risks in investors' eyes, analysts have said. "It's important for everyone to see the relationship between me and Najib as very crucial to strengthen UMNO and the government and to implement the development projects and programs that have been planned," Abdullah said on Friday. UMNO or the United Malays National Organization is the backbone of the Barisan Nasional, which has ruled Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957. Friday's protest was seen as a major political test for Abdullah, already fighting for his political survival after the governing coalition's dismal electoral performance in March. Trying to assuage public anger, Abdullah has said there will not be any more fuel increases this year and announced a cut in the allowances of ministers as part of measures to curb government costs. But critics, led by former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, have rejected the measures as too little and questioned why Malaysia, the largest net oil exporter in Asia, should face the fuel hike when the country earns 250 million ringgit ($76.8 million) a year in revenue for every $1 rise in crude prices. "Although Petronas is estimated to have earned 2 trillion ringgit over the last 34 years ... its accounts are not accessible to (the) public nor by the people's elected representative in Parliament," said Waytha Moorthy, chairman of HINDRAF, a group campaigning for the rights of ethnic Indians which is supporting the fuel protests. Petronas posted a record profit of $12.9 billion for the year ended March 31 2007, helped by a boom in crude oil prices. The state oil firm is expected to release its 2008 earnings at the end of June. ($1=3.2 Malaysian ringgit
