<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com) - The government is set to expand its dialogue process further by holding talks with expatriate or non-resident Bangladeshis to help identify solutions to national problems, an adviser said Monday. The government has hired a firm experienced in video conferencing to execute the cross-continent dialogue session, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters at his office after a meeting with a visiting delegation of expatriate Bangladeshis. Nevertheless, NRBs themselves have expressed an interest in face-to-face talks rather than video conferencing. Visiting delegation member, and a London local government authority public relations officer, Mahbub Rahman said if the government invites them, they would rather participate in direct dialogue. Adviser Anwarul Iqbal said NRBs want to participate in dialogue with the government for the sake of the country. He said the expatriate delegation had met with the Election Commission, the army chief and the adviser for overseas employment and expatriate welfare, to discuss getting Bangladeshis living overseas listed as voters. The adviser said the delegation had proposed holding local government elections before the national election. "They say in the countries where they live, local government is the main-stay of democracy," he added. The expatriates also demanded continuation of the government's anticorruption drive, Anwarul said. Asked whether the expatriates want elections amid a state of emergency, the adviser said: "We want a free and fair election by December. The government will decide whether it will be amid the state of emergency. However, a table situation is nopw prevailing in the country." On behalf of the visiting delegation, Mahbub Rahman said that on their request, the Election Commission has again started the process of including NRBs in the voter list. At the primary stage, as a trial process, the work would begin in the UK, he said. The delegation, led by UK-based businessman and local community leader Muhibur Rahman Muhib, includes Amin Ali, founder of The Red Fort restaurant in London, founder of the British Bangladesh Curry Club Khaled Chowdhury and chief editor of the Canadian weekly 'Desh Bidesh' Nazrul Islam Mintu. bdnew
