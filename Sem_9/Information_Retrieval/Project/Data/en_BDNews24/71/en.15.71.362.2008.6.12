 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) - Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia said Thursday BNP would consider going to dialogue with the government if a "proper environment for elections" was created. Speaking in front of lawyers and reporters, while standing in the dock at court, she also demanded the government make immediate preparations to send her two sons abroad for medical treatment. Khaleda Zia and seven other accused were produced in Special Judge's Court-9 Thursday morning to face charges in the Niko graft case. Defence lawyers asked the court to stay the case proceedings. Judge Khondker Kamal Uzzaman adjourned the court until June 16, saying he would give a decision on the date on whether the case proceedings would be stayed. Speaking to lawyers and reporters after proceedings were adjourned, she demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency, and a stop to the arrests and "repression drive". "For participation of all parties in the election, the government will have to create an proper environment," she said. "For this the state of emergency has to be withdrawn." Regarding the ongoing political dialogue between the government and political parties, she said: "We (BNP) will see if a proper election environment is created, and then consider. The responsibility of creating the proper environment lies with the government." Criticising the government's arrest drive she said: "It has been done to harass the political leaders and their supporters. Leaders and workers of political parties have been arrested in the name of nabbing 'terrorists'. They must be released immediately." The former prime minister said, "I am against terrorists During my tenure I did not show leniency to the terrorists. But today what is being done in the name of arresting terrorists is political harassment." Expressing extreme concern over the illness of her two sons Khaleda Zia said: "They are very ill. Their conditions are deteriorating day by day." "Send them abroad without wasting any more time. The law should be equal for all," she urged the government. However, she again vowed not to go abroad for her own medical treatment. bdnews24
