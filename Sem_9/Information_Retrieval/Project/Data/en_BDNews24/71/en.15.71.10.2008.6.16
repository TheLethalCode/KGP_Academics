 LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands coach Marco van Basten hinted he would rest Andre Ooijer and Nigel de Jong for Tuesday's Euro 2008 match against Romania. Defender Ooijer and midfielder de Jong were booked earlier in the tournament and a second yellow card for the Group C winners in the next game in Berne would mean an automatic suspension for the quarter-finals. Asked by reporters on Sunday why he would rest anyone against Romania, Van Basten replied: "If someone is tired, has a problem with yellow cards or we think a player has done so well (in training) he deserves a chance". Van Basten said he still expected a good display even though his side have qualified in style for the last eight by beating France 4-1 and world champions Italy 3-0. "The fact we have already qualified is nice but we want to perform at our best," said the coach. "For me every match is important and that won't change if some of the players don't play." One man who looks certain to be in the starting line-up is Arjen Robben. The winger missed the game against Italy through injury but did well when he came on as a substitute against France. "He is fit, he wants to play and he can play," said Van Basten. "The way we have performed so far has made me happy and proud but we have to keep going. There is still a long way to go before we are where we want to be.
