<TITLE> Troubled South Korean president faces more strikes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Sun Jun 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean car, construction and other unionized workers threaten to halt work this week in anger at the policies of the president, on top of a truckers' strike that has slowed transport in the export-dependent country. Lee Myung-bak, who stormed to a landslide victory in a December presidential election, has seen his support plummet due to an unpopular deal to open the local market wider to US beef imports and opposition to his calls for privatizing state firms. The militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) is set to announce results of a strike vote on Monday. Its more than half a million members include metal workers for the country's leading car maker Hyundai Motor. "Once we get members' approval, we'll outline details on the timing and the scale of actions," said a KCTU official. The umbrella group that also represents construction and health care workers is angered at Lee's privatization and pension plans. Hyundai Motor Co said on Sunday the transport of finished cars was half of normal levels due to the truckers' strike that started last week and has slowed cargo moving in and out of ports. The Korea International Trade Association said in a statement major ports and inland terminals saw cargo transport fell to 24 percent of normal levels due to the strike and $1.13 billion worth of exports and imports was affected as of Friday. South Korea's biggest port of Busan could grind to a virtual halt in days, Yonhap news agency reported. Unionized truckers represent only a small portion of drivers in the country but play a key role in moving goods in and out of ports. About 14,000 walked off the job last Friday after talks on higher pay and demands for cheaper diesel broke down. The government has mobilized military trucks and scheduled more cargo rail services to transport goods, but such moves have sparked clashes in previous truckers' strikes. Lee scored the largest margin of victory in an open South Korean presidential election with pledges to grow Asia's fourth-largest economy by 6 percent this year, which economists now say is overly ambitious in the face of record high oil prices and a global slowdown. Finance Minister Kang Man-soo told Reuters in an interview that the government was reviewing its policies in the face of mounting streets protests in a way he hoped would appeal to all sectors of society. He also predicted the truckers' strike would be resolved early this week, but gave no details. Protesters have staged rallies on almost a nightly basis since early May calling for the ouster of former construction boss Lee, who has been in office just a little more than three months. The beef deal in April has served as a lightning rod for those angered at his business-friendly reform policies. Analysts said the public may be suffering from a bit of rally fatigue, with protests at the weekend attracting fewer people than rallies last weekend. ($1=1044.0 Won
