<TITLE> Indian truckers call strike as fuel, taxes hurt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's truck fleet will begin an indefinite strike early next month over rising fuel costs and taxes, a union leader said, taking 4 million vehicles off the roads, curbing diesel demand and possibly hitting goods supplies. If the threatened stoppage takes place, Indian drivers will join a series of protests in Asia and Europe after crude oil's record run forced governments and fuel retailers to cut subsidies and raise prices. "From July 2, there will be no vehicle on the road. We have taken that decision," said Charan Singh Lohara, president of the All India Motor Transport Congress, which represents both large and small truck operations across the country. A similar week-long strike in August 2004 pulled monthly diesel sales down 9.3 percent from a year earlier, while annual growth in industrial output slowed to 7.9 percent from 8.4 percent in the previous month as the strike disrupted shipments. Lohara said union members would protest against recent increases in diesel prices, as well as hikes in road tolls and high taxes. "If we raise our charges, we will lose customers to the railways. If we don't, we will make a loss," Lohara told Reuters. He said the majority of the nearly 4 million trucks which would grind to a halt were long-distance cargo carriers that consume about 100 litres of diesel a day. The Indian government raised the retail price of petrol and diesel by about 10 percent this month but most states cut local taxes to soften the impact on consumers. Protests and strikes called by political opponents of the government broke out across the country but soon ran out of steam. S.P. Singh, senior fellow at the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training, said cargo freight rates had gone up 10-15 percent after the government raised fuel prices. But he said the increase was much more than what was required to offset the higher cost of diesel. "The diesel price hike is not the core issue in flaring up inflation. It is the high-handed action of transporters that is raising costs," he said. Low state-set prices of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene have encouraged higher demand in Asia's third-largest oil consumer, where domestic sales rose 7 percent in 2007/08, the fastest growth in eight years, analysts say.
