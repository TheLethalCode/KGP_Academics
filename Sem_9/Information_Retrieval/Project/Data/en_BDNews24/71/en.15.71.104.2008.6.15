The exploratory mission, headed by Zsolt Bartfai, comprises legal, political and security experts of the EC. The mission will recommend to the EC commissioner for external relations whether the EU should send a full mission to observe the December elections in Bangladesh. "The mission will meet government officials and the Election Commission, political leaders, civil society and media representatives to assess the overall situation necessary for holding elections," Charles Whiteley, first secretary to the Delegation of the European Commission to Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com. Whiteley said the team would also visit Mymensingh and Madhupur in Tangail.
