<TITLE> Second century may not be enough for Australia's Katich </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, June 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia opening batsman Simon Katich scored his second successive test century with a career-best 148 not out against West Indies on Saturday -- and then reflected on his possible demotion from the team. The plucky left-hander ended a two-year exile from the test team when he came into the starting line-up in Jamaica for regular opener Matthew Hayden, who was ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury. After a century in the second test in Antigua he produced nearly half of Australia's 330 runs in their second innings, so far, in Barbados. However, with Hayden likely to be back for October's tour of India, Katich is unlikely to keep his spot in any first-choice 11 given Australia's abundance of batting talent including Saturday's other centurion Phil Jaques. "I was just grateful to be on the tour as an extra batsman," Katich told reporters after his all-day innings. "The opportunity to play has been great because I felt that I was ready to play well given my form in the last couple of years so it's nice to get that opportunity now when I'm playing well. "But I obviously know that when Matt is back in the team, he and Jaquesy have done a great job so I'll just have to bide my time." A fit Hayden is guaranteed a place and with Jaques his established opening partner, skipper Ricky Ponting at three followed by Mike Hussey and vice-captain Michael Clarke, it is hard to see where Katich would fit in. It would not be the first time Katich was dropped after making a hundred -- in 2004 he lost his place to Andrew Symonds for the first test in Sri Lanka after scoring 125 against India the previous game. However, the New South Wales batsman said there would be no bitterness on his part if he found himself back in a supporting role. "I think that's the way it is, I'm grateful to have played these three tests, it could have been I didn't play any. I would rather have played three than none and been in this position. So whatever happens, happens," said the left-hander. "It's just nice to be playing well.
