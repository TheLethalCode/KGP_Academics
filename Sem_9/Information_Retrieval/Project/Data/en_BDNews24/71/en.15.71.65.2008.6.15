 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has again deferred charge framing against Tarique Rahman and others to June 19, in a bribery case involving the murder of Bashundhara Group director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Judge Shahed Nuruddin, of Special Judge's Court-3, deferred proceedings after lawyers for Tarique, one of the main accused in the case, asked for more time due to his poor health. Tarique's lawyers made two separate requests for their client  to halt the trial proceedings and make arrangements for his proper treatment. Detained former home minister Lutfozzaman Babar and Bashundhara Group official Abu Sufian, also accused in the bribery case, were both present in court Sunday. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique and seven others on May 6. They stand accused of taking approximately Tk 21 crore in bribes to conceal the involvement of Safiat Sobhan Sanbeer, son of Basundhara Group chairman Shah Alam, in the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered on July 4, 2006. A case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdnews24
