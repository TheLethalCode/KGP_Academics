<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)Home adviser MA Matin has emphasised that the government is not acting in any biased way regarding the release of former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. "Sheikh Hasina applied for her release, so she was released. Khaleda Zia is still in detention as she has not yet applied for her release," the adviser said at a home ministry press conference Sunday on the 'special drive' (arrests) that started on May 28. "I do not think any discriminatory attitude has been shown in this matter." Following Hasina's release, the release of others is under government consideration, he said. "If former prime minister Khaleda Zia applies for release it will be considered," he reiterated. On the release of Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco, Matin said all except one of Coco's necessary medical tests have been carried out. "The government is keeping an eye on his situation," he said. "I received the petition for Tarique's release today (Sunday). Whether they will be sent abroad for treatment is a matter for the government to decide. At the same time legal procedure is also involved." Asked whether Hasina, who was released the previous week to seek overseas treatment, would be allowed to address any political meeting, Matin said: "The advisers in charge of political dialogue can answer clearly in this regard." However, the home adviser said he believed that under such special conditions of release there was no scope for holding or addressing political meetings. "The government has released her with the condition that the government can cancel the release order at any time," he said. Asked whether repeated amendments of Emergency Powers Rules, during the longest state of emergency in Bangladesh, were a sign of the government's backtracking, he said: "It cannot be said that Emergency Powers Rules have failed." "An amendment to the rules is not a sign of government backtracking. The government can make such amendments for the sake of the country." The adviser told reporters that the arrest drive was aimed at improving law and order. Home secretary Abdul Karim and inspector general of police Nur Mohammad among others were present. bdnews24
