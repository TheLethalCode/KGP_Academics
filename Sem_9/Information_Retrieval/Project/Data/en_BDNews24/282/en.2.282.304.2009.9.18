<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)A fire early on Friday burned down 11 CNG-run buses at a garage in Savar on the fringe of capital Dhaka, police said. A sudden blaze exploded in the garage at Anandapur and 11 buses of Trans Millennium Company Limited were burnt down in minutes before the fire service personnel doused the flames and moved another 12 buses to safety. There was no immediate report of casualties. The airconditioned luxury passenger buses run on Motijheel-Savar route. Sub-inspector Abu Taher of Savar police station said they found out that most of the gutted coaches had long been lying there because of various dysfunctions. "We are investigating the matter." Savar fire service station officer Khalilur Rahman told bdnews24.com their conjecture is that some gas cylinder leakage might have caused the blaze. But he didn't comment on how a gas cylinder leakage could torch 11 big buses in such swiftness. Bankim Chandra, the bus pool manager, said night guards Ata and Jyotindra, a driver Chan Mia and another person were under the shed last night. He was unwilling to divulge any more information. TMCL managing director Alamgir Khan told bdnews24.com, "I have come to the spot after receiving the news of the accident. I do not know anything more about this now." bdnews
