<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)The law minister has termed recent comments by opposition BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain regarding BDR trials "deplorable and confusing". "Delwar's statements were politically motivated, deplorable and confusing," Shafique Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat on Thursday. The minister reiterated that trial of those accused of killings and looting during the mutiny by border guards in February would be held under speedy trial tribunal. "Only the time frame for the trial had been set, the same procedure as any other court will be followed," he said. "This legislation was made during the regime of last BNP government. Many cases have been tried under this act and no one raised any questions. "The BNP secretary-general is intentionally issuing misleading statements," said Ahmed. He said the decision was taken to try such crimes in future under the Army Act, and the government would also consider trials under an amended BDR Act. The trials were vital to maintain discipline among the border guards and they would get under way when charge-sheets for the cases were prepared, he added. On Tuesday, Delwar said the government's move to try BDR mutineers under speedy trial tribunal would not ensure justice. "Trial under existing general law will ensure justice as the government has influence on the speedy trial tribunal. There are many past examples of that," he said to reporters at party headquarters at Naya Paltan. The law ministry on Tuesday decided to try BDR mutineers under the BDR Act, but those charged with killings and looting will be tried under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal. The Supreme Court on Sept 10 sent its opinion to the president on the reference on the BDR mutiny trial. The reference file was sent to law ministry from the president's office on Sept 13. President Zillur Rahman sent the reference to the court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the mutineers could be tried under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, 'advisers to the court', to advise on the reference. It began hearing the reference on Aug 25, and ended it on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae observed that the BDR mutiny trial could not be held under the Army Act. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month to seek the chief justice's opinion as views varied widely on whether the mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. bdnews2
