<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel will warn its citizens to avoid India after receiving a "pinpoint" intelligence tip-off that Pakistani militants may carry out a series of attacks there in the coming weeks, Israeli television reported on Thursday. Citing a leaked copy of the travel advisory due out on Friday, Channel Two said the alleged militants had al Qaeda links and planned to target both Western and Jewish tourists in attacks similar to last year's attacks in Mumbai. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, which oversees Israel's spy services, had no immediate comment on the report. India is a popular destination for Israeli holidaymakers, especially during Jewish festivals such as the traditional new year, which begins on Friday night.
