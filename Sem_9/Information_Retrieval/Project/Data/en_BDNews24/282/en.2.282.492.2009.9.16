 LONDON, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Peter Kenyon will leave his post as chief executive at Chelsea on October 31, the Premier League club said on Wednesday. Kenyon, 55, will continue to serve as a non-executive director and will represent the club on various UEFA and European Clubs' Association committees said a statement on the club's website (www.chelseafc.com). Kenyon, formerly head of sportswear firm Umbro, made his name at Manchester United, where he spent six years, three as chief executive, before leaving to join Chelsea in February 2004 following the takeover of the club by Roman Abramovich. Since then, backed by the Russian's huge investment, Chelsea have won the Premier League twice -- their first championship titles since 1955 -- plus the FA Cup and League Cup twice each.

That is a major achievement. "I am also delighted that our relationship is not ending and I can continue to make a contribution to keeping Chelsea in that position and to go back to visit friends. "I intend to take a little time off before considering what I do next but I am certain I have at least one major challenge left in me." Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck added: 'Peter has done a fantastic job for Chelsea in the last five-and-a-half years and has been absolutely central to the success on and off the field we have had during that time.
