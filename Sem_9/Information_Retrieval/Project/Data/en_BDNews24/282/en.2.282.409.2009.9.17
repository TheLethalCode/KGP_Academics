 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission is set to hold polls to 300 municipalities early next year after the formulation of regulations in line with Local Government (Municipality) Act, an election commissioner said. "We are preparing to hold municipality polls at the end of February or the beginning of March since parliament has passed the act," Mohammed Sakhawat Hussain said to reporters at his office on Thursday. The Local Government (Municipality) Act was passed on Sept 14. The city corporation bill has not been placed in parliament that was adjourned until Oct 4. "We cannot hold Dhaka City Corporation polls at the start of 2010 since the law has not been passed even though we have plans," he said. The Union Parishad polls will be held next year in phases, the commissioner said.

The term of over 4,500 Union Parishad bodies also expired. Electronic voting system The Election Commission is considering to trial electronic voting system during the DCC elections.
