 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Muslims observsed the holy night of Shab-e-Qadar, or Lailatul Qadar, on Thursday night, marking the revelation of the holy Quran. The Quran was believed to have been revealed on this night to show mankind the path to eternal emancipation. The night has been described in the Quran as 'being better and holier than a thousand months'. The night is observed after the Muslims break their fast of the 26th day of Ramadan, in offering prayers and seeking special divine blessings. Islam says this one night's prayers should be worthier than a thousand nights' prayer offering. It was observed with holding special prayer sessions and milaads at mosques, seeking blessings from Allah. Devotees also visited the graves of their near and dear ones and offered prayers for the salvation of the departed souls. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition chiief Khaleda Zia gave messages addressing the nation marking the Shab-e-Qadr. At the national mosque Baitul Mokarram, after the Quran recital, hamd, na'at, discussion and milaad, the final prayers were offered early on Friday after the Fazr prayer. The day after Shab-e-Qadar was an annual public holiday, though it fell on the weekly Friday holiday this year. bdnews24.com/rah/wz/bd/1413h.
