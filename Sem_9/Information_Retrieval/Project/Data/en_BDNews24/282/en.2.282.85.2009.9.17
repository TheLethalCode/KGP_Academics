 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)The police on Wednesday requested the home ministry to block 84 websites with obscene content depicting Bangladeshi citizens. A letter signed by assistant inspector-general of police Nazrul Islam requested the home ministry direct Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission to block the websites. The letter said a police investigation had identified 84 websites carrying pornographic video clips of Bangladeshi men and women or doctored pictures falsely depicting well-known Bangladeshi celebrities in obscene poses. It said many people in the country had been "socially defamed" by the vulgar content, which were contrary to the social values of the country. Personal relationships had even been jeopardised by the sites, said the letter. Police said they were unable to take direct action as the websites were controlled from abroad. bdnew
