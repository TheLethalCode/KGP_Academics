 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)Some 455 prisoners will be freed from prisons across the country on Eid day this year, an official said. Senior superintendent of Dhaka Central Jail Mohammad Touhidul Islam told bdnews24.com that among the 455, 204 were serving time for minor crimes, and the others were lifers. Those who had already served 20 years of their life sentences would be freed, he said. Dhaka Central Jail, with a total of 8,875 detainees on Saturday, will see two jamaats on Eid day, at 8am and 10am, amid tight security. The Eid menu this year will include payesh, soft drinks and paan-supari, for the first time, along with all the other 'must have' dishes for any Muslim festival. Previously prisoners could look forward only to semai as a sweet dish before Eid prayers. IG prisons Md Ashraful Islam Khan told bdnews24.com, "Whatever was usual in the past, this year the prisons will celebrate Eid with the highest facilities within the legal framework." Touhidul said the afternoon meal, rice, hilsha fish and potato curry, will be served by 12.30pm. The evening meal will include polau, beef or mutton, egg, salad, and the sweet dish. Each prisoner will get a bottle of soda and a paan after their evening meal this year, he added. He said the soft drinks and paan comes this year from the profit of selling bakery items made by prisoners. Those who would like to have extra cold drinks or other items will be able to buy them from the prisoners' canteen. Touhidul said inmates may also receive food and clothes from relatives on Eid day and the following two days. "Each and every item will be checked thoroughly," he added. bdnew
