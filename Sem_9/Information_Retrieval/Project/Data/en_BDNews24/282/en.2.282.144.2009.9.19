<TEXT>
 Pabna, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  A leader of a banned extremist party was reportedly killed in a shootout with police in Ataikula, Pabna, on Saturday. Special Branch officer Kafil Uddin said 35-year old Shukkur Ali, of Khakharipara village in Ataipara, was the regional leader of outlawed Purba Banglar Communist Party (ML-Janajuddha). Kafil said police launched an operation acting on a tip-off that the Janajuddha operatives were holding a secret meeting at Nandanpur intersection in Ataikula at around 1am. Sensing their presence the criminals opened fire on them forcing the law enforcers to fire back, he said. At one stage of the half-hour exchange Shukkur was shot dead and his associates fled the scene, Kafil said. Police recovered one firearm and three rounds of ammunition from the spot, he said. The SB officer said there were a dozen cases including murder against Shukkur. Shukkur Ali is the latest in a series of reported extremists killed in encounters with law enforcers across the country, while law enforcing agencies have been concentrating their anti-militancy efforts in the troubled Pabna and the south-western region. Human rights group Odhikar has said as many as 19 people were killed in crossfire/encounters/shootouts in August, of them 10 were the members of extremist parties. Human rights organisations have demanded a stop to what they term the "extrajudicial killings". Home minister Sahara Khatun and state minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku have denied the allegations of extra-judicial killings. "The killing incidents are occurring as the law enforcers are defending themselves in the drive against criminals," Tuku has said. However, Tuku recently warned militants and extremists to surrender or face the consequences. bdnews
