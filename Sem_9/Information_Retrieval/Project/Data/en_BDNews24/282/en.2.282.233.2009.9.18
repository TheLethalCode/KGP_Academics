 Chittagong, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)The workers responsible for lacing and unlacing the containers went on a wildcat strike on Friday morning at Chittagong port after the stevedores and contractors employees' union members did not join duty on Thursday morning demanding full Eid bonus. As a result, work remained suspended for five hours on four container-loaded ships moored at four jetties. The strike was called off at 1 pm as the authorities assured the workers of meeting their demand. Engaged by the berth operators, about 350 lacing-unlacing workers busy on the container carriers abstained from work from 8am demanding Eid bonus, which suspended work on the four ships moored in the general cargo berth (GCB) area. But work at other jetties in the bulk cargo berth area was ongoing. But, the 600 members of Chittagong Port Dock Workers and Employees Federation (CPDWEF) resumed their work in the morning shift at 8am, and all the port jetties saw normal cargo handling in the morning. The workers who had gone on strike Thursday morning demanding full Eid bonus agreed to rejoin work after a discussion with the Chittagong Port Authority chairman Commodore RU Ahmed on Thursday night. The port secretary Syed Farhad Uddin told bdnews24.com at 1pm Friday that the lacing-unlacing workers called off their strike as soon as the authorities declared that the would each receive a Tk 3,500 Eid bonus. He said the berth operators had already paid Eid bonus to majority workers. The lacing-unlacing workers do the tying and untying of the containers on a ship. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, adviser to the Lacing-Unlacing Workers Union and president of Chittagong Port Dock Workers League, told bdnews24.com that the berth operators had given Eid bonus to many workers but the lacing-unlacing workers had been left out. He said, after discussing the matter with the CPA officials and berth operators, the decision of paying each lacing-unlacing worker Tk 3,500 as Eid bonus was announced and the strikers joined work at 1pm. bd
