 NEW DELHI, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Delhi Commonwealth Games organisers promised on Wednesday to respond to heavy criticism and deliver a world class event next year. "We are happy with all the wake-up calls we get," organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi told a packed news conference, as he sought to allay concerns the Oct 3-14, 2010 event was doomed to failure because of poor preparation. Fresh doubts about India's ability to stage the event has grown since Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Mike Fennell slammed the organising committee this week, seeking an urgent meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to salvage the Games. Rattled by heavy media criticism following his remarks, the organising committee gave a video presentation and said all games venues, the Athletes' Village as well as transport, security and hotel accommodation would be ready before time. All the CGF's concerns would be addressed during its general assembly in New Delhi from Oct 6-13, Kalmadi said, in the presence of all senior organising committee officials.

The IOA secretary-general Randhir Singh urged the organisers to take the CGF criticism positively, reiterating his view the organising panel should be decentralised to make it efficient. "It is very, very important for India to stage a great Games," Singh said. "There is no question of any criticism being taken in a wrong manner or swept under the carpet. "I felt the committees need to be decentralised and more people need to be working, but we're putting up a joint front. It is about staging a world class games." Organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot added: "We're fully ready as far as conduct of the Games is concerned, in some areas we are even ahead of schedule". National shooting federation president Digvijay Singh had expressed concern over the slow pace of work at the shooting range. "Yes, we're worried," he said. "But the pace of work seems to have improved after we raised conce
