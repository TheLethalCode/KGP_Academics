 Dhaka, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com)--Muslims in Bangladesh has observed Jumatul Wida on the last Friday of the Ramadan, the month of fasting and religious reflection. Millions of fasting people offered Friday prayers at mosques and prayer grounds. A special prayer was offered at the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque seeking blessings for the country and the government. Jumatul Wida has a special significance since it is a prelude to the departure of Ramadan and considered the harbinger of the end of the showering of divine blessings that characterise the month. In the prayer Baitul Mukarram Khotib Mohammad Salahuddin said, "May Allah help our government so that they can do more good deeds. May our country prosper further." The Khatib sought divine blessings for peace, progress and prosperity of the nation. Thousands of people took part in the Jumatul Wida congregation in the national mosque. Additional arrangement had to be made to accommodate increasing number of devotees at almost mosques. Congregations spilled over onto the streets as mosques lacked sufficient space for the increasing number of devotees. Imams and Khateebs in their sermons stressed Muslims to purify their souls through greater dedication to prayer, seek forgiveness of Almighty Allah and being kind to fellow beings. Ulema and religious leaders urged greater Muslim unity and called for making joint struggle for emancipation of Muslim world and Baitul Muqaddas from the clutches of Israel. They also emphasised the importance of maintaining unity and sectarian harmony, asking people to beware of miscreants and anti-state elements who want to create animosity and hatred among followers of different schools of thoughts. People also prayed for solidarity, safety and prosperity of the country and the Muslim Ummah besides seeking Allah's blessing for the solution of a spectrum of individual and collective problems. b
