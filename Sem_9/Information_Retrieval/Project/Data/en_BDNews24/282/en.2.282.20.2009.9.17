 Dhaka, Sep17 (bdnews24.com)The government has revived a project to ensure improved health facilities countrywide through 18,000 community clinics, or one clinic for every 6,000 people. The green light for the estimated Tk 2677.49 crore project was given at an ECNEC meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday. Of the total, foreign aid will provide Tk 500 crore, the rest will come from government sources. The 'Revitalisation of Community Health Care Initiative in Bangladesh', starting this year, is likely to end by 2014, covering the whole of the country. The previous 1996-2001 Awami League administration initiated the community clinics project, with the aim of building one clinic for every 6000 people in Bangladesh. A total of 10,723 clinics were set up of which some 8,000 went into operation. Later, most of these clinics became inoperative. The present government spoke of reviving the project soon after assuming office in January. The project, under the health ministry, aims at reviving the 10,723 defunct clinics, constructing 2,777 new clinics, reconstructing 99 clinics badly hit by natural calamities and including the existing 4,500 union and upazila health centres in the community clinics project. The project will then bring all 18,000 community clinics under supervision of upazila and district health programmes. Planning secretary Habib Ullah Majumdar told reporters after the meeting, "The project is very crucial for ensuring improved health facilities among rural population."
