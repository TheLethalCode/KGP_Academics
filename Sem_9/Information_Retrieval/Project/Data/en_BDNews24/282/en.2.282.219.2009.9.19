 Dhaka, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will seek to unite countries worse-affected by climate change to press for climate funds during the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly and Climate Summit next week, an official said on Saturday. Hasina will address climate change issues and participate in talks with leaders of countries contributing UN peacekeeping troops around the world, among other subjects, foreign secretary Mohamed Mizarul Quayes told reporters Saturday at the Secretariat. She will fly out on Sept 21 and land in the US on Sep 22, being scheduled to stay for a week, before returning on Sep 29, said Quayes, who will join the prime minister's delegation to the UN assembly. Hasina will attend a meeting of 25 heads of state and government on climate change, convened by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon, on Sept 22, where she will seek to unite the worse-affected countries and resolve compensation claims for climate change, said Quayes. Bangladesh, chair of the LDC Group, will seek compensation for least developed countries. "However, everything depends on the stance of other countries who are also suffering the impact of global warming," said Quayes. Bangladesh stands on the front line of countries facing fallout of global warming, caused by manmade carbon emissions, and seeks financial and technological assistance for adaptation. Poor nations also point out they will be among the worst affected by climate change but are least responsible, and rich nations needed to accept their financial responsibilities in this regard. The UN and World Bank have also urged rich nations to shoulder "the moral responsibility". US president Barack Obama and Sheikh Hasina are also scheduled to attend a sideline meeting of nine countries contributing major UN peacekeeping forces around the world. Bangladesh is a leading contributor to the peacekeeping missions, with around 10,000 personnel from the country engaged in different missions around the world. The UN has nearly 115,000 troops, police and civilians deployed in 16 peacekeeping missions from Africa and the Mideast to Cyprus, Kosovo, Western Sahara and Haiti. The missions, however, are beset with problems ranging from a lack of personnel and equipment to shortages of helicopters and other key assets. Quayes said foreign minister Dipu Moni, who is currently in the US, will join a ministerial meeting ahead of the general assembly. On Saturday, Moni met with World Bank vice president for the South Asia Region, Isabel Guerrero, in Washington DC to discuss regional plans of the bank. Earlier, on Sep 17, Dipu Moni met with US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Dipu Moni is scheduled to return to Bangladesh in the first week October. bdnew
