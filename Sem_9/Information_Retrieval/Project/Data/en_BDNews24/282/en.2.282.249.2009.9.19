 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has told India to improve their fielding in this month's Champions Trophy. "I'm not saying we can't field but ... we will be asking everyone to raise their standards by 20 percent," Dhoni told reporters on Saturday. "Fielding can really contribute to your success. "If you don't give away those extra 10 to 15 runs, or you make it look like you have saved 20 to 30 runs in the field, it can give you a vital cushion."

"We have shifted the batting order quite a few times recently and it may be the same in this tournament," he said.

"The question about 50-over cricket goes on in the media and will stay for a while. Every press conference you know the question will definitely pop up," said Dhoni. "I think 50-over cricket is here to stay, I feel it is quite interesting. It's a format where you can't afford to be too flashy, you need to be technically sound and pace your inni
