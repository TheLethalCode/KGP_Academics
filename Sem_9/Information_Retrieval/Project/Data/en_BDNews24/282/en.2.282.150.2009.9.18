 Chittagong, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong port workers agreed to withdraw a strike for increased festival bonus on Thursday. They said they would resume work from Friday morning, after a meeting with the Chittagong Port Authority chairman commodore RU Ahmed. Chittagong port secretary Syed Farhad Uddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com the issue was settled in the meeting. Unloading of ships remained suspended from 8am to 4pm on Thursday as the members of Chittagong Port Stevedores and Contractors Employees Union called the strike. Port authorities said some port activities went on. They also said the afternoon and night shifts would have been suspended due to Shab-e-Qadar according to prior schedule. RU Ahmed said they had proposed to increase the Eid bonus to Tk 4,000, Tk 5,000 and Tk 6,000 under three categories from the flat-rate bonus of Tk 3,000. Union leaders agreed. CPSCEU president Rashid Ahammad Chowdhury, general secretary Raihan Sharif and other leaders were present at the meeting. Authorities had earlier ruled out any discussion with the workers and employees over their demand for larger bonuses. They termed the demand 'unreasonable'. Port official Fazle Ikram Chowdhury told bdnews24.com union leaders called the strike illegally with a motive to freeze the port. He claimed sacked labourers were engaging themselves in destructive activities to stymie port activities. Rashid Ahammad Chowdhury refuted those allegations. He said the workers had spontaneously called the strike. He claimed berth operators had cut the Eid bonus of workers to Tk 3,000 from Tk 7100 after 1/11. Chittagong Port Dock Workers and Employees Federation (CPDWEF) also supported the strike. bdnews
