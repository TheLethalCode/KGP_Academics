 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com)Educational institutions wishing to be named after Bangabandhu, or any of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's family members, will require prior permission from the prime minister, an education ministry order said on Wednesday. The order said schools, colleges and madrasas wishing to use the name Bangabandhu, a title given to independence leader and Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, or members of his family will now be required to apply to the education ministry with necessary documents. The education ministry will forward the applications after scrutiny to the prime minister for approval, said the order. The order will also apply to names of other nationally recognised leaders. "Educational institutions around the country have opened using the name Bangabandhu and other national leaders with the intention of gaining advantage from the association," Subadh Chandra Dhali, a senior official of the education ministry, told bdnews24.com. "These institutions often try to get government grants by using the names. However, the huge number of institutions using names of national leaders looks odd," said Dhali. He said existing rules require a deposit to establish educational institutions in an individual's name, but those permitted to use the name Bangabandhu and other national leaders would no longer require a deposit. bdnews24
