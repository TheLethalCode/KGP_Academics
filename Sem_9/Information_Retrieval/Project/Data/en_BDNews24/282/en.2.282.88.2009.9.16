 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)Tourist resorts and tour operators around the country are anticipating a bumper season as Bangladesh prepares to celebrate a long Eid-ul-Fitr and Durga Puja holiday this year, although lack of development in the sector means holidaymakers still face hassles often putting a damper on the festive mood. Civil aviation and tourism minister, GM Quader, told bdnews24.com the key problems besetting the sector remained lack of infrastructure and law and order concerns. It's due to the tourism boom in recent years, with development lagging well behind, that annual holidaymakers face massive countless hassles from impossible queues to buy bus or train tickets to sleeping in cramped hotel rooms by night and battling the crowds at popular resorts by day. The resort of Kuakata, for example, designated a special tourist zone, still suffers chronic infrastructural neglect, leaving the main road from Patuakhali almost impassable. Cox's Bazar, marketed as the longest natural beach in the world, becomes so crowded on the town stretch that 'holiday attraction' becomes a misnomer. "We are trying our best to address these hurdles," said Quader. He pointed to the recently established tourist police to deal with security concerns at popular holiday destinations like Cox's Bazar. "Public-private partnerships are also being pursued to develop infrastructure," said the minister. Ashraful Islam Chowdhury, founder of Dhaka University's tourism and hospitality management department, said the tourism industry in Bangladesh had huge potential for development, although skilled manpower and lack of basic infrastructure were crucial stumbling blocks. Chowdhury said advertising the country abroad, and a strong national brand image, was vital to raising the profile of Bangladesh in the international market. He also said the sector was labour intensive and constituted a major source of employment for the future. "All we need is a master plan." "Tourism will develop massively if only five percent of the population take one holiday a year within the country," said Chowdhury. The rise of the middle class in Bangladesh and expanding destinations in the domestic market have already seen tourism soar in the country over the last decade. President of Bangladesh Hotel and Guest House Association, Abdul Aziz said every room in resorts throughout the country would be filled this holiday. Toufiq Uddin Ahmed, president of the Tour Operators Association of Bangladesh, also told bdnews24.com, "Not a single room is likely to remain vacant during the festival period in Cox's Bazaar, Saint Martin's Island, Rangamati, Bandarban or Sylhet." He said the tourism sector in Bangladesh would continue to boom for the remainder of the month, with around 8,000 rooms in the main tourism hot-spots around the country fully booked throughout the period. Ahmed also said about 35,000 Bangladeshis are now also travelling abroad every year for Eid and Puja vacations. "This year around 20,000 Bangladeshis will visit India and Nepal, around 10,000 will go to Thailand, China, Singapore and Malaysia and another 5,000 to the Middle East, Europe, Egypt and South Africa," said Ahmed. Syed Golam Qader, general manager of tour operator Galaxy Bangladesh, said all the packages they announced ahead of Eid, both in the country and abroad, had sold out. "Over the Eid and Puja vacation, Galaxy is taking its clients to Cox's Bazaar, Saint Martin's, Rangamati and Bandarban as well as overseas destinations including Malaysia, Singapore, Nepal, UAE, Egypt and India," he said. bdne
