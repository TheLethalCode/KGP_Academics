 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com)--UK Border Agency officers at Heathrow Airport have made what is believed to be their biggest-ever seizure of heroin, and the haul has sparked an investigation into an international drugs cartel. Following an operation on Sep 9, around 165 kilos of the class A drug, with an estimated street value of  8 million, was discovered by UK Border Agency detection teams hidden in a consignment of souvenirs from South Africa. The find was referred to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), who began an international investigation. Following that, two men were arrested, and a further 80kg of heroin was seized at an address in Dartford, Kent. Thirty-five year old Nicholas Fullbrook from Leigh in Kent was charged with conspiracy to import controlled drugs and possession with intent to supply. He was remanded in custody following a court hearing at Maidstone Magistrates on Sep 12. A second man has been released on bail pending further enquiries. The total amount of drugs seized during the operation is estimated to be worth around  25 million. It is thought that all of it was destined for Britain. UK Border Agency officers carry out detection duties at ports and airports across the UK. Suspected offenders are then referred to Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs for prosecution. Philip Astle, the UK Border Agency's Heathrow Director told press: "This latest detection of heroin at Heathrow, believed to be our biggest ever, highlights our success in preventing class A drugs entering the UK. "We continue, through intelligence gathering and the abilities of our expert teams of officers, to have a high impact on the drugs trade and disrupt smuggling activities. "Drugs devastate lives and communities and my officers, along with colleagues from other law enforcement agencies, are determined to stop them reaching our streets." British authority passed the information to police in South Africa, who subsequently arrested a further five people, including three UK nationals. Another 115 kilos of heroin and more than 6,500 kilos of herbal cannabis and cannabis resin were also found.
