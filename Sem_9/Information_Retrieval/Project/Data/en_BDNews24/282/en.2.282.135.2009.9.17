 Dhaka, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)Markets continued to rally on the last day of trading ahead of the Eid-ul-Fitr break, continuing two days of gains, and leaving about 65 percent of traded issues on the country's twin bourses up. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark general index gained almost 15 points, while the Chittagong bourse's selective categories index ended over 44 points up. Meanwhile, according to the DSE website, trading on the bourse will remain closed from Sept 20 to Sept 24 for Eid. Trading, however, will not resume until Sept 27, as the preceding two days fall on a weekend. The day's buying trend also saw some investors lock in their profits, brokerage house officials said. "Profit-taking occurred to some degree, though most participants were reinvested as trading will be closed for a long time," said an official of Royal Securities. Banks maintained their gains, with low price deviation, although non-bank financial institutions slipped, while mutual funds fell on profit-taking following two days' of highs. All power shares lost, except Desco, which crawled up, with fuel shares also falling, except Padma Oil. Insurers and IT shares continued to rally though at a slower pace.
