 KABUL, Sep 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomb hit an Italian military convoy on a road between the US embassy and the main airport in the center of Kabul on Thursday, killing at least six people and wounding dozens, Afghan and Italian officials said. Italy's Defense Ministry in Rome said six people had died, including some Italian troops, although it was not immediately sure how many of the dead were Italians. The blast was the latest incident in a dramatic escalation of violence this year in a Taliban-led insurgency against Afghan and foreign security forces.

The body of at least one dead NATO soldier could be seen lying in the street in front of an armoured truck that bore an Italian flag. Other body parts were scattered near the scene. The chassis of an exploded car had landed dozens of yards away. A police source said five foreign troops had been killed. An ISAF media officer said they had no information about the incident yet. A message sent from a telephone often used by a Taliban spokesman said the bomber was a member of the Islamist group. "I was shopping when I heard a deafening explosion," said witness Shah Mohammad, an elderly man at the site of the blast. "I saw some dead and wounded bodies lying around," he said. The area is a short distance from the diplomatic enclave housing many Western missions, including the US and British embassies, and the road is frequently used by foreign troops. Last week, a Taliban suicide bomber blew up a car outside the main gate of a military base used by NATO troops inside Kabul's only airport. Several Afghans were killed in that att
