 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign minister Dipu Moni met with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday for her first official bilateral talks, but the meeting appeared rich in symbolism and poor in substance. Appearing jointly at a news briefing at the historic Treaty Room of the State Department, both Moni and Clinton expressed high hopes about strengthening bilateral relations between Bangladesh and the United States in the coming years. When asked in what way the relationship could be strengthened and whether there would be any metrics to measure the progress in coming years, the foreign ministers declined to explain in concrete terms how they planned to go ahead. It turned out that Bangladesh, during the meeting, received no firm commitment from the United States about the two critical issues that Dhaka has been pursuing for yearsduty free access to the American market and inclusion in the Millennium Challenge Account, a multi-billion dollar US fund created six years ago to support developing countries which are committed to promote democracy and fight corruption. Secretary Clinton said in order to qualify for the fund the recipient countries must fulfill certain conditions like embracing democracy wholeheartedly, respect for human rights and tackle corruption vigorously. There are still some issues that need to be settled, she said, before Bangladesh could qualify for the MCA. Although she didn't say it loud and clear, the corruption issue still appears to be a major hurdle for Bangladesh to be considered for the MCA fund. The recent reports of widespread hooliganism by ruling party supporters in tender biddings and other government contracts could further dim Bangladesh's prospects. As for the other major issue of duty-free access to the U.S. market, Secretary Clinton was equivocal, saying it would take more time to resolve the matter. Some U.S. officials said the matter cannot be resolved without the backing of the Congress even if the American government was serious about acceding to Bangladesh's request. Foreign minister Moni said she also asked her counterpart to handover the confessed killers of father of the nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, some of whom are widely believed to be staying in the US. But that request also didn't receive any firm commitment from her counterpart, ostensibly because the US government cannot influence the judicial process. Some observers say, the visit of Dipu Moni may not have accomplished much in terms of concrete outcome, but the fact that she was invited by Secretary Clinton itself is an achievement for Bangladesh and a recognition that the new Obama administration is perhaps sincere about focusing some attention to the country. But unless Bangladesh can show some real progress in political and economic terms, observers say, it would be difficult for the country to gain the acceptance it covets from the United States. So far that appears to be a far cry. The lack of any interest from the American media about the visit of the first female foreign minister from Bangladesh is a case in point. The joint briefing by Clinton and Moni was attended by only two reporters including this correspondent. The other reporter present was from the AFP news agency. And the only question he asked had nothing to do with US-Bangladesh relations; he sought Clinton's views on the new Japanese government. For her part though, Dipu Moni seemed to make a good impression with US officials. Clad in a deep green sari and matching full sleeve blouse, she appeared relaxed but confident. Her impeccable English was also impressive
