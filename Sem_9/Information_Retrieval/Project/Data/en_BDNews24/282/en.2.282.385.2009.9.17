 MOGADISHU, Sep 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali insurgents detonated two suicide car bombs at an African Union (AU) peacekeeping base in Mogadishu on Thursday in what the rebels said was revenge for this week's US killing of a top al Qaeda suspect. A Reuters reporter saw six wounded soldiers being carried away from the site of the explosions, some bleeding heavily, while thick smoke poured into the sky over Somalia's capital. It looked to be the worst attack on the peacekeepers since 11 Burundians were killed and 28 wounded in February by two suicide bombers -- one in a car, one with a suicide vest -- who had infliltrated the base. It also followed one of the most violent months the bullet-scarred city has seen in 20 years. Western security agencies say the country has become a safe haven for militants, including foreign jihadists, who are using it to plot attacks across the region and beyond. Al Shabaab's spokesman, Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, said Thursday's attacks were to avenge the death of Kenyan-born Salah Ali Saleh Nabhan, who was killed in southern Somalia on Monday during a raid by U.S. special forces. "We have got our revenge for our brother Nabhan. Two suicide car bombs targeting the AU base, praise Allah," he told Reuters. "It took place at noon on the 27th of Ramadan, the best blessing. We knew the infidel government and AU troops planned to attack us after the holy month. This is a message to them." Nabhan, 28, had been allied with al Shabaab, which Washington accuses of being al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia. HOSTAGE DEMANDS Witnesses said two cars with U.N. markings entered the coastal airport base of the 5,000-strong AMISOM mission unchallenged before blowing up. The force is made up of troops from Burundi and Uganda. AMISOM officials in Mogadishu were not immediately available for comment. The bombings also came just hours after al Shabaab issued demands in return for the release of a French security consultant the group is holding hostage, including an immediate end to French support for Somalia's fragile government. The French hostage is one of two security consultants kidnapped by gunmen in Mogadishu in July. His colleague managed to escape on Aug. 26. In return for his release, al Shabaab demanded the "immediate cessation of any political or military support to the apostate government of Somalia and the withdrawal of all its security advisers in Somalia", the rebels said in a statement. They demanded the withdrawal of the AU troops supporting President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed's administration and the departure of French warships trying to stamp out piracy in Somali waters. The insurgents' statement also called for the release of mujahideen prisoners in countries to be named later. Fighting in Somalia has killed more than 18,000 civilians since the start of 2007 and left another 1.5 million homel
