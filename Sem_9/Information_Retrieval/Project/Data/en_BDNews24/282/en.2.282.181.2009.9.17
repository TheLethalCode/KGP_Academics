 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newly-crowned US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro said he had set his sights on becoming world number one and winning the Masters after being given a hero's welcome home to Argentina on Wednesday. Del Potro, who turns 21 next Wednesday, upset world number one Roger Federer in five sets to lift his maiden grand slam trophy at Flushing Meadows on Monday. "It was a dream I had from (when I was) very little, to win the US Open, my favourite tournament," the Argentine, who beat number two Rafael Nadal in straight sets in their semi-final the day before, told a news conference in Buenos Aires. Del Potro said although it was hard to think of his next steps amid the euphoria and adulation of his momentous victory, becoming world number one was his dream and the end-of-season Masters tournament in London his next target.

Del Potro, who was due to be paraded through the streets of the small town of Tandil on a fire engine later on Wednesday, said he had been amazed at the reaction of fans in New York and Buenos Aires to his victory. "The recognition was what astonished me most of all," he said, adding that when he left his hotel surrounded by bodyguards he "felt like a Hollywood star". He said the support he received on the Arthur Ashe court during the final was fantastic. "That's why I say I can't allow myself not to give of my best (in matches)." Del Potro, who followed Guillermo Vilas and Gabriela Sabatini as Argentine US Open champions, also publicly thanked his coach Franco Davin, who was compatriot Gaston Gaudio's trainer when he won the French Open in
