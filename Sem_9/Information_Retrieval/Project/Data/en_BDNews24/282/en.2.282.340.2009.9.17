 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sep 17(bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is considering introduction of an electronic voting system in upcoming Dhaka City Corporation elections on an experimental basis. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told bdnews24.com, "We have a plan to experimentally launch e-voting in at least one ward during the DCC polls, due next year." "Prior to that, we will carefully examine all technical aspects of such a procedure," he said. Sakhawat said, "In future we will move for e-voting as existing manual voting involves huge expenditure in procuring ballot papers, ballot boxes apart from allegations of rigging." Akbar Ali Khan, chairman of the Regulatory Reforms Commission, told bdnews24.com, "E-voting is undoubtedly an innovative idea as manual voting has always been an immense undertaking in Bangladesh." He said at one point manual voting may become virtually impossible given the rising population. But, Khan said, there were questions even among Western countries about the technicalities of e-voting. "In Bangladesh, we must ask the same questions. We must also ask whether those in whose hands we place the system are capable of running it," said Khan, a former adviser to the caretaker government. "So, of course, electronic voting must be tried experimentally before it is introduced." He said any such system must be introduced carefully over a period of time, keeping in mind future voter scenarios. "It would take several years to fully introduce such a complex system." SM Lutful Kabir, director of BUET's Institute of Information and Communication Technology, told bdnews24.com, "Our country is producing firmware and hardware for e-voting." He said the IICT had presented a working model to the Election Commission for review. 'It may cost a total of Tk 150 crore to introduce this system all over the country, Kabir said. "But the system may be used in next parliamentary election if initiative is taken from now. It would take two-three years to complete all work involved countrywide." He also said overseas technology may not be as suitable as locally tailor-made system. Regarding overseas versus local technology, Shakhawat said, "All decisions on e-voting will be taken after holding talks with political parties." On top of that, public will also have to be consulted, he said. bdnews2
