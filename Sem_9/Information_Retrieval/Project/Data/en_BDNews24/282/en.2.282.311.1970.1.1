 NEW DELHI, Sep 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Railway ministry said on Wednesday it would not seize private land for new projects, a move underscoring the political difficulties of acquiring land for large-scale infrastruture or industry. The decision is seen as the latest blow to industrialisation efforts of the Congress party-led government, whose key allies are blocking reforms like easier acquisition of land and privatisation of state-run firms.

A total of 230 tax-free export zones have been put on hold. "Land acquisition is a a big issue whether for rail or SEZ projects. We cannot forget the political side," Bhanumurthy said.
