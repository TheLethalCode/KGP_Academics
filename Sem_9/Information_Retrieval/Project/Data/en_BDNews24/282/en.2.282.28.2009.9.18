<TITLE> Japan's new cabinet targets waste </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's brand new prime minister ordered his cabinet on Friday to root out wasteful projects in a $154 billion extra budget crafted by his defeated rival, but his deputy stressed the aim was to redirect stimulus spending, not cut it. Opinion polls showed a stunning three-quarters of Japanese voters support Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's new cabinet, which took office on Wednesday after ousting its long-ruling rival. But Hatoyama is under pressure to make good quickly on promises to focus spending on consumers, cut waste and reduce bureaucrats' control over policy. New Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters that he aimed to find several trillion yen in savings from the review of the 14 trillion yen budget, adding this could result in less government bond issuance for the year to next March 31. But he stopped short of specifying the amount of a possible cut in the total 44.1 trillion yen worth of Japanese government bond issuance planned for 2009/10. "Under past Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) governments, ministers got lectures from bureaucrats based on the interests of each ministry and based on that ... made various demands," Deputy Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who heads a powerful new strategy bureau charged with setting policy priorities, told a news conference. "Under our party, or rather, the Hatoyama cabinet, ministers themselves are already showing a stance ... based on the interests of the people rather than ministries interests." In a sign the government meant to keep its campaign promises, Transport Minister Seiji Maehara on Thursday told reporters that the two costly and long-planned dam projects may be scrapped. REFOCUS SPENDING Kan, a former Democratic Party leader, is in charge of a new National Strategy Bureau that will also oversee the budget process, liaising closely with Fujii and other key ministers. Hatoyama's pledge to cut wasteful spending has raised some concerns that the surgery on the extra budget would decrease stimulus needed to ensure Japan's nascent recovery from its worst recession since World War Two stays on track. Kan sought to allay such concerns. "We are paying attention to the economy. It is not correct to say we are going to freeze spending. We will be reallocating it." The Bank of Japan has upgraded its assessment of the economy, as exports and output bounced back from a steep fall triggered by the global crisis. But analysts warn the incipient recovery was largely due to the temporary effects of global government stimulus steps. Finance Minister Fujii said it was too soon to say if an other extra budget would be needed for the current fiscal year but Kan said that "common sense" suggested one would be needed. Economists have said the government would likely have to craft another budget for this year due to sliding tax revenues in the struggling economy, leaving a hole of at least 5 trillion yen in this year's budget. "The JGB market is waiting to find out more details about Japan's budget. Although the market has priced in some increase in bond issuance, it needs to know more details," said Hidenori Suezawa, chief fixed-income strategist at Daiwa Securities SMBC. Hatoyama will also have to carefully manage ties with the United States as he seeks to chart a diplomatic course more independent of Tokyo's closest security ally. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell met Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada on Friday for talks likely to have included Japan's proposal to review agreements concerning a rejig of U.S. troops in Japan as well as a Japanese navy refueling mission in support of U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan. "There are various issues between the United States and Japan, but... I would like to work hard so the Japan-U.S. alliance will be sustainable and deepened through the next 30, 50 years," Okada told Campbell at the start of the talks
