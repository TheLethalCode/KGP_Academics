 NEW DELHI, Sep 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's security agencies have recommended a ban on international Internet telephony until a system to trace the calls is in place, officials said, the latest move to plug security loopholes after the Mumbai attacks. India fears that militant groups operating from overseas could use Internet telephony to bypass security systems during the planning and execution of attacks, officials said.

The company later agreed to comply with India's security directives after a series of meetings. India is also considering a new law allowing for checking of all imported telecommunications equipment to ensure it does not compromise national security. Several providers, including Skype, Google, Yahoo and Windows Live offer Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP).

In the January-March period this year, 130 million minutes of Internet telephone calls were made in India, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) said it would comply with all security requirements. "We still don't think the security agencies are against Internet Telephony.
