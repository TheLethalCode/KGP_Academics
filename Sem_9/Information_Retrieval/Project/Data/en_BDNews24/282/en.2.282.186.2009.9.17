 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)--The US Embassy on Thursday announced a new US government-sponsored $13 million health initiative called "Modhumita" (sweet friend) to stem the transmission of HIV/AIDS. The programme will help prevent HIV by providing HIV-prevention services to two million at-risk people in Bangladesh including injecting drug users, male, female and transgender sex workers and their clients, and HIV-positive people through a network of 50 health centres. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), in partnership with Family Health International, will implement 'Modhumita', a press release issued by the public affairs section of the US embassy in Dhaka said. In addition to providing medical testing and treatment, the centres will also rehabilitate injecting drug users, offer job skills training to recovering drug users, and deliver HIV awareness messages. Modhumita will also provide care and support programmes for people living with HIV/AIDS
