 ISLAMABAD, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani police plan to arrest an Islamist militant leader who India blames for last year's Mumbai attack, for propagating jihad, or Muslim holy war, and collecting funds for a charity he heads, police said. India accuses the militant, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LT) group, of masterminding last November's assault on its financial capital of Mumbai in which 166 people were killed and has been demanding action against him. The complaints against Saeed came ahead of a meeting between the Pakistani and Indian foreign ministers and the nuclear-armed rivals' top diplomats in New York this month. India has been demanding Pakistani action against Saeed before talks aimed at improving relations can resume. Police in the city of Faisalabad lodged two complaints against Saeed this week for delivering a speech to his supporters last month in which he urged jihad and appealed for funds for his Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity. "We hope to arrest him soon," Hafiz Mohammad Irfan, a senior police official in Faisalabad, told Reuters on Friday. Saeed was not available for coment but a spokesman for him said authorities were acting under pressure from India and Saeed was in the eastern city of Lahore. India broke off a peace process with Pakistan launched in 2004 after the Mumbai assault, that it said was carried out by Pakistani-based militants. NO BREAKTHROUGH SEEN Pakistan, keen to get the peace talks back on track, has acknowledged the Mumbai attack was partly plotted and launched from its soil and has the begun trial of five suspects. Authorities recently arrested two more suspects but Pakistan says evidence given by India about Saeed was insufficient and not tenable in court. Saeed was detained in Pakistan in December, after a UN Security Council resolution put him and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity led by him on a list of people and groups supporting al Qaeda. But in June, a court released him citing lack of evidence, prompting the Pakistani government to launch an appeal in the Supreme Court for his re-arrest. That case is pending. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and his Indian counterpart, S.M. Krishna, are due to meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Sept. 26. Their meeting will be preceded by talks between their foreign secretaries but Qureshi said this week he did not expect any breakthrough. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence in 1947, two of them over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir. The two countries have held three bilateral meeting since June. Saeed founded the LeT in 1990 but stepped down as its chief days before the government banned it in early 2002 after India blamed it and another group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir for an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001
