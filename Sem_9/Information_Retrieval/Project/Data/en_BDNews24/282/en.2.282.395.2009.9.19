 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Many commercial banks in the capital opened their doors for customers on Saturday, the last weekend before Eid-ul-Fitr. State-owned banks and AD branches of private banks also remained open, following a central bank circular ahead of the long holiday period. Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited and Bank Asia were among those to keep all their branches open in the capital. Dutch Bangla Bank's chief information officer Shahjada Bashu Miah told bdnews24.com they had asked all authorised (foreign exchange) dealers branches as well as other branches in Dhaka and main branches outside Dhaka to keep open. Mercantile Bank vice president and Karwan Bazar branch chief Arif Md Shahidul Haque told bdnews24.com they had a pretty good run of customers, despite the huge pre-Eid rush on Thursday. Banks in the capital were inundated on Thursday as customers queued up for what they thought might be their last chance for banking transactions on the final day of business before the long Eid break. In the event, Bangladesh Bank issued a circular on the day, saying individual banks and branches could stay open one more day, on Saturday, if they saw fit. But the circular was issued in the afternoon, too late for banks to avoid the huge holiday crowds. bdnew
