 JAKARTA, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian police killed at least three people in a raid on a house on Java island while hunting militants linked to suicide bombings in the capital in July, a TV station said. One person in the house was captured alive during the overnight raid by the country's anti-terrorism unit, Detachment 88, in Solo, TVOne reported. One of the suspects was Bagus Budi Pranoto, also known as Urwah, wanted by police in connection with July's Jakarta hotel bombings, it said. A police spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Other media reported at least four had died in the shootout, including the owner of the house and his wife. Police have been hunting for a number of suspects believed to be behind the attacks on the Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels on July 17 in which nine people were killed and 53 wounded. Malayasian-born Noordin Mohammad Top, who set up a violent splinter group of the regional militant group Jemaah Islamiah, is suspected by police to be the mastermind behind those and other attacks. Before the latest raid, police had arrested at least six people, including a Saudi national, and three others died during raids targeting militants linked to the bombings. Reports that police had killed killed Top during a raid in Central Java last month proved to be incorrect. Police are trying to pin down whether the attackers received overseas funding from al Qaeda
