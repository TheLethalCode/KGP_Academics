<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)A district-level vetting committee for 'politically motivated' cases has recommended quashing a 15-year old corruption case against former president and Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Mohammad Ershad. Committee members, Dhaka additional district commissioner Amitabh Sarker and public prosecutor of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrates Court Abdullah Abu, told bdnews24.com of the recommendation on Thursday. The four-member committee, based at the Dhaka District Commissioner's Office, sent the recommendation to the home ministry, terming the case 'ill-motivated'. Former Anticorruption Bureau officer Sazzad Hossain filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Aug 31, 1994, accusing the former president of corruption in procurement of bitumen for the roads and highways department. Ershad is on bail in this case, though charges in the case have yet to be submitted 15 years later. The case details said Ershad ordered the purchase more than Tk 15 crore worth of bitumen from M/S Zakir Industries of Moghbazar in 1984 by abusing his power as president to gain benefits for himself and the other party. Experts said the bitumen delivered was no good for road construction works. The government invited applications seeking cancellation of "cases filed for political motives" from February, forming district-level vetting committees and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The deadline for applications was extended three times up to July 12. The scrutiny committee has so far recommended 578 cases should be quashed for being filed on political grounds since its first sitting on June 10. Most of the cases recommended for quashing were filed against members of ruling Awami League or its associate organisations. Only has been recommended for quashing against a opposition BNP leader. Ershad, as chairman of Jatiya Party, is a ruling party ally. bdnew
