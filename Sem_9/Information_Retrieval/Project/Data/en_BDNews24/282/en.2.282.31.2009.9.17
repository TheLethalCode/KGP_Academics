 Washington, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)--US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has said Bangladesh, with a strong secular and democratic heritage, a record of respect for women, a Muslim majority population, embodies the promise that President Barrack Obama spoke of in Cairo. On June 4, President Obama in a speech from Cairo University in Egypt pledged a new beginning between the US and Muslims around the world. "I remember when I visited Bangladesh in the 1990s, and I met many dynamic women in positions of responsibility, and I saw the way that pioneering microcredit projects really invented in Bangladesh  especially through the Grameen Bank  helped women living in poverty gain self-sufficiency and offered them a better life." Clinton spoke at a joint press briefing with foreign minister Dipu Moni at the historic Treaty Room of the State Department on Wednesday. "I saw the government's efforts to increase access to education for young girls. I saw Muslim and Hindu women sitting down together to talk about their countries' future. I was very impressed by the commitment I saw to empowering women, for which Bangladesh has long been known. "And of course, it is further emphasized by Dr. Moni's appointment as the country's first woman foreign minister. So I am extremely pleased to have her as my counterpart," she said. Dipu Monim, who attended an Iftar dinner Clinton gave in her honour on Tuesday night, said the new Sheikh Hasina administration is committed to bringing change. "Our resolve is to ensure rule under the constitution of  and the law, good governance, to protect the inclusive and the pluralist nature of our society, promote women's empowerment, opportunities for the young and the disadvantaged," Moni said at a joint news briefing on Wednesday. "Our goal is to ensure a level of socioeconomic development that would elevate Bangladesh to a middle-income country by 2021, which will coincide with 50 years of our independence," the foreign minister said. "This is not going to be an easy task, and we cannot do this alone. We need support and assistance from our friends, particularly from the United States." "I have discussed with Secretary Clinton the various areas of cooperation between our two countries, including enhanced trade opportunities, U.S. investment in Bangladesh, and cooperation in the area of counterterrorism and debt relief for Bangladesh." The foreign minister said she specially requested for duty-free and quota-free access for Bangladeshi products into the US market. "We have also discussed about the social and human rights related issues. I sought her cooperation in deporting the killers of the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, some of whom have reportedly been living in the U.S. The foreign minister said she briefed Clinton on the adverse impact of the climate change on vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh and stressed the need for collective action to cope with the challenge. "I also drew her attention to the increased cost of development endeavors due to climate change, and underscored the need for developed countries to assist in adaptation and mitigation. On the global financial crisis, both countries agreed that the challenges cannot be resolved by any single country and that there was need for concerted action. "I apprised her about the negative impact of the crisis on Bangladesh and the need for addressing our concerns by the international community." bdnews24.com Washington correspondent Arshad Mahmud, one of only two reporters present, asked if there was any development on Bangladesh's seeking duty-free access of its goods to the US market and the country's inclusion into Millennium Challenge Corporation. Clinton said said they discussed both the issues along with many others "in a very comprehensive discussion about the concerns that Bangladesh and the United States share." "Certainly with respect to the Millennium Challenge Account, the foreign minister recognized that circumstances have changed with the election of a new government in December, about the same time that our Administration was elected. Secretary Clinton said both Bangladesh and the US were young administrations and working hard to get established and proceed on the numerous goals "that we share". "But we will certainly begin a conversation, with no guarantees, because, as you know, the Millennium Challenge Account is not only a very competitive process to get to a compact that many nations are competing for, but it is one that takes time. And so we will begin to look into that and see how that can proceed." "With respect to the foreign minister's very clear request for duty-free access, we have a vibrant trade relationship now, and it has been growing..." "We look forward to continuing to grow that trade. We did specifically talk about the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, which has been discussed between our two governments  your trade officials along with our trade representative," she continued. "Bangladesh currently receives preferential tariff treatment for hundreds of products through the generalized system of preferences, and we're going to work to see how Bangladesh can diversify its exports based on what already exists, because we now believe we have a government with whom we can really explore these questions," she said
