<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)Banks in the capital were inundated as customers made what they thought might be their last chance for banking transactions on the final day of business before the long Eit-ul-Fitr break. In the event, Bangladesh Bank issued a circular on the day, saying individual banks and branches could stay open one more day, on Saturday, if they saw fit. But the circular was issued in the afternoon, too late for banks to avoid the huge holiday crowds. "We saw a huge Eid rush today," Quazi Towhidul Alam, manager of Dutch-Bangla Bank's Dilkusha branch, told bdnews24.com. We served all customers who had made it through the doors before our 2.15pm closing time, said Alam. One of Dutch-Bangla Bank's queuing clients, Naimur Rahman, said he had come to deposit his business takings, but had a lengthy wait due to the huge crowds. Abdur Razzak, another client of the bank, echoed the sentiment, saying he had not expected to see such long queues, even ahead of Eid, but needed to withdraw cash for his employees. Prime Bank's brand communication chief Mahmudur Rahman said his bank's officials had been rushed off their feet dealing with the higher number of transactions being made ahead of the holidays, although he added some previous years had been even busier. "It seems some of our customers had already organised their finances for the Eid break," said Rahman. HSBC's marketing and communication department chief Mustafiz R Khan said they had expected the rush and prepared in advance to meet the increased number of clients. The central bank circular in the afternoon announced high street banks could open their branches on Saturday, which will now be the last banking day before the Eid holiday. The move followed a request from the business community to allow banks to open a further day prior to the long Eid break this year. b
