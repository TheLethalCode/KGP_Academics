<TITLE> Gridlock still seizes city </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep19 (bdnews24.com)Breathtaking traffic gridlock coupled with lack of public transport marked Saturday in the capital just ahead of Eid. Capitalising on the helplessness of city dwellers, CNG autorickshaws were cashing in charging up to five times the usual fares, according to some reports. Bus stops were crowded with passengers waiting for scarce transport, while roads adjacent to the city's shopping malls saw unusual congestion with traffic clogging the areas for hours. The suffering of shoppers peaked as CNG-run auto rickshaws simply refused to take any passengers wanting to go through the more jam prone streets. Meanwhile, ready made garment factories in Dhaka and surrounding areas began Eid vacations on Saturday. Over 50,000 RMG workers faced being stranded due to lack of public transport. New Fashion Knitwear worker Asma told bdnews24.com, "We wanted to get to Gabtali from Kazipara by CNG as buses were not available on the road." But, she claimed, CNG drivers were charging five times the price. "They were asking for Tk 250 where the normal fare was Tk 50!" Many workers heading out of the city altogether, to home districts for the holidays, were seen waiting anxiously for buses at Mirpur-12, Shewrapara, Mirpur-1, Uttara and Jatrabari for hours. They were disappointed when they approached bus counters as most tickets were sold in advance. But a huge number of passengers who booked tickets in advance still had to wait for long hours for buses. Anisur Rahman, a private service holder who was waiting for a bus at Gabtoli along with family members, said, "The bus was due at 12.30pm. Now it is 2.30pm anmd there's still no sign." Failing to procure tickets, many started for home districts on local buses taking roundabout routes, especially those heading for Faridpur, Rajbari, Shariatpur and Madaripur. Meanwhile, launches, like every year, were seen leaving Sadarghat on different routes carrying passengers way beyond their capacity. The annual overloading of the passenger boats, with many travelling on launch roofs finding no room inside, blatantly flouts the law and leads to tragic accidents during the holiday period as does reckless driving on the country's crowded highways. bd
