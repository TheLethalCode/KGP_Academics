A project of Bangladesh Tea Board, the museum will be open for visitors without any entry free from Sunday. Bangladesh Tea Board chairman Maj Gen Ruhul Amin on Wednesday launched the museum located on the Sreemangal-Kamalganj Road, two kilometres from Sreemangal Sadar. Bangladesh Tea Research Institute director Dr Mainul Haque said they had arranged four rooms with furniture and other materials used in tea gardens during the British period and before pre-liberation Bangladesh. The materials and furniture include chairs and tables used by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, special coins used by tea workers, compass, clocks and watches, pump tube-wells, and beds, tables and water filters from London. The museum also displays ornaments, electric fans, fork, survey chain, radio, refrigerators and dressing tables used by the British planters and a car chassis used by former Pakistan president Ayub Khan. Haque said they are still trying to collect other antiques from tea garden areas. They have also plan to set up a new building for the museum, he added.
