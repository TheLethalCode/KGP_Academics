<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni requested World Bank assistance in Washington on Saturday to help Bangladesh establish itself as a middle-income country by 2021. The foreign minister's comments came at a meeting with WB vice president for the South Asia Region, Isabel Guerrero, in Washington DC. The talks covered WB investment in south Asian countries in a range of sectors including social security, rail and water transport, fuel assistance and trade issues. After the meeting, Dipu Moni visited Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, one of two national cemeteries administered by the US army, to visit the grave of the late Senator Edward Kennedy. Edward Kennedy is fondly remembered in Bangladesh for his personal support of the 1971 Liberation War in the face of opposition from the then Nixon administration. Battling brain cancer, which was diagnosed in May 2008, Kennedy died at his home in Massachusetts, Boston at the age of 77 on Aug 25. The foreign minister also met with Bangladeshi journalists working in the US, and told them of ongoing efforts, including the Digital Bangladesh initiative, to transform the country into a middle-income nation within 12 years. Bangladesh ambassador to the US, Akramul Qader and director general of the foreign ministry Muhammad Ali Sarkar attended the meeting among others. b
