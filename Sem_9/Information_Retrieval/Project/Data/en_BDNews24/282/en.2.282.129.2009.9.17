 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Thursday froze for four weeks the High Court bail order granted to the four people charged in the Karwan Bazaar triple murder case. Justice S K Sinha, chamber judge of the Appellate Division, gave the order after hearing the state appeal and as a result, defendants Nabi Solaiman, Lutfur Rahman, Nurul Islam and Abu Sayyid will not be freed from detention now. At the hearing, attorney general Mahbubey Alam said there are clear accusations of the involvement of the four in the triple murders. Deputy attorney general Motahar Hossain Shaju, who assisted Alam at the hearing, later told bdnews24.com, "The Appellate Division has deferred the bail granted to the four accused. Therefore, the four are not getting their release." The High Court on Wednesday granted the four six months' interim bail and asked the government to explain why the accused should not be given regular bail. On June 26 at Karwan Bazaar, three persons including business leader Faruque Mollah were gunned down. Faruque's brother Mosharaf Hossain Mollah filed the murder case with Tejgaon Police Station the same day. b
