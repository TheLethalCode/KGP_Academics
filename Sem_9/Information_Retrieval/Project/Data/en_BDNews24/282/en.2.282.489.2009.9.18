 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)Five people including a Bangladeshi were killed early on Thursday when a bus rammed into a water tanker near the Jeddah checkpoint on its way from Makkah on the Jeddah-Makkah Expressway, Arab News said on Friday. Jeddah traffic director Colonel Muhammad Al-Qahtani said the driver of the Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO) bus, a Saudi citizen, was among the dead. Al-Qahtani said the bus was carrying pilgrims of Arab and Asian nationalities, returning after offering Ramadan 27th night prayers in Makkah. He identified the four dead passengers as two Indians, a Pakistani and a Bangladeshi, Harnul Aaid Abdul Haq, 27. The dead, according to Al-Qahtani, were taken to the morgue at King Abdul Aziz Hospital in Mahjer and the 47 injured to different hospitals. "The reason of the accident was the close proximity of the vehicles on the highway," said Al-Qahtani. bdne
