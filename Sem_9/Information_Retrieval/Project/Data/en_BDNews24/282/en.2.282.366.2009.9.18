<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)An alleged gangster of the capital's Mirpur was killed in a 'gunfight' with RAB early on Friday. RAB said Mohammad Ali, 30, a member of the notorious 'Shahar Ali group', died in the shootout the incident occurred at 2:45 am in Mirpur outer stadium grounds. Commander Abul Kalam Azad, director, RAB media and legal wing, told bdnews24.com that Shahar Ali, the leader of the gang, died in another 'shootout' on Sept 12. In a bid to nab Shahar's cohorts on Sept 13, RAB-4 member major Sarwar sustained injuries, after which RAB efforts to net the miscreants were further strengthened, he said. A a RAB-4 contingent raided the Mirpur outer stadium grounds early on Friday on information that some gang members were having a meeting there. The miscreants opened fire at the law enforcers and a gun battle ensued. Ali took bullets and fell to the ground during the exchange but all his associates fled the spot. He was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where the doctor declared him dead, said Azad. He said, a revolver, three rounds of ammo, a dagger and a ramda (a long-bladed machete) were retrieved from the spot. Human-rights organisation 'Odhikar' said 19 people were killed in the country in August in 'crossfire, encounter, gunfight', of whom 10 were members of various banned militant outfits. It said 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". RAB said 577 people died in 472 incidents up to Aug 31 since the special force was raised on March 26, 2004. The human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. Home minister Sahara Khatun, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. State minister for home Shamsul Huq Tuku has trashed the human-rights organisations' allegations. "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting a raid to apprehend terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two odd deaths occur unavoidably." The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. bdnew
