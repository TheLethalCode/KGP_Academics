 Dhaka, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)Sales of gift items has perked up ahead of the Eid as the last round of shopping mainly focuses on presents for the dear ones. Greeting cards top the list while items like show-pieces, small leather goods are also lodging increased sales, according to gift shop owners. "People are now coming in to buy presents for others as most are done with the preliminary shopping of clothes," says Tipu Rahman, manager of an Archies Gallery outlet at the city's Hatirpool area. An Azad Products showroom at Motijheel was found crowded on Wednesday; people were checking out the greeting cards of different price ranges. "Price of our greeting cards range from Tk 10 to Tk 1,000," Mahbub Zaman, salesperson of the local paper product company told bdnews24.com. But more pricy greeting cards could found in the shops of Banani. A Hallmark shop at the upscale Kemal Ataturk Avenue has greeting cards which can cost up to Tk 6,000. Greeting cards now-a-days are bundled with music, according to Azmal Khan, who runs the outlet. "When you open this card, it plays music; we also have some cards which has three to four parts of folding with hard cover envelopes and ribbons," he said. Asked whether there were customers to buy such highly priced greeting cards, Khan says his low cost items were sold relatively less. "But that must be the case in this area only," he adds. The gift shops are also lodging increased sales for show pieces. "It seems people are finding show pieces as a nice thing for an Eid present," said Anwarul Huq, cashier of Gift Emporium at New Market. Leather goods like wallets and card holders have also carved out a place as presents. "A lot of customers are pouring in to buy moneybags and card holders, there are even ladies buying these men's item, definitely as presents," says Alam, whose tiny shop at Elephant Road deals with leather goods. Sales ahead of the biggest festival of the country almost accounts for nearly 70 percent of the yearly turnover, according to shop owners. "This is the only time of the year when most people come in and buy gifts, otherwise sales is not that much," Mizanur Rahman, owner of Gifts & Cards at Dhanmondi, said.
