 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)The 'national committee', a public pressure group backed by left-leaning parties, that called Monday's hartal to protest government deals with two foreign oil companies, had "confused" the public with incorrect information, a parliamentary watchdog has said on Wednesday. A meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on energy and mineral resources on Wednesday pointed out there was no provision for exporting 80 percent of gas extracted in the production sharing contract (PSC), as claimed by the pressure group. Subid Ali Bhuiyan, the parliamentary committee's chairman, told reporters they would sit with leaders of the National Committee for Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Port within 15 days to discuss the issue. The national committee called a general strike on Sept 14, and set the government an Oct 15 deadline to "scrap" offshore gas exploration deals with US company ConocoPhillips and Ireland's Tullow Oil in the Bay of Bengal. The pressure group, comprising leaders of left-leaning parties and professionals, threatened tougher agitation in future, including heightened strike action, unless their demand was met. "The national committee has confused people by saying the PSC allows the foreign companies to export 80 percent of future extracted gas," Bhuiyan told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. "But there is no such provision," he said. According to the PSC, said Bhuiyan, the oil companies have only fourth option of selling rights, providing gas is found and extraction is feasible. The two foreign companies must first offer the government, that is state-run Petrobangla, the option to buy the gas. If the government refuses to buy, they must offer the gas to private buyers in the domestic market. Only then, if production outruns domestic consumption, do the companies have the option to export the gas by converting it into LNG (liquefied natural gas), said the chairman. Bhuiyan said the government signed the deals with the international oil companies because of the immense cost of gas exploration. He said the country's proven gas reserves were approximately 15 trillion cubic feet, of which 8.3 trillion cubic feet had already been extracted. "If we cannot explore new gas fields, there will be no gas for our use after 2011," said the chairman. "We have decided to invite leaders of the national committee to our next meeting, which is likely to take place in 15 days to clear up the misunderstanding," said Bhuiyan. Bangladesh approved the offshore deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow on Aug 24 for oil and gas exploration in three sea blocks of the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters of the blocks. Tullow is one of the largest oil and gas exploration companies in Europe, while ConocoPhillips is the third largest company of this kind in the USA. bd
