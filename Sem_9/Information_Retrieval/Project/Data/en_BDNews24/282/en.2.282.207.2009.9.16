 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday called for immediate action against individuals involved in illegal tree felling along the Cox's Bazar coastal belt, regardless of their political affiliation. Measures will be taken against those responsible, even if they are from the ruling party, Hasina told a meeting of the National Environment Committee on Wednesday. The meeting, held at the prime minister's office, marked only the third time the national environment committee had convened since forming in 1992. The second meeting was held way back in 1997. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters the committee discussed condition of the country's land, rivers and forests as well as government plans to counter impact of global warming on Bangladesh. He said Hasina asked authorities to ensure government land was not illegally occupied, highlighting the need to fully utilise char areas through tree and crop planting. She also called for more embankments to be built around the country to protect the population from flooding and tidal surges. The prime minister said trees could also be planted on embankments to make best use of the land. She called for formulation of a policy on sand collection from rivers to reduce the affect of the widespread practice on waterways in Bangladesh. The prime minister said she would also ask for an analysis of methods to produce power and fertilisers from waste materials. Azad said the meeting discussed establishment of effluent treatment plants (ETPs) by June next year in river-polluting industries surrounding the capital. The prime minister called for industrial zoning in dedicated areas to maintain a healthy environment, said Azad. Hasina said housing schemes in urban areas must include water reservoirs, and all existing water bodies in cities need to be preserved to create more attractive living spaces. Adequate parking space, delivery of electricity and fire-fighting measures were also emphasised by the prime minister, said Azad. Finance minister AMA Muhith, agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, planning minister AK Khandaker, state minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud, commerce minister Faruq Khan and land minister Mostafizur Rahman Fizar, among others, attended the meeting. bd
