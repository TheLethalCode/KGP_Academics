<TITLE> Windies can tweak CT squad if row settled - ICC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies will be given up until the latest possible moment to make changes to its Champions Trophy squad as the board tries to resolve a contracts dispute with leading players, cricket's ruling body said on Wednesday. The Caribbean body was forced to select a weakened squad for the premier one-day event starting in South Africa on Tuesday due to the protracted row. The side is already in South Africa but concerns remain that the absence of big names such as skipper Chris Gayle and all-rounder Dwayne Bravo would tarnish the event. "The West Indies cricket board and the player situation is quite complex," the ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said in a teleconference from its Dubai headquarters. "We've accepted it is absolutely their right to determine the team based on whatever the challenges are that they face, who is available and who is not," he said. "We have indicated to them that we understand the extent of the challenge they are facing, and if there is an opportunity for them, if they resolve the issue and wish to change the team, we will try and do it as late in the day as possible." The former champions open against Pakistan on Sept. 23. Australia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, England and hosts South Africa complete the line-up. The Champions Trophy will be a crucial test on whether the 50-over game was still relevant in the wake of the popularity of the Twenty20 format. Lorgat compared the raging debate on the issue to concerns raised a year ago on the future of test cricket. The ICC was open to innovations to boost the format but was against any radical changes, he said. India's Sachin Tendulkar has suggested splitting the match into two 25-over innings to make them more evenly matched.
