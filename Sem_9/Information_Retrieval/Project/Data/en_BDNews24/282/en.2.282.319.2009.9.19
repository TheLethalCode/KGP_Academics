Officials said no tsunami warning had been issued, but the quake at around dawn was felt strongly on the resort island. At least seven people were injured, some hit by falling debris from buildings and others after jumping from high floors, said Rustam Pakaya, an official at Indonesia's health ministry. The roof of a shopping mall in the island's capital of Denpasar also collapsed, the official said. "When the quake happened I was in a market and some people started shouting and running out of the market building, leaving their belongings behind," said Putu Suartana, a resident in Singaraja in Bali.
