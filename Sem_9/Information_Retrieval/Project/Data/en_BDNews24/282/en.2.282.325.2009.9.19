 Bandarban, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested four suspected members of militant outfit Rohingya Solidarity Organisation from Naikhangchhari upazila in Bandarban on Friday, police said. "Acting on a tip-off, police set up a check-post on the Jaruliacchori road and arrested the suspected RSO operatives from a CNG heading towards Ramu," Obaidul Haq, officer-in-charge of Naikhangchhori Police Station, told bdnews24.com. Police identified the arrested as 37-year-old Md Afsar from Dosri, 25-year-old Shahidul Islam from Khulna, 28-year-old Nurul Afsar from Shatkhira and 21-year-old Abul Bashar from Ashuliya in Dhaka. Haq said Afsar had confessed to being a local leader of the armed Rakhine separatist group, although the three other arrested denied any connection to the organisation. "Police have information on their involvement with RSO, and these operatives came here from different areas to involve themselves in illegal arms trading and terrorism," claimed Haq. He said RSO was actively recruiting members in Bandarban and Cox's Bazar districts. Police applied to Bandarban Judicial Magistrates Court for ten days to interrogate the suspects. The court ordered the four to jail and fixed Sep 24 to hear the cases, said Haq. bdn
