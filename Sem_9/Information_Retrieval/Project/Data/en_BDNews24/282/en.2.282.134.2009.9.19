 Dhaka, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com)The national committee has said it would accept any formal invitation of the government to sit in discussion, provided the proceedings of gas exploration deals with two foreign companies are halted. Sheikh Mohammad Shahidullah, convener of the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports, a public pressure group backed by left-leaning parties, told reporters at a press conference Saturday that a parliamentary committee had asked for talks. "But the request came through the newspapers; there has been no formal invitation at a fixed date and time." "On the other hand, the government has asked the two companies to complete the contract procedures immediately." "In this situation asking us to discussion is cheating," Shahidullah said. The press conference was held at Mukti Bhaban at Paltan, where leaders of left parties and supporters of the movement were also present. Regarding the cooperation of the large political parties with their movement against foreign oil-gas deals, Shahidullah said, "We neither lean for support on any party, whether known as 'anti-liberation' or 'communal', nor back either with our movement." The citizen's group recently enforced a half-day hartal in capital Dhaka, the first in nearly three years, in protest at two Bay exploration deals with US-based ConocoPhuillips and Irish Tullow Oil Ltd. The movement's leaders, during the hartal on Sept 14, gave the government until Oct 15 to meet their five-point charter of demands including cancelling the deals which they claimed gave the two companies the right to export 80 percent of any gas extarcetd. A parliamentary standing committee last Wednesday, however, said the pressure group had "misinformed" and "confused" the public with its misleading claims. The standing committee on energy pointed out there was no provision for exporting 80 percent of gas extracted in the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the two companies. Shahidullah claimed on Saturday that the "hidden terms" of the contract say Bangladesh will get paid for only 20 percent of extracted gas, while the contractor is not bound to pay for piping the rest to land even if the government wants to buy it. He said, "In reality Bangladesh will not be able to spend the money needed to set up pipelines from the deep sea if it wants to buy the gas, and the contractor will get the opportunity to do whatever it wants to with the gas." The committee declared further programmes until the government changes its stance. The programmes include a 'black flag show' in front of Petrobangla on Sep 24 from 11am to 1pm. It will organise conferences in divisional headquarters Khulna, Barisal, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet respectively on Oct 3, 5, 7, 10 and 13, ahead of a national convention in Dhaka on Oct 16. The convener also criticised the weak role of the government in protesting the aggression of India and Myanmar against Bangladesh's sea claims. He said at the very least a directorate for the sea affairs should be established to handle matters firmly
