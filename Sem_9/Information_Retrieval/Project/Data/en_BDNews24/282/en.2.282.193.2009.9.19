<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentine 1978 World Cup winners Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa have joined the England bid to stage the tournament in 2018. English Football Association chairman David Triesman has invited the two former Tottenham Hotspur players to help England stage the World Cup for the second time, the Argentine news agency Telam reported on Friday. World body FIFA will vote in December 2010 on the country to stage the 2018 World Cup. South Africa is hosting the finals next year and Brazil in 2014. "I am delighted to have been invited to participate in this enterprise by FA president Lord Triesman," Ardiles, who lives in England, told Telam. "Villa and I consider England our home, quite apart from it being the cradle of football," said Ardiles, who joined Spurs with Villa in 1978 after helping Argentina win the world title. The pair, both 57, join present and former England players, including David Beckham who also helped London win the right to stage the 2012 Olympic Games, as ambassadors for the bid. England's bid was officially launched in May and is backed by Britain's three main political parties. England, who won the World Cup in 1966 as hosts, are bidding against Russia, Netherlands & Belgium, Spain & Portugal, Mexico, Indonesia, the United States, Australia and Japan.
