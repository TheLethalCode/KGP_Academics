 Golam Mortuja Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of six garment factories marched towards the prime minister's office on Wednesday, with only one working day to go for payment of their salaries and festival allowances before the long Eid holiday begins. They said owners of the factoriesNibras Knitwear, SIS Garments Ltd, Marshal Knitex, Life Garments, Sydney Fashions, and Pubali Knitexhad closed their doors without paying salaries and festival bonus to around 1,500 employees. Garments workers from at least four other apparel factoriesincluding Canon Garments of Modern Plaza in Savar, Capital Garments of Savar Bazar, Sina Apparels of Kuril Bishwa Road and Islam Dresses of West Hajiparaalso staged street protests on Wednesday with the same demand. The plight of workers of the six closed factories was mentioned in parliament on Tuesday, by Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon MP. He submitted a notice to the House against the backdrop of worker protests over late payment of dues and holiday bonuses ahead of Eid. Commerce minister Faruq Khan said his ministry would address the issue, making sure workers were paid up in time for Eid. He told parliament, "The owners have assured the government that they will pay the workers all dues ahead of Eid." "The government has been closely monitoring the situation." However, Thursday is the last working day before Eid, and many factories are yet to pay their workers. Workers unions had earlier given the deadline of Wednesday (Sep 16) for meeting their demands and threatened tougher action if not paid. There are around 2,010 garments factories in Dhaka and adjacent areas of Narayanganj, Savar, Ashulia, Tongi, employing over one million workers. Some 80 factories have shut down in recent months due to recession-related troubles, according to authorities. According to a police intelligence report, however, another 51 factories with "no work orders" were in danger of closing their doors with owners absconding, as they had no way to pay dues before Eid, and their workers most likely to cause unrest. Workers of Bangladesh Garments in Mohammadpur said their owners wanted to by-pass the month's payment altogether by giving only 'overtime' for August. Protests over the past few days eventually forced the factory owner to pay up full August salaries, they said. But the workers were quite sure that they would not get their Eid bonuses. They suspected the owners might escape by locking up the factory for an uncertain period. Workers also claimed that factory authorities were terminating workers ahead of Eid over trivial reasons, and not paying up dues of the terminated workers. Sharifa, an employee of Pubali Knitex in Asahulia, said the place suddenly closed on Aug 21, she was till owed her salary and overtime for June, July and August, not to mention Eid bonus. She said, "We can't celebrate Eid. We make the clothes you wear and then get cheated." Selina, who was working at Nibras Knitwear at Mohakhali, said the factory shut abruptly on Aug 25. The owner was missing. They did not get their salaries or bonuses. Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association claimed on Sept 3 that 40 percent of garment factories would fail to pay the salaries and allowance to their workers due to the global recession, unless the government came to the industry's immediate aid with a Tk 3000 crore financial package. The announcement led to worker demonstrations and BGMEA came under heavy fire from the government, workers unions, and other business organisations for giving such an ultimatum. Finance minister AMA Muhith rejected the demand, saying industry leaders should not have linked an appeal for financial aid with workers' pay ahead of Eid. The BGMEA later issued an apology for their request, saying "mistakes in language" and "frustration deriving from the global recession" had prompted their appeal. However, the finance minister on Wednesday announced the woven and knitwear industries would receive support from a government stimulus package, to combat recession effects. The support will be provided according to details to be worked out by a working committee this month, Muhith told reporters after attending the second meeting of the government's recession taskforce. Wednesday's meeting was held at the conference centre of the National Economic Council at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar six months after the first sitting of the taskforce. The government formed the 27-member recession taskforce, which includes politicians, economists and business representatives, in March, with its first meeting on March 24. In April, the government announced a proposed stimulus package of Tk 3,424 crore, based on recommendations made in the meeting. However, the two major trade bodies of the garments industry, the BGMEA and BKMEA, were highly critical as the huge export-earning RMG sector was excluded altogether from the proposed package. They later welcomed the revised Tk 5,000 crore package included in the FY 2009-10 budget, although they again expressed concern that the RMG sector still received no specific allocation. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi said Wednesday, "The taskforce has admitted the negative effect of the recession on the RMG sector. That is why they assured us help." BKMEA president Fazlul Haque said, "We have been saying for months that recession affected the RMG sector. Today's meeting of the taskforce formally recognised that." Muhith said the taskforce meeting also discussed timely salaries and Eid bonuses for workers, and security issues inside garment factories. bdnews2
