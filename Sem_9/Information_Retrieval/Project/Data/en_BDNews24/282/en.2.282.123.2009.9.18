 Jessore, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com)Police have arrested four Jubo League leaders in connection with the murder of Chowgacha upazila Awami League leader Imamul Hasan Tutul. Forty-two-year-old Tutul, organising secretary of the Awami League's Chowgacha upazila unit and a former Pashaful union parishad chairman, was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen on Wednesday night. Debashish Misra Roy, Masud Rana, Hasanuzzaman and Liyakot Ali have been arrested in connection with the incident, Ahasan Habib, officer-in-charge of Chowgacha Police Station, told bdnews24.com. Habib said no case had yet been filed by the victim's family, although an investigation was underway in the case. "The shooting occurred at around 10pm during a meeting at the Chowgacha Awami League office," said Habib. He said a group of armed men threw a handmade explosive into the office and fired several rounds, which also injured two other party activists. The victim's wife and upazila vice-chairman Aklima Hassan said her husband did not have any enemies in the community. However, general secretary of Chowgacha upazila Awami League, SM Habibur Rahman, said the incident may have been the result of an internal power struggle. bdnews2
