<TITLE> Five facts about billionaire Philippine senator Villar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A billionaire senator who once lived in Manila's slums before rising to become one of the Philippines' top property magnates said on Wednesday he cannot promise no new taxes to reduce the government's budget deficit if elected president on May 10. Senator Manuel "Manny" Villar's rags-to-riches story and his success in business helped him build an army of supporters from both the slum communities across the country and in corporate boardrooms at Manila's business district. Here are some key facts about Villar: - Villar, 60, was born in a poor Manila district on Dec. 13, 1949 to Manuel Villar Sr, a lowly government worker and Curita Bamba, a seafood vendor, who gave him an early lesson in managing a small retail business. - Villar holds both an undergraduate and master's degree in business administration from the University of the Philippines, the country's premier tertiary educational institution. Once he graduated, he started a seafood delivery business and later put up a small construction company that launched him into the profitable real estate sector. His family owns Vista Land & Lifescapes, builder of residential enclaves with a market value of $337 million. - Married to a scion of a political clan that has ruled the suburb of Las Pinas City in metropolitan Manila for decades, Villar entered politics in 1992 to run for congressman. He was re-elected twice and became speaker of the lower house of Congress in 1998. He became senator in 2001 and was elected president of the upper chamber of Congress in 2006. - Villar has a relatively clean image in the endemically corrupt Philippine politics, but has been accused of favouring a road project that benefited his family's property companies. There were also allegations he used his position to bag a government bail-out for his family's small bank which was hit by the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. - Villar, mild mannered with simple tastes, is very much a family man. He is married to Cynthia Aguilar, who is on her third and last term in the lower house of Congress. They have three adult children -- Paolo, Mark and Cami
