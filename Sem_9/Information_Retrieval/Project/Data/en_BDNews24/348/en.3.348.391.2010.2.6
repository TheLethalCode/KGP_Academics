 LONDON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - John Terry's sacking as England skipper Friday opened the door for a significant turnaround in fortune for Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand who will take over the captain's armband. When Ferdinand missed a doping test in 2003 it cost him an eight-month ban from football, ruled him out of Euro 2004 and cast a cloud over the career of one of England's most talented defenders even though there was no suggestion he had taken drugs.

After the tabloid frenzy of the past week regarding Terry's extra-marital affair with the former girlfriend of England team-mate Wayne Bridge, England will be hoping Ferdinand can smooth over any potential dressing room tension. "John Terry is by far for me the best skipper in the team but Fabio Capello thinks it's best for the squad," former Arsenal and England midfielder Ray Parlour told the BBC. "Rio Ferdinand will do a great job. If you're going to win the World Cup you don't just need one skipper, you need at least four or five around the pi
