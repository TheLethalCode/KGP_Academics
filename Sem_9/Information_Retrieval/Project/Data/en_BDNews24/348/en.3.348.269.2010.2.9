 NAGPUR, India, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dale Steyn produced on Monday one of the best spells by a fast bowler on Indian soil, generally regarded as a graveyard for speed merchants. The South African fast bowler showed he was a bowler for all conditions as he combined express pace and reverse swing to return career-best figures of seven for 51. Steyn wiped out India's lower order in the first innings by taking five wickets for three runs with classic reverse swing after he provided the visitors' early breakthroughs with conventional swing.

Steyn, who took five wickets to blow away India for 76 in the Ahmedabad Test victory in 2008, attributed his post-tea magic to a ball change as well as his chat with coach Corrie van Zyl at the break. "From tea onwards is what really defines a player," Steyn said. "You've already been out in the field four hours and now you've got to go and do another two. When you come to India, the days do tend to get warm and there's no real movement off the deck. "There's nothing really happening. So little speeches like that can lift the players a
