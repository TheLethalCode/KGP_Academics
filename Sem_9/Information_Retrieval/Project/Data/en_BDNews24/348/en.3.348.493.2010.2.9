 Dhaka, Feb 09 (bdnews24.com)  A rice mill owner was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen at Babu Bazar in the capital on Tuesday, police said. Locals identified the dead man as Afil Uddin, 35, proprietor of VIP Rice Mill in Kushtia, and a resident of Tipu Sultan Lane at Babu Bazar in Dhaka. He supplied rice to traders of the Babu Bazar area, as well as wholesalers in Rampura and Muhammadpur, they said. Wholesalers and businessmen in Babu Bazar closed their shops for two hours in protest on hearing news of the murder. The gunmen reportedly drove by on two motorbikes in front of Afil's house at around 3.10pm and fired shots as they looked him in the eye, witnesses said. Locals rushed him to Mitford Hospital where doctors declared him dead, a neighbour of the dead man Sapan, who was witness to the incident, told bdnews24.com. Police had no immediate leads. "We are investigating whether there may be any link to a business feud or whether it was a random killing," Kotwali police chief Salauddin told bdnews24.com. bdn
