 COLOMBO, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's president has dissolved parliament before legislative elections on April 8, a senior government official said on Tuesday, a day after a leading opposition figure was arrested on military offences. The legislative poll will follow last month's presidential election, in which incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa beat former army commander General Sarath Fonseka by a landslide. "The elections will be held on April 8 and the new parliament will convene on April 22," Chandrapala Liyanage, a media officer at the president's office told Reuters.

Opposition politicians who backed Fonseka's election bid condemned his arrest, and vowed to seek legal redress. "To all of us it is evident that this is a government which is not simply dictatorial but fascist and they are all out to humiliate him, harass him and go on a journey of vendetta," Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem told reporters. The general had stood side-by-side with Rajapaksa in May after the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels, but fell out later over what he said were false accusations of planning a coup. He also complained a promotion had sidelined him by stripping his powers. He then became the common candidate of several weakened opposition parties with divergent ideologies, who united solely for the purpose of beating Rajapaksa. Some of the parties had earlier criticised him sharply for his conduct of the war. The campaign turned bitter and personal, with Fonseka and Rajapaksa trading allegations of corruption and miscondu
