 BERLIN, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew has declared peace with the German Football Association (DFB) after the two sides came close to falling out over the extension of his contract after this year's World Cup. "We've had a very, long, intense conversation and we want to get this misunderstanding out of the way," Loew told a news conference on Tuesday alongside DFB president Theo Zwanziger and national team manager Oliver Bierhoff. "We are united in that our common interest in the next few weeks is the World Cup, where we have an unbelievably big responsibility."

Loew took over from Juergen Klinsmann following the 2006 World Cup and led Germany to the final of the European championship in Austria and Switzerland two years ago. On Friday, he said he and Bierhoff had been handed a non-negotiable offer by the DFB and have been given only 48 hours to make a decision. He denied that the two sides had shaken hands on a new contract the previous December. On Sunday, he said he was "very angry" that details had come out into the open.
