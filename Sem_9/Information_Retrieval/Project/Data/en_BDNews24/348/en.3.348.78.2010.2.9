 Rajshahi, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Four Rajshahi University teachers, who had been convicted by a magistrate court in 2007 in a case filed for instigating student protest during the state of emergency, were acquitted on Tuesday by the Rajshahi district and sessions judge's court. Judge AR Masud acquitted professor of dramatics Moloy Kumar Bhowmik and assistant professors Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun of the journalism department. Police filed a case under emergency power rules charging the teachers for instigation students' agitation on RU campus following an untoward incident between Dhaka University students and army men in August 2007, which triggered countrywide protest at educational institutions. Rajshahi additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ruhul Amin had sentenced them to two years' rigorous imprisonment on December 4 that same year. They were, however, freed from jail following a presidential pardon on December 10, 2007. The teachers also moved to have the charges against them dropped. Malay Kumar told reporters after Tuesday's acquittal: "Thought late, truth has won in the end." He urged the government to also withdraw the cases filed in 2007 against a number of RU students for violation of emergency rules. bdn
