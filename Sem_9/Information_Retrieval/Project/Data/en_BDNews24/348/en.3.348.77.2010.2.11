 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Secondary School Certificate and equivalent examinations began across the country on Thursday with around 1.2 million candidates appearing under 10 education boards. The examinations began at 10am. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid visited the capital's Government Laboratory School centre to see for himself the examination arrangements and talked to the invigilators and guardians assembled around the centre. He assured the guardians that the education system would be recast soon to help students in acquiring quality education. This year's SSC exams are being held under a new innovative method for which the students had been trained up for the last four years. Nahid mourned the death of a Rajshahi University student. "Such death at the end of academic career is not expected," he said. At a press conference earlier on Wednesday, Nahid said that the authorities had taken all arrangements so that examinations are held smoothly in a congenial environment. He also warned that if any incident of cheating was found at any examination centre, it would be closed down. Nahid had earlier cautioned that instant punitive actions would be taken against officials showing the least tolerance for cheating. The total number of examinees this year is 1,206,019. Of them, 627,672 are male and 578,347 female. Dakhil examinations under the Madrasa Board are being taken by 211,860 students, of whom 112,119 are male and 99,741 female. There are some 77,979 students, with 55,369 male and 22,610 female, sitting for exams under the Technical Board.
