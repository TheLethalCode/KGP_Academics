 UNITED NATIONS, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discussed the arrest of a defeated Sri Lankan opposition candidate with the country's president and expressed concern about events in the Asian nation, the United Nations said on Wednesday. In a telephone call on Tuesday night, Ban also agreed with President Mahinda Rajapaksa that Lynn Pascoe, head of the UN political department, would visit the island soon after the presidential inauguration this month, a U.N. statement said.

"(Ban) was told that the government looked forward to further progress both in the economic and development spheres, with the participation of investors and other assistance from abroad," the Sri Lankan statement said. Human rights groups have accused Colombo of disregarding human life as the war ended, saying the Sri Lankan Army fired heavy artillery at a tiny strip of land where the Tigers had retreated along with hundreds of thousands of civilians. The Sri Lankan government has rejected the charges. Ban visited Sri Lanka shortly after the end of the conflict last May, but some human rights advocates charged that the visit appeared to be endorsing the government's victory. Regarding accusations of human rights violations, the government statement said Ban was told that an independent committee in Sri Lanka was "looking into the contents of the related reports and ... further action would be taken as considered necessar
