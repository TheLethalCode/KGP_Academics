 NAGPUR, India, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa have targeted India's middle order as an area to exploit in the first Test starting on Saturday, according to captain Graeme Smith. Experienced number three Rahul Dravid and the hard-hitting Yuvraj Singh have been ruled out of the series, while Vangipurappu Laxman is yet to recover from a finger injury. "Guys like Laxman and Dravid, they are quality players, a huge amount of experience," Smith told reporters on Friday ahead of the two-Test series between the world's top-ranked teams. "Not only do they bring experience, they bring calmness to the Indian team. From our aspect it's an opportunity," said the South Africa captain, who will test the hosts with the express pace of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. "I think it does put pressure on guys, certainly (Gautam) Gambhir and (Virender) Sehwag. They need to take a little more responsibility," he said of India's explosive opening pair. "They don't really have the guy with 10,000 runs at number three," he said, referring to former captain Dravid. "He is really the rock of the lot. The responsibility on Sehwag is crucial." Dravid sustained a fractured jaw after being struck by a Shahadat Hossain bouncer in the second Bangladesh Test last month that put him out of action for three weeks. TOP SPOT India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told reporters that they were waiting to decide on Laxman's fitness. The stylish middle-order batsman, who is approaching the 7,000-run mark in Test cricket, sustained a finger injury that ruled him out of the second Bangladesh test. India displaced South Africa as the top-ranked Test team after securing a 2-0 victory over Sri Lanka in December, but a series victory for the tourists would see them reclaim top spot. Batsman Subramaniam Badrinath is expected to be handed a debut and Murali Vijay will bat at three. If Laxman is ruled out, India will field a second debutant in Rohit Sharma, who was called up as cover. "Somebody should step up and do well for the team. So I am just expecting some of the youngsters getting the opportunity to prove themselves and get runs for the side," Dhoni said. South Africa's preparations for the difficult tour was disrupted when long-serving coach Mickey Arthur resigned and the entire selection committee were sacked following the drawn home series against England last month. "At the moment we have everything to gain on this tour and India has got everything to lose," Smith said. "The opportunity to beat India excites us and if we do that we get the rank
