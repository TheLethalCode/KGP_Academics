<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Appellate Division has fixed Thursday to give a ruling on an appeal by Jamuna Builders challenging a previous High Court order for demolition of the illegal stories of the company's Future Park development in the city. A full Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Fazlul Karim fixed the date after a hearing Wednesday. Rajuk issued a demolition notice on Jan 17, ordering the Jamuna Future Park authorities to knock down unauthorised top four floors of the sprawling 10-storey complex at Basundhara. Rajuk gave them seven days. Jamuna Group immediately petitioned the High Court, challenging the Rajuk notice but the court dismissed the petition on Feb 3. Rajuk itself began demolishing the unapproved floors of the development the following day. But the demolition work came to a halt as Jamuna Builders immediately sought to appeal against the High Court's dismissal of the earlier petition. The Appellate Division chamber justice Md Muzammel Hossain sent the appeal to the regular bench on Feb 7. bdnews
