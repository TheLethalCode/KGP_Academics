 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a High Court order for a new warrant of precedence placing district judges above generals. Appellate Division chamber judge Justice Md Muzammel Hossain stayed the order for six weeks on a government appeal filed by attorney general Mahbubey Alam on Sunday. The court also asked the government to file a regular appeal within the six-week period. The High Court on Feb 4 ordered the government to create a new warrant of precedence within 60 days, placing officials with district judge rank above the chiefs of the armed forces, in a huge leap of status for the judiciary. The existing order of precedence places the army, navy and air force chiefs in 12th position, and district judges or equivalent rank, including additional judge, chief judicial magistrate and chief metropolitan magistrate, in the 24th. The High Court in its order said that the constitutional status of judicial officials should be duly prioritised and reflected in the official protocol. It said the judges would be followed by the chiefs of the three armed forces, followed by secretaries of ministries. The Bangladesh Judicial Service Association filed a petition in 2006 challenging the legality of the existing warrant of precedence drafted in 1986. The High Court issued a rule nisi at that time asking why placing district judges below secretaries should not be declared illegal. b
