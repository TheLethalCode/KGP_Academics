<TEXT>
 Pabna, 06 (bdnews24.com)  A senior government figure on Saturday welcomed BNP's decision to come back to parliament, but said it must return to make the seat of democracy effective, not for the opposition party's own gains. "You were elected by the vote of the people so work for them.," shipping minister Shahajan Khan said, addressing his remarks to the BNP. "Present your opinions in parliament to make it effective," said Khan, as he spoke to newsmen at Madaripur after inaugurating an academic building of Nazimuddin Government College. The minister, however, condemned the attitude of the opposition in attending parliament one day within ninety, just to avoid being stripped of membership. Successive oppositions have done the same in Bangladesh, including the now ruling Awami league when it was previously in opposition. Meanwhile, speaker Abdul Hamid said on Saturday that BNP had decided to return unconditionally, whereas just weeks ago it had presented a ten-point charter of demands to rejoin parliament. He said: "BNP have not discussed anything with me regarding more seats on the front row, or the security of chairperson Khaleda Zia." Speaking to reporters after the inauguration of Amar Ekushey Book Fair at Pabna Town Hall Field, he also welcomed the opposition's decision to return to parliament. bdn
