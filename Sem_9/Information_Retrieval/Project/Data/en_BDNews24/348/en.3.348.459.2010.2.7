<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government on Sunday appealed against a High Court order for a new warrant of precedence placing district judges above generals. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam filed the appeal also seeking a stay on the High Court order given last week. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Muzammel Hossain set Monday for a hearing. The High Court on Feb 4 ordered the government to create a new warrant of precedence within 60 days, putting officials with district judge rank above the chiefs of armed forces, in a huge leap of status for the judiciary. The existing order of precedence places the army, navy and air force chiefs in 12th position, and district judges or equivalent rank, including additional judge, chief judicial magistrate and chief metropolitan magistrate, in 24th. The High Court in its order said that the constitutional status of the judiciary should be duly prioritised and reflected in the official protocol. It said the judges would be followed by the chiefs of the three armed forces, followed by secretaries of ministries. Bangladesh Judicial Service Association filed a petition in 2006 challenging the legality of the existing warrant of precedence drafted in 1986. The High Court issued a rule nisi at that time asking why placing district judges below secretaries should not be declared illegal. bdne
