 Rajshahi, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com) - Islami Chhatra Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League traded gunfire on Rajshahi University campus early hours Tuesday. Gunshots were heard for at least half an hour from around 1.45am, witnesses said, after a night of mounting tensions on the campus. Students said Shibir activists had earlier beaten up two Chhatra Leaguers Kawsar Alam and Asadur Rahman as they were trying to enter Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall at around 8:30pm on Monday. The two injured men were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital in critical condition. Tension spread to other halls, while Chhatra League activists "took position on the campus", said witnesses. Meanwhile, hearing reports of an attack on two Chhatra League students, the university proctor, three assistant commissioners of police and three local police chiefs, led by Rajshahi city police commissioner Sardar Nurul Amin, came rushing to the scene. Assistant proctor Prof Mustak Ahmed said necessary actions would be taken against those involved with the incident. Assistant police commissioner MK Jahangir Hossain also said they would take necessary actions after talking with the university administration. Police then raided Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall at around 10pm, though no arrests were made, said Hossain. Just hours after the raid, bdnews24.com's Rajshahi University correspondent, on the scene, reported that gun shots were heard as Shibir and Chhatra League elements locked in battle on the campus. bdn
