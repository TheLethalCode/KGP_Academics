<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 09 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has recommended setting uniform terms and conditions for aspirants of plots in government housing projects. The parliamentary standing committee on housing and public works ministry on Tuesday made the recommendation following news reports that some ruling party MPs had applied for government plots in violation of Rajuk rules. The existing rule prohibits anyone having plots in Dhaka from applying or being awarded Rajuk plots in the city. "It's perhaps happened because the rules are confusing", Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury, a standing committee member told reporters, referring to the news reports. He said for plots in the Uttara Model Town projects, those having their own plots in Dhaka could apply. But the terms and conditions for the Purbachal New Town project are different, which disqalifies any applicant having plots in Dhaka, Chowdhury said. "This difference in policies makes people confused in applying for Rajuk plots", Chowdhury said. He added: "Some MPs may be unaware of the difference in terms and conditions while applying for plots in two projects". He said the terms and conditions were changed by the previous BNP and the interim governments, not by the present Awami League. Committee chairman ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury and state minister for housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan were present at the briefing held at the parliament's media centre. The committee chairman Fazle Karim Chowdhury said the applications will be considered as per the terms and conditions of the projects. It means that persons having own plots in city will be eligible for getting plots in Uttara project of Rajuk, the city development authority. But they will be disqualified for Purbachal project. Rajuk has already selected people for the two housing projects in Dhaka's north. The parliamentary body also suggested the ministry should construct a flyover from Gulistan zero point to Mawa to ease traffic jam in the city. "We have decided to build a flyover or elevated expressway from the zero point to Mawa to address the chronic traffic jam," Abdul Mannan Khan, the state minister, told reporters. He said the flyover would help people who would be living in the proposed Jhilmil housing project in Dhaka's South. Traffic jam in Dhaka-Mawa highway, which connects the city with the country's Southwestern region, is severe. Vehicles take hours to reach Mawa ferry pointa distance of 38 kilometres from Gulistan zero point. The flyover will also help passengers to reach Khulna and Mongla port across Mawa.
