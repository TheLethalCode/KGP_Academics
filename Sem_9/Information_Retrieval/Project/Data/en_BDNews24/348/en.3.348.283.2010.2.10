<TEXT>
 By Lenin Gani Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The 11th South Asian Games that ended on Tuesday will be remembered as Bangladesh's finest in living memory as they exceeded expectations collecting a record 18 gold medals, seven better than what they achieved 17 years ago on home soil. After an elaborate closing ceremony at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, the curtain came down on the 12-day regional extravaganza billed as the 'Olympics of South Asia' that saw Bangladesh regain their football crown after an 11-year long wait. Golf and Twenty20 cricket, two newly introduced disciplines, also went to the hosts. While India topped the table as expected with 90 golds and Pakistan was a distant second with 19 golds, Bangladesh will be satisfied having finished in third place. India is expected to stage the next edition in either 2013 or 2014. Weightlifter Hamidul Islam had the honour of winning Bangladesh's first gold of the eight-nation meet. He lifted 257kg to clinch the gold in the 77kg weight category. On Day 10 of the competition Bangladesh enjoyed a gold feast clinching a total of six golds with four coming in karate alone. The men's team comprising Hasan Khan Sun, Hossain Khan Moon and Syed Nuruzzaman won the kata (team) gold while under 45 Kumite gold was won by Moreom Khatun Bipasha. Women's kata (individual) gold was grabbed by Jaw-U- Pru-Marma. Later Jaw U teamed with Munni Khanam and U-Sainu- Mara to win the team kata gold. Two other unlikely martial arts events -- taekwondo and wushu -- also made the country proud. Boxing produced two heroes in Jewel Ahmed Jonny and Abdur Rahim on the penultimate day. But there was nothing to cheer about in either swimming or athletics. Golf, on the other hand, was a story of sorrow turned into inspiration after Shakhawat Hossain Sohel braved the news of his father's death and helped the team to glory at the Kurmitola Golf Club on Feb 4. Moments before the tee-off, Shakhawat learned that his father Kazi Mohiuddin Khokon had passed away. But he did not allow the grief to affect him as he kept it a secret and only revealed the sad news to his team-mates later on. Earlier, Dulal Hossain, who was part of the gold-winning team, won the individual gold. Bangladesh's shooters were bang on target securing three golds in both women's individual and team 10m air rifle events. The individual event was won by Sharmin Akhter Ratna Later Ratna joined Syeda Sadia Sultana and Tripti Dutta to bag the team gold. Asif Hossain Khan, Abdulla-hel-Baki, Shovon Chowdhury bagged the men's team 10m air rifle gold. Asif, however, missed out on an individual gold and had to be content with silver. The Junior Tigers staged a brilliant show defeating Sri Lanka by six wickets to clinch the maiden gold in cricket. It was sweet revenge for Under-21 cricketers who lost their preliminary round match against the islanders by 18 runs. In the semi-finals they overcame fancied Pakistan. A day later, it was the turn of the footballers to thrash surprise finalists Afghanistan 4-0 and secure only their second title since way back in 1999 at the Kathmandu Games. In other events, Pakistan retained their hockey crown defeating arch-rivals India 4-3 in the tie-breaker. Bangladesh finished with the bronze medal after a 2-1 win against Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan Shehan Saearewan and Naseem Hamid of Pakistsan became the fastest man and woman of the
