<TITLE> No Taliban `unconditional surrender' sought: Britain </TITLE>

 MUNICH, Germany, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Western powers are not seeking an "unconditional surrender" of Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan because many could form part of a settlement, Britain's defence minister said on Saturday. British Secretary of State for Defence Bob Ainsworth said recent Western pledges to send more troops and aid would show rebels that NATO forces were determined to stay in Afghanistan until control could start being ceded to local authorities. "But you have to provide them with a genuine other way," he said on the sidelines of the annual Munich Security Conference. "This is not the Second World War where we're talking about unconditional surrender. This is building Afghanistan." Ainsworth said Pashtun tribes -- from which many Taliban fighters come -- were an integral part of Afghanistan and urged the Afghan government "to reach out to them". Both Western and Afghan officials have stressed the need to step up efforts to reintegrate local rebel elements, to drive a wedge between them and insurgents from outside the country that are affiliated to militant networks like al Qaeda. There were "huge opportunities" for encouraging Taliban insurgents to come to terms with the Afghan government, and Britain and its NATO allies wanted to help Kabul "in any way we can to split the insurgency", Ainsworth said. "If we give them the opportunity to come across into safety where they're prepared to honour the constitution and put down their weapons we can peel off a proportion of the insurgency." Ainsworth said last week's Afghan conference in London had achieved nearly all of what NATO commander General Stanley McChrystal intended. It only came up short in finding enough trainers for Afghan forces, he said. "I'm a lot more optimistic than I was six months ago," Ainsworth said. "Following the election, and the election was messy, let's not beat about the bush, President (Hamid) Karzai has made some very positive announcements" since the August vote, he noted. Karzai is due to appear in Munich on Sunday. Ainsworth said the recent initiatives had not gone unnoticed in Britain, where public concern over casualties have been a thorn in the side of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. "I think that support among the British population has steadied. I think people are beginning to realise now there is potential to go forward," Ainsworth said. "And we need that." "Our people back in the United Kingdom need to see ... that this is doable, that this is going in the right direction. We need to be able to show some tangible gain
