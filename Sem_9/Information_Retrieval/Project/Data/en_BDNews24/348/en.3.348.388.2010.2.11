<TEXT>
 London, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com) - A British woman has been found guilty of killing her lover by poisoning his curry because she could not bear the thought of him marrying a younger rival. Lakhvinder Cheema, 39, died hours after eating a leftover curry which had been in the fridge of his home in west London while his fiancee Gurjeet Choongh, 21, was violently ill. The Old Bailey heard Lakhvir Singh, 45, had poisoned the food with Indian aconite.

My face has become numb and when I touch it, I cannot feel it,'" Choongh told the court. She had a shower and then began feeling similar symptoms. "He said that everything seemed to be going dark. He could not see anything and was losing feeling in his body," she said. "I was feeling the same. I began to feel dizzy. It was difficult to stand up. My tummy was hurting." Suspicious that Singh had poisoned them, Cheema rang for an ambulance, telling the operator: "Someone put poison in our food ... she is my ex-girlfriend." Cheema died within an hour of arriving at hospital while Choongh was placed into a coma for two days while doctors traced the poison and gave her an antidote.
