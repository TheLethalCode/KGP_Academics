<TITLE> Security in Central Asia: What is at stake? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALMATY, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security in Central Asia is a concern for the West, which is determined to prevent Islamist militancy from spreading in the fragile but energy-rich region. Below are key security issues in the region: WHY IS CENTRAL ASIA IMPORTANT? Wedged between China, Russia, Afghanistan and the Caspian, Central Asia is a vast Muslim region of steppes and mountains that has been under Russian dominance since the 19th century. It is now home to five independent "stans": Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. Long isolated from the outside world, it has gained global significance because of its proximity to Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. The region strongly supported US-led efforts in Afghanistan and three of its countries, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, allowed NATO forces to use their Soviet-era military bases to support operations against the Taliban. A wave of Taliban-backed attacks on NATO supply routes in Pakistan has driven the West to seek alternative ways of delivering cargo to Afghanistan through the so-called northern route snaking across Central Asia. Central Asia's stability is now key to Western efforts to turn the tide in the Afghan war and prevent Taliban-style militancy from spilling over into broader Central Asia. The region also lies on some of the world's biggest untapped oil, gas, uranium and gold reserves. Kazakhstan is the region's economic powerhouse, with an economy worth about $100 billion. Its vast energy riches, particularly in gas-rich Turkmenistan and oil-producing Kazakhstan, are of interest to Europe looking for alternative energy resources in the Caspian region to ease its dependence on Russian gas. The region has a patchy human rights and democracy record and remains one of the world's most politically repressed regions. Uzbekistan, its most populous nation, is particularly criticised by humanitarian groups for rights violations. The United States has focused mainly on military cooperation with Uzbekistan and other Central Asian states in recent years, drawing criticism from human rights groups who accuse the West of putting security interests above democracy in the region. HOW WIDESPREAD IS RADICAL ISLAM IN CENTRAL ASIA? Central Asia is secular but radical strands of Islam, influenced by the war in Afghanistan as well as home-grown factors such as poverty, have also been on the rise. The Islamist movement in Central Asia, while propagating religious purity, is largely political in nature and aimed against Soviet-style leaders who tolerate no opposition. Thousands of people have been jailed across Central Asia on terrorist charges in a trend that has drawn criticism from human rights groups who say local governments are using the treat as an excuse to crack down on broader political dissent. The densely populated Ferghana valley, split between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, is seen as a hothouse of extremists aiming to set up an Islamic state in the region. A religiously conservative, impoverished part of Central Asia, dotted by mudbrick villages and Soviet-era factories, it flared up in 2005 during the Andizhan riot in which hundreds of people were shot by Uzbek troops, according to witnesses. WHO ARE THEY? The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Hizb ut-Tahrir are the two main groups in the region accused by local governments of terrorist activities. The IMU is a secretive underground organisation and its numbers are unclear. Its leader Takhir Yuldashev has been reported killed several times but video clips posted on the Uzbek and Russian languages websites claim he is still alive. Its fighters left the region in 2001 to fight alongside the Taliban but are now returning, seeking to revert to their original goal of toppling Karimov and staging an Islamic revolution in Central Asia, analysts say. Hizb ut-Tahrir says it has tens of thousands of members in Central Asia. It rejects government accusations of any involvement in terror activities. While seeking to establish an Islamic state in Central Asia -- the so-called Caliphate -- and beyond, the group says it employs only peaceful methods. Its members are regularly arrested and sentenced to long jail terms across Central A
