 MOSCOW, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told his ruling party on Friday it must pay more attention to ordinary voters, just days after one of the biggest opposition protests in a decade. About 10,000 people attended a rally in the Baltic region of Kaliningrad last week to call for the dismissal of the governor, prompting Putin's United Russia party to send officials to investigate why its local leader had become so unpopular.

Pro-Western liberal opposition forces such as Solidarity and Yabloko are cast as the heirs to the unpopular rule of former President Boris Yeltsin. Solidarity was one of the organisers of last week's protest in Kaliningrad and surprised observers by persuading the Communist and Liberal Democratic parties, both mainstays of a Kremlin-dominated system that tolerates only the mildest of dissent, to join them.
