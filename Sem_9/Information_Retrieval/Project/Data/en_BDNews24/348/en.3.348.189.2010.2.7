 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) was enforcing a strike at Dhaka University on Sunday to protest the death of student Abu Bakar Siddique last week following factional clashes of Bangladesh Chhatra League. Most classes were suspended on the day. The pro-BNP student body called the strike on Friday to also press a six-point demand including trial of those responsible for an earlier attack on Chhatra Dal's DU president Salauddin Ahmed Tuku last month. The Chhatra Dal workers took out a procession from Shahbagh at around 9am in support of the strike, though they faced police bar at the campus entrance. Offices and seminars of most departments at the arts faculty were closed. The presence of students on the campus was scattered. The same situation was seen in the commerce faculty. Samia Khandaker Mohna, a third year finance student told bdnews24.com only one class was held since the morning. Many classrooms were locked, she said. Most classes were suspended in the science faculty too. Shafiqul Islam Milton, a DU student and founding member of cultural organisation 'Slogan '71', said that common students had a silent support for the strike protesting Abu Bakar's death. bdn
