 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladeshi pilgrims may travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj by sea from next year as the government is planning to reintroduce Hajj ships after a lapse of 25 years. The last time Bangladeshi pilgrims travelled over sea to Hajj was in 1985. A decision to resume operating the Hajj ships was taken at an inter-ministerial meeting held on Sunday with shipping minister Shajahan Khan in the chair. Khan told reporters after the meeting that 18,000 pilgrims would be sent for Hajj next year by ships, which would cut the cost of journey by at least 40 percent. The minister said the decision followed a proposal made by Eden Shipping Lines, a local agent of an Italian shipping company, for transport of Hajj pilgrims by ships. As per the proposal, Eden will carry 18,000 Bangladeshi pilgrims next year on six return trips for the Hajj. Khan said the meeting formed an 11-member committee, with shipping ministry joint secretary Abdus Kuddus as its head, to implement the proposal. Shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Howlader, religious affairs secretary Abdur Rab Howlader, Chittagong Port Authority chairman Reazuddin Ahmed, Department of Shipping director general Bazlur Rahman, Shipping Corporation managing director Moqsumul Hakim and representatives from the ministries of home, finance, and civil aviation and National Board of Revenue were present at the meeting.
