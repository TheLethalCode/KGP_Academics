 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An election expected in early May could leave no party in overall control of parliament after Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour Party cut the Conservatives' lead to single figures, an opinion poll suggested on Sunday. The ICM survey in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper put the Conservatives on 39 percent, down one point from last month, with Labour unchanged on 30 percent. If repeated on election day, that result would leave the main opposition party 14 seats short of a majority in the lower house, the Conservative-supporting newspaper said.

Brown has faced criticism over the war in Afghanistan, a scandal over lawmakers' expenses claims and the size of Britain's record budget deficit, which is set to exceed 12 percent of gross domestic product this year. Conservative leader David Cameron has pledged to cut the deficit sooner and faster than Labour if he wins the election. "But Brown has sought to undermine Cameron, a 43-year-old former public relations executive, by accusing him of lacking the experience to manage the economic recovery. Labour could attempt to wrong-foot the Conservatives by calling an election for April 15 rather than May 6, the date which ministers have suggested as the most likely date for the vote, the Telegraph said, citing an unnamed sour
