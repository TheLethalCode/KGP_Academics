<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 08 (bdnews24.com)  Visiting US official Judith A McHale on Monday said US scholarships were open to madrassa students in Bangladesh. Her invitation to students of the religious schools came during her visit to Uttar Badda Islamia Alia Madrassa, where a student told her that the madrassa students were seldom given a chance to go for study in the United States. "Our doors are open for you and you are welcome to the United States." She visited the Madrassa to witness US initiative of teaching English to students in religion-based educational institutions, which are madrassas in Bangladesh. The US initiative is apparently intended to counter religious extremism because it is commonly perceived and often alleged that Islamic schools breed radical fundamentalism. "Yesterday, I talked to students of Dhaka University on the possibility of studying in the United States," McHale, the US under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, told reporters after visiting the Uttar Badda Madrssa. "The US is proud to work with madrassas in Bangladesh." McHale urged the students there to reach out and take the opportunity to study in the United States. McHale, however, did not clarify or elaborate on the number of madrassa students that the US might allow. In her earlier remarks made at the Dhaka University, McHale said the US may allow 20,000 students every year to study there. The US government, through some non governmental organisations, provides the madrassa teachers with training in English language, information and communication technology, human rights, democracy and other issues to sensitise the madrassa pupils. McHale came to Dhaka on Saturday and was scheduled to leave Bangladesh this afternoon. She met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni and a number of other senior government officials
