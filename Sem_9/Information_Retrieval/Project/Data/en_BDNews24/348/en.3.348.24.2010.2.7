 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  President Md Zillur Rahman on Sunday urged private universities to offer higher education to students from insolvent rural families. He made the call while addressing the convocation ceremony of Brac University at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in Dhaka. "Students from rural families are deprived of opportunities to study at private universities because of their inability to bear the costs", he said. "This is why a large section of the people is being deprived of higher educationt," said the president, who is also the chancellor of the university. Urging the universities to be centres of free-thinking practice, he said: "You need to ensure that academic activities are not confined to books only." The president asked the Brac University to introduce information and bio technologies in its curricula because, "This will play a significant role in developing the rural economy and building a digital Bangladesh." A total of 385 students received graduate and 176 post-graduate certificates at the convocation. Harvard University professors Martha Alter Chen and Lincoln Chen were the convocation speakers. Martha Chen began her lecture in Bangla amid claps by guests and students. "I learned Bangla from women when I used to work with Brac in rural Bangladesh 35 years back," she said. She lauded Bangladesh's non-government organisations for their works in education, health and micro-credit sectors. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, University Grants Commission chairman professor Nazrul Islam, and Brac University vice-chancellor professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury and governing body chairman Fazle Hasan Abed also addressed the ceremony. Nahid said although the number of educational institutions increased substantially in the last two decades, they could not attain the required quality. He urged all concerned to raise the quality of education both at public and private levels.
