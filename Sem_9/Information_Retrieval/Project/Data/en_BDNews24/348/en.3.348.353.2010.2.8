 Keraniganj, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) Three officials of Keraniganj Police Station, including the officer-in-charge, have been sued for the death in custody of a murder suspect last week. Addu Miah, father of victim Lutfur Rahman Miah, alias Manik, filed the case with Dhaka chief judicial magistrate's court on Monday, alleging that his son was tortured to death while in police custody. But Keraniganj police claimed that he committed suicide. Keraniganj police chief Md Asaduzzaman, sub-inspectors Zahidur Rahman and Harunur Rashid have been made accused in the case. On February 1, Keraniganj police said 38-year old Manik, detained in connection with the murder of a woman, had hung himself in the toilet of police station. Police later filed a case of unnatural death. After the victims's father filed the case on Monday, magistrate Shahriar Arafat asked for the file of the previous case, filed by police. The magistrate will give an order after examining the file, Aminul Gani Tito, lawyer for Addu Miah, told bdnews24.com. Addu Miah appealed for investigation of the case through the criminal investigation department of police. Police said Manik was arrested on Jan 31 and committed suicide some time after midnight, but his father said he was arrested days ago. Keraniganj police had retrieved the burnt body of Nazma, a woman from Maniknagar under Hazratpur, on the evening of January 13. Nazma's sister, Mamtaz, filed a murder case and Manik was arrested as a suspect. b
