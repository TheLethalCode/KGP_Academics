 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)The government Wednesday tabled a bill in parliament aimed at setting up an authority which will set standards for genetically modified or GM foods in Bangladesh. State minister for science Yeafesh Osman initiated the "National Institute of Biotechnology Bill-2010" amid absence of the main opposition BNP and its allies. The GM bill's proposed biotechnology institute will mainly be dedicated to environment-friendly and sustainable technologies innovations for social and economic development. "The institute will set standards and issue certificates for genetically modified foods and genetically modified organisms," sections nine (e) of the bill says. Introduction of genetically modified foods is a very controversial issue in Bangladesh. Environmentalists have been opposing legalisation genetically modified foods in Bangladesh fearing environmental disasters. They say the genetically modified foods crops will change the genetic characters of the indigenous species of crops and plants. The genetically modified foods, developed by a US company, will also result in health hazards of the poor consumers. Introduction of the high yielding genetically modified organisms will destroy the seed security of the poor farmers as the cultivators will have buy seeds from the company, they fear. But some agriculturists have argued that the genetically modified organisms are the only option in the future to feed increasing number of populace in Bangladesh. The government is yet to announce acceptance of genetically modified organisms, according to agriculture ministry sources. HIGH-TECH PARK BILL Osman also piloted four more bills, including the Bangladesh Hi-tech Park Authority Bill-2010, which will pave the way for individuals to set up hi-tech parks across the country. Section 15 of the bill says the investors in setting up hi-tech parks will be given special tax facilities. Interested investors will have to apply to the hi-tech park authority, which will be established following passage of the bill. The proposed authority, headed by a director-general, will have to the power to lease land and floor spaces to the investors of hi-tech parks. The authority will set up a one-stop service to provide the investors with services such as selection of land, getting resident and non-resident visas, issuing work and construction permits, providing water, gas and electricity facilities and others. THREE MORE BILLS The Bangladesh National Scientific and Technical Documentation Centre Bill is aimed at turning the present documentation centre into an autonomous body for facilitating dissemination of scientific publications. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novotheatre Bill will rename the Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani Novotheatre in city after Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independent hero. Earlier, the government by an executive order renamed the Novotheatre after Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. If passed the Bangladesh Science and Technology Museum Bill will set up a science museum in Dhaka. This museum will encourage people with science culture and preserve scientific innovations.
