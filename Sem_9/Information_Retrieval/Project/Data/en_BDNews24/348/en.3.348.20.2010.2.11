<TITLE> Iran to shut down Google email service - WSJ </TITLE>

He added that Google supported free online communication, but "sometimes it is not within our control." There was no immediate comment from Tehran, where it was after midnight when the news broke. Opposition leaders have called on supporters to take to the streets on Thursday, raising the risk of renewed violence.

"While information technologies are enabling people around the world to communicate ... like never before, the Iranian government seems determined to deny its citizens access to information, the ability to express themselves freely, network and share ideas," State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. "Virtual walls won't work in the 21st century any better than physical walls worked in the 20th centur
