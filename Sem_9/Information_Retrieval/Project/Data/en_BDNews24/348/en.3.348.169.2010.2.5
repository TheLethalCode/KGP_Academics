 LONDON, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British state prosecutors charged four legislators on Friday with false accounting over alleged abuses of the parliamentary expenses system. The charges are the latest twist in a long-running scandal over politicians' expenses that has damaged Britain's ruling Labour and opposition Conservative parties in the run-up to a general election that must take place by June.

White faces six charges, centred on numerous claims for overnight expenses for staying in London when records show he was driven home and did not spend the night in London. He could not immediately be reached for comment. While only four legislators face criminal charges, the scandal over parliamentary expenses has tainted several hundred members of parliament, undermining a once-proud institution that has stood at the centre of British politics for centuries.
