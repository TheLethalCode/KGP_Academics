 Dhaka, Feb 05 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami on Friday said a move is on to outlaw Islamic politics in the country through repealing the 5th Amendment to the Constitution. "There is a deep-rooted conspiracy to make Bangladesh a failed and dependent state. Smart army officials were killed last year as part of the conspiracy. Now a move is on to outlaw Islamic politics through repealing the 5th Amendment," he told a national convention of the party's majlis-e-shura, or executive committee, at Diploma Engineers Institution in Dhaka. He urged all to be united to face the move. The Supreme Court on Feb 2 dismissed two petitions challenging the High Court's ruling that had declared illegal the 5th Amendment. Ministers on several occasions said if the High Court ruling is upheld Bangladesh would return to 1972 Constitution, which had outlawed Islamic politics. Criticising prime minister Sheikh Hasina's signing of deals with India during her recent Delhi visit, the Jamaat ameer said: "Bangladesh will be India's grazing ground by allowing it to use the two seaports." Referring to India-Bangladesh understanding on energy cooperation, the Jamat chief said: "India will get access to our national grid through import of power. The people are worried about it." The joint communique released during the prime minister's visit said Dhaka had agreed to allow Delhi to use Chittagong and Mongla ports while India agreed to export power to Bangladesh. Jammat senior nayebe ameer Abul Kalam Muhammad Yusuf, nayebe ameers Maqbul Ahmed, AKM Nazir Ahmed, Muhammad Abdus Subhan and Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Ali Mujahid, assistant secretaries general Muhammad Kamurzzaman, Abdul Quader Mollah, ATM Azharul Islam, Mojiur Rahman and Shafiqur Rahman were present at the conventio
