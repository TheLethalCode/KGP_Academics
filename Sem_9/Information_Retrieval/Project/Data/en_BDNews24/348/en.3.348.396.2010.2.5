 ISTANBUL, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States promised on Friday to provide armoured vehicles, ground penetrating radar and other equipment to NATO allies to help protect their troops in Afghanistan from increasingly deadly roadside bombs. The pledge by US Defence Secretary Robert Gates was coupled with a personal appeal for allies to send up to 4,000 more trainers and mentors to Afghanistan to help ready the country's army and police to gradually take control of security. "Today I told our allies that the United States will be able to offer them more intelligence, training and equipment including jammers, route clearance robots, surveillance systems and ground-penetrating radar," Gates told a news conference. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the US offer was an important step and could help persuade NATO states to pledge more troops and trainers, urging them to "dig deep". "We need more, a lot more," he told the news conference. Some NATO states have linked additional force commitments to more help from Washington in countering the threat posed by so-called improved explosive devices (IEDs), which kill more Western troops than any other weapon in the Taliban's arsenal. The promised equipment is expected to come mainly from Iraq as US troops withdraw. The training programme, particularly for the police, has been under-resourced for years, but has become a more urgent priority since President Barack Obama in December set the goal of gradually handing over security responsibility to the Afghans and drawing down US forces starting in July 2011. US UPS OUTPUT OF MINE-RESISTANT VEHICLES Last year US President Barack Obama ordered the deployment of 30,000 additional US troops to battle a resurgent Taliban. Allies from around 36 countries have pledged around 9,000 more, but there remains a big shortfall in numbers of trainers for Afghan forces, not least due to safety concerns. The Western death toll from IEDs has soared in Afghanistan, prompting Gates to make production of new protective vehicles for U.S. troops a top priority. The United States has ramped up production of all-terrain Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAPS), built by Oshkosh Corp., but Pentagon officials have made clear those vehicles would go to US troops in Afghanistan. Instead, NATO allies will mostly be offered surplus MRAPs and other counter-IED equipment that is in Iraq but no longer be needed by US forces there. Gates said US law required that US forces be supplied first before equipment can be offered to others, but he added: "The United States will now do whatever we can, within the limits of US law, and as soon as we can, to provide as many surplus MRAPS as possible to allies, especially those operating in high-risk areas." It is unclear how much equipment the United States will provide, and whether it will be sold, leased or given free-of-charge to NATO allies. The US military has spent more than $12.5 billion in recent years to speed output of the blast-proof MRAP trucks, first to Iraq, and now to Afghanistan. The vehicles have a v-shaped hull that offers better protection against IEDs than less armoured Humvees and other land vehic
