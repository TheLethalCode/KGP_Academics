 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Letters of Credit rose by 18.06 percent in the second half of 2009 over the corresponding period the previous year, mainly due to a huge leap in imports of food products. According to a Bangladesh Bank statement issued on Tuesday, banks opened LCs worth $13.19 billion in the July-Dec period against $11.17 billion in the same period in 2008. It said LCs for edible oil were up by a massive 1150.39 percent, pulse by 495.3 percent, sugar by 260.2 percent and wheat by 41.91 percent. The statement also said LCs for pharmaceutical machinery rose by 146 percent, plastics industry machinery by 75.42 percent and textile machinery by 39.22 percent. Experts view the increase in opening of LCs as a positive sign for the economy. "Imports of textile machinery increased despite the global recession. It was beyond my expectation," said M Asaduzzaman, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). Regarding the high rise in import of food items, he said: "Import of food items will obviously increase if we want to keep their price stable." Despite the rise in opening of LCs, LC settlements fell by 3.58 percent during the period. According to the release, LCs worth $10.71 billion were settled during July-Dec period in 2007 against $11.12 billion in the previous period.
