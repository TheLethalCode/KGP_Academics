 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)The government will assist in the development of the information technology sector by providing incentives and necessary policy support, said finance minister AMA Muhith at the inaugural of Softexpo 2010 at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Wednesday. "Infrastructures are critical for the development of the nation's IT sector. The government will provide necessary policy support and incentives for the purpose," said the finance minister. He mentioned three key challenges towards building digital Bangladeshskilled manpower, domestic demand for software and the commitment and loyalty of the youths. "We notice remarkable zeal and eagerness to learn among our youths. But they lack in commitment and loyalty to institutions, which needs to be addressed", Muhith said. Mentioning the pioneering role of the late former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria in advancing the cause of the IT sector in the past AL regime, Muhith said, "The government is committed to providing all support to the development of this sector because it's not just any minister's word, but the prime minister herself pronounced the commitment of building a 'digital Bangladesh'." IT state minister Yafes Osman said, "If we describe a district as 'digital district', it may be easier to explain to common people what we mean to say by calling our country 'digital Bangladesh'". "We'll rename the ICT Incubator 'ICT Park' and the existing incubator will be shifted to another site from its current place at Karwan Bazar's BDBL Bhaban". Annisul Huq, FBCCI president, highlighted the various problems faced by the computer software industry. "Most (95 percent) of the entrepreneurs in our IT sector are struggling to survive. We need skilled engineers and a dedicated IT Park. Also, measures must be adopted to facilitate the efforts of the newcomers in the sector," said Annis. Mentioning increased governmental assistance in the IT sector, commerce minister Faruq Khan said, "The EEF (equity and entrepreneurship fund) has an allocation of Tk 200 crore for financing ICT enterprises. The government has also given a lumpsum allocation of Tk 100 crore." Bangladesh in FY2008-09 exported software worth $33 million, which is expected to reach $38m in the current fiscal. "With governmental assistance, it will soon be possible to export software worth $500 million", said Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) president Habibullah N Karim. A total 55 organisations have taken part in the Softexpo 2010 organised by BASIS. Organisers believe that the five-day event would be able to showcase the possibilities and the development of Bangladesh's software before the enthusiastic visitors. The exposition will remain open everyday from 10am to 8pm. The admission ticket has been priced at Tk 20 but students will enjoy free admission. b
