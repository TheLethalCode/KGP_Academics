 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NASA began fueling the space shuttle Endeavour for a Monday morning launch amid concerns that low clouds over Florida's Kennedy Space Center could delay lift-off a second time.

"We're cautiously optimistic that the weather will go our way." With high humidity and a relatively chilly temperature of 48 degree Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius), crews also were concerned about the possibility of ice buildup on the tank, which was being filled with super-cold liquid propellants, Diller said. Monday morning's launch was expected to be the final launch carried out in darkness for NASA's shuttle fleet, which is scheduled to be retired after completing five missions this year. Endeavour's crew is to install the space station's last connecting hub and a dome-shaped cupola with seven windows to provide the crew with panoramic views outside the station. With those parts installed, the space station will be about 90 percent complete. Four more shuttle missions remain to deliver cargo platforms, spare parts, a Russian docking port and scientific experimen
