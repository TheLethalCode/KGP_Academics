 Sylhet, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  BNP began its first view exchange meeting with union-level leaders and workers in Sylhet division on Saturday as part of efforts to reform the party from the grassroots up. Grassroots workers and supporters of four districts of the division were attending the meeting from 10.30am at Sylhet city's Saifur Rahman auditorium, BNP divisional coordinator M Ilyas Ali told bdnews24.com. Ilyas, also the party's central organising secretary, said the last union representatives meeting was held in Sylhet in 2005. Saturday's meeting will discuss opinions aired at the 2005 meeting. Standing committee member ASM Hannan Shah was attending as chief guest. Among the central leaders were vice president Selima Rahman, Shamsher Mubin Chowdhury and joint secretary general Amanullah Aman. Selima Rahman said last month the party would hold divisional meetings with grassroots leaders in efforts to reform the party and set the future work plans. The grassroots reform programme has been modelled on the delegates conferences organised by BNP senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman in 2005, party leaders said. Nine more meetings will be held in other divisional cities. bdn
