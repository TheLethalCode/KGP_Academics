 Rajshahi, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi University erupted in violence in the early hours of Tuesday, including a gun battle between Islami Chhatra Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League cadres, that left scores injured and ended with the recovery of a dead student's body from a manhole on campus. Gunshots had rung through the university grounds in the small hours, police and witnesses said, after a night of mounting tensions between activists of Shibir, Jamaat-e-Islami's student front, and Chhatra League, aligned with the ruling Awami League. Police said Faruk Hossain, a master's student in mathematics and a Chhatra League activist, was found dead on the university grounds at around 8am. The body was recovered from a manhole beside Shah Mukdum Hall, Rajshahi Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner, Sardar Nurul Amin, told bdnews24.com. The body showed signs of stab wounds. Police also recovered four bombs and one firearm in front of Abdul Latif Hall, Amin said. He said the situation at the university remained tense through the morning with police and RAB deployed there. Violence had been mounting since the previous night, students said, as Shibir activists had beaten up two Chhatra Leaguers Kawsar Alam and Asadur Rahman as they were trying to enter Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall at around 8:30pm Monday. The two injured students were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital in critical condition. In retaliation, BCL activists reportedly beat up a Shibir activist Israfil Hossain and handed him over to police. Meanwhile, hearing reports of the attack on two Chhatra League students, the university proctor, three assistant commissioners of police and three local police chiefs, led by Rajshahi city police commissioner Sardar Nurul Amin, came rushing to the scene. Assistant proctor Prof Mustak Ahmed said measures would be taken against those involved with the incident. Assistant police commissioner MK Jahangir Hossain also said they would take necessary actions after talking with the university administration. Police then raided a number of halls at around 10pm. They arrested nine Shibir activists from Bangabandhu Hall and four from Nawab Abdul Latif Hall. But tension continued to mount as student activists of both camps took position on and around the campus, said witnesses. Deputy police commissioner Sardar Nurul Amin said Shibir activists stormed the campus at around 1am attacking several halls. Gunshots were heard on the campus from around 2am as Shibir and Chhatra League locked in battle. Of the injured students, 20 were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. bdn
