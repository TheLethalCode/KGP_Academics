<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Feb 05 (bdnews24.com)  Reconstruction of the damaged Sirajganj town protection embankment began on Friday, nearly 8 months after part of the embankment was washed by last year's flooding. Around 1000 feet of the embankment's hard point was washed away, ostensibly by the strong current caused by the massive flooding in July last year. The Taka 160 million (16 crore) project was inaugurated by the Water Development Boarad director general Habibur Rahman at Goyla under sadar upazila. The Water Board formed an expert committee last year to ascertain what exactly caused the breach of the hard point, but it has not yet submitted its report. Habibur told reporters: "We've undertaken the repairing works before knowing the exact cause of the breach taking into consideration the plight of Sijrangaj people." The 2.5 km hard point was built by Hyundai of South Korea at a cost of taka 3.3 billion (331 crore) in 1995-2000 on the west bank of the Jamuna river. Habibur said the prime minister has assured that there would be no shortage of funding for the repair and maintenance of the embankment. The Board has submitted a proposal to the water resources ministry for allocating taka 860 million, which would be required to get the embankment in its original shape. WDB Rajshahi zone chief engineer Sajjad Karim Chowdhury, Bagura zone superintending engineer Afzal Hossain and Sirajganj executive engineer Sujay Chakma were present at the inaugural ceremony.
