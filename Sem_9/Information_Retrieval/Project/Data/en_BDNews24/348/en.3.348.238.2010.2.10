 Kushtia, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  A suspected outlaw was killed in a gun battle with police and RAB in Kushtia's Doulatpur upazila Wednesday morning. Forty-year old Hobi Kobiraj was the regional leader of extremist Gano Bahini and second-in-command of the Panna Bahini, a criminal gang active around Padma's coastal belt, said Syed Mostafa Kamal, assistant police super of Kushtia. Acting on a tip off that a group of criminals were holding a meeting there, a joint team of RAB-12 and Daulatpur police launched an operation near Bajumara village at around 6am, Kamal said. Sensing the presence of law enforcers the criminals fired on them. The police-RAB team retaliated by firing shots, he said. Hobi Kabiraj was killed in the encounter but his assciates managed to escape. Police found his body on the spot and was sent to Khustia general hospital for autopsy. He was wanted in nine cases in different police stations, said Doulatpur police chief Hasan Hafizur Rahman. The joint team also recovered one light gun, 12 rounds of ammunitions, nine cocktails and two machetes from the spot. bdn
