 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Police in Bangladesh's river and haor areas once had speedboats. But these days the law enforcers are all but grounded in their efforts to chase criminals operating on the water as the police force is unable to maintain the expensive speedboats or even to purchase unwieldy but less costly trawlers to replace the faster vessels. The lack of adequate water-going vessels is also obstructing communications between police stations and regular police work in water-enclosed areas. There are 20 police stations in the country where most of their patrol areas are covered by rivers or water bodies. There are around 150 more where police have to carry out at least part of their duties on water. Boats are an absolute necessity to track down criminals, including river pirates and smugglers, in these places. "We had speedboats in water areas in the past but almost all of them have worn out," Mahbub Alam, assistant inspector general of police, told bdnews24.com on Friday. Now, police are forced to work with old rented trawlers in these areas, Alam said. The aging trawlers available for rent are not ideal, being unwieldy and often posing a safety hazard. Just earlier in the week, a police officer drowned in the Jamuna River while pursuing drug dealers. His body was still missing up to Saturday. The police department, desperate for water-going vessels of any sort, submitted a proposal to the government last year to purchase new trawlers instead of the more costly speedboats. A new speedboat costs around Tk 4 million, while a good trawler costs from Tk 400,000 to 600,000. The fuel cost is also much less for trawlers, police officials point out. Although an allocation of Tk 20 million was given to buy the vessels in the last fiscal year, it has remained unutilised due to inaction of the home ministry, say police officials. "We are in doubt whether the allocation will be put to use this year either," said a senior police officer not wishing to be named. The proposal, submitted last year, was initially returned saying that it was not a priority. It was submitted again and the fund was eventually approved, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh Police floated a tender to purchase the new trawlers in December last year. Seven companies made bids, but the process went no further. It remained stuck for lack of a go-ahead from the ministry, say police officials. Equipment is purchased for the police force in line with a Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO&E) drafted in 1982, which has barely been updated in the last 28 years. The force's manpower and equipment needs have increased manifold, with new police stations being set up since 1982, but the TO&E remains almost the same, said a top police official, not wanting to be named. "There is a huge gap between demand and allocation," he added. Asked about the situation, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikdar told bdnews24.com, "Though the fund for buying trawlers was unused last year, I hope it won't happen this year. We have asked the police force to complete the tender process in the meantime." The matter can be undertaken under special consideration, even if it does not meet with the TO&E requirements, he added. bd
