 Dhaka, Feb 06 (bdnews24.com)  The recent visit of prime minister Sheikh Hasina to India was only the first step towards building a stronger regional cooperation, but more needs to be done. This was the broad agreement among speakers at a workshop on poverty reduction through regional cooperation on Saturday. They said the true integration and harmonious relationship in the region would require persistent efforts and hard work in order to build on the foundation that the current government had laid. Mostly commending the recent tour of Sheikh Hasina and the joint communiqu issued with the Indian premiere Manmohan Singh, the speakers termed it a success. Finance minister AMA Muhith stressed the need for bilateral talks on what was said and what was eventually done to implement the words. "Bangladesh by birth is a transit country. We should seize the advantage now and strive for economic development, although we did not do so in the last 30 years." Foreign minister Dipu Moni, optimistic about further development, said there should be discussions avoiding petty rivalry. "It is unfortunate that we failed to utilise the geographical advantage that Bangladesh has", she said. Senior Awami League leader MK Alamgir, besides welcoming the joint communiqu, advocated more talks with India. He said the country's history suggested that it favoured the bilateral mode than any other platforms when it came to cooperation, economic or political. Faruq Sobhan, a former foreign secretary, stressed introducing an effective communication strategy by Bangladesh for fostering development within the region. Anisul Islam Mahmud, a former foreign minister, said Bangladesh could ask for more trade benefits since it imports textile raw materials and machinery worth around $1 billion on zero-duty every year. Former finance minister M Sayeduzzaman stressed on integrated economic activities, suggesting such projects as a mega port and a common energy market. Former finance advisor to the previous military-controlled interim regime Mirza Azizul Islam said issues needed to be prioritised based on their potential. "We should move on the issues with a win-win situation," he added. Independent parliamentarian Fazlul Azim highly appreciated the government's initiatives regarding India. He mentioned the need of making public all necessary information since the Right to Information law has been passed. Wahiduddin Mahmud, a noted ecomist and former adviser of the Caretaker governmnet, moderated the discussion.
