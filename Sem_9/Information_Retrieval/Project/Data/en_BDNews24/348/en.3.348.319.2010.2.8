 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Editors and senior journalists pressed BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Monday on the opposition's return to parliament. Khaleda in turn called on media to play its democratic role in a meeting with top newsmen. "We are here to share views, no speeches," she said in a brief welcome statement. "I'll speak with everyone and hear everyone," she told the newsmen at the start of the meeting at Hotel Lakeshore in the capital's Gulshan area. A number of editors called for a quick return to parliament, and suggested hartals and street violence be discarded as means of political protest. She referred to "persecution of journalists", specifically mentioning Amar Desh and cases filed against the Bangla paper's editor. "Going back to parliament alone will not solve the problem, media has to be allowed to play its role," she said, responding to the editors' comments. "The ruling party doesn't want us to return to parliament. Once we announced (that we'd go back) they started making provocative statements. "They know if we go and speak in the parliament, they will be in trouble." On India, she said she would have gone and met the prime minister had she been invited to discuss the India trip before Hasina went to Delhi. "If such an invitation was made and I hadn't gone, then you would have had reason to criticise me," Khaleda, leader of the opposition, said. Khaleda's BNP has been criticised by the government for airing serious objections to Hasina's recent India trip outside parliament, which the opposition has been boycotting for months. b
