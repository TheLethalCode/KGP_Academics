 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun said on Wednesday that action will be taken against the law enforcers if they are found guilty of negligence in connection with the murder of a Rajshahi University student on Tuesday. She warned that any law enforcement personnel flouting her orders would have to face serious consequences. Her warnings came after a meeting with high officials at her Secretariat office. In the meeting, Sahara claimed that the law and order situation is better than any time in the past even though there has been a spate of killing across the country in recent times including murders of two university students and a ward commissioner in the capital in a matter of week. Faruk Hossain was killed during a clash between Bangladesh Chhatara League and Islami Chhatra Shibir at Rajshahi University in the early hours of Tuesday.

The minister said investigation is underway to find out the reasons behind the RU violence. She said state minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku left for Rajshai and the police chief had already visited the campus. B
