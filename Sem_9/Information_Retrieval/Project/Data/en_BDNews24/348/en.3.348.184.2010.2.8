 KARACHI, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam will not travel with a new-look team for two Twenty20 internationals against England later this month in Dubai. Former Test captain Alam, who has a two-year contract with the board that does not end until October this year, faces an inquiry after the disastrous tour of Australia. Alam has been replaced for the matches by former Test batsman Ijaz Ahmed, who has been given the title of batting and fielding coach. The 14-man squad announced by selectors will be led by all-rounder Shoaib Malik but does not include wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, Salman Butt or pace bowler Muhammad Asif. Shahid Afridi was named in the squad but will not be available for the first match on Feb 19 as he is serving a two-match ban for ball-tampering against Australia earlier this month. Asif was not selected because of his detention in Dubai for 19 days in 2008 for possession of hashish and subsequent entry-ban. "We tried to get clearance for him from the authorities in Dubai so that he could play as he is our key bowler but it didn't work out," a spokesman for the Pakistan Cricket Board said. Pakistan have also recalled all-rounders Abdul Razzaq and Yasir Arafat and play the second match on Feb. 20. Squad: Imran Nazir, Imran Farhat, Khalid Latif, Umar Akmal, Shoaib Malik (captain), Shahid Afridi, Yasir Arafat, Abdul Razzaq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Umar Gul, Muhammad Talha, Fawad Ala
