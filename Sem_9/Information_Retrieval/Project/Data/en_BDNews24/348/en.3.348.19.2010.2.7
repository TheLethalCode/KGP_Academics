 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday issued a suo moto rule on the government asking why traffic law was not being enforced in the city, following two road accident fatalities involving children earlier in the week. The court bench comprising justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin issued the rule after two lawyers Monjil Morshed and Md Shahjahan drew attention of the court to media reports on the recent deaths of two children who were killed in separate road accidents within 24 hours. Hamim Sheikh, a six-year old student of Wills Little Flower School, was crushed to death under the wheels of a bus in front of the school at Kakrail in Dhaka Wednesday morning. The following day a seven-year old girl Sumi met the same fate in front of the prime minister's office. The court has given the home secretary, inspector general of police, DMP joint commissioner (traffic), Bangladesh Transport Authority chairman and deputy commissioners of Dhaka city's four traffic zones three weeks to reply to the rule. It also asked the government to submit before it monthly progress reports on traffic law enforcement with the first to be issued within 30 days of the order. It furthervasked the government to inform the court what measures have been taken to set up speed-control devices to prevent road accidents, as ordered in a suo moto rule in February 2008. The High Court had then asked the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority to introduce Speed Governor Seals, a mechanical device for controlling the speed of motorised vehicles, and submit a report to the court on June 29. bdne
