 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid expunged a statement of ruling Awami League MP Sk Abu Baker on Wednesday after he commented on the High Court's order to create a new warrant of precedence. The Narail MP made several comments referring to the High Court order while delivering his speech on the president's parliamentary address. The High Court on Feb 4 ordered the government to frame a warrant of precedence placing the district judges above chiefs of army, navy and air force. The Supreme Court on Feb 8 stayed the high court order for six weeks. Among his comments, Abu Baker said the original warrant of precedence was framed by an elected government (Awami League) in 1974. Speaker Abdul Hamid termed Baker's comment on the judiciary a "violation of the Rules of Procedure" and expunged his statement. Hamid was chairing the session while Baker delivered his comments before Asr prayer recess, but did not intervene then. He gave his ruling on the issue after Maghrib recess. "The state has three organslegislative, executive and judiciary. Each of the organs will work in their respective arena not intervening into others' businesses," said Hamid in his ruling. "But some MPs while delivering speeches on the president's address made some comments about the judiciary. "I remind the MPs not to make comment on any of the issues under the court's disposal," he said. Hamid said parliament's Rules of Procedure did not permit such practices.
