<TEXT>
 Noakhali, Feb 06 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member Goyeshwar Chandra Roy says the government is afraid of the opposition party's presence in parliament, as evinced by recent comments by ruling party leaders. "Whenever the opposition party announces joining parliament, the prime minister and her ruling party's senior leaders make indecent remarks over the grave and coffin of (late) president Ziaur Rahman." Such behaviour by the government's stands in way of the rule of democracy, he observed, speaking as chief guest at a party programme in Noakhali. Local party leaders arranged the programme to felicitate former BNP MP for Noakhali-4 who was made a joint secretary general of the central committee. "The government is out to claim its own interests rather than work for people's welfare and development though they came to power through a pledge to people promising a 'Charter for Change'." "The prime minister is misleading people that her visit to India was significant. The treaties and MoUs that were made with India are like pawning the country's interests if not a total sell out," said the BNP leader. The money that is being spent to import power from India is enough to install power plants anew in the country, he also claimed. "It is not good in any way to depend on India for a necessity like power," he added. bdn
