 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun on Sunday urged student activists loyal to both the ruling and opposition parties to call a truce on Dhaka University campus and others countrywide. "No matter who is involved in the death of a DU student, he will not be able to get away with it," Sahara told reporters at her office after a monthly evaluation meeting of the ministry. The minister termed DU student Abu Bakar Siddique's death on Feb 3, following pro-ruling party Chhatra League clashes the day before, "deplorable" and "unacceptable." Asked what initiatives the ministry was taking after Abu Bakar's death, Sahara replied that a case was filed, investigations were underway "and no one will be able to escape punishment". Regarding organisational action against the Bangladesh Chhatra League activists involved in the factional clashes on Feb 2, the minister said, "Necessary action will be taken against them." She also said student organisations aligned to both the ruling party and the opposition "must come forward to establish a genial atmosphere on campus." Last month, at least 20 students were also injured in armed clashes of the pro-opposition Jatyatabadi Chhatra Dal. bdne
