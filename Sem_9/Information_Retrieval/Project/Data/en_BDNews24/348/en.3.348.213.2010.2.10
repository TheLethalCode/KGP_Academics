<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The UK parliament was told about the necessity of urgent assistance for Bangladesh to fight climate change on Tuesday. Bangladesh was the main topic of discussion in the British parliament during a half hour debate before the house was adjourned for the day. The discussion brought about some crucial issues and challenges for Bangladesh. Colin Challen, head of the all-party climate change group of the UK parliament, initiated the discussion and pointed out that 'even a 1 metre sea-level rise would displace 30 million people'. Referring to the amount often quoted during the Copenhagen climate summit, Challen said, "It would be interesting to learn how much of the $30 billion of early climate change finance proposed by the Copenhagen accord will find its way to Bangladesh." Voicing a common demand of the poor countries that climate change funds must be over and beyond the existing pledges made by developed countries, the Labour MP from Morley and Rothwell of West Yorkshire stressed, "We have to be open and transparent about this; we must not count the new money twice." It is commonly mentioned that poor countries like Bangladesh, with low greenhouse gas emissions, were not behind climate change and global warming. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap the sun's heat causing the temperatures to rise. It is estimated that unless global gas emissions are not reduced substantially then it could mean irreversible climate change leading to extreme weather including more frequent and intense cyclones, floods and droughts. Higher temperatures would cause polar ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise. With a dense population along its low lying coastal betl, Bangladesh is said to be one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts. Bob Spink, an independent MP, pointed out that Bangladesh's annual per capita carbon emissions were a quarter of a tonne, which that of the UK was about 10 tonnes and that of the US was about 28 tonnes. "Bangladesh did not cause the problem, and it is not fuelling the problem now. We did and we are, so we must pay. That is the clear message." Michael Foster, under-secretary of state for international development acknowledged that by 2050 Bangladesh could have some 70 million people affected by floods each year, 8 million affected by droughts. Also relating to a probably one-metre sea level rise, Foster noted that a fifth of Bangladesh could be flooded by the end of the century. "In other words, an area 18 times the size of Greater London would be under water  land that people depend on for shelter and for their livelihoods. All of that could happen within the lifetime of our grandchildren." Challen mentioned a report, 'Climate change equity: is it a plan, an aspiration or a fashion statement?', jointly published with Bangladesh's all party parliamentary group, headed by Saber Hossain Chowdhury, and pointed out that equity was important in climate change. Challen also quetioned the rationale behind proposing $100 billion by 2020 as assistance to poor countries. Challen said it was not clear how that figure was arrive
