 NAGPUR, India, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis struck his third hundred in five Tests and shared a double century stand with Hashim Alma to put South Africa in control of the first Test against India on Saturday. Kallis crafted a magnificent 159 and added an unbroken 285 for the third wicket with Amla, who scored 115, to help the visitors reach 291 for two after winning the toss. Left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan dismissed openers Ashwell Prince for nought and skipper Graeme Smith for six in successive overs to reduce the tourists to six for two before Kallis orchestrated the recovery with his 34th test hundred.

Amla batted conservatively before opening out to reach his eighth Test hundred, giving the South Africans the perfect platform as they seek a rare series victory in India to reclaim the number one test ranking. Amla hit 11 fours in his steady knock, surviving a chance to Murali Vijay at slip on 61. India, already without experienced batsmen Rahul Dravid, Vangipurappu Laxman and Yuvraj Singh through injury, suffered a further blow when Rohit Sharma, called up as cover for Laxman, suffered an ankle injury in the warm-up. Wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha was handed an unexpected debut and will join another debutant batsman, Subramaniam Badrinath, in an inexperienced middle o
