 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Nine percent of children enrolled at primary school each year never attend a single class, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said Saturday. On top of that, about 48 percent of students drop out at primary level and almost the same ratio of students give up at secondary level, the minister said. He blamed poverty and lack of awareness of guardians for the huge drop-out rate. Nahid was speaking at the National Museum at a book launch of an omnibus edition of novelist Kazi Imdadul Haque's works. "Forty-two percent of registered students did not sit for the recent SSC examinations, though they registered for the exams in class nine," he said. Nahid also said it is not possible to appoint meritorious students as school teachers since the government cannot provide them suitable financial, professional or social status. But, he said, the government is working on those matters. On the new education policy that the government is formulating, Nahid said: "Six policies so far have been formulated by successive governments of Bangladesh, but none implemented." "We want to create such a policy that will not need any amendments. For this reason, we have asked for opinions from every walk of people ahead of taking any final decision." The minister said that although the government is facing some hurdles in finalising the policy, it would be implemented. Imdadul Haque's famous novel 'Abdullah' was previously included in the secondary school curriculum. Nahid said the novel should be reintroduced as it depicts a secular, progressive and modern society. Among others, former BUET vice-chancellor professor Iqbal Mahmud, writer Syed Abul Maksud, Dhaka University Bangla professor Saumitrya Shekhar also spoke at the book launch. bdne
