 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The meeting of the next Bangladesh Development Forum will be held in Dhaka on Feb 15-16, four and a half years after the last one took place in 2005. The forum, consisting of donores and other development partners, is convened every two years to discuss how the aid money can be spent in order to ensure optimal development of the country. Economic relations division (ERD) secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told a press conference in Dhaka on Monday that the revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper would be presented at the forum. He said the meeting would be divided into six session, which will discuss such topics as  good governance, energy and power, agriculture, food security and water resources, environment and climate, communications and transport, and digital Bangladesh and information technology. The meeting of development partners, formerly held under Paris Consortium, used to take place in the French capital until 2002. Since 2003 the venue was shifted to Dhaka. The last BDF meet was held in November, 2005 and another was scheduled for Nov, 2007 but was cancelled because of political reasons. ERD and Local Consultative Group (LCG), a coalition of local representatives of the development partners, are organising this year's meet. LCG executive committee chairman and DFID resident representative Chris Austin was present at the press conference.
