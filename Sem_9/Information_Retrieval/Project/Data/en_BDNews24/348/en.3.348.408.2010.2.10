 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Charge framing against ruling Awami League's former general secretary Abdul Jalil in a tax evasion case deffered once again on Wednesday. The Dhaka special judge's court of ANM Bashirullah extended the time upon a petition filed by Jalil's advocates on the ground that he is out of the country. Earlier on Jan 18, the same court extended the time for charge framing upon another petition by Jalil and fixed the date on Feb 10. The AL leader secured deferral of the hearing several times in th past through similar petitions. The National Board of Revenue deputy commissioner Bazlur Rahman Khan filed the case on Oct 15 last year accusing Jalil of not paying income tax worth Tk 4 lakh by concealing income of about Tk 54 lakh. The court, on the same day, issued an arrest warrant against Jalil, who secured bail three days later. Additional public prosecutor Shah Alam Talukdar told bdnews24.com that the defendant's bail would end on Monday. The charges against Jalil include concealing bank revenue information, amount of money in his and his wife's accounts, credit card information and not having income tax documents. bdnew
