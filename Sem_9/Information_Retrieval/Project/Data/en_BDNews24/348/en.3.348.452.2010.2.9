 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday issued a rule on the government on upkeep of the Central Shaheed Minar at the Dhaka University campus in the capital. A bench of Justice Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Justice Naima Haider issued the rule, upon a writ petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a local NGO, asking why actions should not be taken to protect the Shaheed Minar's sanctity. The cabinet secretary, cultural affair's secretary, liberation war affairs secretary, Dhaka University vice chancellor, Dhaka mayor, DCC chief engineer and architect were asked to answer the High Court rule within 10 days. Advocate Manjil Morshed argued for the petitioner while deputy attorney general Mostafa Zaman represented the government. bdnews
