 Dhaka, Feb 09 (bdnews24.com)Golam Mohammad, currently serving as the Bangladesh ambassador in Jordan, has been appointed envoy to Indonesia, a foreign ministry statement said Tuesday. A career diplomat, Mohammad's appointment will fill the post, which has been lying vacant since June 2008 when Salma Khan returned home after serving nearly two years. Mrs Khan, a former civil servant and wife of a BNP leader, was appointed ambassador in Jakarta on contract in the middle of 2006. The immediate past caretaker government appointed Syed Fahim Munaim, then press secretary to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, to replace her, though he was unable to take up the post. Golam Mohammad joined the foreign service in 1982. He earlier served in Australia, Pakistan (Karachi), Egypt and the UAE (Dubai). Mohammad had his post graduate degree in Economics from Dhaka University. He has a son and two daughters.
