 Sylhet, Feb 5(bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith on Friday alleged that some banking systems patronised global terrorism. Muhith said that the government would invest more to make the entire industry more responsible, transparent and accountable. The finance minister was speaking as chief guest at the launch of a conference on tackling money laundering at the Sylhet branch of Bangladesh Bank on Friday. "Bangladesh is the first country to formulate a law to prevent money laundering," Muhith said adding that Bangladesh Bank would lead the fight. Chaired by deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, Ziaul Hasan Siddiqui, governor Atiur Rahman delivered a speech as special guest. In his statement, Atiur said, the government, along with Bangladesh Bank, had undertaken various steps backed by UN and donor agencies. Money Laundering Preventive Law-2009 covers bribes and corruption apart from other crimes, he said. A total of 40 recommendations have been formulated in preventing money laundering and nine for preventing global terrorism funding, he said Money laundering and funding terrorism are impediments to socio-economic development of the country, said the central bank governor. Failure to check money laundering might lead to liquidity crisis which will ultimately increase the amount of unpaid loan and strain correspondent banking relationship, he said. If any bank or financial institution gets involved in money laundering or funding terrorism, it tarnishes not only its goodwill but also the image of the country, he said As a result, the foreign investors lose their interest in investment which deprive the country of revenues, he said. bdnews
