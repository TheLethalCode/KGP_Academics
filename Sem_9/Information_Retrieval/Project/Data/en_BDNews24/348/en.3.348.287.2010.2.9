<TITLE> Hosts grab dream football gold </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh were crowned SAG football kings after a thumping 4-0 win against Afghanistan at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. Two goals in either half capped a brilliant performance by the hosts and as soon as the final whistle was blown the players went on a lap of honour carrying the national flag. The result ended an 11-year wait for the elusive gold. Bangladesh last won the title at the Kathmandu Games in 1999. It also presented the country's 18th gold medal of the 11th South Asian Games. Atiqur Rahman Mishu put Bangladesh ahead in the 18th minute with a header. Enamul Haque doubled the lead with another powerful header in the 32nd minute. Abdul Baten Kollol found the net in the 69th minute with a brilliant piece of finishing that left the Afghan players in total disarray and Touhidul Islam Sabuj smashed home the fourth goal three minutes before the end. From the start Bangladesh appeared like they came with a plan while Afghanistan, who stunned powerhouse India with a draw in the preliminary stage, were totally out of their depth against the speedy play of their opponents. On way to the final, Bangladesh thrashed Bhutan 4-0, Nepal 3-0 and the Maldives 1-0 in the group matches and India 1-0 in the semi-finals. The dream gold more than made up for Bangladesh's painful semi-final exit from the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship at the hands of India on home soil two months ago. b
