Things can go one way or another," Ribery said. "I think I'll know before the end of March... I want my mind to be free to play the World Cup," he added. "I want to play with the most competitive team as possible, the one that will give me a chance to win as many trophies as possible, whether it is Bayern or another. I'll be 27 in April and my career is at a turning point." Ribery has just returned to action after three months out through injury and expect to be back at his best in about 10 days.
