 AMAZON, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- Aerial images show the remains of a mysterious ancient civilization in Brazil's Amazon forest. TV AND WEB RESTRICTIONS~ NO ACCESS BRAZIL ~ The recent discovery of huge geometric earthworks in Brazil's Amazon forest has baffled scientists around the world. New aerial images reveal vast archeological remains of a mysterious ancient civilization dating back to 200 AD, near Brazil's border with Bolivia. Some experts have linked the findings to the legendary civilization of El Dorado, which drew various Spanish explorers into the jungle without success. Alceu Renzi, a paleontologist at Brazil's Federal University of Acre, is examining the site. SOUNDBITE: Alceu Ranzi, Paleontologist, saying (Portuguese) "(The markings were made) some 200, 300 years before (Portugese navigator Pedro Alvares) Cabral (arrived in Brazil)". Researchers estimate only 10 percent of the markings have been spotted so far. Renzi says the structures, made up of ditches 36 feet wide and several feet deep, were likely used in religious rituals. SOUNDBITE: Alceu Ranzi, Paleontologist, saying (Portuguese) "We believe the sites were used for religious rituals due to its elaboration, it's monumentality, it's area." Anthropologists believe the ancient civilization had a population of about 60,000, who lived in clusters of towns and smaller villages, connected by complex road networks. They believe the inhabitants were killed by European colonists, and disease. Many questions, however, still remain and scientists say they need more evidence to truly understand this unknown Amazon cult
