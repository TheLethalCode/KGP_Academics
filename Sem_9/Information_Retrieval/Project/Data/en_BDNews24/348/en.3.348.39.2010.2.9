<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku said Tuesday the government was giving 'top priority' to the killing of Rajshahi University student Faruk Hossain, an activist of the pro-ruling party Chhatra League, whose body was recovered on the campus that morning. Tuku told reporters at the home ministry in the afternoon that he had directed law enforcers to net all suspects from around the campus and ordered inspector general of police Noor Mohammad to go to Rajshahi and take measures in consultation with law enforcers there. Police recovered Faruk's body after the university erupted in overnight violence, including a gun battle between Islami Chhatra Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League, that left scores injured on campus. Gunshots had rung through the university grounds in the small hours, police and witnesses said, after a night of mounting tensions between activists of Shibir, Jamaat-e-Islami's student front, and Chhatra League, aligned with the Awami League. Police said the body of Faruk Hossain, a master's student in mathematics and a Chhatra League activist, was recovered from a manhole beside Shah Mukdum Hall and showed signs of stab wounds. The state minister condemned the attack on Chhatra League by Shibir activists. "One student is dead. We have also heard another remains missing. Some 17-18 students are under treatment." Tuku, blaming 'a certain quarter' for destabilising the country, said: "The student wing of an anti-liberation party is carrying out criminal activities with others just at a time when we have begun the process of trying war criminals." "The process started after the killing of Bangabandhu. The government has executed the verdict. The process of trying war criminals has also begun." He said the government would continue trial of war criminals defying all impediments. CALLS FOR 'CAMPUS TRUCE' Just two days ago, home minister Sahara Khatun urged student activists loyal to both the ruling and opposition parties to call a truce at Dhaka University and other campuses countrywide after a student died following Chhatra League clashes at DU. The minister termed DU student Abu Bakar Siddique's death on Feb 3 "deplorable" and "unacceptable." Regarding organisational action against the Chhatra League activists involved in the factional clashes on Feb 2, the minister had said "necessary action" would be taken. She also said student organisations aligned to both the ruling party and the opposition "must come forward to establish a genial atmosphere on campus." Last month, at least 20 students were also injured in armed clashes of the pro-BNP Jatyatabadi Chhatra Dal. bd
