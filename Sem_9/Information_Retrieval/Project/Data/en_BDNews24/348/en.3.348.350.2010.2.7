 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Former primary education adviser Jahanara Begum secured bail from a Dhaka court on Sunday in a corruption case. Senior special judge ANM Bashirullah awarded the bail on a Tk 1 lakh bond and sent the case to special judge Md Nasiruddin for charge framing on February 18. The court in the order mentioned that her bail prayer was considered, as she was a woman and aged over 70 years. The same court had refused Jahanara's bail and ordered her to jail on January 30, when she surrendered to the court in the case accusing her of concealing wealth information from the Anticorruption Commission.
