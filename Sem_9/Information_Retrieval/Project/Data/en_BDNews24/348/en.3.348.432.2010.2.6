 MAKHACHKALA, Russia, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The police chief of the southern Russian city of Makhachkala was shot dead in his car on Friday, one of 16 people killed in a string of attacks in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus. At least six insurgents and five Russian troops were killed in gun battles in the mountains of Chechnya, while five people were killed in attacks in Makhachkala, capital of neighbouring Dagestan, officials said.

Six insurgents were killed on Thursday in fighting nearby, Kadyrov's office said.
