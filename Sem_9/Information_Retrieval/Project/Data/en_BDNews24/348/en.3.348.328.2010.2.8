 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has summoned Jamuna Builders' managing director Shamim Islam on Feb 22 in a contempt of court suit filed by Rajuk. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin gave the order on Monday. It also asked Islam to explain in 10 days why measures should not be taken against him for the contempt of court. Rajuk, the capital development authority, filed the suit against the managing director on Sunday accusing him of misinterpreting a High Court ruling that had dismissed a Jamuna Group appeal against a demolition notice served on the Future Park shopping mall being constructed near the Baridhara diplomatic enclave. Rajuk lawyer AFM Mezbahuddin told journalists that the managing director of Jamuna Builder's Ltd, owning company of the shopping mall, appealed against the High Court ruling where he mentioned "I filed the appeal as per the direction of the court". "But in reality there was no direction for appeal in the High Court ruling  Such a wrong presentation of the ruling is cause for contempt of court," the Rajuk lawyer said. Rajuk initially served the demolition notice on Jan 17 against the Jamuna Builders asking it to knock down unauthorised top floors of the sprawling Future Park development complex within seven days. Jamuna Group immediately petitioned the High Court, challenging the notice but the court dismissed the petition on Feb 4. A day after the dismissal Rajuk began demolishing the unapproved top floors. But the demolition work came to a halt as Shamim immediately sought to appeal against the High Court's dismissal. Appellate Division chamber justice Md Muzammel Hossain sent the appeal to the regular bench on Sunday. Ahsanul Karim, lawyer for Jamuna Group, told reporters that as they did not get approval to submit the appeal on Feb 4, which fell on a Thursday, the last working day of the week, it was not in Sunday's cause list. b
