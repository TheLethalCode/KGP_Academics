 Golam Mortuza Antu Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  With the upcoming Dhaka city elections, ward commissioners say they are concerned about their personal security as many of them, aligned with the main opposition BNP, will be contesting in the polls. The gunning down of Ward 70 commissioner by unknown assailants on Tuesday night has served to heighten their anxiety. Ward-62 commissioner Mir Ashraf Ali Azam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday: "I really am frightened. A popular commissioner like Hazi Ahmed Hossain was murdered." Mentioning that Ahmed is the fifth commissioner to have been killed in recent years, Azam said: "What guarantee is there that I will not be killed in a few days?" Since the last Dhaka City Corporation elections in April 2002, five ward commissioners have met with violent deaths, while another died in police custody. According to city corporation records, the slain commissioners are Syedur Rahman Newton of Ward-8, Binoy Sarker Bina of Ward-72, KM Ahmed Raju of Ward-44, Shahadat Hossain Shikder of Ward-90 and Hazi Ahmed Hossain of Ward-70. Ward-16's commissioner Qayum Khan died in police custody during the past caretaker government regime. Azam said: "All we want from the government now is security for our lives." Another commissioner and BNP leader told bdnews24.com: "We have enemies both in our localities and beyond, enmity due to getting the party nomination and enmity from contesting in the polls." However a police official, not wishing to disclose his identity, alleged that the killings might have some other motive. "These ward commissioners are in one manner or other related to the crime world," he said. "It's an open secret. Some of them were criminals before, some now harbour criminals and some are criminal godfathers of their areas. They control domination, extortion, tender manipulation, land grabbing and other criminal activities in their areas," alleged the police official. During the last caretaker regime's anti-graft crack down, at least 15 ward commissioners went to jail on charges of corruption. Another 30 went underground for months, neglecting their ward duties, to avoid imprisonment. Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief AKM Shahidul Haque told bdnews24.com: "We are aware of the upcoming ward commissioner elections. We will hold talks with the contenders. If they have any demands about security issues, we will look into them and try to fulfil them." He added: "We are trying to apprehend those involved in the ones killings. We are continuously working on the cases. We are alert to prevent any further occurrences." bd
