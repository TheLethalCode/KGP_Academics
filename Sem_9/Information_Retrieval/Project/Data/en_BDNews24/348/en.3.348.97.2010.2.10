 RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho's hopes of a place in Brazil's World Cup squad faded on Tuesday when he was not picked by coach Dunga for their last scheduled warm-up against Ireland in London next month. Robinho, who has returned to Santos on loan from his English Premier League side Manchester City to try to secure a place in the Brazil squad, was included among four forwards. Ronaldinho, a member of the 2002 World Cup-winning team who last played for Brazil in April 2009, has played well for AC Milan lately and expectations had been high of a recall. "Every player has chances (of a place in the squad). At this moment, he (Ronaldinho) isn't part of it," Dunga said in typically dry fashion after naming a 22-man squad at Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) headquarters. Irritated by persistent questions from reporters about the 29-year-old former Barcelona playmaker, Dunga said: "That's already the same question a fifth time. I think that until the day of the final (World Cup) list, all (players) have a chance, all are in play." The March 2 match at Arsenal's Emirates stadium will be Brazil's first of the year after an impressive 2009 during which they finished top of the South American World Cup qualifying group and won the Confederations Cup. Brazil, favourites to win their sixth world crown in South Africa in the finals starting on June 11, are in Group G with North Korea, Ivory Coast and Portugal. MAY ANNOUNCEMENT At a news conference dominated by the subject of Ronaldinho, Dunga said he planned to name his 23-man World Cup squad, which was almost settled with few places open, in May even though the FIFA deadline is in June. "At the moment, there's no room for surprises... It's a job done over three and a half years," he said, dropping a hint as to why Ronaldinho is not in the squad. "You want big names. For us there is no big or small (name). Sometimes there's a guy with huge potential and you want him (in) but we, as trainers, have to see what happens on the pitch." Dunga's biggest worry is at left back where a number of candidates have been tried, including Barcelona right back Daniel Alves. This time Dunga is giving Olympique Lyon's Michel Bastos another chance to prove himself and Gilberto, a reserve at the 2006 World Cup in Germany who has been playing in midfield for Cruzeiro. Dunga said that in the final analysis experience would count. "A player who comes in near the end (of our preparations) is unlikely to fit in. It is very difficult to play in the national team. Adapting to the national team takes time and time is what we don't have." Squad: Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter Milan), Doni (AS Roma) Defenders: Maicon (Inter Milan), Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Gilberto (Cruzeiro), Michel Bastos (Olympique Lyon), Lucio (Inter Milan), Luisao (Benfica), Juan (AS Roma), Thiago Silva (AC Milan) Midfielders: Elano (Galatasaray), Felipe Melo (Juventus), Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos), Josue (VfL Wolfsburg), Julio Baptista (AS Roma), Kaka (Real Madrid), Kleberson (Flamengo), Ramires (Benfica) Forwards: Luis Fabiano (Sevilla), Robinho (Santos), Adriano (Flamengo), Nilmar (Villar
