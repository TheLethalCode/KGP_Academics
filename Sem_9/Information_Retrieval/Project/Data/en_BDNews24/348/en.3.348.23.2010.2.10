<TITLE> Ruling MP loses Bhola-3 seat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid has declared the Bhola-3 constituency void. He made the announcement in parliament on Wednesday following a gazette notification from the Election Commission, which declared the seat of Awami League MP Mohammad Jashimuddin vacant on Sunday. The High Court on Feb 26 last year ruled that Jashim's nomination was unlawful following a petition by BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed. Jashim moved the Supreme Court to overturn the verdict but the apex court upheld the HC ruling. Electoral law stipulates that none can contest the polls in three years from the date of retirement and in five years after compulsory retirement from any public office. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2004, and contested the general election in December 2008. bdne
