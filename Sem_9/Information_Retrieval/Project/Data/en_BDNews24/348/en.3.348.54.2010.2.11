<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by Jamuna Builders challenging a previous High Court order for demolition of unauthorised storeys of the company's Future Park shopping mall in the city. A full Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim gave the order on Thursday. The order means there is no bar for Rajuk to demolish the unapproved four floors, Rajuk lawyer AFM Mesbahuddin told reporters after the ruling. Rajuk had issued a demolition notice on January 17, asking the Jamuna Future Park authorities to knock down within seven days the unauthorised top four floors of the sprawling 10-storey complex at Bashundhara. Jamuna Group immediately petitioned the High Court, challenging the Rajuk notice, but the court dismissed the petition on February 3. Rajukthe capital development authorityitself began demolishing the unapproved floors of the building the following day. But the demolition work came to a halt as Jamuna Builders immediately sought to appeal against the High Court's dismissal of the earlier petition. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Muzammel Hossain sent the appeal to the regular bench on February 7.
