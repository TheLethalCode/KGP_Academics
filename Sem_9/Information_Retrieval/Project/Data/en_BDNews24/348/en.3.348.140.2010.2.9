<TITLE> Nurses' strike on as talks fail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brahmanbaria, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Nurses' strike entered its third day on Tuesday as talks with Brahmanbaria Sadr Hospital authorities failed. This has apparently led to worsening the miseries of the patients, many of whom have already left the hospital seeking healthcare elsewhere. Angry at a BCL leader beating up one of their colleagues, the nurses have demanded justice and trial of the Chhatra League leader. The nurses allege that Ashikul Alam Babul, a leader of Bangladesh Chhatra League, student wing of the ruling Awami League, beat up Piyara Begum for not using an injection of a certain pharmaceutical company that Babul represents. Deputy commissioner Haiul Qaiyum and superintendent of police Mokhlesur Rahman sat with agitating nurses at noon. Both the officials assured the nurses of stern action against the culprit and requested them to call off the strike. Rahman also guaranteed police watch round the clock at the hospital. But, nurses insisted on Babul's arrest first. "This strike will go on sine die until Babul is arrested," said Ferdousi Begum, president of Brahmanbaria district branch of Bangladesh Diploma Nurses' Association. However, nurses will work at the emergency wards, she said. Piyara's allegations were noted in a case lodged on Monday night, said officer-in-charge of Brahmanbaria Sadar police station Hamidul Islam. There are also allegations of obstructing the hospitals activities against Babul, a former vice president of Brahmanbaria Government College. bdnews24
