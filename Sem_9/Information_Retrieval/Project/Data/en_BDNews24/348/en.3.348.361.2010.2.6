<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Biman Airlines launched its new non-stop Dhaka-London service on Saturday. The flight took off with 311 passengers and crew at 9:15am, Biman director (administration) Md Aminul Haque told bdnews24.com. The national flag carrier has been operating five Dhaka-London flights a week via Dubai. Biman will now run two direct flights a week, Saturday and Tuesday, with a newly acquired Boeing 777-200ER, while an Airbus-320 will continue to operate three days a week via Dubai. Direct flights will be increased to three a week, Haque said, adding: "We believe the direct flight will be a profitable one with the high number of passengers on the Dhaka-London route." "We have not run a direct scheduled flight on the Dhaka-London route in the past," he said. A number of direct flights did operate on a temporary basis, Haque said. Currently Biman connects to 16 international and 3 domestic destinations with its fleet of four DC-10s, two Airbus-320s, two F-28s, two Boeing 747s and a new 777-200ER and 737-800NG. In 2008, Biman signed a deal with Boeing for four 777s, four 787s and two 737s at a cost of $2.5 billion. Last week the national carrier emerged with a major makeover with a new logo and livery and two New Generation Boeing aircraft, a 777-200ER and 737-800NG, being added to its fleet. b
