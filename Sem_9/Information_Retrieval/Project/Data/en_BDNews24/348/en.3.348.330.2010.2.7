 WARSAW, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European champions Spain will face Czech Republic, Scotland, Lithuania and Liechtenstein in the qualifying competition for the Euro 2012 championship after being the last team pulled out of the bowl at Sunday's draw. World champions Italy will face two 2010 World Cup finalists in Serbia and Slovenia in their group which also includes Northern Ireland, Estonia and Faroe Islands. Germany, runners-up to Spain in the Euro 2008 final, face neighbours Austria as well as Turkey in what should be a straightforward group for them to negotiate into the finals in Poland and Ukraine in two years' time. England will renew their old rivalry with Wales after being drawn together, while France, runners-up in the 2006 World Cup final, face a challenge from Romania, Bosnia, Belarus, Albania and Luxembourg. The qualifying competition starts in September and concludes with final-place playoffs in November
