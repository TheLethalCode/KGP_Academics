<TEXT>
 Tanim Ahmed Dhaka, Feb 06 (bdnews24.com)  The world's largest retailer Walmart is considering a plan to procure 20 percent of its apparels from Bangladesh worth over $2 billion. If the plan materialises, it could raise Bangladesh's annual exports by more than a billion dollars, which was about $15.5 billion last year. Details of the plan discussed between top executives of Walmart and a delegation of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) emerged hours after the Walmart International CEO had left the country on Friday afternoon. According to a source who participated in the breakfast meeting held at Radisson hotel in utmost secrecy, the retailer is planning a major move to Bangladesh turning it into one of its main sourcing locations. The source said even the proposition of the figure (20 percent) 'came as a surprise' to us as it would have a big impact on the entire industry. Currently Bangladesh's RMG exports to the US market are worth just about $4 billion, of which Walmart alone accounts for just over $1 billion. "Their proposal would mean more than doubling Walmart's purchase, which itself is quite substantial," said the source pointing out that the move promised exciting developments. Accordingly, Walmart's local office in Dhaka is being completely restructured with new staff from abroad including a new company representative. Himself a garment factory owner as well as a top BGMEA office bearer, the source told bdnew24.com late Friday evening that the high profile Walmart delegation was actually looking to secure an assurance for uninterrupted supply from the prime minister. The Walmart executives, he said, were mainly concerned about poor infrastructure, particularly in the power and energy sector, which is widely blamed for hampering industrial production. However, the Walmart delegation had not been able to secure an audience with prime minister Sheikh Hasina as she was scheduled to fly to Tungipara Friday morning. Moreover, the Walmart delegation made no prior appointment to see her. The visit of the delegation was kept secret, ostensibly to avoid media attention. The Walmart top executives flew in on Thursday night and stayed at the Radisson Hotel amid tight security. The BGMEA delegates, who had no idea of their meeting's agenda, had to go through three layers of security and were not 'even allowed to take a pen to the meeting', said the source. "There was a sense that Walmart was trying to create a sense of authority, which is sometimes a part of these meetings." The Walmart delegation included C. Douglas McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart International, Jana Carter, a senior director of Walmart's international corporate affairs, David Scogin, vice president for merchandise planning and a newly appointed local representative. It was evident from the meeting that the main purpose of the high-powered delegation was to secure an assurance regarding infrastructure and utilities for their supply chain from Sheikh Hasina, the source said. "In the process they sort of said 'hello' and appraised us of their plans." Earlier BGMEA president, Abdus Salam Murshedy, had told reporters after the meeting that McMillon suggested setting up of a comprehensive industrial zone for the apparel sector that could attract a lot more investment. "He told us that they consider Bangladesh an important source of apparels. They want to buy more products from here. For that he suggested setting up of a combined industrial zone with adequate gas and power supply for the sector," Murshedy said. Famous for its low prices helped by an innovative inventory management system, Walmart says it "serves customers and members more than 200 million times per week" at more than 8,424 retail units under 53 different banners in 15 countries and topping $400 billion in annual business. The US-based company operates in Mexico as Walmex, owns the giant Asda in the UK, and runs Seiyu in Japan. In countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Puerto Rico, the company has wholly-owned operations. Walmart has it presence on the subcontinent with a retail chain called Best Price in Indi
