 VANCOUVER, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympic chiefs went toe-to-toe with a boxing kangaroo on Friday when the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) refused to remove a giant flag of the iconic character hanging in the Winter Games athletes' village. "It is our mascot," said defiant AOC spokesman Mike Tancred. "It says what Australia is; that we punch above our weight, that we are a very determined nation." The dispute developed into a minor international incident after an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official ordered the AOC to take down the flag earlier in the week because it bears a registered trademark and is a commercial property. But the AOC has said the flag, which depicts a yellow kangaroo wearing red boxing gloves, will remain in place until it receives an official written request from the IOC.

The boxing kangaroo first appeared on the Australian sporting scene in 1983 when Alan Bond and his crew waved the flag on the way to winning the America's Cup yachting race. Bond later sold the trademarked image to the AOC, the boxing kangaroo becoming a symbol of Australia's fighting spirit. "The deputy prime minister, Julia Gillard, she has come out in our support and the leader of the federal opposition Tony Abbott has come out in our support, so we have cross party support and that's really refreshing," said Tancred. "We want to have fun at these Games. We're here to do some very serious business but the athletes also have a lot of fun in the village. These sort of issues are not what the village is about. "It's a fun place, a happy pl
