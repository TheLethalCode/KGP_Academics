<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim on Sunday said that the judges should submit their wealth statements not only for the sake of transparency but also for setting precedence for those holding public office. "This tradition is maintained in several countries throughout the world including India" Karim said just a day prior to taking over from outgoing chief justice Mohammad Tafazzal Islam. His comments came during a conversation with reporters at his Supreme Court chamber. "I'll try my best to ensure justice to people within a short time and at a lower cost. I'll try to make sure no one falls victim to injustice. Around 150 million people of the country are looking forward to me." Commenting on the huge pile of cases in high court he said, "I'll try to decrease this backlog caused by inadequacy of judges and courts." Karim urged the reporters not to publish such reports "that hamper justice and make us feel embarrassed." He announced that initiatives will be taken immediately to set up a separate independent secretariat for the Supreme Court and to increase the salary of the judges. Karim's appointment will be effective from Monday until he goes into retirement on Sept 30. Outgoing chief justice Tafazzul Islam, meanwhile, was appointed on Dec 15, for barely two months, and left office Sunday as he reached the mandatory retirement age of 67. Islam said on Friday that the role of justices, lawyers and mass media is beyond limit to take the country forward. Many young lawyers are nowadays using laptops in their professional work during the age of globalisation. "I don't think you'll too long to see that verdicts are being pronounced through this technology", he said. Asked how he would pass his time during retirement Justice Islam said "I've decided to devote my time reading and writing books". He made these remarks at his farewell ceremony organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association and the attorney general's office. He led the special bench of the Supreme Court, formed for the final disposal of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman killing case. He was also the chief of the bench that declared illegal the fifth amendment of the constitution. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said, "We are losing an amicable, cultured and music-loving personality through your farewell." Supreme Court Bar Association president Mesbah Uddin said, "The nation will eternally remember you for the historic example you have set within a short time to retain the image and integrity of the highest court and establish rule of law and democracy in the country." As historic examples, he especially mentioned Tafazzul Islam's epoch-making verdicts in Sheikh Mujibur Rahman killing case and the fifth amendment of the constitution. After the farewell ceremony, chief justice Islam exchanged greetings with lawyers in two hall rooms. bdnew
