 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Around 900,000 impoverished families in Dhaka city will be given low-priced rice under a special programme aimed at easing their hardship, food minister Abdur Razzaque said Monday. Starting Feb 21, the programme will extend to cover another 10,000 families from 25 unions in Dhaka district, 5,000 families from each of the six divisional wards and 10,000 families from each of the 64 districts, he said. Under the programme, each family will be provided with 20 kg of rice per month at a rate of Tk 22 per kg. The minister told reporters about the programme after a meeting of the food planning and monitoring committee. Asked who would get this special facility, Razzaque said the programme will cover those who have no stable income, own property or do not obtain any facilities from the social security network. Ward commissioners and councilors have already been asked to prepare a list of the poor people in their respective localities in cooperation with the local lawmakers, he said.
