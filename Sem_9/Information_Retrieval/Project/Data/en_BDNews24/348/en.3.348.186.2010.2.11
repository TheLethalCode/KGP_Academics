<TITLE> UN climate panel reforms urged to boost trust </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OSLO, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading UN climate panel should be split up or even turned into an online encyclopaedia to help restore trust after mistakes like an erroneous forecast on the melting of Himalayan glaciers, experts said. Five leading climatologists suggested everything from sticking with the existing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to replacing it with an organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "IPCC: cherish it, tweak it or scrap it," the journal Nature said of proposed solutions published in Thursday's edition. An error that Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 -- a huge exaggeration of the thaw -- has exposed shortcomings in the IPCC's checks of its sources and led to calls for reforms of the panel that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Scandals over leaked e-mails from a British University and conflicts of interest by panel members have also damaged the IPCC, whose reports are the main guide for costly government policies to shift from fossil fuels towards renewable energies. "Like the financial sector last year, the IPCC is currently experiencing a failure of trust that reveals flaws in its structure," wrote Eduardo Zorita of the GKSS Research Centre in Germany. He said the IPCC, whose authors usually keep their existing jobs, should be replaced by an "International Climate Agency", perhaps with 200 staff. He said the IAEA, the European Central Bank or the US Congressional Budget Office showed it was possible to be independent and respected. Several experts said a problem is that the IPCC produces its main reports only once every six years. The last was in 2007 drawing on the work of 2,500 experts and totalling about 3,000 pages. John Christy of the University of Alabama suggested turning the IPCC into "a living, 'Wikipedia-IPCC'" to be updated online and with sections overseen by groups of four to eight experts. SHORT, RAPID "A new class of short, rapidly prepared, peer-reviewed reports is needed," said Mike Hulme, a lead author of the University of East Anglia in England. These could be about the use of carbon border tariffs, ways to slow deforestation, or controlling soot that can darken and thaw Arctic sea ice by making it soak up heat. Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern, a co-chair of one of the IPCC's three main working groups, defended the panel's existing plans, saying reports every six years ensured "the robustness required for a thorough and rigorous assessment". Separately, another study in Nature outlined a new framework for assessing climate change, improving on scenarios used by the IPCC until now which do not factor in the impact of cuts in emissions, new green technologies or changes in lifestyles. "The idea is to have a whole library of scenarios," Nebojsa Nakicenovic of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis told Reuters. "It will become richer." The 2007 IPCC report used just 6 core scenarios, developed after consulting non-climate experts on issues such as economic growth, population and energy use and then adding likely greenhouse gas emissions and other factors. "That process takes too long" and the scenarios cannot easily be adapted with new information. A new "parallel process" could assess possible use of carbon-burying technology at coal-fired power plants, for instance, or a shift to biofuels.
