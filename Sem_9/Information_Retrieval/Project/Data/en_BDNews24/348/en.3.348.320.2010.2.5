<TEXT>
 Gopalganj, Feb 05 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina renewed her pledge to bring back the fugitive killers of her father as she visited the grave of the Bangabandhu on Friday. She said the men found guilty of murdering the founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975 would be hunted down and punished. Hasina made the comments during her visit to Bangabandhu's grave at Tungipara in Gopalganj on Friday. Despite suggestion that the summary executions had made the matter of extradition quite difficult, especially if the convicts happen to be in western countries, the prime minister said that the government was doing everything possible to bring back the guilty and fully carry out the court's verdict. Of the 12 former military officers found guilty of murdering the founding president, five were hanged between midnight and 1.00am on Jan 28. While one of the guilty is believed to have died abroad already, six are in hiding in different countries. This was Hasina's first visit to Tungipara after the executions. The prime minister arrived by helicopter at around 11.00am and placed a wreath at the grave along with her sister Sheikh Rehana, cousin Sheikh Helal MP and nephew Fazle Noor Taposh, MP. The five executions had happened 35 years after the murder in 1975 and Hasina thanked the people in the constituency for their support and cooperation in enduring the pain and waging a movement for justice and trial for all these years. "I am grateful to you," she said. The former army officers were convicted of the massacre of Aug 15, 1975 when Mujibur Rahman was killed along with his family. However, his two daughters, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana escaped the bloodbath because they were not abroad. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, commerce minister Faruk Khan and local Awami League leaders were present during the prime minister's Tungipara visit. Hasina, also president of ruling Awami League, later had meetings with party leaders of Gopalganj district and Kotalipara and Tungipara upazilas. bdn
