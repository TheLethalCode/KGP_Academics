 MEXICO CITY, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen stormed into a nightclub in the Mexican beach resort of Mazatlan and shot dead six people in what looked like the latest in a flurry of drug cartel attacks. Early Saturday, four men entered the nightclub and fatally shot two waiters and a patron on a crowded dance floor. They then turned back and shot three more people at the door, an official at the public prosecutor's office in the northern state of Sinaloa said. "It all happened while a local band was playing, that's when the shooting started," the official said, asking not to be quoted by name. Drug gang killings have risen sharply this year.

The governor of Chihuahua state, home to Ciudad Juarez, said on Saturday his office, the state legislature and state judiciary planned to move their operations to Ciudad Juarez to focus on calming the rampant drug violence there. A spokesman for Gov. Jose Reyes told Reuters officials would start arranging the move next week. Separately, the Chihuahua state prosecutor's office said a second suspect had been arrested for the student party shooting, which sparked angry protests from relatives that the Mexican government is not doing enough to prevent bloodshed. Since Calderon launched his drug war just over three years ago, nearly 18,000 people have been slain across Mexico, mainly rival traffickers and police, a level of violence that worries the US government, foreign investors and tourists along with Mexicans. Chihuahua, on the US border, and Sinaloa, on a lucrative Pacific coast smuggling route north and dominated by an smuggling alliance led by Mexico's most-wanted man, Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman, are the main hotspots in the drug war. While few foreign tourists would venture near Ciudad Juarez, the Pacific resort of Mazatlan is lined with luxury hotels and glitzy discotheques that attract vacationers and wealthy drug baro
