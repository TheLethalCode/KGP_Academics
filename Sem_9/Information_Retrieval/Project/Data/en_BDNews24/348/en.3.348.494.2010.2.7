<TEXT>
 NAGPUR, India, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's Jacques Kallis underlined his ability to adapt to difficult conditions with his 34th Test hundred and third against India on Saturday. Kallis's spectacular 159 and unbroken 285-run third wicket stand with Hashim Amla (115) helped South Africa reach 291 for two on the opening day of the first Test and take a grip on the match as they seek to reclaim the number one ranking from their hosts.

Only India's Sachin Tendulkar (45) and Australian Ricky Ponting (39) have scored more centuries. "I think, as he has grown in stature over the years he has got his game so well worked out, so well organised, that he knows exactly how to bat under different conditions," Wessels added. "It is a trial for batsmen worldwide to be able to bat, assess the situation and then capitalise when the time is right." Kallis used his feet remarkably well against the spinners, as he and Amla put together South Africa's highest partnership against India. "The powers of concentration by both batsmen were exceptional. I think their shot selection was very good. You don't often see (off-spinner) Harbhajan go through a play like today without bowling a maiden," Wessels
