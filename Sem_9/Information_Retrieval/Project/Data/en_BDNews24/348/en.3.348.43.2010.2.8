<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)The government has signed a deal with China on installing two 150-megawatt power plants. Power Development Board signed the agreement with two Chinese private companies on Monday in presence of finance minister AMA Muhith at the Bidyut Bhaban. "The two power plants will be able to generate at least 250 MW power within 15 months," Muhith said. The projects are Chandpur 150-MW and Sylhet 150-MW combined cycle power plants. The Chandpur project is expected to start production at the end of September, 2011 and the Sylhet project between mid-June and December of the same year. Muhith said the government is giving priority to the development of power and energy as they are the main basis of the country's overall development. "We have a three-year crash programme on the matter," he said. He admitted that even after taking all moves the government would not be able to generate power more than demand. The minister said development of power and energy lagged behind because of anomalies in these sectors in the past seven years. He hoped the two Chinese companies would be able to start generation by the deadline. "We want to get China as a development partner," Muhith said. Tawfik-e-Elahi, the prime minister's energy adviser, said: "The signing of the two power plants is a milestone in the fulfillment of the government's election pledge. "Our economic growth is being stymied due to gas crisis. We hope the projects will be implemented in time," he said.
