 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone's disclosure of massive fourth quarter profits has prompted the market regulator to ask for an explanation, with the two bourses also standing in the dock. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wrote to the three on Tuesday and gave just two days to respond. The company reported net profit after tax of Tk 844.44 crore for the fourth quarter of 2009 in unaudited financial results posted on the websites of the two bourses on Tuesday. In the letter, the SEC objected to the figures being unaudited. The regulators maintain that the rules do not allow a company to post unaudited results beyond three quarters and publication of the fourth means making public the annual statement, which must be audited. The mobile operator has insisted that it did nothing wrong, and that the disclosure was in full compliance of the regulations. "You have issued and submitted fourth quarter (Q4) financial statements for the quarter ended on December 31, 2009 prepared cumulatively for the current financial year to date, which is equivalent to the annual financial statements," the SEC said in its letter to the phone company. "But, such annual financial statements have not been audited as per rule 12(3A) of the Securities and Exchange Rules, 1987. "In view of the above, you are requested to explain your position in respect of your violating rule 12 (3A) of the Securities and Exchange Rules, 1987, within February 11, 2010, latest." GP chief executive officer Oddvar Hesjedal defended his company's action. "We firmly believe that Grameenphone has been compliant with the SEC regulations and the guidelines we received from the SEC prior to disclosure of our above financials," Hesjedal told The Financial Express on Wednesday. He said GP's top executives had already met with SEC officials on Wednesday to explain its position. The latest financial results meant an earning per share (EPS) of Tk 6.44, compared to Tk 2.14 the previous year. GP's financial disclosure on Tuesday propped up the market mover's share price by 2.89 per cent on the day, amounting to nearly 14 per cent the day's turnover. Its stock price fell by 1.1 percent on Wednesday to Tk 316.1, not as low as market observers had predicted as the curb on netting was announced earlier in the week. Trading in GP sharesthe single largest issue in Bangladesh's historybegan just two and a half months ago.
