 JERUSALEM, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for immediate and "crippling" sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, as it began making higher-grade nuclear fuel in defiance of international censure. "Iran is racing forward to produce nuclear weapons ... I believe that what is required right now is tough action by the international community," Netanyahu told European diplomats. "This means not moderate sanctions, or watered-down sanctions. This means crippling sanctions and these sanctions must be applied right now," he said in a short message to underscore Israel's concern over the latest developments. Netanyahu's language implied Israel would not be content with so-called "targeted sanctions" which Western diplomats have predicted could be pursued against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other assets of the Tehran leadership.

Iran currently enriches uranium to a level of 3.5 percent while 80 percent or more is needed for a nuclear bomb. The Pentagon has said the United States wants the UN Security Council to approve a resolution "within weeks, not months", laying the ground for new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme. They would be the fourth set of sanctions. Spain's ambassador to Israel, Alvaro Iranzo, said the EU condemned Tehran's Holocaust denials and calls for the destruction of the Jewish state. The 27-nation bloc wanted assurance that Iran's atomic ambitions were peaceful, he said. "I think what is required is a lot more than words," Netanyahu told the gathering of envoys. He said Iran was acting "in brazen defiance of the international community, and the international community must decide if it is serious about neutralising this threat to Israel, the region and the entire wor
