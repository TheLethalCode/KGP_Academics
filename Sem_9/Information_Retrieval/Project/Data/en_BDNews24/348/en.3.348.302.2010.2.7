 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The capital development authority Rajuk filed a contempt of court suit against an owner of Jamuna Future Park on Sunday accusing him of misinterpreting a High Court ruling that had dismissed a Jamuna Group appeal against a demolition notice served on the Future Park shopping mall. The chairman of Rajuk filed the suit at the High Court bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin. Rajuk lawyer AFM Mezbahuddin told journalists that Shamim Islam, managing director of Jamuna Builders Ltd, owning company of the shopping mall, appealed against the High Court ruling where he mentioned "I filed the appeal as per the direction of the court". "But in reality there was no direction for appeal in the High Court ruling  Such a wrong presentation of the ruling is cause for contempt of court," the Rajuk lawyer said. The demolition notice was initially issued by Rajuk on Jan 17 against the Jamuna Future Park development that is nearing completion at Basundhara, Dhaka. The Dhaka city development authority gave the Future Park authorities seven days' notice for knocking down unapproved upper floors of the sprawling complex. Jamuna Group immediately petitioned the High Court, challenging the notice to demolish but the court dismissed the petition. Rajuk began demolishing the unapproved top floors of the development on Feb 4 just a day after the High Court dismissed Jamuna Group's petition. But the demolition work came to a halt as Shamim immediately sought to appeal against the High Court's dismissal. Appellate Division chamber justice Md Muzammel Hossain sent the appeal to the regular bench on Sunday. Ahsanul Karim, lawyer for Jamuna Group told reporters that as they did not get approval to submit the appeal on Feb 4, which fell on a Thursday, the last working day of the week, it was not in Sunday's cause list. b
