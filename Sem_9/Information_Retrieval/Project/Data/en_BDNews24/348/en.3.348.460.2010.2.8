<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of a readymade garment factory blocked the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway at Tongi, clogging traffic, from Monday morning to afternoon demanding back pay. Local people said the blockade caused severe traffic congestions on either side of the highway and snapped the capital's direct road communications with Gazipur and Mymensingh. Tongi police chief Tapan Chandra Saha told bdnews24.com wages and salaries payment by the factory, Giant Tex, remained suspended after it was closed without notice on Jan 14 over an ownership dispute. He said BGMEA vice-president Md Faruque Hasan had handed the ownership of the factory to one Hasan Sayeed and his brother Nowshad Hasan in 2007 on a sales agreement. Quoting Sayeed, the police official said the factory was shut down as Faruque did not fulfil the conditions of transferring the shares through the Registrar of Joint Companies and Firms and arranging bank loan for the factory. Faruque, however, claimed to have met all the conditions of the sales deal, Tapan said. Labour law provides for payment of three months' wages to laid-off workers in addition to their regular pay. Assistant superintendent of police for Gazipur industrial zone Monwar Hossain told bdnews24.com the workers withdrew the blockade at 1:45pm on assurance that their dues would be paid through talks with the owners. Earlier, a large number of police and RAB personnel were deployed in the area to avert untoward incident, he said. b
