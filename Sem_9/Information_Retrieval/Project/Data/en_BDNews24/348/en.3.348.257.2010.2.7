<TITLE> Barua sees no Boro fertiliser crisis this year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 07 (bdnews24.com)  Industries minister Dilip Barua on Sunday rejected any possibility of a fertiliser crisis in the current Boro farming season. January to March is the peak season for Boro cultivation. Farmers across the country regularly face shortages of fertiliser every year during the period. The estimated demand this year is for 1.5 million tonnes, while the government has 1.7 million tonnes in stock, Barua told reporters after a meeting with Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation and other agencies concerned with fertiliser distribution. Around 500,000 tonnes have already been distributed for January, in line with farmers' needs, Barua said. The industries and agriculture ministries are closely monitoring the fertiliser distribution and immediate steps are being taken against any signs of crisis anywhere, he added. He said farmers regularly had to face fertiliser crisis in the past as stocks could not meet demand. "But there has been quite good production of fertiliser this year and so stocks are outweighing demand at present. We are trying to further increase stores of fertiliser, though we are facing shortage of storehouses," the minister said.
