<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has said the government is plotting a conspiracy to implicate the party's senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman in the 10-truck arms haul case. "The government is putting up fresh obstacles for BNP to go to parliament by fabricating stories about Tarique Rahman," Jainal Abdin Farrouque, opposition chief whip, said in a press conference on Tuesday at parliament's media centre. "Still, we'll rejoin parliament," he said. The opposition, after months of boycott, recently announced it would return to parliament this session. A number of daily newspapers have reported that Hafizur Rahman, a prime accused in the 10-truck arms haul case, in a confessional statement alleged that Tarique Rahman had held a meeting with India's ULFA leader Paresh Barua at Hawa Bhaban. It is widely speculated that the consignment of 10 truckloads of arms seized in Chittagong in 2004 was bound for India's outlawed United Liberation Front of Assam. "A certain intelligence agency is trying to tarnish the image of the Zia family by making public these false confessional statements", Farrouque said. He also pointed out that Hafizur Rahman was arrested in connection with the arms case during the BNP-led four-party alliance government. Farrouque also protested against involving former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in the murder case of former Awami League finance minister Shah AMS Kibria. The opposition chief whip criticised a recent comment by ruling Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam against BNP chief Khaleda Zia. "He has termed our leader 'subhuman' at a time when she decided to return to parliament for the sake of maintaining the flow of democracy." The opposition decided to join the current session of parliament last week. It has been boycotting the house since June last year.
