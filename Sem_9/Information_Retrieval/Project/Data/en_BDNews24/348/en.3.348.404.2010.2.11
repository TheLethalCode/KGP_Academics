 Chapainawabganj, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)Shaheen, 24, a Rajshahi College Chhatra Shibir leader, died in Chapainawabganj early on Thursday in a gunfight with police. Police claimed that Shaheen, from Meherchandi in Rajshahi, was an accused in the killing of RU Chhatra League activist Faruq Hossain. He was a student of political science at RU and social welfare secretary of RU unit of Islami Chhatra Shibir. Chapainawabganj police super Nazrul Hossain told reporters that the gun battle took place at the house of Toufizul Islam Tanu, a local Jamaat-e-Islami leader in Choitannyapur village under Shibganj Upazila. Being tipped off about a meeting of some Shibir leaders and activists at Tanu's place, police raided the house. "As police cordoned the place at 2am on Thursday, shots were fired from the house and the police retaliated. Upon storming the house later, police found the bullet-hit dead body of Shaheen there," said Nazrul. The police super, however, claimed that Shaheen was hit by someone from his own side. Police arrested JI leader Toufizul and his son Mahfuz, 27, from the house. The body was sent to Sadar Hospital morgue for autopsy. Locals people said that following the death of RU student Faruq Hossain on Tuesday, some people including Shaheen had taken refuge at Toufizul's place. Faruq, a RU mathematics student was killed in an attack by the CS activists, police said. Two cases were filed in this connection on Wednesday against some 600 CS members, including 64 who were named specifically. Shaheen's name was not there among the list of 64, but police said his name would eventually be included in the list as a suspect. bdnews24
