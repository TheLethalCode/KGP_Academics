 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Minister and Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam has alleged that Islami Chhatra Shibir members had infiltrated top ranks of the pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League. He told reporters at the party's central office in Dhanmondi Tuesday that members of Shibir, aligned to Jamaat-e-Islami, were holding "responsible posts" in BCL committees on Dhaka University university. He made the claim just hours after the killing of Faruk Hossain, a student and Chhatra League activist at Rajshahi University, reportedly by Shibir men, during clashes between the two opposing camps at the northern university. He also said that criminal activities under the banner of student politics will not be tolerated. "Complete zero tolerance. Strict legal and organisational steps will be taken if anyone is involved in criminal offenses." Ashraf, who is the government party's spokesperson, was speaking after a two-hour long meeting of Awami League-led 14-party leaders. The ruling party's coalition partners voiced concern over increasing student violence on campuses countrywide. President of Chhatra League, Mahmud Hasan Ripon, told bdnews24.com after Ashraf's remarks on Shibir infiltration: "I don't want to make any comment without detailed knowledge." Meanwhile, Sajjad Sakib Badshah, organising secretary of Chhatra League's Dhaka University unit claimed at a public meeting on Tuesday that there was "Shibir's hand" behind the death of DU student Abu Bakar following BCL factional clashes on Feb 3. He claimed, "Shibir was involved in the death of Abu Bakar during the internal clash of Chhatra League at AF Rahman Hall last week." Also referring to the death of Abu Bakar, Ashraf said, "The chief assailant has been marked and arrested." He also hinted at possibilities of Shibir influence behind the murder, saying the Islamist student organisation had infiltrated BCL committees in four DU halls. He said, "Sometimes a party is infiltrated by others conspiratorially. Sometimes parties are hijacked." "We have no such plans" was his response when asked whether the government might move to suspend activities of student organisations. bd
