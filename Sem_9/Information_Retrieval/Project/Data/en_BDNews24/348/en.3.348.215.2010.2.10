 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The 11th South Asian Games was left reeling when Nepal's Rajendra Bahadur Bhandari apparently beat the marathon world record by an incredible 12 minutes and the Asian record by 16 minutes on the concluding day of the sports extravaganza on Tuesday morning. It later emerged that Bhandari 'beat the record' having run only 35 kilometres instead of 42 as organisers discovered the course had been some seven kilometres shorter than it should have been. The organisers decided against publishing the timings in a meeting in the afternoon. General secretary of the Bangladesh Athletics Federation, Shah Alam, told bdnews24.com, "A probe committee will be formed to investigate the matter." He said it would be sent on to the Asian Athletics Federation or the International Athletics Federation.
