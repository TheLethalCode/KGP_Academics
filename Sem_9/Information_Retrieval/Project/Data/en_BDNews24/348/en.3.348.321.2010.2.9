<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government will allow establishment of 1,500 new non-government primary schools in villages across the country, primary and mass education minister Afsarul Amin said on Tuesday. Addressing a gathering of non-government primary teachers, the minister said the schools would be named after freedom fighters from the respective villages, and the Tk 300,000 registration fee would be waived. But he did not mention any timeframe for their set-up. The non-government primary teachers association organised the gathering, at the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh, marking the association's 18th founding anniversary with a call to nationalise their jobs. In reply to the call, the minister said the government has not considered nationalisation of their jobs. But he said authorities concerned have been instructed to ensure disbursement of their salaries by 7th of the month. Non-government primary teachers now get just Tk 1,000 a month. Their demands include a new pay scale, housing and medical allowance
