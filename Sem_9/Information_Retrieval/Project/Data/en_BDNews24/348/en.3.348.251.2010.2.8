<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 07 (bdnews24.com)  Bids for the Padma Bridge Construction Project will be invited soon after receiving opinions from donors on the tender document, communications minister Abul Hossain said on Sunday. "The tender document is ready. It has been given to donors. Tenders will be invited as soon as possible after they give their opinions on review of the document," Hossain told newsmen after a meeting of donors and government policy makers at the Economic Relations Division in the city. The government announced last December that the bridge will cost an estimated $2.4 billion with the World Bank to provide $1.2 billion, the ADB $550 million, IDB $120 million and JICA $300 million. Abu Dhabi Development Group will also lend $31 million. The rest, just $140 million, would be raised locally by issuing bonds and other means. Hossain has said tenders for constructing Padma Bridge will be floated by February. Asked Sunday whether the donors are likely to have any objection to the tender document, he said, "They may have some advice to offer, but they are saying it (the tender) will be done as the government wants." Planning minister AK Khandaker, who also attended Sunday's meeting, said, "Padma Bridge will be constructed by 2013. Tenders will be invited as soon as possible." Asked whether there are any hitches over funding, he said, "Funding has almost been assured. Donor organisations are saying there will be no problem." Asked whether the estimated cost will rise again, communications minister Abul Hossain said, "The estimated cost will not rise again, we think." The estimated cost of the Padma Bridge escalated by about $500 million last year. The past caretaker government had initially estimated cost of construction at around $1.4 billion, which it later revised up to $1.8 billion. The present government, immediately after coming to power in January 2009, raised the estimate again to $1.9 billion, with loans pledged from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Islamic Development Bank among others. The cost rose again to $2.4 billion, with all but $140 million being pledged by donors, the finance minister AMA Muhith announced after a meeting on Dec 21 last. b
