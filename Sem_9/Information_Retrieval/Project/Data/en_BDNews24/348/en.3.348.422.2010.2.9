 Moinul Hoque Chowdury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) --- The Sundarbansthe world's largest mangrove forest situated in southwest Bangladeshlacks skilled manpower, particularly veterinary surgeons, to manage and take care of its precious wildlife resources including many endangered species such as the iconic Royal Bengal Tiger. Despite many government initiatives, there has been no headway made to recruit conservation experts and veterinary surgeons ensure protection of the biodiversity of this unique world heritage site, a senior forest official told bdnews24.com. The forest is already vulnerable to the onslaughts of climate change and rising sea level threatening to decimate its rich wildlife, says Tapan Kumar Dey, conservator of forest directorate. It bore the burnt of recurring cyclones and tidal surges that wrought havoc on the forest's wildlife that includes the Bengal Tiger, now on the verge of extinction. Forest officials said the Sundarbans is suffering from shortage of workforce. Some veterinary surgeons should be appointed and hundreds of posts lying vacant for management and monitoring of the forest should be filled to efficiently conserve the forest. State minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud last week said in parliament that at present 1,282 posts are vacant at the department of forest. Of those vacant posts, some 759 are possible to be filled up through direct appointment and 523 can be filled up through promotion, he said. For years now, experts have voiced concern at the deteriorating condition of the forest with many of its rare flora and fauna being on the verge of extinction. They have called for initiatives both at government and private levels to protect the forest. In 1999, UNESCO designated some 32,400 hectres of Sundarbans forest as a world heritage site and an important sanctuary of wildlife. The Sundarbans is the home to 50 species of mammals, 320 species of native and migrant birds, 50 species of reptiles, eight species of amphibians, 40 species of fishes and 334 species of plants. Forest and environmental officials said the Sundarbans is divided into four ranges with 16 stations. There are 80-90 camps, each manned by only three forest employees while only 10-15 people work at each station. Chief executive of Wildlife Trust Bangladesh professor Anwarul Islam lamented the indifference on the part of government in appointing veterinary surgeons to take care of ailing animals. It is pity that veterinary surgeons have to be called in from Cox's Bazar's Bangabandhu Safari park in case any tiger falls ill. "Human beings usually look down on animals and wildlife while there is no strict law to punish anybody for killing a wild animal, including tiger," he said. Prof Islam stressed the need for raising public awareness in wildlife conservation. Under a project, the forest division/department in association with WTB is working to address the tiger-men rivalry and monitor tiger movement, he said. Admitting the shortage of manpower, chief conservator of the forest directorate Abdul Motaleb said there had been no veterinary surgeons attached to the forests. The government has formulated a work plan for 2009-2017 which includes Sundarbans management assistance project worth Tk 19 crore, development of communication network and rehabilitation project costing Tk 6.5 crore and development of infrastructures in Sundarbans project worth Tk10 crore. Besides, an initiative has been taken to improve Sundarbans enviromental livelihood security under the auspices of USAID at the cost of Tk 108 crore. The government is keen to implement all these projects to conserve the forest and protect the tiger population, forest and environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumdar said. Majumdar told bdnews24.com, "Skilled manpower is being created and a team has already been trained to capture sick wild animals for treatment by using tranquiliser gun." He said a recommendation has been sent to establishment ministry asking for creating more posts, including that of veterinary surgeons, for sustainable management of the Sundarbans. Besides, the government has taken steps to amend the existing forest and wildlife conservation laws. Chief forest conservator Abdul Motaleb said a proposal for amending the wildlife law has been sent to the law ministry with a provision for maximum five years in jail and Tk 50,000 fine for killing wild animals. "But under the proposed law, no action can be taken against killing of tigers in mass beating in human habitation as thousands of people are involved in it. Creating public awareness can only avert the situation," he said There were one lakh tigers in the world in 1900 and the figure has now dropped to only 3,200, according to conservation experts. Forest division and environment ministry officials said over 120 tigers were killed in Bangladesh since independence while 925 tigers were killed across the globe since 1994. There are some organised groups of poachers in each village surrounding the four ranges of the Sundanbans, informed sources said. They mix poison with food, gun down tigers and deer and smuggle out the animal hide to foreign countries where they are sold at exorbitant prices. b
