 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition party BNP is set to rejoin parliament Thursday afternoon, after a break of 64 working days, a senior party figure said. The afternoon JS session is scheduled to kick off at 3pm. "BNP has decided to join the session in the afternoon," Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury told bdnews24.com at noon. He said his party took the decision in the interests of the public. "The government has failed to address the law and order problems, price escalation, and so on, faced by the people. We would like to raise these burning issues in the parliament ourselves," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "We hope the party in power will allow us to speak up. If they won't, we'll tell people that the government wants to choke people's voices, like they did in the past." He said BNP had asked all its MPs to be present at the session; three MPs from coalition partners Jama'at-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party will also be there. A meeting of BNP's parliamentary party earlier this week decided on rejoining parliament this session. b
