 Rajshahi, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  One student was killed and scores more were injured, along with police, as Rajshahi University campus erupted in violence overnight, police said. bdnews24.com's RU correspondent reported that Faruk Hossain, a master's student in mathematics and a Chhatra League activist, was found dead on campus Tuesday morning. His body was reportedly recovered from a manhole near the university's Shah Mukhdum Hall and showed signs of stab wounds. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner, Sardar Nurul Amin, told bdnews24.com the situation at the university was tense. Gunshots had earlier rung through the campus in the small hours, witnesses said, after a night of mounting tensions between Islami Chhatra Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League on the campus. Students said Shibir activists had earlier beaten up two Chhatra Leaguers Kawsar Alam and Asadur Rahman as they were trying to enter Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall at around 8:30pm on Monday night. The two injured students were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital in critical condition. Tension spread to other halls, while activists "took position on the campus", said witnesses. Meanwhile, hearing reports of the attack on two Chhatra League students, the university proctor, three assistant commissioners of police and three local police chiefs, led by Rajshahi city police commissioner Sardar Nurul Amin, came rushing to the scene. Assistant proctor Prof Mustak Ahmed said measures would be taken against those involved with the incident. Assistant police commissioner MK Jahangir Hossain also said they would take necessary actions after talking with the university administration. Police later raided Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall at around 10pm, though no arrests were made, said Hossain. Just hours after the raid, bdnews24.com's Rajshahi University correspondent, on the scene, reported that gun shots were heard as Shibir and Chhatra League locked in battle on the campus. bdn
