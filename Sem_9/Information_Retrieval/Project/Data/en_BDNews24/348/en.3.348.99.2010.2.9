<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Tanjim Ahmed MP, popularly known as Sohel Taj, the former state minister for home on Tuesday visited the home ministry for the first time since he returned home from the United States after about seven months. He went to the ministry at around 12.45 pm and met his succesor Shamsul Haque Tuku. Home minister Sahara Khatun was not present at her office at the time of his visit. Taj spent about 45 minites there and exchanged greetings with the journalists as he left the ministry. But he avoided responding queries on whether he would join any ministry. Recently, Sahara Khatun said Tanjim's resignation letter was not accepted and hence he still remains the state minister. There was widespread speculation in June last year that Tanjim would resign due to conflicts with his boss. After staying in the United States for about seven months, Taj returned home on Jan 27. He refused to take any offcial protocol at the Zia International Airport upon his arrival. Taj, son of Bangladesh's first prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed, has already joined the parliamentary session. bdnews
