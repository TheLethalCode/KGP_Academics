 Sylhet, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  A BNP policymaker, admitting that intra-party squabbling is eating into the strengths of the party, has said a committee will seek to resolve the feuds at all levels. Speaking in Sylhet, standing committee member A S M Hannan Shah told an audience of party activists that the party must act to halt the slide. "BNP scuttled in the Sylhet division because of infighting," Hannan Shah said during a discussion on BNP's role at the grassroots level. Activists from four districts of Sylhet were present. The meeting discussed opinions expressed at the union representatives' conference in January 2005 in Sylhet as a part of BNP's grassroots level activities across the country. He termed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's India trip 'deceiving' to the nation. "The nation has got nothing from the prime minister's India trip. The aim of this trip was to give advantage to India." While he acknowledged India's support and assistance to Bangladesh during it Liberation War in 1971, Shah said that the neighbouring country had remained consistent in its aggression against Bangladesh. The government is torturing leaders and workers of BNP across the country. Indecent speeches are being delivered against BNP leaders, he said. He urged the new generation to follow nationalist politics. He said the present government was following the path of establishing Baksal, which was introduced in 1975. He urged the grassroots workers to resist such a move. The discussion was presided over by Kamal Ahmed Chowdhury, divisional head of social science department of Shahjalal University of Science & Technology. M Ilyas Ali, president of Sylhet district BNP and organisational secretary of central BNP, Dr Mahbub Iqbal, professor of Sylhet Agricultural University and Advocate Faruq Chowdhury spoke among others. Central BNP vice president Selima Rahman, advisory committee member Enam Ahmad Chowdhury, joint secretary Amanullah Aman and former minister Ruhul Kuddus Talukdar Dulu were present among others. Ten such meetings will be held in six divisions within two months. It aims at reforming the party and determining future directives, said BNP's central leaders. BNP organised this meeting following the model of representatives' conference held at the initiative of Tarique Rahman. The conference of 2005 and a documentary on Tarique Rahman were also exhibited. bd
