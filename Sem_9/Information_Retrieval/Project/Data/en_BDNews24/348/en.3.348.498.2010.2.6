 NAGPUR, India, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis struck his third century in five Tests to help South Africa recover from the loss of two early wickets on the opening day of the first Test against India on Saturday.

Top-ranked India, already without experienced batsmen Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh, suffered another blow when Rohit Sharma, called up as cover for Vangipurappu Laxman, suffered an ankle injury in the warm-up. Wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha was handed an unexpected debut by India in the absence of both Laxman and Sharma and joins another debutant batsman, Subramaniam Badrinath, in an inexperienced middle o
