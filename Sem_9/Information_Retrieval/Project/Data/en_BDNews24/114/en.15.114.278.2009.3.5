 NEW DELHI, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's leading Twenty20 tournament will go ahead despite security concerns but some fixtures are being rescheduled to avoid clashing with national election dates, the IPL tournament director said on Thursday. "We're just changing the dates around matches, around polling," Dhiraj Malhotra told Reuters, referring to the popular league scheduled from April 10 to May 24. "Where do you postpone it to? There is a World Cup starting on the first of June, (with) the first warm up game," he said, referring to the Twenty20 World Cup in England from June 5-21. The league, involving many international players, has been thrust into the security spotlight in the wake of Tuesday's militant attack on Sri Lankan players in neighbouring Pakistan. Foreign players are raising concerns over travelling to the sub-continent after the attack in Lahore left six members of the Sri Lankan squad wounded and seven Pakistanis, six policemen and a bus driver, dead. Indian authorities want the cricket board to reschedule the league as the security forces would be busy providing cover for the massive poll exercise scheduled between April 16 and May 13. The rescheduling would ensure no matches are held in cities when elections are being held. New Delhi, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad are the venues for matches. Malhotra said security had been assessed in the past few weeks and that league officials would talk to players and national boards to allay safety fears. "Before this (the Lahore attack) happened we'd already decided on security," he said. "We've a security warden in India who has been here for the last one month roaming around these eight venues, meeting with the local authorities. "Once we shift the dates around the election, obviously we will get the local police and all. If the election is happening in Chennai it is possible to have a match in Mumbai. "Right now we are talking to the players, all the boards. I don't see it being a problem.
