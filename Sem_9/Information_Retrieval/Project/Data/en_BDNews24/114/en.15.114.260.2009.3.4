 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has suspended for four weeks hearing of an appeal against a High Court verdict that declared the fifth amendment to the constitution illegal. A full five-strong bench of the Appellate Division, led by the chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, delivered the order Wednesday on an appeal by the government. On Aug. 29, 2005, the High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Huq and ATM Fazle Kabir delivered the verdict that said the fifth amendment was extra-constitutional. The High Court also announced the rules of Khandakar Mushtaq Ahmed, Abu Sadat Md Sayem and Ziaur Rahman from Aug 15, 1975 to 1979 as illegal. A few illegal steps for people's welfare taken during that period were given waiver, however. The High Court said martial law was illegal and unconstitutional, and all laws and proceedings under a martial law were also unlawful. It also said that changes of government from Aug. 15, 1975 to before the national elections in 1991 were unconstitutional. The High Court gave the verdict based on a writ petition lodged in 1977 challenging the number seven martial law regulation (MLR). Attorney general Mahbubey Alam moved argued for the government while Azmalul Hossain was represented the other side. bdnew
