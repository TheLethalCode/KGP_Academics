 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com) - A concerted effort of the government and the opposition could help Bangladesh overcome the aftermath of the BDR mutiny, US ambassador James F Moriarty said on Wednesday. Moriarty, after meeting with opposition leader Khaleda Zia, lauded her offer to cooperate with the government to overcome the crisis. The BNP chairperson and the US ambassador discussed the current situation during the hour-long meeting, he told reporters. Moriarty conveyed the US's sympathy for the Peelkhana tragedy to Khaleda Zia, said her adviser Shamsher Mubin Chowdhury. "The ambassador had underlined the need for the government and opposition to work together so the country's democratic process is not impeded," Chowdhury said. He also emphasised that parliament was the place for discussion, said the adviser. bdnews
