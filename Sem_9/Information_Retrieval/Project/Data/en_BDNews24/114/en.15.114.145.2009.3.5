 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)The speaker was forced to adjourn parliament for a quorum crisis on Wednesday. This is the first time since the new parliament convened under an Awami League government in January that the House could not ensure presence of 60 out of 296 MPs. A quorum crisis in the House was common during the past BNP-led government when the then opposition Awami League had just 58 sitting MPs. BNP MP Shahid Uddin Chowdhury Anny drew the attention of acting speaker Ali Ashraf to suspend proceedings. According to the rules of procedure, the speaker cannot run parliament without presence of 60 MPs. bdnews24.com counted 52 MPs present when Anny drew the speaker's attention. Senior Awami League MPs including deputy leader of the house Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Tofail Ahmed, Abdul Jalil and agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury were present on the front row. Only four BNP MPs were present. Ashraf asked officials, "Please, ring the bell." According to rules of procedure, the speaker can run the House without the presence of 60 MPs if no MP raises the issue for the chair's attention. If an MP draws attention, the speaker must ring the bell for some time to bring the MPs back from the lobbies. If the speaker fails to mobilise 60 MPs, the bell being over, the chair must suspend the House. The speaker urged Abdul Baten, the last speaker on Wednesday's list, to finish his speech. He adjourned the session until 3.30 pm Thursday as Baten finished his speech at around 9.15 pm. The ruling Awami League-led alliance has 261 out of 293 MPs in the ninth parliament. The BNP-led opposition has 31 MPs. Fazlul Azim is now the only independent MP. bdnews2
