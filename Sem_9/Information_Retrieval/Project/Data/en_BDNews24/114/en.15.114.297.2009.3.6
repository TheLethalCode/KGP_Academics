 Dhaka Mar 5 (bdnews24.com) - Another defamation case has been filed against former information secretary ATM Fazlul Karim, also known as poet Abu Karim, who was forced into compulsory retirement last month and sued for 'sedition'. A total of four cases have been filed against the ex-secretary for writing a poem entitled 'Bagane Fute Ache Oshonkho Golap' (Many roses have bloomed in the garden), which allegedly insults Islam, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family. A warrant of arrest was issued against Karim on March 2, in connection with the original case filed by Maulana Ilias Hossain Bin Helali on charges of 'defamation'. Another two cases were filed against the poet for 'sedition' and 'hurting religious sentiment'. Mohammad Ismail Hossain, president of Bangladesh Awami Olama League, filed the fourth case against Karim at the CMM court Thursday. Metropolitan magistrate Konika Biswas set March 31 for hearing of the case. bd
