 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh has been postponed on advice from the home ministry, a BCB official said Thursday. Bangladesh Cricket Board media committee chairman Jalal Younus told bdnews24.com: "The government advised us this morning to postpone the tour and we have acted according to their suggestion." Pakistan were scheduled to arrive here Saturday on a 16-day trip to play five one-day internationals as well as two Twenty20 matches against Bangladesh. It was a reciprocal series for Pakistan, who had earlier hosted Bangladesh in a five-match ODI series last year after Australia rejected their tour of Pakistan on security reasons. Later, at a media briefing in the afternoon, Younus said that their preparations for Pakistan's tour to Bangladesh were in the final stages and the Pakistan cricket team was also ready to tour. "However, the home ministry of the Bangladesh government advised us today (Thursday) to postpone the series for the time being. Accordingly the BCB has deferred the tour. "A suitable new itinerary will be announced as early as possible," said Younus. The decision comes two days after some unidentified gunmen attacked the Sri Lanka team on way to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, leaving six players and an assistant coach wounded. Seven Pakistanis, six policemen and a bus driver were killed in the ambush. Bangladesh has security concerns of its own following the Feb 25-26 mutiny at the headquarters of a paramilitary unit in Dhaka which killed at least 80 people, mostly army officers. Younus said that the ICC had also requested them to prepare a revised security plan for the tour of Pakistan and the BCB was working on it. BCB marketing committee chairman Aziz Al Kaiser Titu said they are now looking forward to organise the series after this month. With the series postponement, the BCB may face paying compensation to broadcaster Nimbus. bdnew
