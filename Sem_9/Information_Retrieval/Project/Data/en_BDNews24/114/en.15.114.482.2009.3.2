 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com) - Fifty victims of the BDR mutiny, including BDR director general Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed and his wife, were buried with state honours on Monday. Among them, 42 officers were buried at the military cemetery in Banani and eight at their village homes, an Inter Service Public Relations press release said. Grieving families, the president, army chief and hundreds of others joined in prayers and a last salute as a namaj-e-janaza was held for the 48 army officers, the DG's wife Nazneen Shakil Shipu and a soldier slain during the Feb. 25-26 armed rebellion at the BDR headquarters. The coffins, draped with national and army flags, were carried in a solemn parade with a guard of honour through the cantonment to the National Parade Ground in the morning. Thousands in subdued mood lined the streets en route. The bodies arrived at the square to gun and air salutes as relatives, friends and colleagues broke down in tears, many clutching wreaths to pay a last tribute to their near ones. The bereaved families, president Zillur Rahman, cabinet members, army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed, air chief SM Ziaur Rahman, navy chief ZU Ahmed, political leaders, freedom fighters and members of civil society joined in the janaza. The khatib of the central mosque in Dhaka Cantonment, Md Mahmudul Haque, conducted the janaza at around 10:45am at the parade ground. Prayers were also held for the salvation of the departed souls. The president and three chiefs of the armed forces laid wreaths on the coffins after the prayers. A wreath was also offered on behalf of the prime minister. bdnews24.com/mr
