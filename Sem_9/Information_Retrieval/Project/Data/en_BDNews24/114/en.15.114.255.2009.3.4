 BIRMINGHAM, England, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was already in talks about moving New Zealand's December tour of Pakistan to Abu Dhabi before Tuesday's attack on Sri Lanka in Lahore, its chairman said. PCB chairman Ejaz Butt told Reuters he would continue to try to persuade nations to tour Pakistan. However the international cricket community, while sympathetic to Pakistan's plight, is reluctant to visit the country in the near future and more top-level cricket is likely to be moved to venues such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. "It's very depressing what has happened and I don't want to look at it as a benefit," Abu Dhabi Cricket Club chairman and Pakistani expatriate Dilawar Mani told Reuters by telephone from the UAE. "However unfortunate, it does seem more the case that Pakistan will be playing at neutral venues," he added. "We are always on the radar for Pakistan and are willing to help them at any time, and we were already in discussions with them with regards to the New Zealand tour and playing the matches in the Emirates so that hasn't changed (because of the attack)." New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said the December tour to Pakistan had been called off. "We are not going, I think that's pretty clear," he told New Zealand radio." Gunmen attacked Sri Lanka's bus with rifles, grenades and rockets, wounding six players and a British coach, while it was being driven to the Gaddafi stadium for the third day of the second test against Pakistan. At least eight people, including six police, were killed in the attack according to Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's office. The test match and tour has now been cancelled. LOST MILLIONS Pakistan meet Australia for five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in April as part of a staging agreement between the PCB and the Emirates Cricket Board. The relationship may become even stronger now. West Indies met Pakistan in a one-day series in Abu Dhabi in November and Pakistan may have to return to the Emirates as a longer-term home venue as in 2002 when West Indies and Australia played Test series there because of security fears. The PCB said afterwards they had lost millions of dollars from the shift and would not agree to such moves again, but they could have little choice. The PCB's broadcast partner Ten Sports were also caught up in the Lahore attack and its staff were forced to lock themselves in a TV control room at the ground. "With the attack happening around the stadium, our staff did not know whether there would be follow-up attacks so they battened down the hatches to stay safe until the area was secure - it's just horrific," Ten Sports Chief Executive Chris McDonald told Reuters from his vacation in New York. Ten Sports staff were due to fly out of Pakistan later on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Ten Sports had just agreed a new five-year broadcast deal with the PCB worth $145 million in November. McDonald said the attack would not harm the contract. "It's too early to talk business after this shocking incident, but we have supported the PCB before and we will continue to do so," McDonald said
