 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith says he expects it should be business as usual within a week as the nation tries to recover from the Feb 25-26 mutiny shocks. "The government as well as business has suffered a stagnation in the aftermath of the BDR rebellion. There has been a feeling of shock, fear and apprehension among people in general," the minister told reporters Wednesday. "The period of inertia will be over in a week," the minister said as he emerged from a meeting with representatives of the Bangladesh Corrugated Carton and Accessories Manufacturers and Exporters' Association. "There will be some budgetary pressure as the government will have to pay the pensions and other financial benefits to the families of the deceased. We hope we'll be able to manage.

Asked about the extent of extra spending, "We have not calculated yet. We have to do the sums." bd
