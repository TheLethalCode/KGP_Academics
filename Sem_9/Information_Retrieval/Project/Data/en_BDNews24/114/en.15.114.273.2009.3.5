 MUMBAI,Thu Mar 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The BSE Sensex sank 2.9 percent to its lowest close in more than three years on Thursday, after a half-point rate cut failed to bolster investor confidence and smother concerns about sagging growth. Foreign funds, who have dumped about $2 billion of stocks this year, were again big sellers on rising aversion to risk amid a gloomy outlook for equities worldwide, traders said. After weeks of speculation, the Reserve Bank of India lowered its short-term lending and borrowing rates by 50 basis points each late on Wednesday, saying the country's growth had been hit more than expected by the global financial crisis and downturn. Banks initially rose on the rate cut but were beaten back, with ICICI Bank tumbling to its lowest in four and a half years and State Bank India plumbing near two-year lows, before pulling back slightly. "A half-point rate cut is not going to work miracles," Gul Teckchandani, an independent strategist, said. Though the lower policy rates could help banks in the long term, credit is still hard to come by now, he said. "More rate cuts are needed." Policy makers expect India's economy to expand at a six-year low of 7.1 percent in the fiscal that ends on March 31, down from 9 percent or more in the previous three years. But private sector economists believe the pace could slow to below 6 percent. Growth in the December quarter was just 5.3 percent. The 30-share BSE index fell 2.94 percent, or 248.57 points, to 8,197.92, its lowest close since Nov. 2, 2005. The benchmark had started up more than 1 percent on the rate cut, but then fell to 8,167.75, the trough since last Oct. 27's intraday 7,697.39 -- a break below which would take it more than three year lows. ICICI closed down 5.2 percent at 269.60 rupees and State Bank shed 2.4 percent to 934.55 rupees. The bank sector index ended down 4.15 percent at 3,728.22 after hitting 3,698.65, its lowest in more than three years, as the outlook for the sector remained bleak. Bond yields pulled back to almost level after falling about 20 basis points initially on the rate cut, with large government borrowing expected to keep prices under pressure. High yields would dent banks' hopes for treasury gains, which have been supporting their earnings in the slowing economy. HDFC Bank slid as much as 6 percent to 791.10 rupees, its lowest in more than two years, before paring losses to 800.70 at close. "In my opinion the interest rate cuts are nothing more than a ploy by the government to borrow cheaper for its own borrowing programme," R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Mutual Fund, said. He said foreign funds were not comfortable with India's swelling fiscal deficit as tax cuts and a slowing economy hurt revenue. "Foreign institutional investors are selling across the board. It looks to me as if they are not comfortable with the Indian market," Gupta said. Data on Thursday showing annual inflation had fallen to 3.03 percent in late February, its lowest since October 2002, had little impact as supporting growth and market liquidity have overtaken inflation as the main policy objective. Top consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd, which had held its ground this year, fell 4.5 percent to 230.05 rupees on concerns of slowing consumer spending. Reliance Industries, India's largest-listed firm with the heaviest weight on the main index, fell 5 percent to 1,149.10 rupees on foreign fund selling, traders said. Twenty-five of the BSE components fell while in the broader market, losers led gainers 1,695 to 700 on light volume of 218.64 million shares. The 50-share NSE Index shed 2.6 percent to 2,576.70. MAIN TOP 3 BY VOLUME Satyam Computer on 8.7 million shares Unitech Ltd on 7.8 million shares ICICI Bank on 7.8 million shares STOCKS ON THE MOVE Drug-maker Ranbaxy Laboratories fell 9.3 percent to 144.40 rupees on media reports the Australian pharmaceutical regulator is investigating allegations by US regulators that one of Ranbaxy's plants falsified data and test results for several approved and pending drugs applications. A company spokesman declined comment on the report. Energy explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp fell 2 percent as Goldman Sachs cut its earnings estimates by 15 percent for the current year ending on March 31 due to falling volume and higher costs
