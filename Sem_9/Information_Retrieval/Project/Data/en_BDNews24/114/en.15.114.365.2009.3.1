 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)The US has renewed its pledge to support Bangladesh in the "tragic aftermath of the BDR mutiny", but stressed that the government and the opposition must work together in such a crisis. On behalf of secretary of state Hilary Clinton, assistant secretary for Asia Richard Boucher phoned prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday and praised the Bangladesh government's role. An embassy statement said Boucher stressed the importance of national unity to overcome the national tragedy. "He emphasised, in particular, the importance of cooperation between the government and the opposition to resolve the crisis," said the statement. Boucher also lauded the government's efforts to assist the survivors, honour those who were killed, and bring those guilty to justice. The state department official reiterated the United States' willingness to render all possible assistance to the government. Commander of the United States Pacific Command, admiral Timothy Keating, wrote to Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed on Feb 28 (Saturday) to express condolences for the loss of life, the statement said. US Ambassador James F Moriarty also spoke with General Moeen on Saturday to applaud his leadership of the military in support of the new democratically-elected government at "this crucial time", according to the statement. The US embassy extended support to Sheikh Hasina's government on Friday, in the wake of the killings of scores of army officers during the Feb 25-26 armed uprising. bdn
