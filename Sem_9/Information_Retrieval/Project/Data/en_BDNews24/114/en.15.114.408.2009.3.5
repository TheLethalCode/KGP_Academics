 BAGHDAD,Thu Mar 5(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb exploded in a livestock market in Iraq's southern Babil province on Thursday, killing 12 people, wounding 40 and shattering a peace that had held in the area for some time, police said. The blast in Hamza, a mostly Shia Muslim town 130 km (80 miles) south of Baghdad, occurred in a region that has been relatively quiet for months amid a general decline across Iraq in the violence unleashed by the 2003 US-led invasion.

US troops currently play a low-key role in southern Iraq after handing over the main responsibility for security to Iraqi forces.
