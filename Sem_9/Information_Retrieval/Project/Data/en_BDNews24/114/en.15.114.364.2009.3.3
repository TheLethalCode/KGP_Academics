 NEW DELHI, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) expressed dismay and sadness after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan team bus in the Pakistani city of Lahore, leaving at least five players wounded and police dead. "We note with dismay and regret the events of this morning in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation," ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement after Tuesday's attack. "It is a source of great sadness that there have been a number of fatalities in this attack and it is also very upsetting for the wider cricket family that some of the Sri Lanka players and one match official have been injured in this attack. "At this time our thoughts and prayers are with the injured people and also the families of those who have died." Five Sri Lankan players were wounded when around a dozen gunmen attacked their bus as it drove under police escort to the Lahore stadium ahead of the third day of the second test. Five policemen were killed in the attack, according to Lahore police officials. "I have confirmed with both member boards that the remainder of the tour has been cancelled and we are working hard to get our match officials out of the area as safely and as quickly as possible," Lorgat said. "I know, also, that the Pakistan Cricket Board is working with Sri Lanka Cricket to make sure the players are flown home at the earliest opportunity." Until the full facts of the incident are established and the players and match officials have returned home safely, the ICC will make no further comment, he added
