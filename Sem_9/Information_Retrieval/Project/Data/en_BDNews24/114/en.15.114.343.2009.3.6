 MULTAN, Pakistan, Fri Mar 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani authorities have identified the kidnappers of an American working for the UN refugee agency but want to avoid any hasty action that may endanger him, the country's foreign minister said. John Solecki, 49, head of the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Baluchistan province, was kidnapped in the provincial capital of Quetta on Feb. 2 by gunmen who ambushed his car and shot dead his driver.
