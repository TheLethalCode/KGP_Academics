<TITLE> Tata to bring Nano to Europe by 2011 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Geneva, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tata Motors plans to bring the Nano, the world's cheapest car, to Europe by 2011, the chairman of India's biggest vehicle maker said on Tuesday. But the European version of what has been dubbed the "people's car" would be different from the one to be sold in India because it would have to meet different safety and emissions standards, Ratan Tata told reporters at the autoshow. "It will not be the same car but it will still be very, very affordable," he said. Tata Motors begins selling the Nano in its home market next month for less than $2,000. Tata said it was too early to put a price tag on the European version, to be called Nano Europa. Tata Motors will be bringing two other models to Europe in the coming years. In 2010, it will introduce an electric car. A year later, it will roll out the Prima, a premium sedan that was unveiled by Tata at the autoshow. Tata Motors already sells four models in Italy, Spain and Poland. They include a hatchback and a pick-up truck.
