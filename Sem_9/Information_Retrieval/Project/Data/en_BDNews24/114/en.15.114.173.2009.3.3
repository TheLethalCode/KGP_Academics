 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has denied an extension of bail to former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in an arms case for which he was sentenced to 17 years. A full five-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, rejecting Babar's appeal for bail extension, ordered him to surrender to the lower court in connection with the case. The High Court had awarded him 6 months' bail in the case on Oct 6 2008. The government appealed against the order on Oct 23, on which the Supreme Court reduced Babar's bail in the case to three months. The BNP leader was convicted in October 2007 to 17 years in the arms case, filed with Gulshan police station on June 3 last year. Baba was present at Tuesday's hearing. bd
