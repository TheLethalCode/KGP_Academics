<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  BDR personnel will resume reporting back to duty at the paramilitary force's mutiny-hit headquarters from 8am Monday. The process was postponed at around 9m Sunday. An army man announced by a loudspeaker that those who could not report were to appear at the headquarters Monday morning. However, hundreds of "non-military staffs" working in various departments of BDR headquarters have not been able to report in line with a government order. BDR troops in their hundreds had gathered to report back to the Pilkhana headquarters Sunday after the government Saturday ordered them to return to duty within 24 hours. More than one BDR man said he had been ordered to take leave again after reporting back. Earlier in the day, bdnews24.com correspondent Syedul Islam Talat reported over 1,000 BDR men in uniform gathered outside the Headquarters to report back to work. "Another 1,000 or so, who are not in uniform but have their ID cards, are gathered at Abahani Sportsground in Dhanmondi," he said around noon. "It looks like two to three thousand BDR personnel will have returned to barracks by afternoon." A home ministry notice issued at 1.30pm Saturday called all BDR personnel, "absent form their posts in the wake of the quelled mutiny" to join their posts within the next 24 hours. The border guards, many "absent without leave", began reporting back to stations in from Saturday evening. Ordered to take leave Sepoy Faruq Laskar told bdnews24.com that after returning to headquarters, army personnel in the compound had questioned him about his actions during the mutiny. "I told them that hearing gunshots on the morning of Feb. 25, I left the headquarters immediately," said Faruq. He said the army personnel at the headquarters gave him a month's leave after he reported back Sunday. "They said they would call me back, if necessary," he said. "Other BDR men, who reported back Sunday, have also been sent on long leave like me," Faruq said. 220 fleeing guards caught The Rapid Action Battalion and police arrested 121 'on-the-run' members of Bangladesh Rifles from the capital, and 99 from elsewhere in the country, up to Saturday evening. The jawans had mostly escaped the BDR headquarters during the 33-hour mutiny from the morning of Feb 25. Dhaka Metropolitan Police said 114 fleeing jawans were caught up to Friday and seven on Saturday from different places across the capital. Most of the arrests were made by RAB who handed the captured over to police, they said. RAB also picked up 99 of the paramilitary border guards from Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, as well as Tangail, Bogra and Rajbari districts, rounding them up from buses and other vehicles that were stopped and searched at various checkpoints. Some were detained with gold ornaments reportedly looted during the mutiny, RAB officials said. All were fleeing in civilian clothes. More than one captured member said they were escaping the BDR headquarters, site of the mutiny, out of fear. bdnews24.c
