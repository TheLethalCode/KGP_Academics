<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board on Tuesday rejected any possible cancellation of Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh to play a one-day international series this month following the heinous attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore. At least 12 unidentified gunmen on Tuesday morning attacked a bus carrying the team near the Gaddafi Stadium that left six Sri Lankan players injured and eight police personnel dead. The Sri Lankans were being driven to Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium for the third day of the second Test. The match has been called off and the cricketers are due to fly home. Besides, the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny in Dhaka also forced many to think that the series against Pakistan would be called off. "At the moment I can tell you that Pakistan will be coming here. Till now we have been not received a request from the Pakistan Cricket Board to cancel or defer the series," said Jalal Younus, chairman of the BCB media committee. Pakistan are scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on March 7 to play a five-match one-day international series as well as two Twenty20 matches against Bangladesh. "We have been preparing keeping the things in mind that Pakistan will come here in line with the previous schedule. "Besides, there is no reason to cancel the series as we have yet to get any directives from the government," said Younus. Sports Minister Ahad Ali Sarker told bdnews24.com that the government has also no plans to cancel Bangladesh's home series against Pakistan. "The Pakistan cricket team will visit Bangladesh as scheduled. Till now it is the government's decision," said the minister. The BCB, meanwhile, has condemned the deadly attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore.
