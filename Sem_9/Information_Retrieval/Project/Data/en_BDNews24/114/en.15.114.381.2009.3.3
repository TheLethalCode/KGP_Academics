 WELLINGTON, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The attack by gunmen on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus in Pakistan on Tuesday was a "frightening" development in sport, New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said. New Zealand's cricketers are no strangers to trouble in Pakistan, cutting short their 2002 tour after a suicide bomber blew up a bus outside the team's hotel in Karachi, killing at least 12 people. Other touring international teams have also been caught up in trouble on the sub-continent but Vaughan said Tuesday's attacks were a new proposition altogether. "It's very frightening that for the first time a cricket team are what appears to be the specific target of terrorist action," he told the New Zealand Press Association. "That's never happened before. Previously all the incidents have been about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. "This is a very different proposition and I think just a very frightening one for world cricket." News of the attack came as New Zealand and India were playing in a one-day international at Napier. Both teams wore black armbands at the change of innings as a mark of respect to the victims. India were supposed to be touring Pakistan but pulled out after the government refused permission due to strained political ties following the militant attacks in Mumbai in November. They extended their tour of New Zealand while Sri Lanka agreed to take their place in Pakistan
