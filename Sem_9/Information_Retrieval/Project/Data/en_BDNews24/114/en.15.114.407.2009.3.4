 ROME, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho courted controversy again on Tuesday when he returned fire on his Serie A rivals in a row over a contested penalty in Sunday's 3-3 draw with AS Roma. Polemics have been flying since 18-year-old striker Mario Balotelli, who scored twice, helped league leaders Inter come back from 3-1 down by converting a penalty after going down in the area.

Instead, the Serie A champions backed their coach, saying in a statement: "Jose Mourinho responded in a clear, explicit way to an attack of the same level. Our coach expressed his ideas, without insinuations, without malice, according to his style, which is much appreciated by the club." Inter and Juve's already fierce rivalry worsened in 2006 when Juve were stripped of the title and demoted in a match-fixing scandal as Inter became champions and signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Patrick Vieira from their riv
