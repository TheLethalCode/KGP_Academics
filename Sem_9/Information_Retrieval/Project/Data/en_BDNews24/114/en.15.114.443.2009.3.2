 BAGHDAD,Mon Mar 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ali Hassan al-Majeed, a former official in Saddam Hussein's regime known as `Chemical Ali,' was given a third death sentence on Monday for his role in killing and displacing Shia Muslims in 1999. "The court condemns Ali Hassan al-Majeed to death by hanging for jointly committing premeditated killing, as a crime against humanity," Judge Mohammed al-Uraibi said. Majeed, a cousin of Saddam, earned his nickname for his role in using poison gas to kill thousands of Kurdish villagers. His previous sentences were for masterminding a campaign against Kurds in the 1980s and killing thousands of Shia in a crackdown on their uprising after the 1991 Gulf War. Those executions have been held up by political wrangling. In the latest case, Majeed was said to have sent the Iraqi military into Shia areas, mainly in Baghdad, to stop people gathering for Friday prayers after the assassination of revered Shia cleric Mohammed Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr. The soldiers opened fire on civilians and destroyed homes in the ensuing clashes. Majeed, wearing traditional Arab headdress and looking frail, said nothing and showed no emotion as charges were read. Of the 14 defendants in the case, two others were sentenced to death and four were given life in prison, including Abed Hamid Mahmoud, who was Saddam's personal secretary at the time. AZIZ ACQUITTED The court acquitted former Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, who also faces another trial for his alleged involvement in executing dozens of merchants accused of breaking state price controls in 1992. "Thank you," he said on hearing the verdict. Majeed's reputation for ruthlessness in crushing his opponents won him widespread notoriety during Saddam's rule. Many Iraqis feared him even more than the leader himself. Eyewitness Yasser Ali al-Wa'ili remembers the 1999 raid in Baghdad's Shi'ite slum of Saddam City, now called Sadr City. "The soldiers blocked the streets and stopped people entering the mosque for Friday prayers. They were shooting and I saw people collapse," he said. "I'm happy now justice is done." The Iraqi High Tribunal was set up after the 2003 US-led invasion to try former members of Saddam's government. It sentenced the former president to death. New York-based Human Rights Watch estimates 290,000 people vanished under Saddam, many of their bodies heaped in ditches. Saddam was executed in December 2006 after being convicted of crimes against humanity for the killing of 148 Shia men and boys after a 1982 assassination attempt. But Sunni Arabs were outraged by a video showing the ousted leader being subjected to sectarian taunts by official observers of the Shia-led governing coalition in his last moments. His half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was executed two weeks later in a botched hanging that tore off his head. Two other members of the former government have also been executed
