 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com) Opposition leader Khaleda Zia has called for resignation of home minister Sahara Khatun for a "proper investigation" into the BDR mutiny. The former prime minister, speaking to reporters at her Gulshan office, also said the prime minister's general amnesty for the border guards should be revoked. "We think reconstitution of the probe committee into the incident by dropping the home minister and the state minister for law was not enough," she said. "The investigation might still be influenced by the home minister; so I recommend the prime minister to ask the home minister to resign for the sake of proper investigation," said the opposition leader. Khaleda said the government has limited the probe committee's 'terms of reference'. "The TOR may give rise to suspicions in people's mind that the government may be covering up the truth or trying to save someone," she said. bdnews2
