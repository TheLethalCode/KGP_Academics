 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Eleven fake revolvers have been recovered at the site of the BDR mutiny, an army officer said Monday. The plastic handguns, difficult to differentiate from real ones at a distance, were found along with abandoned live arms recovered during the ongoing search operation at the Peelkhana headquarters. "These are 'toy' guns," the army officer told reporters at the Rifles Family Welfare Association office, where they were displayed along with 23 rifles, three sub-machine guns, four light-machine guns, 23 grenades and 11 walkie-talkies. But no officials would specify the spot at which the fake guns were recovered. The government and experts have said the mutiny, in which scores of army officers deputed to the BDR were slain, was a "well-planned massacre". bd
