<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Nearly 1600 BDR members who fled their headquarters during or after the BDR mutiny have reported back until Monday evening, an army official said. Upon reporting at the headquarters, most of the BDR personnel, except a number of drivers and cooks, have been ordered to go on leave, an on-duty major said on condition of anonymity. The paramilitary border guards fled the BDR complex during or after the Feb. 25-26 mutiny by renegades that left 77 BDR officers deputed from army killed, while 72 more are still missing. As there are more BDR personnel, in uniform and plain clothes, waiting to report back at the main entrance to the headquarters, the major said they would continue late into night. BDR troops in their hundreds had gathered to report back to the headquarters since Sunday after the government Saturday ordered them to return to duty within 24 hours. The reporting resumed Monday morning after it postponed at 9pm Sunday. bdnews
