 BRUSSELS, Sun Mar 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union leaders, trying to present a united front to stave off recession, were set on Sunday to promise to avoid protectionist measures that prop up national industries but hurt other member states. The pledge was in a draft statement at a summit intended to bridge differences over how to combat the financial crisis and address fears some countries could take steps that undermine the EU commitment to a single market and the bloc's solidarity. The 27-nation bloc's leaders were not expected to set out any quick steps to help central and eastern European member states by offering a regional aid plan or offering to bring them into the single euro currency zone. Warning the recession could cause new divisions in Europe two decades after the collapse of communist rule in the east, Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said: "We should not allow a new 'Iron Curtain' to ... divide Europe into two parts." Addressing such concerns, a draft statement prepared for the summit declared: "The meeting must ensure that maximum possible use is made of the single market as an engine for recovery to support growth and jobs." The Union is split between rich countries such as France which want strong action to buoy industry, and poorer ones -- largely in the east -- who cannot afford such bail-outs. Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, has said EU nations must be ready to help each other but has not explained how. It has resisted proposals such as issuing a eurozone bond to raise funds for worse-off members of the currency zone. "This summit must show that Europe must not be divided into new and old, southern and northern or eastern and western," Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, whose former communist country holds the EU presidency till the end of June, said. COOL ON BAIL-OUT The talks are the latest meeting before the Group of 20 leading and emerging nations meets in London in April to discuss ways to deal with the financial crisis. A French scheme for state loans to its carmakers on the proviso they will not shift production elsewhere has prompted fears that EU governments will rush to protect their own industries at the expenses of others. The EU Commission has backed the scheme, noting the loan agreements do not contain any formal conditions on the location of activities, but has said it will monitor events closely. "We would like Europe to do everything to avoid the temptation of protectionism and egoism," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said after central and eastern European leaders met before the summit. Appeals for a bail-out of Europe's weakest economies are likely to face a cool response at the talks and member states seeking aid are likely to be told they must also put their finances in order. Officials played down chances of European leaders taking any decision on Hungary's call for a 180-billion-euro ($228 billion) aid package for central and eastern Europe, whose currencies have taken a battering as the economic outlook worsens. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the group of euro zone countries, said there was no chance of relaxing criteria to allow would-be euro members to enter the zone faster than current procedures allow. "I don't think we can change the accession criteria to the euro overnight. This is not feasible," Juncker told reporters. Hungary has said the existing two-year preparatory phase for would-be members should be shortened
