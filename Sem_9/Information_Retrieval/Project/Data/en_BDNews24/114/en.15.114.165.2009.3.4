 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) will give the government technical assistance to strengthen the justice system at the grassroots level through village courts. The government signed Wednesday an agreement with the UNDP to implement a new technical assistance project, the UNDP said in a media release. Tthe "Activating Village Courts in Bangladesh" project, jointly funded by the Government of Bangladesh, the European Commission and UNDP, aims to improve access to justice for disadvantaged and marginalised groups, and promote and protect human rights. It will strengthen the village court system primarily in 500 selected Union Parishads across the country, which will enable people at the grassroots level to seek justice remedies in a transparent and affordable manner for matters under the jurisdiction of the village courts. Improved access to justice mechanisms at the local level will have particular impact on the empowerment of women, the poor and disadvantaged groups. The project will also strengthen local government institutions making them more responsive to local needs. The project is valued at nearly Tk 103 crore with some Tk 50 lakh contributed by the government, around Tk 93.4 crore by the European Commission and some Tk 8.9 crore by UNDP.
