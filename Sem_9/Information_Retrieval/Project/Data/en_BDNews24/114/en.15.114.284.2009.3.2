 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  The army on Monday revised the number of its missing officers down to just seven, and that of the dead to 56. On Saturday, as emotions ran high among the ranks after the massacre by the mutineers, the military intelligence chief Brig Gen Mahmud Hossain said 72 were still missing, 63 were dead and 33 officers were found alive. Just two days later, the army's chief of general staff lieutenant general Sina Ibne Jamali released names of the seven missing officers to reporters at a briefing Monday. Col Gulzar Uddin Ahmed, lt col Manzur Elahi, major Abu Sayed Gazzali Dastgir, major Ahmed Azizul Hakim, major Kazi Ashraf Hossain, major Makbul Hossain and captain Tanvir Haider Noor. "Fifty-six bodies of (army) officers have been found. Not 63 (as army intelligence chief)," Gen Jamali said. "Forty officers were rescued alive." Asked by the reporters, the general tried to come up with an explanation. "We took some time to get to this. Those who could give us the information ... we tried to collate various pieces of information ... now we can say only seven are missing ... maybe two-three days later we'll come know about one or two more ... because all these officers came from all over the country ... (they) came from other organisations. There may be errors in case of one or two." Army inquiry The general announced the army's own team of investigators will work to unravel the mystery of the Feb 25-25 mutiny. "An army investigation team led by Lt Gen Jahangir (Alam Chowdhury) will begin work from tomorrow," general Jamali said. Gen Jahangir is a former BDR chief. Border force to be re-branded The general also said Bangladesh's border force might have its name changed. "It may change very soon. That's been the decision." Sunday's meeting with PM The general also answered questions about the three-hour meeting between the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the army officers at Sena Kunja Sunday. "The prime minister came to talk to us. She heard the officers, their woes and complaints. "She assured them of quick steps according to law. "And one of the important steps is a special tribunal. If necessary, the parliament will pass necessary legislation. "(Another is) formation of an independent inquiry committee which will have three officers of the rank of brigadier from our three forces." The government reconstituted the probe body Monday, naming a former civil servant as its chief and dropping both the home minister and the state minister for law. Three representatives of the AFD, the new BDR chief and army's Judge Advocate General were made members of the now 11-strong committee. The previous six-member committee had only one AFD representative. bdn
