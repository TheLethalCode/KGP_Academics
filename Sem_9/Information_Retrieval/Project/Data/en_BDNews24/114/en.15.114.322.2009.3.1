 Liton Haider Chief Crime Correspondent Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)A court admitted Sunday a case filed by Lalbagh police against over 1000 BDR men, accusing them of treason for links to the Feb 25-26 mutiny. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Muhammad Abdur Rahim admitted the first information report of the case filed by Lalbagh police station officer-in-charge Nobojyoti Khisha. Khisha named deputy assistant director (DAD) Touhidul Alam, DAD Nasiruddin Khan, DAD Mirza Mahbubur Rahman, Jawan Abdur Rahim, DAD Jalil (one name given) and Jawan Selim and over a thousand unknown ones. "More DADs may be involved with the incident," Khisa said. DAD Alam had led the rebels to talks with the prime minister on the first day of the Feb. 25-26 mutiny. The news of registering a formal, legally cognisable complaint came immediately after the prime minister left the Dhaka cantonment after what appeared to be an emotion-charged encounter with middle-ranking military officers, who lost over a hundred of their colleagues during the two-day mutiny. The case, however, was registered at 11:30pm Saturday, Khisha told bdnews24.com Sunday. The case said according to information gathered the rebel border guards were instigated by vested quarters to upset the stability of the state and to make unlawful gains. Their action amounted to treason, the case said. The first information report said the filing of the case was delayed since it took time to analyse the situation, gather information on the events and complete official formalities. The Lalbagh police chief also accused "over a thousand" JCOs and NCOs but did not name them, duty officer Tariqul Islam said. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had offered a general amnesty to the BDR mutineers on Feb. 25, but later the government said those directly involved in killings, arson and looting during the mutiny will not come under the amnesty. The government also said the mutiny was a "pre-planned conspiracy". So far, at least 75 bodies, mostly of army officers deputed to the BDR, have been recovered. As the rescue operations are on, the army headquarters said 72 more officers are still missing. The BDR rebels had alleged the deputed army officers were involved in corruption and psychological torture of the BDR personnel for years, an allegation the army has outright rejected. 3 more BDR men held Jatrabari Police Station Sunday arrested three more fleeing BDR men upon surrender. Metropolitan magistrate Shamima Parvin ordered them into jail. The Jatrabari police station sub-inspector in his statement said the three had taken refuge at a house in South Jatrabari. The house owner later informed the police about them. With the three, the number of fleeing BDR men arrested stood at 223 since the mutiny. bd
