<TEXT>
 Madaripur, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  Dense fog forced suspension of operations of river vessels between Maoa and Kawrakandi piers for over five hours early Friday. A thick cloud of fog suddenly covered the Padma early in the morning, making signal lamps invisible. Ferries and launches were stopped at around 4am to avoid accidents, said Alimuzzaman Chowdhury, in charge of Kawrakandi pier of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. Several ferries laden with vehicles were also stranded in the middle of the river then, he said. "Over 500 vehicles were stuck on the both piers during the halt of ferry service," Chowdhury said. The fog disappeared at around 9:30am, and normal service was restored afterwards, he added. bdnews2
