 NEW YORK, Mon Mar 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American International Group Inc reported a $61.7 billion fourth-quarter loss on Monday, the largest quarterly loss in US corporate history, after a revised rescue plan from the US government. The massive loss, equal to $22.95 a share, is the company's fifth consecutive quarterly loss, bringing the total loss over that period to in excess of $100 billion. Investment losses, writedowns and restructuring charges were the largest drivers of AIG's fourth-quarter loss, more than wiping out operating profits posted by its insurance subsidiaries. AIG, the recipient of $150 billion in taxpayer aid last year, on Sunday reached a deal that revises its government bailout to give the company more financial flexibility, and head off rating cuts that could have triggered crippling collateral calls and termination clauses in policyholder contracts
