<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has upheld a High Court verdict ordering reinstatement of ten judges dropped by the past BNP-led government, said attorney general Mahbub-e-Alam on Monday. A full five-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, delivered its five-point verdict disposing of a leave to appeal by 29 serving judges challenging the High Court's verdict to reinstate the ten judges with seniority. Th verdict removed all barriers to appointing the ten as permanent HC judges, their lawyers said. But the judges' seniority will be effective only from the date of their taking the oath as permanent HC judges, they added. The five-point SC verdict ran as follows: 1. It is constitutional practice to appoint judges through consultation the chief justice. 2. This practice forms part of the rule of law by dint of being a constitutional practice. 3. The chief justice's recommendations will be given priority while selecting and appointing judges. The executive wing's opinions will also be sought in scrutiny and verification of the candidates' eligibility. 4. As per Articles 95 and 98 of the Constitution, the judges will take charge of their offices from the day they are sworn in. 5. The permanent appointments of the ten judges will be decided in the light of the above legal criteria. The ten judges names were given as: Abdus Salam, Mamtaj Uddin Ahmed, Shamsul Huda, Faruque Ahmed, Marji Ul Haque, Abdur Razzak, Hasan Fayez Siddiqui, AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury, Abdul Hai and Nizamul Haque Nasim. Shamsuddin Chowdhury, one of the ten judges said, "We are glad that justice prevailed." Dr Kamal Hossain, chief counsel for the ten, told reporters: "The constitutional practice of appointing judges based on the chief justice's recommendations has been formally recognised." Barrister Rokonuddin Mahmud, another lawyer for the ten judges, said the Supreme Court rejected the leave to appeal against the High Court verdict. "The appointment of the ten judges to permanent positions should be an unhindered process." TH Khan, chief counsel for the 29 serving judges, also expressed his satisfaction over the verdict. "The High Court had granted the 10 judges seniority while ordering their posting to permanent positions. But the Appellate Division didn't keep the seniority provision clause." Khan also welcomed the verdict for making the chief justice's recommendations mandatory in recruiting judges. The Appellate Division on July 29, 2007, had stayed the HC order on reinstating the ten excluded judges after the caretaker government and serving judges had filed a petition challenging the verdict. On July 17, the High Court ordered the government to reappoint the ten within a month. The HC in its order directed the government to appoint the judges to permanent positions, and grant them seniority with effect from their date of employment as additional judges. After Monday's verdict, the period of their exclusion from service up to reinstatement will be treated as 'special leave without pay'. The High Court in its verdict had declared illegal their exclusion during the BNP-led government regime. bd
