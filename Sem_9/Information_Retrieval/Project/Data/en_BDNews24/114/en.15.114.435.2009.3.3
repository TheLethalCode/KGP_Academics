 March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five members of the Sri Lankan cricket team were wounded when around a dozen gunmen attacked their bus as it drove with a police escort on Tuesday to a stadium in the Pakistani city of Lahore, officials said. Here are five facts about security concerns over cricket in Pakistan. Sri Lanka's cricket team were touring Pakistan after India pulled out in the wake of the Mumbai attacks in November in which about 170 people were killed. The team agreed to play three test matches and five one-day internationals. Until the Sri Lankan series Pakistan had gone without test cricket for more then a year and was keen to have international cricket at home. Australia postponed a test tour in April 2008 and the International Cricket Council also put off the Champions Trophy after South Africa raised security concerns about playing in Pakistan. The Champions Trophy was then shifted out of Pakistan and no new venue has been decided. Johannesburg, Dubai and Abu Dhabi were being considered as possible venues, the ICC said on Monday. In 2002, a bomb exploded in Karachi while the New Zealand cricket team were touring, killing 13 people including 11 French navy experts. The tourists, based at the Pearl Continental Hotel, were preparing to depart for the National Stadium for the start of a test match when a car exploded outside the nearby Karachi Sheraton. New Zealand called off the tour within hours of the attack. Pakistan is meant to jointly host the 2011 World Cup along with India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The ICC last month asked the organisers to plan alternate venues if it becomes difficult to play in Pakistan due to security concerns
