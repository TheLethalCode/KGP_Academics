<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  The recent BDR massacre was executed to foil the government's efforts to hold the war crimes trial, a minister said Tuesday. "The horrid Peelkhana killings and plundering clearly show that the conspirators active in destabilising the Bengali nation and its language are menacingly strong," Commerce minister Faruq Khan told reporters at his Secretariat office. "Therefore, all of us must stay united and frustrate the villains' evil designs," said Khan. The government measures to take the war crimes trial process forward will be on, "thwarting all the impediments posed by the conspirators", he added. On the Peelkhana killings, the minister said, "The situation there has improved considerably and the government has brought everything under control. "Our allies at home and abroad assisted us in the rehabilitation process." "We have to be extremely careful though." About investigation into the BDR bloodbath, the minister said two separate committees have been formed to probe the events. "Two ministers have been withdrawn from the government's probe team to free it from any partisan bias." Khan said the government hoped the probe committee would submit their findings soon to enable the government to take measures "The government will share the probe findings with the people to a maximum possible extent," he added. bdne
