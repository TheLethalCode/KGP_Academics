<TITLE> India asked not to build Tipaimukh dam before deal: Dipu Moni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has urged India not to construct Tipaimukh dam that will stop water flowing into the country until the negotiations on sharing of Meghna waters are closed, the foreign minister says. Dipu Moni also told parliament Tuesday that New Delhi also agreed to share technical data on the construction of the dam over the river Meghna in the northeastern Bangladesh. The minister spoke after ruling Awami League MP Hafiz Ahmad Majumder asked for diplomatic initiatives to stop India constructing the dam. He said unless Bangladesh lodged a strong protest right away, India would go ahead with the project. "India has assured us that it will not take any initiative which will go against Bangladesh's interest," Dipu Moni said. She said Bangladesh did discuss the construction of the Tipaimukh dam with India at bilateral meetings. She said sharing of Meghna waters would be included in the upcoming meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission. Majumder said India had said the issue would be negotiated when Bangladesh protested the construction of Farakka Dam, but the dam was finally commissioned. "India is going ahead with the (Tipaimukh) project. He said many Indian people are against the project. India undertook the Tipaimukh dam project over the common river Meghna, known as Barak across the border, a few years back. Environmentalists both in Bangladesh and India have been opposing the project over the Meghna fearing adverse impact on environment. Originating in India the river runs through the greater Sylhet before emptying itself into the Bay of Bengal. A good number of rivers and water bodies in Sylhet region are dependent on the Meghna's flow. Bangladesh has repeatedly been urging India to share technical data on the project. But New Delhi is yet to share the data though it diplomatically agreed to provide the same. bd
