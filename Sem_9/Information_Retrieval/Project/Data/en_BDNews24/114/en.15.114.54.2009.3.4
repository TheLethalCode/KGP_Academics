 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission does not foresee a separate authority being needed in the near term for keeping national identity cards up to date. "Though the caretaker government had passed a law for a dedicated National Identity Registration Authority (NIRA), the EC doesn't consider it necessary to establish such an agency right now," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters on Wednesday. "The Commission will continue to issue the NID cards alongside updating of electoral rolls," said Sakhawat. The caretaker government ordinance for NIRA's formation was passed in May 2007. A chairman was appointed in July that year. Md Golam Hossain, the appointed chairman, had previously told bdnews24.com that the authority was supposed to begin working, under the aegis of home ministry, in June 2008 after securing a sustainable and accurate database. "NIRA's efficacy is no more in force," said Sakhawat. "A draft legal framework for EC's continued upkeep of the NID project will soon be forwarded to the ministry." The election commissioner also said directives have been issued to concerned departments and agencies not to make production of NIDs mandatory for accessing government or private sector services. "The EC has taken this decision as the government has yet to issue any gazette notification to this effect," said Sakhawat. bdnews24.com
