 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP staged a ten-minute walkout from parliament Tuesday following a dispute over a derogatory term used by Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury about army officers killed in the BDR mutiny. Ruling party MP Suranjit Sengupta bitterly criticised Chowdhury and termed him a "war criminal". The dispute began at around 7pm when Chowdhury took floor on a point-of-order. He questioned the terms of reference for the home ministry's committee to investigate the BDR mutiny, saying it did not specify any undertaking to detect the killers. He urged the formation of a parliamentary committee to properly investigate the killings of army officers at the Peelkhana headquarters on Feb 25-26. Countering him, Suranjit said, "Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury just two days ago called the army officers killed in the BDR mutiny ' prani (animals)' in parliament." "By use of this term we can understand his view of the martyrs," he said. At one stage of his statement, Suranjit said, "I also understand Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's pain in carrying the stigma of being a war criminal." "It is not fair to ask for clarification from parliament on terms of reference of the home ministry's committee," he said. Another treasury bench MP, Tofail Ahmed, said, "We should not play politics over this issue." "The prime minister has clearly said the perpetrators of the BDR mutiny will be found and brought to justice. The government has already filed a case with Lalbagh Police Station," said Tofail. Chowdhury once again shouted for floor to clarify his position on the allegations, but the speaker denied him, prompting the opposition to leave the House at around 7:15pm. They returned ten minutes later. Speaker Abdul Hamid said he would form a parliamentary committee if the home ministry's committee failed to investigate. bdn
