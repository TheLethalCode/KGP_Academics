 LAHORE, Pakistan (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Sri Lankan cricketer Thilan Samaraweera has been hit in the chest, after gunmen fired on his team's bus as it drove into Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Tuesday, reports Pakistan's Geo TV. Lahore Police chief Habib-ur-Rehman said five people were killed in the attack by a dozen gunmen, who fired AK 47s and rockets and hurled grenades as the bus drove to the 60,000-seater stadium.

"We are trying to bring the team back as quickly as possible," a Sri Lankan cricket official said. Pakistan TV showed footage of gunmen with rifles and backpacks running through the streets and firing on unidentified vehicles.

A witness told Reuters he believed two police commandos were killed along with a regular policeman and a traffic warden. Shopkeeper Ahmed Ali said the two police commandos had been driving behind the team bus when they were hit.
