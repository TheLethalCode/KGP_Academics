 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)Electricity-starved Bangladesh will have to wait much longer now to get two major power plants, planned for long, into production after decision to give more time to prospective bidders. Independent power producers will get another 45 days to apply for pre-qualification in the 450-mw Bibiana power plant project, officials said. "The ministry approved the proposal today, extending the March 8 deadline," Power Cell director General Abdul Jalil told bdnews24.com Wednesday. But there was no decision yet on launching the re-tender process for the 450-mw Serajganj power plant. Last December, the caretaker government ordered re-tender for both plants. The process had started way back in late 2007. Power officials say the proposal from Malaysia-based Powertek Consortium, the lone bidder, for the plant in Bibiana, Habiganj, was shot down in November last year by the cabinet purchase committee for high price. Powertek offered US$ 4.399 per kilowatt/hour, revising an earlier rate of US$ 4.53. Four bidders were initially pre-qualified, but only Powertek came up with a price offer. Its partners were South Korea's state-owned Korean Electric Power Company and Germany's Siemens. The deadline for the Serajganj plant was Jan 31. Of all the pre-qualified bidders, only Powertek said it would pursue the project. The government decided to go for re-tender for both in December, even before the expiry of the Serajganj deadline. "If Powertek did submit the bid for Serajganj, it would in all probability be the same rate as Bibiana," one senior official explained. "So the government decided to call re-tender for both even before the deadline ended."
