<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has sought forensic expertise from the US and UK to trace and identify the bodies of army officers killed in the Feb. 25-26 BDR mutiny. Foreign minister Dipu Moni sought the assistance as US ambassador James F Moriarty called on her at the foreign ministry Monday. "We know that a number of dead bodies could not be identified. The family members of the victims have the right to know about their dear ones," Dipu Moni told reporters the meeting. "That is why I have sought further forensic support from the US and UK, though Bangladesh has some forensic expertise." She made the request to the UK as British high commissioner Stephan Evans met with her Sunday night at her office in parliament. The minister said the government also asked the two countries for assistance and cooperation from the FBI and Scotland Yard to investigate the BDR mutiny. "The foreign minister asked for assistance for the ongoing investigation. I assured her that I will do my best to pass the formal request to my government," Moriarty told reporters after the meeting. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday told parliament that her government would involve the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to probe the mutiny that left scores of army officers dead in the capital. The bodies of at least 64 army officers have been found so far, buried in shallow graves in the BDR compound or floated away to the Buriganga banks. Over 70 army officers are still missing since the two-day armed rebellion was quelled.
