 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)  The customers opposed a proposal Wednesday to hike the power price of Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited in a public hearing at Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) office. DPDC proposed to increase the electricity price from 10 percent to 14.77 percent in last November. BERC chairman Ghulam Rahman told bdnews24.com they heard the opinions of the customers and DPDC. A decision would be made in 90 working days after the 'open meeting' held on Jan. 11, he added. The customers were represented by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Consumers' Association of Bangladesh. They said the systems loss that now was 23 percent should be cut down to 15-16 percent and in that case there was no need to push the price. DPDC argued in the public hearing they took the liabilities of DESA and needed to pay an additional Tk 15 crore according to price fixed by Power Development Board. Another power distribution company Dhaka Electricity Supply Company also proposed a price hike. Both DPDC and DESCO are distributing power in capital and adjacent areas.
