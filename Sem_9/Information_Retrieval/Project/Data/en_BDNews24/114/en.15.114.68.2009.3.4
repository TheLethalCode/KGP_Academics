 DURBAN, South Africa, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security has been increased for the South African and Australian cricket teams ahead of the second test in Durban following Tuesday's attack on the Sri Lankan side in Pakistan. "It's a big reality check, a big wake-up call and it shows that all measures have to be taken to avoid teams being at risk and we need more caution wherever we go," South Africa captain Graeme Smith told Reuters on Wednesday. "Even in South Africa, security was stepped up around us yesterday and maybe the ICC (International Cricket Council) needs to have certain security requirements in place wherever you go." Around a dozen gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan team's bus in Lahore, wounding six players and a British coach and killing seven Pakistanis as they were being driven to the Gaddafi stadium for the third day of a test match. "The terrible attack was obviously a major talking point for the team as we travelled down to Durban and it was pretty emotional because it resonated with us," Smith added. "It was only in September 2007 that we were travelling down that same road in Lahore and to picture yourself sitting in the bus preparing for the day's play and a rocket and a grenade fly past the window is pretty scary." Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said rash decisions should not be made about future events in the sub-continent but security needed to be reassessed. "It would be irresponsible to look as far ahead as the 2011 World Cup (due to be partly hosted by Pakistan), but we need to think long and hard about the dangers that are out there," he said. "Security probably needs to be beefed up, and even here in Durban that has happened just to make the guys feel more secure. "It was really saddening to see what happened and it was very close to home for us because there were Australian umpires involved and our physiotherapist, Alex Kountouris, worked with the Sri Lankan team for five years so he knows a lot of the guys very well," Ponting added. The second test between South Africa and Australia starts on Friday. Australia lead the three-test series 1-0
