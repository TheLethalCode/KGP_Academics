<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday said in parliament that her 50-day-old government focused more on saving thousands of innocent civilian lives while dealing with the Feb 25-26 mutiny, which she said was "completely pre-planned massacre". "I decided to talk myself ... I'd talk with anyone, I thought, to save lives, to save the families, to save the soldiers," she said, replying to charges that she made a tactical mistake by not using force. In her first public remarks since the speech Thursday, she said she did not "waste a single moment" before taking steps and recalled that the rebels were "threatening to shoot anyone" in case of a move to use force. "You must surrender, release the hostages, release the officers," Hasina quoted herself as telling the 14 BDR men she had negotiations with on Wednesday just hours into the crisis. "That's why these families survived ... these little children survived. "What else could we have done?" She said: "This is unprecedented that we have been able to end such a mutiny and the hostage crisis at such a short time." "This was completely pre-planned murder," she said. "I won't say anything now, since the investigation is on," the prime minister said as she referred to those "who organised cars, boats to help them flee". Phone conversation with Gen Shakil The prime minister disclosed for the first time she had talked on the phone with the slain BDR chief Shakil Ahmed, who she said she knew personally. "He is first cousin of one of our MPs (from Brahmanbaria)." "Gen Shakil told me: 'we are under attack, being shot at'." Hasina said she ordered immediate action, asked army and RAB to rush. Her military adviser Tarique Ahmed Siddique, a former major general, first broke the news to Hasina at around 9:30 am and then called the army chief. "How long would it take? I asked the army chief. (I was told) it'd take one to two hours," she said. "We talked to air force. RAB was late, said they got stuck in traffic. "The rebels meanwhile were threatening to kill anyone who would try to advance towards them. "We called Shakil again, several times, but there was no answer," the prime minister said of the first minutes. "I called the three chiefs to a meeting." No mercy for killers "Now they are nitpicking," she retorted, replying to opposition leader Khaleda Zia's charge that amnesty decision was wrong and that use of force would be a better option. "The amnesty will not apply to those who killed, arsoned, looted. "We do not spare killers. They have the record of not trying killers. "Her husband (slain president general Ziaur Rahman) did not try the killers (of August 15, 1975). "He rewarded the killers instead. He gave them diplomatic jobs." Past killings "What happened in 1977? How many military officers got killed?" she said, speaking of the 21 coups and counter-coups Bangladesh has witnessed in its 38-year history. "As many as 565 air force officers were killed by hanging in one incident." "So many of those who actively took part in the liberation war were killed. US-UN help sought The prime minister said she had already sought assistance from the US and UN to probe the BDR murders. She told parliament Sunday that she had asked a senior US official for helping with the investigation into the incidents that saw 135 army officers killed or missing. "I have had discussions with (assistant secretary of state) Richard Boucher today (Sunday). I told him I want FBI assistance in the probe," the prime minister said. "I'd also like Scotland Yard (of the UK) to help us, and I have already sought UN support," she said. No provocations, please The prime minister stressed that all other institutions such as the armed forces, RAB, police, Ansars, VDP must maintain discipline. "They must not respond to any provocation. They must learn from this incident," she said. "They must beware of those who wanted to benefit politically." Monument for mutiny victims The prime minister promised a monument to the mutiny martyrs. "All the names of those who died will be there." The families each will get Tk 10 lakh from the government, she said, in addition to the army's Tk 5 lakh. The children will get free education. Meeting with army officers Referring to her meeting at the Sena Kunja earlier in the day, she said she had wanted to listen. "I am an elected representative of the people, I am the prime minister, I am the defence minister, I am the daughter of the Father of Nation ... I told them I'd listen," she said of her decision to go to the Dhaka cantonment and meet hundreds of emotion-charged officers. Of the dead, she said: "Many of them were known to us. Our own relatives. Even five of my daughter's in-laws were killed." She did not disclose what she heard during nearly three hours with the military officers, but said "what I heard there has been echoed here in parliament" in a clear reference to Khaleda Zia's statements that preceded hers. bd
