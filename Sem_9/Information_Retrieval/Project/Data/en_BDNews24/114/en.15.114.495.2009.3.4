 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com) Sanath Jayasuriya arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday, a day after terrorists attacked the Sri Lankan team in Lahore, to play for Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Premier Division Cricket League. The veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder will play his first match against Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium on Thursday. Jayasuriya along with Arjuna Ranatunga had earlier played for Mohammedan after helping their country to clinch the 1996 ICC World Cup. Mohammedan began their campaign with a tie against Young Pegasus and now have five points from six matches, seven points behind joint leaders Bangladesh Biman and holders Abahani. Biman, however, have played a match less than Abahani's seven. The left-hander, who has been out of the Sri Lankan Test squad since December 2007, was supposed to come here earlier but he was engaged in South African club cricket instead. A club official said that it was still unclear whether Jayasuriya would play in the remaining league matches. bd
