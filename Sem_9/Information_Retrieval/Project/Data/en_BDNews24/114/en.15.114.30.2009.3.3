 LAHORE, March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Pakistan board official has urged the international cricket community not to isolate the country following Tuesday's militant attack on the Sri Lankan team that left six players wounded and five policemen dead. "I will only say what happened today is a great tragedy," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of human resources Wasim Bari told reporters. "But at a time when terrorist attacks are taking place all over the world, Pakistan cricket should not be abandoned or isolated." The former test captain said he was greatly encouraged by statements coming out of Sri Lanka that they did not regret visiting Pakistan for the test series and urged for support rather than rejection. "It is very easy now to just say 'lets stop going to Pakistan'," he added. "But we need the support of the international cricket community. We can still hold international matches. Terrorists have tried to hit cricket targets in other countries as well." Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam said his team had been fortunate that they left for the ground five minutes later then the Sri Lankans. "Both teams normally leave together for the stadium but today we decided to go late," he said. "But when we were on the mall we heard about the attack and were told to return to the hotel," Alam added, while lamenting the sudden end to a series both teams were enjoying. "We have been in touch with the Sri Lankan players and officials and we have done our best to show them our support.
