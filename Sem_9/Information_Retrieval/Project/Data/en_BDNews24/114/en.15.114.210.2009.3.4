 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government has plans to bring power from Nepal and Bhutan as part of regional cooperation, prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament Wednesday. She spoke of the government's plan to build a nuclear power plant in Rooppur, Pabna to "reach electricity in every household". "We have been hearing for long that a nuclear power plant will be built in Rooppur. Now we want to do something. We want that power is produced in Rooppur." She also said her administration was looking at short, medium and long-term plans to meet power demands by 2014. She referred to the power system master plan of 2006 and said the country would be needing highest 6066 MW by 2009, 9776 MW by 2015 and 13993 MW by 2020. The short-term plan includes installation of eight independent power plants, capable of producing 176 MW, by June, she said. Under the plan, the government would produce an 11-megawatt power plant at Ullapara, 11 MW in Habiganj, 22 MW at Feni grid sub-station, 11 MW at Mohipal, 33 MW at Mawna, 22 MW at Barabkunda, 33 MW at Rupganj and 33 MW at Jangalia. The short-term plan also includes three-year 214 MW rented power generation. To achieve the goal, a 34.5 MW power plant would be set up in Bhola, 22 MW in Bogra, 50 MW at Fenchuganj, 55 MW at Ashuganj and 55 MW at Shikalbaha. Besides, the prime minister said, the government would produce 146 MW power by installing 86 MW rented power plants at Shahjibazar, 10 MW at Kumargaon and 50 MW at Fenchuganj under a 15-year rented power generation plan. The government would also set up a 210-megawatt power plant at Siddhirganj. If these plants were established, the government would be able to get 570.5 MW power within June this year, Hasina said. The 86 MW power plant at Shahjibazar had already started generating power on Feb. 9, she pointed out. Under the medium-term plan, a total of 960 megawatt power would be added to the national grid by 2012 from July this year, Hasina said.
