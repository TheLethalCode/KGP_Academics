<TITLE> Virus forces Murray out of Davis Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andy Murray has withdrawn from Britain's Davis Cup match against Ukraine this weekend after failing to recover from a virus, officials said on Monday. The world number four pulled out of last week's Dubai Championship and will also miss the Europe/Africa zone Group One second-round tie being played near Glasgow. "Andy's condition hasn't improved," Murray's spokesman told the Lawn Tennis Association's website (www.lta.org). "After daily visits from the LTA doctor and a number of medical tests, Andy has been told to rest for at least seven days to overcome his virus." Murray said: "I'm very disappointed I won't be playing ... but the doctor has told me I need complete rest for at least seven days and I have to respect that. "I hoped that pulling out of Dubai when I did would give me enough time to recover but this virus has hit me harder than any illness I've had before and I still feel terrible. "Missing out on a home tie is tough for me but more than anything I'm sorry for all the people making the journey who had hoped to see me play in the team."
