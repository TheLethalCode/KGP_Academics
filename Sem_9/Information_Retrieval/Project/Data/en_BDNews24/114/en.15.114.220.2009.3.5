<TITLE> Former Merril execs invested in Madoff funds: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Thu Mar 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top former Merrill Lynch executives, including two former CEOs, invested in hedge funds that lost money with alleged fraudster Bernard Madoff, becoming the highest-level Wall Street victims of the scandal to date, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Former chief executives Daniel Tully and David Komansky and former investment-banking chief Barry Friedberg personally invested in the funds, set up by former Merrill brokerage chief John Steffens, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC collapsed after the 70-year-old Wall Street trader was arrested and charged on December 11 last year with securities fraud.

He said he invested with Steffens because "you back people you know and trust." Komansky could not be reached to comment, the paper said. While $35 million in Madoff investments amounted to just 4.4 percent of Spring Mountain's $800 million in hedge-fund fund-of-funds investments, Madoff represented as much as 7 percent of at least one fund, the Journal said. Ten days after the Madoff scandal broke in mid-December, Steffens announced plans to close down the Spring Mountain funds of hedge funds, even though some had positive returns, it said, adding that it was not clear how much money the executives may have
