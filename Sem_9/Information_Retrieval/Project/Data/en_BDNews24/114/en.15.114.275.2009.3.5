 COLOMBO, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's world record bowler Muttiah Muralitharan believes security for players and officials must be tightened, while insisting that South Asia should continue to host cricket despite Tuesday's militant attack. Muralitharan was on the Sri Lanka team bus that was ambushed by gunmen in Lahore, Pakistan on Tuesday and while six of his team mates and a coach were wounded, the spinner is adamant that the sport must continue to be staged in the region. "If we stop playing in Asia then world cricket is finished," Muralitharan told Reuters on Thursday. "We cannot let terrorists stop cricket, but we must take greater care over security." Muralitharan, who holds the record for most wickets in both test and one-day internationals, highlighted the importance of planning ahead to ensure maximum safety. "We need to think very carefully what can be done to secure stadiums and also protect cricketers as they travel," he added. "We need to consider bullet-proof transport, proper security protection with well-trained commandos and the complete closure of roads when teams travel to the stadium. "Had we had such protection in Pakistan, then I don't think we could have been attacked in the way we were." Muralitharan, who escaped without a scratch, said he was very fortunate to survive. "I was close to Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) and Tharanga (Paranavitana) in the bus... I heard all the guys getting hit one-by-one and was waiting for my one," he said. "To be honest, I thought I was going to die. We must have all have done some good things in life to be spared.
