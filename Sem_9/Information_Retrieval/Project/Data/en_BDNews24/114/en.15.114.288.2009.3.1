 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to remove disparity in a long-standing subsidised food scheme for the police force. The finance ministry has given all-clear to the plan that will cost an extra Tk 30 crore a year. A finance ministry order Sunday said the inspector general of police and an ordinary constable would now be allowed the same quantities of essential food items at subsidised cost. The allowance has been hiked 19 percent for ordinary policemen, said the order. Previously there were two levels of subsidies: one for the IGP down to gazetted inspectors, and one for police sub-inspectors down to constables. The subsidy is now divided into four blocks for a single policeman to a four-member family, with no more than four members of a family to receive subsidy. A single policeman will now get a monthly allowance of 11 kg rice, 12 kg wheat, 3.5 kg lentils, 1.75 kg sugar, 2.50 litres edible oil, and 37.5 kg fuel at low cost. A four-member family will get 35 kg rice, 30 kg wheat, 8kg lentil, 5 kg sugar, 8 litres edible oil and fuel as needed at subsidised prices. Policeman say, to date, allotment for a single policeman of SI down to constable rank wase 20 kg rice, 8kg wheat, 0.5 kg lentil, 1 kg sugar and 2 litres edible oil. A four-member family drew 20 kg rice, 25 kg wheat, 8 kg lentil, 2 kg sugar and 4 litres edible oil every month. The new allowances will cost an extra annual expenditure of Tk 30 crore, raising the total cost of the scheme to Tk 182 crore a year, said the ministry. bd
