<TITLE> Woodgate relishing chance to repeat League Cup success </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's patched-up defender Jonathan Woodgate is hoping their resilience against the 'big teams' this season means the holders can triumph over Manchester United in Sunday's League Cup final. "We play well against the big teams, we've proved that this year. Maybe we are the underdogs but we don't mind that," said Woodgate whose extra-time headed goal clinched a 2-1 victory over strong favourites Chelsea in last year's final. "Getting the winner was a great feeling. It was a great moment in my career," Woodgate told reporters at the club's training ground ahead of the match. "You want to win as many competitions as you can and I haven't done that. "There is a lot more pressure on us this year to do it and a lot of players thrive under pressure," added the 29-year-old who lifted the first major trophy of his career last year when Spurs picked up their first silverware since a 1999 League Cup win. ADVERTISEMENT Woodgate, who has had a chequered career plagued by injury and a much publicised conviction for affray, was playing only his fifth game for Spurs after moving from Middlesbrough but has since become the rock in their sometimes porous defence. Sporting six large stitches across his forehead after a nasty collision with team mate Vedran Corluka in Monday's vital Premier League win at Hull City, he was looking forward to another Wembley final this time against the league champions. EXCEPTIONAL BUNCH Spurs are 13 places below Premier League leaders United, who are still on track to win five trophies this season. But while United manager Alex Ferguson said he would start with youngsters such as Darron Gibson and Danny Welbeck, his Spurs counterpart Harry Redknapp, who has several players injured or cup-tied, will put out the best side he can muster. Woodgate said United would be tough whoever they select for the first major final featuring the two famous teams. "They're an exceptional bunch of players, every single one, even the young players who come in they're brilliant and they've got the (winning) mentality running all the way through the club," he said. "I think Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs have been exceptional for them and they must be learning off them and there couldn't be anyone better to learn off than those three. They will probably win the European Cup this year as well." Woodgate, who has also played for Leeds United, Newcastle United, Real Madrid and England, said his move to London from Middlesbrough a year ago had not yet felt like a step up. "I think when you look at it on paper it has been a step up but if you look at the way we've played it hasn't really been much of a step up if I'm going to be honest," he said. But he still harbours high hopes that Tottenham can be successful in the future starting at Wembley on Sunday. "The club is trying to move in the right direction. The potential is there to do it and we've got the right manager in charge." bdnews24.com/sh/1455 h EI/Sport Lucky strike gives Juventus victory over Napoli ROME, Mar 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus cut Inter Milan's Serie A lead to six points by beating Napoli 1-0 with a lucky strike from Claudio Marchisio on Saturday. The midfielder scored on the stroke of halftime with a shot from outside the box that looked to be going wide before taking a deflection off Napoli's Manuele Blasi. Earlier, visiting keeper Nicolas Navarro did well to keep out a David Trezeguet shot from close range and an Alessandro Del Piero free kick. Napoli's eighth consecutive away defeat will increase the pressure on coach Edy Reja, whose side have dropped to 11th after picking up two points in eight games. Inter can regain their nine-point advantage over second-placed Juve by beating AS Roma at the San Siro on Sunday (1930). "We played an excellent first half. After that Napoli came out, they lost their initial nervousness and poured into our half," Juventus coach Claudio Ranieri told Sky television. "The goal at the end of the first half was providential. We built our victory on that." Elsewhere, Mauro Zarate struck twice as Lazio beat struggling Bologna 2-0 to move up to seventh. The Argentine forward ended his goalless spell, which stretched back to December, by curling in a free kick on 36 minutes and chipping his second with nine minutes to go after a one-two with Tommaso Rocchi. Lazio's first league win at home in two months made it a bitter return to the Stadio Olimpico for Bologna boss Sinisa Mihajlovic, who played for the Rome side between 1998 and 2004. Midfielder Massimo Mutarelli came on in the second half to make his debut for Bologna against the club he took to a tribunal to free himself from his contract. EI/Sport Real close gap on Barca with 10th straight win MADRID, Mar 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid registered their 10th league victory in a row to reduce Barcelona's lead at the top of the Primera Liga to four points on Saturday, Guti and Raul scoring for the visitors in a 2-0 victory over Espanyol. The champions had looked short of ideas for more than an hour in Barcelona before midfielder Guti came off the bench to score a superb free kick in the 70th minute and striker Raul sealed the win two minutes later. Barca, who were beaten 2-1 at home by city rivals Espanyol last weekend, can restore their seven-point advantage with victory at Atletico Madrid on Sunday (1800 GMT). Espanyol made the brighter start at the Olympic Stadium and almost scored on six minutes when Iker Casillas was forced into a reaction save from a glanced Roman Martinez header. But neither side came close to breaking the deadlock until Guti, recently back from a lengthy injury layoff, replaced Wesley Sneijder just before the hour. He won a freekick in a central position and although goalkeeper Carlos Kameni got a hand to his curled long-range effort, he could only deflect it in to the top left corner. Raul doubled the lead soon after when he stroked Marcelo's pass low past Kameni from the edge of the area. "We're just taking each match one by one and collecting the points as we go," Raul said in a television interview. "I think Barca are in good shapethey have some great players and a top coachbut we are definitely making things difficult for them." STYLISH DOUBLE Barca lead the standings with 60 points from 24 matches with Real in second on 56 from 25 and Sevilla third on 47. Fourth-placed Villarreal (41) play at Betis on Sunday and Valencia, in fifth (39), host Real Valladolid. Earlier on Saturday, Frederic Kanoute scored a stylish double to help Sevilla to a 2-1 comeback victory at Athletic Bilbao. Sevilla enjoyed more possession in the opening stages but it was the home side who struck on 26 minutes. Andres Palop got a hand to Igor Gabilondo's low shot but the ball squirmed over the line into the bottom corner. Kanoute produced a sublime piece of control to create the equaliser five minutes before the break. The Mali international took the ball down in the penalty area, shrugged off a defender and slammed the ball past Armando. He twice went close before grabbing the winner just before the hour when he picked up a Ndri Romaric pass and drove the ball into the bottom left corner. Sevilla return to the San Mames on Wednesday to play Athletic in their King's Cup semi-final second leg with the Andalusians leading 2-1 from the first leg. EI/Sport Hertha go top with win over Moenchengladbach BERLIN, Mar 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hertha Berlin returned to the top of the Bundesliga with a 2-1 home win over bottom side Borussia Moenchengladbach while lacklustre Hoffenheim dropped to third after a 0-0 draw at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Hertha's Andriy Voronin struck after 28 minutes against the run of play when Cicero's sharp through ball found the Ukraine forward who chipped the ball over goalkeeper Logan Bailly for his seventh goal of the season. A minute before halftime Patrick Ebert played a beautiful ball to Pal Dardai who doubled Hertha's lead with a low drive before the visitors pulled one back with a Michael Bradley penalty in the 69th. The speedy Voronin, on loan from Liverpool, was a constant danger despite being a lone striker because attacking partner Marko Pantelic is still out injured. ADVERTISEMENT Moenchengladbach, who were much improved in the second half, came close to equalising several times through veteran Oliver Neuville and the talented Marko Marin but stay on 16 points. In the final minutes, Hertha could have extended their lead but Bailly, outstanding throughout, twice denied Raffael and Valeri Domovchiyski. "For me it was no surprise that it became tight towards the end," said Hertha coach Lucien Favre. "But it was hugely important to get the three points after our defeat against Wolfsburg (last Saturday)." Hertha, on 43 points, are two points ahead of Hoffenheim. Second-placed Hamburg SV host VfL Wolfsburg, who are fifth, on Sunday when champions Bayern Munich, in fourth, visit mid-table Werder Bremen. DIP IN FORM In a scrappy encounter in Dortmund, Hoffenheim, who have now gone four matches without a win, failed to impress yet again in an error-strewn performance lacking spark and inspiration. Dortmund settled for their 12th draw in 22 league matches this season but looked the livelier side with Tamas Hajnal the provider behind forwards Mohamed Zidan and Nelson Valdez. Even when Hoffenheim striker Chinedu Obasi came on for the struggling Boubacar Sanogo, the visitors failed to find the form that had previously taken them to the top of the Bundesliga. "Despite being better in the second half we had far too many wrong passes to get anything out of this," said Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick. Both teams finished with 10 men after Hoffenheim's Tobias Weis saw red for violent conduct and Dortmund's Sebastian Kehl was sent off for a second booking, both in the 77th minute. Bayer Leverkusen suffered a setback in their race to stay in touch with the top sides, losing 1-0 at Hanover and dropping one place to sixth on 36 points. Schalke 04 moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while VfL Bochum won their relegation battle with Energie Cottbus 3-2 after twice falling behind before Marc Pfertzel's penalty 11 minutes from time snatched the points. EI/Sport Liverpool lose at Boro, Chelsea go second LONDON, Mar 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool's lingering Premier League title hopes virtually disappeared on Saturday when they lost 2-0 at Middlesbrough as the home side secured their first league win in 15 matches. Liverpool's second league defeat of the season leaves them on 55 points, seven behind leaders Manchester United, who play Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup final on Sunday and now have a game in hand. Chelsea climbed above Liverpool into second place on goal difference after an injury-time header by Frank Lampard gave them a 2-1 home win over Wigan Athletic. Aston Villa, fourth on 51, host Stoke City on Sunday and Arsenal's chance of catching them suffered another setback when they were held at home by Fulham for their fourth successive goalless Premier League draw. Arsenal were booed off and are now just two points ahead of sixth-placed Everton, who beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0. For once, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger did not blame the opposition's negative approach for his team's failure to score. "Fulham played well, it was not a 0-0 game. It could have been 2-2 but we lacked fresh legs," Wenger told Sky Sports. Liverpool's failure to win the league for 20 years while continuing to taste success in the Champions League has been encapsulated by their performances in the last week. On Wednesday they humbled Real Madrid in their own stadium but that triumph was sandwiched between a 1-1 home draw with Manchester City and Saturday's defeat by a Middlesbrough team who had not managed a league goal since Jan. 10. Recent history, though, suggested Saturday's result was not so much of an upset because the five times European champions had won only once in their last nine visits to Middlesbrough. OWN GOAL Boro went ahead after 32 minutes when Stewart Downing's cross hit Xabi Alonso's thigh and flew in for an own goal. The second came after 64 when Jeremie Aliadiere cut the ball back for Turkey forward Tuncay, who calmly converted. Morocco's Nabil El Zhar missed a sitter for the visitors when he fired over from close range, while Dirk Kuyt also missed a great opportunity late on. Both chances were created by Steven Gerrard but the midfielder, making his first start for almost a month, limped off 15 minutes from time with what appeared to be cramp. "We knew we'd have to be at our best, we a were a threat going forward and were strong defensively as a team," said Boro manager Gareth Southgate. "It was an important win for us, we've had four clean sheets in our last six, that's given us the confidence and now we are starting to score," he added after the victory moved his side out of the relegation zone. John Terry's deflected first-half volley put Chelsea ahead against Wigan. Steve Bruce's seventh-placed side have proved difficult opponents this season though and equalised through Olivier Kapo in the 82nd minute, only for Lampard to win it at the death. Bruce was furious the referee didn't punish Lampard for a push on Mario Melchiot before he headed the winner. "I don't blame Frank but the referee is standing 10 yards away. I just can't understand why he doesn't give it," he said. Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink recognised the title remained a long shot. "Let's be realistic, we're depending on the loss of points by United and then we have to win our own games," he said. "United are very stable but as long as it's possible we don't give up." EI/Sport Nakamura hits hat-trick as Celtic hammer St Mirren 7-0 LONDON, Mar 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura hit a hat-trick as Celtic thrashed 10-man St Mirren 7-0 on Saturday to close within four goals of Rangers at the top of Scottish Premier League. St Mirren had Jack Ross sent off in the first half at 1-0 for a last-man foul on Scott McDonald and although St Mirren goalkeeper Chris Smith saved Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink's penalty, Celtic eventually made the visitors pay. A Nakamura double put the home side 2-0 up at halftime and they ran riot after the break when Scott Brown weighed in with a brace and Nakamura completed his treble. Celtic, who led the league by seven points two months ago, are level with Rangers on 60 points after their rivals won 1-0 at Hamilton thanks to a Barry Ferguson strike but their goal-fest has made things even tighter at the
