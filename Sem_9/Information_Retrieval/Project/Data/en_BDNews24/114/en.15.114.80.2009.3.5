<TITLE> SEC approves book building rule </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com)The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a regulation to introduce book building for pricing IPOs (initial public offerings), an official said Thursday. "The SEC hopes to introduce the new pricing method within three months of the gazette being published," SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters after a meeting Thursday. The book building process offers a price band, between the floor price and a cut-off price, within which investors are allowed to bid. The final price is determined by the issuer only after closure of the bidding. The issuer usually appoints an investment bank to act as 'book runner'. The process aims at tapping both wholesale and retail investors for efficient price discovery. "The present fixed price process for IPOs will also remain," added Farhad. The present process has issuers propose a fixed price in their prospectus, which the SEC approves if it finds the price in line with the company's fundamentals. Farhad said profitable companies were reluctant to float shares through fixed price issues as a huge difference is often seen between the IPO price and closing price after the first few trading days. "Companies with a net worth of Tk 30 crore or more and no accumulated losses can opt for book building issues in raising capital," he said. They would have to offer shares worth either 10 percent of the paid-up capital or Tk 30 crore whichever is higher, he said. "They also have to hold annual general meetings on time and verify their accounts through SEC certified auditors." According to the new law, merchant banks (except for the issue manager or 'book runner'), banks, financial institutions, insurers, recognised pension and provident funds and stock exchange dealers would be able to take part in the bidding. "Foreign institutional investors, institutional venture capitalists and any other organisation can also bid for shares after getting SEC approval," said Farhad. The cut-off price for the bids would be the offer price for retail investors, he added. Book building is a common practice in developed countries and is recently being introduced into emerging markets, including India. The whole process is done on-line. New IPO Thursday's meeting also approval for a Tk 4.5 crore IPO of Rupali Life Insurance. The insurer with a paid up capital of Tk 3 crore has been permitted to float 4.5 lakh shares with face value of each share at Tk 100, said Farhad. bdn
