 By Sumon K Chakrabarti NEW DELHI, March 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh on Sunday took back 49 citizens, out of more than 400, who were pushed back into Indian waters by Thailand as they tried to make their way to Malaysia in December last year. Among the 400 illegal immigrants, almost 300 were feared dead near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after drifting through the high sea on a non-mechanised boat provided by Thai authorities. They were rescued, from aboard the boat and nearby islands in the archipelago, in a joint operation launched by Indian Navy and Coast Guard. "The Indian authorities sent us a list of 67 people who had claimed that they were Bangladeshis, but we could confirm the citizenship of only 49. We are taking these people back to Bangladesh on Sunday," said a senior official of the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata. The remaining illegal immigrants, still in Indian custody, are Rohingyas from Myanmar. The 49 Bangladeshis were brought to Kolkata by ship from Port Blair on Saturday. On They left for Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh early Sunday morning. The surviving immigrants alleged that they were brutally tortured in Thai custody. "We started our journey on 30th November from Cox's Bazar area in mechanised boats on our way to Malaysia. We paid 'touts' between Tk 20,000 and 30,000 each to get a job there. But we were apprehended by Thai Navy and kept in isolation on an island", said Mohammed Atik, whose family is in Chittagong. "The Thai authorities kept us lying on the sand throughout the day. If someone moved his head a little bit, 5-6 police brutally beat him", added another labourer from Cox's Bazar. Abu, another Bangladeshi immigrant who was handed over Sunday, said: "We were asked to sit in chest deep sea water till 10 o'clock in the night." "We were forced to keep the wet clothes on. The Thai police didn't spare us for the slightest deviation of their orders. And they used to give us food only once  that too only rice and dried fish." After this ordeal in Thailand, the illegal immigrants were forced to board a non-mechanised boat  with their hands tied. A couple of sacks full of rice and five drums of drinking water were provided for the 412 people. "We were stacked like cattle  there were at least two people above me on the boat, which a Thai Navy vessel piloted to the high seas. Then our hands were set free and we were left on our own. We didn't know which way to go", another Bangladeshi said. "The food was exhausted in two days. And we were also exhausted. Many of us fell unconscious," said Atik. They were eventually rescued by an Indian navy ship, but haven't heard from their family members since they left their homeland. "I don't know whether my wife and my children know that I am alive or not", said Abu
