 Abdur Rahim Harmacchi bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com) - The global recession has yet to affect remittances, one of the economy's main indices, the central bank boss said Tuesday. "However, we're constantly observing whether there may be any negative impacts in the coming days," Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. "The most important thing to consider here is the situation of our workers in the Middle East." "If our workers are pushed back home because of the global recession, especially from the Middle East, then our remittance flow will suffer," he said. The governor was optimistic that FY2008-2009 would see $9 billion, $1bn more than the previous fiscal year. According to central bank figures, overseas workers sent back $784.5 million in February, compared to $689.3 million in the same month last year. January saw a record $859 million in remittance. As much as $6.15 billion was sent back by Bangladeshi workers overseas in the first eight months (Jul.-Feb.) of the current fiscal year, 28 percent higher than the same period in FY2007-2008, central bank figures show. bdne
