 NEW DELHI, Thu Mar 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will bid for freedom hero Mahatma Gandhi's personal belongings which are to be auctioned in New York on Thursday, the country's cultural affairs minister said. The iconic leader's trademark wire-rimmed glasses, a pair of worn leather sandals, a pocket watch and a metal bowl and plate are up for sale in New York.
