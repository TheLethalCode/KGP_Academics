<TITLE> Ramdin's letter shows confidence and thanks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After he finished breakfast at his hotel on Sunday morning, West Indies wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin sat down and wrote a little note of thanks. On the piece of paper, in thick marker pen, he thanked fellow Trinidadian and former West Indies bowler Ian Bishop, the team's assistant coach David Williams and his team mate Ramnaresh Sarwan. The note turned out to be timely -- it was taken out of his pocket on the square at the Kensington Oval as Ramdin celebrated his maiden test century. Although few will have been able to make out the words "Thanks Bish, Willy and Ronnie" -- the message got across. "They are the three guys who have played an important part for me. Getting ready for that big knock I believed I could do it and then I was guided out in the middle by Ronnie (Sarwan)," said Ramdin. Ramdin's 166 was more than double his previous best test score of 72 and it came as part of a 261 run partnership with Sarwan that helped lead West Indies to a mammoth 749 for nine, putting England under heavy pressure on the final day, trailing by 143 runs. "Everything takes its time and this was meant to be," said Ramdin, "As I go along things will get better. In the years I have played I've learnt a lot from guys from our team and guys I've played against about building an innings," he said. He had the perfect maestro to learn from at the other end. Sarwan now has scores of 106, 94 and 107 and 291 in this series -- 598 runs at a remarkable average of 149.50. BIGGEST CHALLENGE The trio of advisors told Ramdin his biggest challenge was improving his shot selection. "They've been looking at the way I play and telling me I have the ability to bat long periods of time. "It's about choosing the right balls to go after and if I go in with a batter to try and learn from him, try and pick up certain things like which bowler to attack and how to get off strike," he said. All those were patently visible in Ramdin's patient and focused innings and he showed he can score quickly by hitting the 66 runs that followed his hundred at a run per ball. On Monday, Ramdin will have his keeping gloves on as West Indies look for the wickets that could bring them an unlikely victory, in the test and the series, which they currently lead 1-0. Sarwan believes there is a chance of doing what no team has ever done in test cricket -- clinch victory having had 600 scored against them in a first innings, drawing inspiration from England's collapse to 51 all out in the first test in Kingston. "Anything is possible, we all saw what happened in the first test in Jamaica and the lead we have is very valuable to us. "Hopefully we can get the ball in the right areas and get in the wickets. The wicket has deteriorated a little, a few are keeping low. "I don't know if Jamaica will play on their minds, but certainly it will be in our minds. If we can put them under some pressure hopefully we can take the initiative in the first hour or so.
