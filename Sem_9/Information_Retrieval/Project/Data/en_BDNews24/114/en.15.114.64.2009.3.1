<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)MPs joined in expressing deep condolences Sunday for the families of the scores of military officers killed in the Feb25-26 mutiny at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters. Parliament's sitting began at around 3:30pm with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair and the tabling of a condolence reference. The speaker in his statement termed the killings "barbaric" and said the patience shown by the members of the armed forces was "praiseworthy". He hoped that the command of BDR should be restored in a way so that such a tragic incident was not repeated in future. Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, who returned to parliament for the first time since BNP's walkout in late January, demanded that all MPs should be given the chance to speak. Hamid had earlier invited only the leader of the House and the leader of the opposition to speak. He later allowed both the opposition and treasury bench MPs to take the floor. Commerce minister Faruq Khan, chief whip of opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque and Jatiya Party lawmaker Ruhul Amin Hawlader spoke before the break for Asr prayers. bdn
