<TITLE> Chopper delay puts UK Afghanistan troops "at risk": lawmakers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A failure by Britain's Ministry of Defence to get new transport helicopters into service has put the lives of soldiers on the frontlines in Afghanistan at greater risk, British lawmakers said on Thursday. In a damning report on procurement, a leading parliamentary committee accused the defence ministry of bad decision-making bordering on "irresponsibility" in the purchase of 14 U.S.-built helicopters, ordered more than a decade ago. Manufacturer Boeing delivered the Chinook choppers in 2001, but eight of them could not be put into service because software needed to modify them for special operations was not supplied since it was not specified in the contract. Eight years on, the helicopters remain under wraps in hangars, unfit to be flown at a time of ever-increasing demand from military commanders in Afghanistan for airlifts. "The story of the MoD's programme to make airworthy eight Chinook Mk3 helicopters...has been one of bad decision-making to the point of irresponsibility," said Edward Leigh, the chairman of parliament's committee on public accounts. "The consequences have included a shortage of helicopter support in Afghanistan, thereby heightening the risk to the lives of British troops." More than 8,000 British troops are serving in Afghanistan, with the vast majority in Helmand, a large province in the south of the country that stretches along the length of the Helmand river valley, where the Taliban remains strong. The lack of roads, the danger of attack from militants when moving forces on the ground and the sheer scale of distances involved mean helicopters are vital for almost all operations. Since Britain joined the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, 149 soldiers and Marines have died. In a statement issued before the committee's report, The Ministry of Defence dismissed the criticism as "nothing new" and said the eight Chinooks were expected to be in service by 2010. "Our priority is on giving military commanders in Afghanistan the helicopters they need," said Quentin Davies, the minister for defence equipment and support. "We have already increased flying hours and helicopter numbers in Afghanistan by 60 percent over the last two years." The military does have a handful of Chinooks in operation, but the constant need for servicing means only some of them can be used at any given time and demand for them is very high. Special forces operations have been particularly affected. As a result of the contract delays, the cost of the eight Chinooks has risen to 422 million pounds ($600 mln), from an original 259 million pounds, up nearly 70 percent. Leigh said the saga had shown how important it was for the MoD to minimize the number of modifications it requests from manufacturers when buying off-the-shelf equipment.
