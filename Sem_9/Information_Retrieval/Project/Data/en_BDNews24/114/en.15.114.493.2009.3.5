 By Andrew Heavens KHARTOUM, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A decision by International Criminal Court judges to issue an arrest warrant for Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir could bring further turmoil to Africa's largest state and the surrounding region. BASHIR WILL WANT TO FIGHT ON It is unlikely Bashir will go quietly. He has seen off other challengers in almost 20 years in power. Insiders say a crunch meeting of senior members of Bashir's dominant National Congress Party in mid January agreed to back him in the immediate aftermath of the court decision. Some supporters of the International Criminal Court's move hope it will eventually persuade Sudan's politicians to hand over their leader in a palace coup, end the festering conflict in Darfur and do more to repair relations with the West. But potential plotters and opposition groups will hedge their bets, waiting to see how events play out. They will be watching for any signs of weakness from Bashir, harsher sanctions from abroad, and challenges from rebel groups. If Bashir hangs on in defiance of the court, his government could slowly retreat into bitter isolation that may worsen the Darfur conflict and undermine the deeply troubled peace deal with southern Sudan. Over time, hard-liners in the extensive security establishment could gain the upper hand. Bashir could look to elections scheduled for 2009 to show he is a popular leader with a democratic mandate. Sudan will seek to build up its relations with China, Russia, members of the Arab League and African Union who opposed the ICC case, and also with Iran. MORE CONFLICT Once freed of a feeling it needs to pander to the West, Khartoum could mobilise its militias to achieve what some still think is a viable military solution to the Darfur conflict. Darfur rebels will be emboldened by the court's decision. The Justice and Equality Movement has already threatened to repeat its May attack on Khartoum. A tentative agreement signed between JEM and Khartoum in February, that was supposed to pave the way to peace talks, will come under pressure. Neighbouring Chad could step up its support of insurgent groups. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended two decades of civil war between north and south Sudan in 2005, could be in greater danger as both sides focus on internal battles at the expense of preparations for elections in 2009 and a referendum on southern secession in 2011, both promised under the pact. Anti-Western groups blamed for a bomb plot against embassies in 2007, and the killing of a U.S. diplomat in 2008, could take advantage of the atmosphere. Embassies, U.N. agencies, peacekeepers and aid groups are already on high alert, fearing attacks on foreign staff. Intelligence cooperation with the West against Al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups could cease. DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION While Bashir remains in power, the arrest warrant means the West has lost one of its strongest negotiating cards with Sudan -- the offer to normalise relations. The new U.S. administration could still offer Sudan the carrot of removing the country from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. But early statements from President Obama and his team suggest they plan a tougher stance on Sudan. Sudan may continue to push members of the U.N. Security Council to use their powers to postpone the ICC case, but this has so far been resisted by Western members of the council. Western powers will face questions over whether they can continue to deal with a wanted president or fund elections and other projects involving his regime. China's stance will be key. So far, the permanent member of the UN Security Council has opposed the arrest warrant, saying the move would bring turmoil to Darfur. But its support for the regime may waver if unrest arising from the ICC case endangers China's oil interests and workers in Sudan. Sudan's African neighbours will be torn between protecting themselves from any Sudanese conflicts overflowing their borders and looking for ways to exploit unrest for their own ends. Other African countries, who opposed the ICC case through the African Union, may start reconsidering their membership of the International Criminal Court. Some of the 30 African countries who signed the founding statute of the International Criminal Court may start reconsidering their involvement. Many states already feel the court's investigations to date have unfairly targeted the contin
