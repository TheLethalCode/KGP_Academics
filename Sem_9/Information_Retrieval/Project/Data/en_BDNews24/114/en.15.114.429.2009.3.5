 By Kamran Haider LAHORE, Pakistan, Mar 5 (bdnews24.cm/Reuters) - Pakistani police were searching on Thursday for a breakthrough in their investigation nearly 48 hours after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team and then melted away. The ambush on the team and its police escorts as they drove to the main stadium in Lahore has shocked the cricket-mad country and raised new fears about nuclear-armed Pakistan's ability to overcome the militant threat. Seven Pakistanis, six policemen and the driver of a bus carrying match officials, were killed in Tuesday's attack.

"It's correct that we were forewarned ... there were many pieces of information which came to us," he told Dawn Television. Pervaiz did not elaborate but said security for the team could have been "much, much better." The government of Punjab province, of which Lahore is capital, has offered a reward of $125,000 for information on the attackers, who were armed with AK-47s, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grena
