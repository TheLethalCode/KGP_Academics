<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government must admit its failure in resolving the Feb. 25-26 crisis at the BDR headquarters, the main opposition BNP chairperson said Thursday. The perpetrators of the massacre must not be let off the hook, Khaleda Zia also said, as she led a mourning procession for the BDR mutiny victims, mostly army officers deputed to the border force. She warned the government that if the perpetrators were spared history would one day brand it as a traitor. The mourning procession started from BNP's central office in Naya Paltan in the city at around 5:30pm. The BNP supporters across the country also took out mourning processions around the same time, BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said. At least 62 army officers were either murdered or missing in the mutiny by the renegade border guards. Khaleda visited the bereaved families of the dead army officers and conveyed her sympathy Tuesday and Wednesday. bdnew
