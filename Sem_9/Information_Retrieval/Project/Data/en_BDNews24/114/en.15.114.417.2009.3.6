<TEXT>
 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)The government is checking out the feasibility of constructing another runway as per master plan at Zia International Airport, which handles 400 flights a week, Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh officials said Thursday. ZIA should be offering a lot of additional facilities befitting an international airport, once another runway is added, especially during any emergency when a runway goes inoperative., they added. "We have already formed a committee headed by AKM Mahabub Alam, member, administration, CAAB, who will submit a feasibility report as soon as their scrutiny of and sifting through the relevant data is done and the recommendations made," said M Naim Hasan, member, operation and planning, CAAB. "The ZIA master plan has kept the provision for two runways. Therefore, we're checking out the feasibility of the second one. He mentioned the availability of land for constructing another runway at ZIA. "We have space for the second runway. Some houses built in the vicinity of the airport may impede the construction of a second runway. "The committee is determining the number of such houses and the extent of possible relocations." Highlighting the advantages of an additional runway, he said, "Having two runways can be quite helpful and at times of emergency when the runway in use has to be shut down, it should serve as a much-coveted bail-out." "There aren't any planning or budgetary provisions for the envisaged second runway till now though." ZIA began operating in 1980 with a 10,500 feet runway and three taxiways. In 1983, it was christened Zia International Airport after the slain president Ziaur Rahman. According to CAAB, the government in 2005 demolished 12 contiguous high-rise buildings. But to date, 20-25 multi-storied buildings including the Lotus Tower, Nitol Tower and RAJUK trade centre still scrape the ZIA skies posing risks to the flights landing and taking off, officials said. CAAB officials added that eventually hundreds of buildings raised in Uttara and Nikunja residential areas may prove to be obstacles to the second runway. Bangladesh has three international and five domestic airports. It also has seven STOL ports (short take-off and landing)
