<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com)  The legal hurdles to resume hearing of the appeal of the convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case are set to be removed with the appointment of two judges to the Appellate Division, two senior lawyers said. The government appointed Wednesday senior High Court judges Shah Abu Naim Mominur Rahman and Md Abdul Aziz to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. "Now there are possibilities of a resumption of the final hearing of the case at the Appellate Division," the chief counsel of Bangabandhu (independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) murder case, Anisul Haq, told bdnews24.com Thursday. "Once the chief justice orders constitution of a bench, there will be no more bar in resuming the hearing of the appeal," additional attorney general M Enanyetur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The High Court in 2001 gave the final verdict on the case, but during the BNP-Jamaat alliance rule the hearing of the appeal was suspended after a few judges felt embarrassed and also on a lack of required number of judges. Three judges of the now seven-strong Appellate Division cannot hear the appeal, as chief justice MM Ruhul Amin and justice MA Matin felt embarrassed in delivering verdict. Justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim delivered verdict after two High Court benches had given split decision, Haq said. He said the new bench will have three judges from among justices Md Tafafazzal Islam, Jainul Abedin and the two new judges. The trial court gave verdict in the case in 1998 and the High Court delivered its judgement in 2001 on appeals by the convicts. Six years later, in 2007, the Appellate Division admitted the appeal of the convicts for hearing against that ruling, which is yet to start. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president, was killed along with most of his family members on Aug. 15, 1975 in a military putsch. Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed' government passed the indemnity ordinance in November that year, barring trial of the killers. The Awami League government cancelled the indemnity law in 1996 to clear the way for trial. Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case, naming 20 as accused, with Dhanmondi Police Station on Oct. 2, 1996, 21 years after the carnage. Police pressed charges on Jan. 15, 1997 against the accused, the trial started on Mar. 12 in the Dhaka Sessions Judge's Court. The court framed charges on April 7. On Nov. 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul handed down death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused. Four jailed accused Maj (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (sacked) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the verdict. On Dec. 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split judgement in the case. Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentence of 10 accused, while Justice ABM Khairul Haque upheld death sentence of 15 accused. On Apr. 30, 2001, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentence of 12 accused and acquitted three others. Of the 12 accused who got death sentence in the final verdict, four jailed accused submitted leave to appeal in the Appellate Division in the same year. Lancer AKM Mohiuddin, who also was sentenced to death, appealed from jail after he was extradited from US, on June 18 last year. Of those sentenced to death, Lt Col Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Col Majed are absconding. Lancer AKM Mohiuddin was arrested in the US on March 13 and sent to Bangladesh on June 17. Absconding accused Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. bdnew
