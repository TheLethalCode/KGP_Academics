<TITLE> FACTBOX - Likely scenarios after India's general election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi Mon Mar 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) India will hold a general election between April 16 and May 13, election officials said on Monday, kicking off a mammoth process in which 714 million people will be able to cast their votes in the world's largest democracy. The main battle will be between the Congress-led coalition and the main opposition bloc, headed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Here are the three most likely outcomes of the election which will determine who will head the next government, according to pollsters and political analysts. CONGRESS-LED ALLIANCE: The incumbent United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the Congress party wins the biggest number of seats. It may also have to rely on support outside the coalition, such as the communist parties that propped up the government from 2004 to 2008. This time, its former leftist allies, who quit the coalition over a civilian nuclear deal with the United States, may be hesitant about joining the government once again. This means smaller regional parties, like the Dalit-based Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by the controversial Mayawati, could become power brokers. BJP-LED ALLIANCE: The National Democratic Alliance, led by the Hindu-nationalist BJP, wins the biggest number of votes. Again, it could have more than 50 percent of seats or be dependent on a tie up with a regional party. THIRD FRONT: If the UPA and the NDA fail to cobble together a coalition -- or between them win less than half the total number of parliamentary seats -- then a loose alliance of smaller parties could win power. In India, these parties are known as the Third Front. Chief among them are the communists, who thwarted several pro-reform policies of the UPA and pulled support over the nuclear deal. They have strongholds in three Indian states where they usually win enough seats to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. The Mayawati-led BSP or the Samajwadi Party, based in populous Uttar Pradesh, could also play a major role in this government. The parties would choose a prime minister after post-poll negotiations
