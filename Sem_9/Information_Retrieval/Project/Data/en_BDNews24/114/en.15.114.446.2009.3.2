 HONG KONG, Mon Mar 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fire-related injuries are a major cause of death in young women in India and many are a result of kitchen accidents, suicides and domestic violence, a study has shown. Using data from urban hospitals and results from a survey covering rural populations, researchers estimated that there were about 163,000 fire-related deaths in India in 2001, which made up two percent of all deaths in the country. In an article published in The Lancet, they said the figure was six times higher than that reported by Indian police. Of these, 106,000 involved women, 57 percent of that number were women between the ages of 15 and 34. The average ratio of fire-related deaths of young women to young men was 3:1. "Such a high frequency of deaths in young women suggests that these deaths have common causes involving kitchen accidents, self-immolation, and different forms of domestic violence which may include dowry harassment that leads to death," said the team of researchers led by Prachi Sanghavi of Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States. A dowry death is the killing of a young woman by members of her husand's family for bringing insufficient dowry and is commonly carried out by first dousing the woman with kerosene and then setting her alight, the researchers said. "Some studies further suggested that fire-related homicides are often disguised as accidents and suicides," they wrote. In urban areas, fire-related injuries were responsible for 26 percent of deaths in women in the 15-24 age group, and 22 percent in the 25-34 year category, making them the leading cause of death in these age groups. In rural areas, fire-related injuries were responsible for respectively 13 and 12 percent of all deaths in women in the same age groups. The researchers called for more effort in distinguishing between fire-related accidents, suicides and homicides, and in discerning between unintentional and intentional injuries. Clues may be found in autopsy reports as they often noted "kerosene smells and prior removal of jewellery." "For intentional injuries, detailed interviews with survivors, and kin and neighbours of victims, can give some indications of the victim's environment," they wrote. "These deaths are preventable with effective policy measures," they wrote, adding that there must be immediate action to identify populations at risk so that urgent interventions can be implemented
