<TITLE> DSE moves against non-performing Z-category shares </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka Stock Exchange has decided not to include non-performing Z-category shares in the daily top 10 gainers list, a top official has said. The bourse also agreed to de-list the Z shares and halted trading of such nine companies over the last few days. "By no-performers, we mean those companies that do not have any operation or production, but only exist in papers," DSE president Rakibur Rahman said at a press briefing Wednesday. Z category scrips are companies that do not declare dividends and regularly hold annual general meetings. The Z-category shares require investors to be more careful in their investments in scrips of such companies. If a company fails to resolve investors' grievances, the authorities may suspend trading in the scrip. The chief of the country's prime bourse said these non-performing Z shares "abnormally influence rise and fall of the indices". Rahman said the bourse management believed when the market performed well a certain quarter hiked the demand for such Z shares. "It encourages investors to bet money on those scrips," he added. The nine companies are Rahima Food, Mona Food, Bionic Sea Food, Amam Sea Food, Quasem Silk, M Hossain Garments, Dynamic Textile, Saleh Carpet and Bangladesh Electric Meter Reading Company. "By halting trades of these companies we want to send to investors a clear message to not trade in such non-performing Z shares." On de-listing, Rahman said from now, they would rigorously follow the process. "The de-listing process may start within a day or two...companies falling under one or two of the criteria would be taken off the bourse." He also said meetings between the DSE board and merchant banks, financial institutions and other stakeholders would start next week in a bid to find ways to improve the market.
