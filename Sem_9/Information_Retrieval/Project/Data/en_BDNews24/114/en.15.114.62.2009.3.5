 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com)MPs have unanimously called for reinstatement of Bangladesh's membership in the Commonwealth Parliament Association (CPA) and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). They took a resolution moved by chief whip Abdus Shahid. Bangladesh was suspended from the CPA and the IPU in 2007 for failing to hold parliamentary elections for more than two years. The MPs vowed to work together to continue with democracy as they took part in the discussion. Speaker Abdul Hamid read out the chief whip's proposal. "The opinion of this parliament is that the membership of Bangladesh Parliament should be reinstated in the Commonwealth Parliament Association." The proposal was unanimously adopted by voice vote. The MPs authorised the parliament secretariat to send a copy of the resolution to the CPA headquarters. The MPs also took a similar resolution, moved by whip Mujibul Haq, to get back the IPU membership. "Let us promise that we will work together so that we must not lose our CPA and the IPU memberships in future," BNP's Jafrul Islam Chowdhury said. "We are yet to cultivate the habit of parliamentary democracy," Abdul Jalil said. "We hope that democracy we have achieved under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina will not be killed by anyone," said Jalil. "Let democracy live long," added foreign minister Dipu Moni. "We support this proposal," BNP's MK Anwar said. "Only reinstatement is not enough. We have to make parliament the centre of all discussion. "I hope under your guidance we will be able to make parliament centre of all discussion," he said. bdn
