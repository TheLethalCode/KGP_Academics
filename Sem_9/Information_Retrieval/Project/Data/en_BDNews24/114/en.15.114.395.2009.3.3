 JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiery fast bowling from Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle led Australia to a 162-run win over South Africa on the fifth and final day of the first test on Monday. The home team, chasing an improbable victory target of 454, were bowled out for 291 as Johnson (4-112) and Siddle (3-46) put Australia 1-0 up in a three-match series that will determine which of the two teams tops the world rankings. South Africa began the day on 178 for two but lost batsmen at regular intervals after Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis batted through the first hour to extend their partnership to 76. Amla fell for 57 when he hit paceman Siddle to Phillip Hughes at mid-wicket. First-innings centurion AB de Villiers was next to go, trapped leg before for three by Andrew McDonald. Kallis went for 45 in the third over with the second new ball, playing a ball from left-armer Johnson on to his stumps. JP Duminy and Mark Boucher held Australia up with a stand of 39 for the sixth wicket before the former was removed for 29, edging Siddle high to Ricky Ponting at second slip. Hughes took another catch at mid-wicket to dismiss Morne Morkel for two off Johnson. Boucher followed for 24 just before tea, bowled through the gate by Ben Hilfenhaus. Siddle dismissed Paul Harris for eight after the interval and Johnson wrapped things up by bowling Dale Steyn for six. Hilfenhaus also finished with two for 68. The second test in Durban starts on Friday
