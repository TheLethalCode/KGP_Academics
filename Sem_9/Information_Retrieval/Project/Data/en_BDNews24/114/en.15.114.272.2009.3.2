<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islam has demanded a probe committee into the BDR mutiny comprising the judiciary, defence forces, law enforcers and representatives of all parties in parliament. Jamaat amir Motiur Rahman Nizami, in a press conference Monday, also put forward 12 questions to be answered by the prime minister including why "no actions" were taken by the government on the first day of the mutiny. He asked, "What was the rationale for declaring amnesty after learning of the atrocities?" He also demanded answers to:  why the army was prevented from taking action  why the time for surrendering of weapons was extended  why thousands of BDR men were allowed to flee  the questions around the 'leader of the rebels' DAD Touhid  why rescue operations were delayed after the home minister declared that the situation was under control "The people want answers to these questions and that is the responsibility of the government," said Nizami. He criticised private Indian news network CNN-IBN for trying to link Jamaat-e-Islami to the BDR mutiny. He also accused India-based Bangla-language daily Anandabazar of being involved in the malicious "anti-Islamic" campaign. "Through this false gossip, efforts are underway to turn the events towards a different end." He said the ruling party was following the old culture of pointing fingers of blame at the opposition. "This revolt was instigated by those who want to make Bangladesh into a subservient nation and this heinous act was perpetrated to weaken our armed forces," said Nizami. He said calls for limiting army influence on BDR and strengthening the border force was logical. "The present incident carries similarities to the Nov 7 1975 revolt, when leaflets on behalf of a political party were distributed calling for the killing of army officers." Calling the present situation grave, he asked all to unite, forgetting their divisions. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Md Mujahid, assistant secretary general M Qamruzzman and others were present at the press conference. bdnew
