 Sirajganj, March 4 (bdnews24.com)At least eight people were killed as a salt-laden truck lost control and ploughed into a ditch in Kamarkhand on Wednesday, said police. The Bogra-bound truck coming from Chittagong lost control on the Jamuna Bridge Western Link Road, and crashed into the roadside ditch at around 6am, Md Rawshan Mostafa, Jamuna Bridge West police chief, told bdnews24.com. "Seven people were killed on the spot and another six injured," said Mostafa. One of the injured died on the way to Sirajganj Sadar hospital, he said. Only one of the deceased could be identified immediately after the accident, as 30 year-old 'Yousuf' from Jhajhira village in Sherpur, Bogra. The bodies were being kept at Sirajganj Sadar hospital morgue for post mortem, said Mostafa. The police chief said five people were injured in a separate accident, just half an hour later. A Dhaka bound bus coming from Bogra collided head-on with a speeding truck at around 6.30am, at Nalka on the Sirajganj-Hatikumrul section of the same highway. The injured have also been admitted to Sirajganj Sadar hospital for treatment, said Mostafa. bdnews2
