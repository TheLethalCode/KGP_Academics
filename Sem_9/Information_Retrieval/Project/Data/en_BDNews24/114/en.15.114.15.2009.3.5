 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)The speaker adjourned parliament for ten days on Thursday to avoid holding another session before the special budget session in June. Speaker Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com the House would sit again from 4.45 pm on March 15. He said the current session could run until the end of March subject to the approval of the business advisory committee, which decides the working days of each session. Parliament cannot break for more than 60 days between sessions, said Hamid. "If the current session ran until the end of March, the second could begin by the end of May."

This is the second time since Jan. 25 that the working days of the current session have been changed. The first meeting of the business advisory committee on 28 Jan. decided the session would run until Feb 26.
