 Dhaka, march 2 (bdnews24.com)  The government has ordered the armed forces to assist the civil administration until all fugitive BDR personnel are rounded up, the home minister said Monday. The police and Rapid Action Battalion have been taking all measures to find and arrest the rebel border guards fleeing since the Feb 25-26 mutiny, said Sahara Khatun. The home ministry in a statement issued Monday asked members of the public to inform nearby police stations immediately if they have any information on border guards who escaped during the armed rebellion that left 77, mostly army officers, dead. Military will be deployed indefinitely to help 'hunt down' the rebels and retrieve firearms missing in the wake of the mutiny. "I have given instruction," the home minister told reporters. When pressed on how long the army would be deployed, the minister said: "They will stay until all the fugitive BDR personnel are arrested." On steps against the renegade BDR troops, the minister said: "A case has been filed against 1,000 border guards in connection with the mutiny. Other required measures are being taken." Hundreds rounded up The Rapid Action Battalion and police have arrested and detained hundreds of 'on-the-run' border guards since the mutiny. The personnel had mostly fled the BDR headquarters during the 33-hour mutiny. "Most of them were caught trying to leave the capital," said Masudur Rahman, Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional deputy commissioner Saturday. "The arrests were mainly made by RAB who handed the captured members over to police," said Masudur. "We have sent them to the court", he said. RAB rounded the fleeing troops mainly from buses and other vehicles that were stopped and searched at various checkpoints out of the capital. Some were detained with gold ornaments reportedly looted during the mutiny, RAB officials said. All were fleeing in plain clothes. More than one captured BDR man said they had fled out of fear. bdne
