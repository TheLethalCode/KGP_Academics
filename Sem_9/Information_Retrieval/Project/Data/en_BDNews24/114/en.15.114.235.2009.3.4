<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament Wednesday the BNP-Jamaat coalition government destroyed all the institutions by politicising them. "So, we are now facing an almost impossible situation to run the country." She accused them of massive corruption and said not a single watt was added to the national grid although Tk 20000 crore was spent on the power sector. "They will be brought to justice." "They [BNP] rigged elections. To protect their rigged votes, the Janatar Manch was set up then," she said, her voice laden with sarcasm, on a question from a BNP MP who said a judge appointed to the Supreme Court during Awami League rule was involved with Janatar Manch. The Manch was formed by some top-ranking officials in the administration when the Awami League-led movement against the BNP government reached climax in 1996. "The gangs of Nazmul Huda (former BNP communications minister) went to beat the chief justice. They kicked at the chief justice's door." "There is no instance that a judge was removed after he had sat in the courtroom. But, it happened when you were in power. "You appointed 22 new judges. One of them had a fake certificate, another was corrupt. I don't know if another judge had bathroom at his residence. He was caught [urinating]] on the wall of Bhutan's embassy." Taking aim at BNP MPs, she said, "You were about to beat the speaker in this parliament. You kicked and broke a television camera." On promotion in civil service, she said, "Promotions took place during BNP's rule by slips." The prime minister said civil servants were made officers on special duty at the establishment ministry with little work to do. "We will try to give them back their dignity." To a question from BNP MP Nazimuddin Ahmed, Hasina said," What did you do in the five years? Why did the rate of education fall? You came to power to plunder." bdnews
