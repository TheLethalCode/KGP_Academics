 New Delhi, March 1 (bdnews24.com)  Headlines in top Indian newspapers and news channels, on Saturday and Sunday, have pointed fingers at BNP MP Salauddin Quader Chowdhury for instigating the massacre of army officers at the BDR headquarters last week. The Indian Express made the story its main Sunday headline. "Dhaka rebels reveal plot to provoke Army, topple Govt," The Indian Express said. "It's learnt that several BDR personnel, who surrendered after killing nearly 100 Bangladesh Army officers and personnel, have been interrogated and revelations are said to be quite alarming. "The interrogation reports, which include one Subedar Major Zafar, point the finger of suspicion to BNP MP and known businessman Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury, who has several cases of graft against him," the newspaper wrote.

India's leading English news network, CNN-IBN, had reported on Thursday that Chowdhury played an important role behind the bloody revolt, quoting Indian intelligence sources. The channel, which is a partner of CNN International, also said on Saturday during a live broadcast that Chowdhury's name has been taken by some of the arrested BDR personnel in Dhaka.
