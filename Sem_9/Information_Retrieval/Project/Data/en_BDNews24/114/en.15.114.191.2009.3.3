 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  The body of an officer on the army's latest missing list, and a BDR man, were 'primarily identified' on Tuesday, out of five bodies that remained unidentified at Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue. Major Kazi Ashraf Hossain was identified by sister Ashrafunnisa, who told reporters she made the primary identification by a scar on the nose. Subedar major Nurul Islam was identified by his son Ashraful Islam, by his beard. Authorities said the bodies would be handed over to families after further confirmation. The army announced Monday that just six officers were missing, in the wake of the BDR mutiny, revising the figure down from 72 as earlier estimated by military intelligence. Ten bodies were among the last discovered in a shallow grave on Feb 28 following the mutiny. The body of the BDR chief's wife was among the ten. Five of those ten bodies remained unidentified at DMCH morgue until Tuesday. bdnews24.com/lh/g
