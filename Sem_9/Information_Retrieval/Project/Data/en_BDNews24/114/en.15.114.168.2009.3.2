 LONDON, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Champions League opponents Inter Milan and Manchester United hold seven point leads in their domestic championships, the Italians after a 3-3 draw with AS Roma, United thanks to Liverpool's defeat at Middlesbrough. Barcelona and Olympique Lyon's leads were cut to four, the Spanish leaders going down 4-3 at Atletico Madrid while the French champions were held 1-1 at home by Stade Rennes. SPAIN Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero scored a dramatic late winner to condemn visiting Barcelona to a 4-3 defeat, a second consecutive loss for the leaders whose advantage over champions Real Madrid shrunk to four points. Real's 2-0 win at Espanyol, a 10th straight victory secured by second-half goals from Guti and Raul, upped the pressure on Barca, who have taken only one point from three matches. Argentine international Aguero and Uruguayan strike partner Diego Forlan both scored two as Atletico twice came from behind at the Calderon, while Thierry Henry netted a brace and Lionel Messi one for the Catalans. Mali striker Frederic Kanoute scored a stylish double to help Sevilla to a 2-1 comeback win at Athletic Bilbao that extends their lead over fourth-placed Villarreal, who drew 2-2 at Real Betis. ENGLAND Leaders Manchester United won the League Cup when they beat holders Tottenham Hotspur on penalties to stay on course for a sweep of five trophies. Liverpool's lingering title hopes virtually disappeared when they lost 2-0 at Middlesbrough with the home side securing their first league win in 15 matches. Chelsea climbed above Liverpool into second place on goal difference, but still seven points behind United, after an injury-time header by Frank Lampard gave them a 2-1 home win over Wigan Athletic. Aston Villa blew a chance to go eight points clear of Arsenal in the race for England's fourth Champions League berth after conceding two late goals in a 2-2 draw with Stoke City. ITALY Leaders Inter Milan rallied from 2-0 and 3-1 down to draw 3-3 with AS Roma thanks to a double by 18-year-old striker Mario Balotelli and a late Hernan Crespo equaliser. Juventus trimmed Inter's lead from nine points to seven with a 1-0 win over Napoli in Turin thanks to a lucky goal by Claudio Marchisio, whose shot took a deflection on its way into the net. After being ousted from the UEFA Cup by Werder Bremen on Thursday, AC Milan's troubles continued with a 2-1 defeat at Sampdoria that leaves them five points further back. Fiorentina were held 1-1 at bottom club Reggina and missed the chance to join Milan in third. GERMANY Champions Bayern Munich had to settle for a 0-0 draw against Werder Bremen, dropping to fifth place after picking up only their fourth point out of a possible 15 this year. Hertha Berlin went top, a point above Hamburg SV, after their edgy 2-1 win over bottom team Borussia Moenchengladbach with goals from Andriy Voronin and Pal Dardai. Brazilian striker Grafite struck twice to take his league tally to 14 in VfB Wolfsburg's impressive 3-1 away win, their fourth in a row, over Hamburg that lifted them to fourth. Hoffenheim are third after a lacklustre 0-0 draw against Borussia Dortmund. FRANCE Olympique Lyon dropped two precious points in their bid for a record eighth consecutive Ligue 1 title when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Stade Rennes, while their rivals all won on Sunday. At their Gerland stadium, Lyon were leading 1-0 after Kim Kallstrom's opener in the 66th minute but French international striker Jimmy Briand equalised one minute into stoppage time. Lyon have 55 points from 26 matches, four more than Paris St Germain who thrashed Nancy 4-1 with a Guillaume Hoarau double. Hoarau also set up Stephane Sessegnon for his team's third, with Ludovic Giuly netting the third. Olympique Marseille (48 points) were third after Brandao scored his first goal for them since joining from Shakhtar Donetsk in January in a 1-0 win at Caen. Marouane Chamakh scored four minutes after the break to give Girondins Bordeaux a 1-0 victory over Lorient. NETHERLANDS Italian Graziano Pelle scored a goal in each half to inspire leaders AZ Alkmaar to a 3-0 home victory over Groningen that keeps them nine points in front with nine matches left. Blaise N'Kufo kept second-placed Twente Enschede on course as he sealed the 1-0 home win over ADO Den Haag to brush away the bad taste of last week's UEFA Cup elimination by Olympique Marseille. Ajax Amsterdam beat Utrecht 2-0 to stay third, 12 points off the pace, while Heerenveen moved into fourth by beating PSV Eindhoven 3-2 with Danijel Pranjic converting a penalty in injury time. PORTUGAL: Benfica closed the gap at the top to two points by beating Leixoes 2-1 after leaders Porto were held 0-0 at home by Sporting. Benfica's home win against fourth-placed Leixoes came through an own-goal by defender Elvis Pereira and a headed goal by Nuno Gomes, with Rodrigo Silva pulling one back. Porto created the first chance against Sporting, a Lisandro Lopez header cleared off the line by Bruno Pereirinha in the 11th minute. Sporting also came close to scoring in the first half when Liedson's header hit the post. SCOTLAND Japan midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura hit a hat-trick as Celtic thrashed 10-man St Mirren 7-0 to close within four goals of Rangers at the top of Scottish Premier League. Celtic, who led by seven points two months ago, are level with Rangers on 60 points after their rivals won 1-0 at Hamilton thanks to a Barry Ferguson strike and their goal-fest has made things even tighter at the top. GREECE Olympiakos Piraeus had their lead cut to nine points after their big derby against Panathinaikos at the Karaiskakis Stadium ended in a goalless draw. Panathinaikos had to play much of the second half with 10 men after central defender Josu Sarriegi picked up a second yellow card just before the hour. PAOK Salonika took advantage by beating Panionios 2-1 with two late goals from Ivorian striker Ibrahima Bakayoko and so leapfrogging Panathinaikos into second pl
