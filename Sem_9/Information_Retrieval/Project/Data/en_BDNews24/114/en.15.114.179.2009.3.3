 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)--The alleged leader of the murderous Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny, Touhidul Alam, and four others were arrested Tuesday in the capital in still unclear circumstances. "Five including DAD Touhid and sepoy Rahim have been arrested in Hajaribagh," said commander A K Azad, director of legal and media wing of the elite Rapid Action Battalion. The RAB officer could not give the other names immediately, and did not give further details about the circumstances in which they were held. Touhidul Alam, a deputy assistant director, led the rebel team in negotiations with the government during the 33-hour mutiny ending Thursday evening. Two days later, the government sued him and five others, charging them all with treason, murder, arson and looting. At least 62 army officers were killed or missing, according to the army. Several other civilians and many BDR men were also killed. Sepoy Rahim was also among the six the Lalbagh police named in the case, registered Saturday night. A magistrate on Sunday took the charges into cognizance. Over a thousand BDR men were also charged, but the Lalbagh OC Nobojyoti Khisha did not identify them. DAD Touhid led a team of 14 BDR men to talks with the prime minister at her home on the day the border guards rose in rebellion at their headquarters in the capital. Touhid also led the renegade BDR men in negotiations that followed with the home minister late into the night. The other four names that Khisha mentioned in his submission were DAD Nasiruddin Khan, DAD Mirza Mahbubur Rahman, Jawan Abdur Rahim, DAD Jalil (one name given). "More DADs may be involved with the incident," Khisa had said after filing the case. Khisa said in his court submission the government had information that the rebel border guards were 'instigated by vested quarters to upset the stability of the state and to make unlawful gains'. Their action amounted to treason, the court was told. Police attributed the delay in filing the case to time taken 'to analyse the situation, gather information on the events and complete official formalities'. After the first round of talks with the rebels on Feb 25, prime minister Sheikh Hasina offered a general amnesty to the BDR mutineers, but later said the pardon would not cover those who directly killed, looted or committed such other criminal acts. The prime minister told parliament Sunday that the BDR revolt was a "completely pre-planned massacre".
