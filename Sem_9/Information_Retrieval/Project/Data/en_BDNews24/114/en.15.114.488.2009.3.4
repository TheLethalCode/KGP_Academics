<TITLE> Sri Lanka security same as for other teams, says Butt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAHORE, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The level of security provided to Sri Lanka during their tour was the same given in the past to other teams, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said on Wednesday. The Sri Lankans abandoned the tour following Tuesday's attack on their team bus in Lahore when around a dozen gunmen opened fire, wounding six players and a coach and killing seven Pakistanis as they were being driven to the Gaddafi stadium for the second test. "The same manpower was provided to the Sri Lankans and don't forget the police lost six of their men. They showed bravery," Butt told reporters. "We prayed something like this would not happen but it was beyond our control and it has badly damaged our country. "To comment on the security arrangements would be premature until the investigation is complete," he added. "But nowhere in the world is the board directly responsible for the security of the teams." Butt said the board could have private security consultants but it could not interfere in the working of the local police. "If we start telling the local police what to do they will point fingers at us if something happens," he said. 'NO COMPLAINTS' Former test player Butt met the Sri Lankan team following the attack and said they would consider returning to Pakistan in the future. "My hat's off to every single player. Every single player I met said they will return soon. "I can't express in words for the way their players, their manager spoke after the incident. They made some brave comments," he said. "They had no complaints against anyone and they said if it had not been for the driver all of us would have been dead." Pakistan are due to co-host the 2011 cricket World Cup although this will be reviewed in April by the International Cricket Council which has already said the country was unlikely to stage internationals in the near future. "The future of Pakistan cricket looks grim at the moment," Butt said. "We have to see over the next six months or one year what the situation is in Pakistan. If it does not improve we can't expect teams to tour our country. But I'm hopeful that things will improve and we can have the World Cup matches.
