 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)Six suspected members of militant outfits Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Hizb-ut Tauhid have been arrested in Dhaka and Tongi, police said Monday. Four youths were caught distributing Hizb-ut-Tahrir leaflets with messages on the BDR mutiny, Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Islam told bdnews24.com. "The leaflets read: Raise your voice against the Indian conspiracy to destroy the army and the border guards, and the government's inaction" said Islam. Two youths, 'Zubair' and Shamim Ahmed, were arrested at Shahbagh intersection Sunday night and another two young men, Nader Jamil and Mehedi Hassan, at nearby Shishu Park, said the officer. He said all four were produced in court Monday. Tongi police chief Abdus Salam said two men were caught at Pubail with leaflets of the disbanded militant outfit Hizb-ut-Tauhid. "The leaflets depicted the BDR headquarters massacre committed on Feb 25-26," he said. Police seized a huge number of leaflets from Shakil Mahmud Shabuj of Tangail and Kamaluddin Jewel of Haydarabad in Rajshahi, said Salam. The leaflets, bearing the same message as Hizb-ut-Tahrir's, urged people to speak out against the "Indian conspiracy to destroy the army and the border guards and the government's inaction". Salam said Hizb-ut-Tahrir was not yet banned but its messages were similar to that of the now banned Hizb-ut-Tauhid. "The arrestees are being interrogated. They will be sent to the chief metropolitan magistrate's court at Gazipur [Monday] and remanded," he said. bdnews24.com/corr
