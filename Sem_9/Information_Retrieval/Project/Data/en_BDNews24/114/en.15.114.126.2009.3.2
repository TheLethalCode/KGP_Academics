<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)Parliament had an unscheduled debate on forming a probe committee to investigate alleged corruption in the parliament secretariat during the tenure of former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar. Chief whip Abdus Shahid, Suranjit Sengupta and Rahmat Ali proposed the formation of a parliamentary probe body. Opposition chief whip Jainul Abdin Farroque and BNP MP AK Bhuiyan opposed the move. Ruling party MP Dhirendra Nath Shambhu first drew the attention of the speaker on the subject. He said, "Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar resorted to corrupt practices in purchases. He gave us third rate earphones inside parliament and we cannot hear anything. "I urge you to give us digital earphones". Farroque opposed Shambhu, saying parliament should not hold such discussions against Sircar as he was "a highly respected individual". "I should not have to defend him in parliament," said Farroque. Chief whip Shahid also alleged that Sircar resorted to corrupt practices while he was speaker. Sengupta supported Shahid, saying, "If parliament cannot curb corruption within its structure, it has no right to investigate the corruption of the executive". He alleged irregularities in Sircar's appointment of staff. Speaker Hamid said, "It is true that we have never held such discussions. But it should not be that parliament cannot investigate if I, as speaker, commit offences." He said parliament investigated corruption in the ministries. "This should also be looked into," said Hamid. However, parliament did not form the committee. bdnews24.c
