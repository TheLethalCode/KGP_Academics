 March 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six Sri Lankan cricketers and their British assistant coach were wounded when gunmen attacked their bus as it drove under police escort on Tuesday to a stadium in the Pakistani city of Lahore. Following are a selection of quotes on the attack from witnesses, politicians, cricket authorities and former players: NADEEM GHOURI, PAKISTANI UMPIRE "It was horrifying. They were bullets flying around us and we didn't know what was happening. When the firing started we all went down on the floor of the coach. Our driver was killed instantly from a shot from the front." MOHAMMAD LUQMAN, WITNESS "I saw them from the window of my office firing at the police escort first. When the police dispersed after the shooting, they started firing at the bus of Sri Lankan team." JAVED MIANDAD, FORMER PAKISTAN CAPTAIN "It is so sad all this carnage and terror. What is worse is that all the fears expressed by foreign teams about coming to Pakistan have been proved correct. Pakistan cricket will take a long time to recover now." INZAMAM-UL-HAQ, FORMER PAKISTAN CAPTAIN "What is sad that the Sri Lankans supported us and came to Pakistan and this is the price they have paid for their friendship with us." BRENDAN KURRUPU, SRI LANKA TEAM MANAGER "We are going back today but it is a sad day for cricket. I feel for Pakistan cricket." PALANIAPPAN CHIDAMBARAM, INDIAN HOME MINISTER "It is quite clear that the security of the Sri Lankan team was hopelessly inadequate. We condemn the incident." INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY STATEMENT "Terrorism based in Pakistan is a grave threat to the entire world. It is in Pakistan's own interest to take prompt, meaningful and decisive steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure once and for all." SALMAN TASEER, PUNJAB PROVINCE GOVERNOR "I want to say it's the same pattern, the same terrorists who attacked Mumbai. They are trained criminals. They were not common people. The kind of weaponry they had, the kind of arms they had, the way they attacked ... they were not common citizens, they were obviously trained." HAROON LORGAT, INTERNATIONAL CRICKET COUNCIL CHIEF EXECUTIVE "We note with dismay and regret the events of this morning in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation.
