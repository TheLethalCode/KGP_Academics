<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammad Ashraful struck an unbeaten hundred to guide newcomers Gazi Tank Cricketers to a tense 15-run win against Victoria Sporting Club in the Premier Division Cricket League at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium on Tuesday. Away at the BKSP ground, holders Abahani extended their winning streak to six matches after a 32-run win over lowly City Club. Gazi Tank vs Victoria Electing to bat, Gazi Tank got off to a fine 61-run opening stand before M Anwar was run out for 23 and one-down Nafis Iqbal also fell short of the crease for 14, leaving the side at 106-2 in 25.5 overs. Opener Imrul Kayes followed Nafis when he was stumped by Amran Hossain off Tariqul Islam that left Gazi Tank wobbling at 112-3 in 27 overs. But Ashraful, who has been going through a lean patch in the league, finally struck form hitting a 72-ball 100 with the help of 12 fours to propel the side to a challenge total of 296-4. The Bangladesh captain was accompanied by M Mithun (41) and Nayeem Islam, who was 31 not out. Victoria rattled up 281 in the stipulated 50 overs after spinner Nayeem Islam grabbed four for 44. Openers Amit Majumdar and Arman Hossain gave Victoria a blazing 56-run start in 6.3 overs before the latter was run out for 33 off 29 balls studded with five fours. Amit was going great guns with a 27-ball 40 before becoming Nayeem's third victim, leaving the side at 86-3. Faisal Akther and M Sharifullah then took charge to steer Victoria to 171-4 in 35.5 overs, but both batsmen were run out for 43 and 68 respectively. Middle-order batsman Arafat Salahuddin raised hopes of upsetting star-studded Gazi Tank with a 29-ball 60 that included two sixes and seven fours, but his departure dashed Victoria's hopes. Needing 59 runs in the last five overs with four wickets in hand, Victoria managed 44 runs losing their remaining wickets. Abahani vs City Club Put in to bat, Abahani posted a modest 238-9 in 50 overs, thanks to a fifty from Tamim Iqbal. The left-handed opener smashed 59 off 80 balls with seven fours while captain Mashrafee bin Mortaza, batting at number seven, made a quickfire 46 off 27 balls studded with four sixes and two fours. Besides, one-down Anwar Hossain (34), Sahagir Hossain (27), Nasir Hossain (22) and Ziaur Rahman (22) were the other notable scorers for Abahani. Despite a 56-run knock from opener Rasel Al Mamun, City Club could manage 206-9. Lower-order batsman Shafaq Al Jabir and Rashedul Islam chipped in with 34 and 28, but they could not avert their seventh straight defeat in as many matches. Nazmul Hossain grabbed three for 29 while Arafat Sunny took 2-32. bd
