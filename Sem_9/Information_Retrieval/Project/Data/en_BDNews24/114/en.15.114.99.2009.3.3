 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  The unprecedented attack on Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore on Tuesday, became a hot topic for Bangladesh's leading players who now feared for their safety while touring abroad. "We never heard of cricketers being terrorist targets. I also never thought Bangladesh cricketers could come under attack, but after this incident, we are also not safe," said Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful. Ashraful, who struck a hundred during a Premier Division League match, said that he learned about events in Pakistan while chatting to other players. Bangladesh visited Pakistan last April to play a five-match ODI series after Australia cancelled their tour citing security concerns and Lahore hosted two one-day internationals between Pakistan and Bangladesh. Ashraful recalled that security at the hotel was extremely tight, but the Sri Lanka team were attacked on way to the stadium. "Now I think we could have been attacked at that time, but thankfully we avoided going through such an incident," said the youngest Test centurion. Ashraful termed the Lahore incident an act of sheer cowardice. "I can't understand why the cricketers were attacked. Cricket or cricketers are always out of politics." The 24-year-old cricketer also condemned the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny in Dhaka. His predecessor Habibul Bashar said the attack had shaken cricketers' foundation of trust. "Before today we had no doubts over our security, but now I am sure cricketers will be worried whenever they travel abroad," said Bangladesh's most successful captain. Shakib Al Hasan expressed his shock over the Lahore attack. "News of the ambush really was a shock. It makes me wonder how safe we are when playing abroad. If it can happen to the Sri Lankan team then it can happen to anyone anywhere," said the leading all-rounder. bdnew
