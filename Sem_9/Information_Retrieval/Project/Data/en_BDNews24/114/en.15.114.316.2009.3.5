<TEXT>
 LAHORE, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The PCB is to lodge a protest with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over remarks made by match referee Chris Broad criticising security following Tuesday's attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore. "It is very unfortunate what he has said," Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said on Thursday. "All he has said is totally untrue and fabricated." Former England player Broad, travelling behind the team in a another bus whose driver was killed, told a news conference he and colleagues were left like "sitting ducks" due to the lack of security during the attack. Six Sri Lankan players and their assistant coach were injured in the incident and seven Pakistanis, including six police, were killed. "Broad has made some obnoxious comments," Butt said. "How can he say there was no security... policemen lost their lives and 10 were injured trying to protect the players and officials. "The team and officials got the same security which was given to them during the one-day series in January. Broad himself praised the security arrangements then." MATCH OFFICIALS Two investigations are being carried out to find out if there was a lapse in security arrangements for the Sri Lankan team and ICC match officials. "We would like to know what happened, whether there was a security lapse and deviation from the standard operating procedure. If we have faulted somewhere we will say it is our responsibility," Butt said. Former England bowler Dominic Cork was also caught up in the incident. "If Ejaz Butt believes that security was enough at an international sports event then he's wrong and he should live and die by the words he's come out with," Cork told Sky Sports News. "Ejaz Butt is completely and utterly out of order." Pakistan's status as a co-host of the 2011 World Cup is in doubt following the attack and the ICC will hold a teleconference on March 16 to discuss the matches, Butt said. "The situation is very grim for us. We shouldn't expect any teams to come for the next six months or one year.
