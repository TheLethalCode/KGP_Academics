<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Tue Mar 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new US envoy on North Korea arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on how to coax the reclusive Communist country, which is thought to be preparing a missile launch, into fresh steps toward nuclear disarmament. The Chinese capital is the first stop on Stephen Bosworth's first visit to Asia since he was nominated last month for the job of overseeing protracted nuclear negotiations with North Korea. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, also in Beijing, said Chinese officials were also worried about a possible North Korean missile launch. "They (the Chinese) are obviously concerned with the risk of raising tensions," Bildt said. No breakthroughs are expected on Bosworth's first visit. "Ambassador Bosworth wants to signal that the United States will not be tested by North Korea," said Kim Sung-han, Korea University professor of international relations. "From the North Korean point of view, they do not make concessions under any circumstances. From Stephen Bosworth's point of view, he needs to send a clear message to North Korea that even if North Korea test-fires its Taepodong missile, that will not automatically lead to North Korea-US bilateral talks." Bosworth has become the chief US envoy at a tense time, with North Korea repeatedly threatening in recent weeks to reduce the South to ashes. Six-party talks between the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States on the North's nuclear weapons programs have stalled, with implementation of an initial energy-for-disarmament deal stuck on Pyongyang's refusal to allow nuclear material to be taken abroad for tests. "At present, there are some new and complicated circumstances in the denuclearization process," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said of the talks without elaborating. "We hope these difficulties will be temporary." MISSILE INTERCEPTORS U.S. and South Korean officials have said North Korea is preparing for a test flight of its Taepodong-2 long-range missile, which could carry a weapon as far as Alaska but has never successfully flown. Japan is considering deploying its two ballistic missile interceptor warships to the Sea of Japan ahead of any test launch, Kyodo news agency reported on Tuesday. Japan will be cooperating with the US military, which also has anti-ballistic missile ships stationed there, Kyodo quoted the official as saying. But a spokesman for Japan's Defense Ministry said nothing had been decided as yet. Pyongyang has said it was preparing to launch a satellite and it had the right to do so as part of a peaceful space program. Bosworth would meet Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei during his stay, Qin said. Bosworth, a former ambassador to South Korea, will later in the week fly to Tokyo and Seoul, where he will also meet Russian officials. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week said Bosworth's tour was to "move the six-party process forward." Since taking on his new job, Bosworth has not publicly discussed how he will approach the negotiations. He did not speak to reporters on arrival in Beijing but said he would make a statement later. But early in February, he visited North Korea while still dean at the Fletcher School of diplomacy at Tufts University. After that visit, he said North Korean officials said they wanted to advance nuclear disarmament steps if their aid demands were
