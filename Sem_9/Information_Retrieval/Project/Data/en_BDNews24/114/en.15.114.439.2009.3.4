 COLOMBO, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's cricketers were reunited with their families after returning home early on Wednesday following an attack by gunmen in Lahore. The players were welcomed home to Bandaranaike International Airport by friends and families, cricket officials, sports minister Gamini Lokuge and a large media contingent. Around a dozen gunmen attacked the team's bus on Tuesday with rifles, grenades and rockets, wounding six players and a British assistant coach and killing at least eight Pakistanis.
