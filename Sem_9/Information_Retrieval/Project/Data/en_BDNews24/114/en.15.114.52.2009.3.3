 NEW DELHI, march 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said Tuesday's attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan was shocking and audacious, exposing the "hopelessly inadequate" security provided to the players, six of whom were wounded. "It's a shocking incident," Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's home minister, told reporters. "It is quite clear that the security of the Sri Lankan team was hopelessly inadequate. We condemn the incident." Six Sri Lankan cricketers and their British assistant coach were wounded when gunmen attacked their bus as it drove under police escort to a stadium in the Pakistani city of Lahore, officials said. Sri Lanka's cricketers were invited to Pakistan after India pulled out over security concerns. India's reaction could stoke further tension with Pakistan. The nuclear-armed rivals have been exchanging angry rhetoric since the November attacks in Mumbai, with New Delhi saying Islamabad must dismantle what it says are terrorist networks on Pakistani soil. A Pakistani official said the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore bore the hallmarks of the same militants that carried out the attack on Mumbai. In a separate statement, the foreign ministry said: "We are shocked at the audacious attack. "Terrorism based in Pakistan is a grave threat to the entire world. It is in Pakistan's own interest to take prompt, meaningful and decisive steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure once and for all." India called off a tour of its cricket team to Pakistan in January citing security concerns. "Given the fact that organised terror outfits were working with impunity, striking at will and challenging the civilised world it was not possible for India to expose its cricket team to the grave threat," Anand Sharma, India's junior foreign minister said
