 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  The army on Monday revised the number of its missing officers down to just seven, and that of the dead to 56. On Saturday, as emotions ran high among the ranks after the massacre by the mutineers, the military intelligence chief Brig Gen Mahmud Hossain said 72 were still missing, 63 were dead and 33 officers were found alive. Just two days later, the army's chief of general staff lieutenant general Sina Ibne Jamali released names of the seven missing officers to reporters at a briefing Monday. Col Gulzar Uddin Ahmed, lt col Manzur Elahi, major Abu Sayed Gazzali Dastgir, major Ahmed Azizul Hakim, major Kazi ashraf Hossain, major Makbul Hossain and captain Tanvir Haider Noor. "Fifty-six bodies of (army) officers have been found. Not 63 (as army intelligence chief)," Gen Jamali said. Asked by the reporters, the general tried to come up with an explanation. "We took some time to get to this. Those who could give us the information ... we tried to collate various pieces of information ... now we can say only seven are missing ... maybe two-three days later we'll come know about one or two more ... because all these officers came from all over the country ... (they) came from other organisations. There may be errors in case of one or two."
