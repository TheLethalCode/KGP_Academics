<TITLE> GDP to fall below target: ADB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh's GDP growth is expected to fall 0.5-1.0 points below the targeted 6.5 percent in the current fiscal year, the Asian Development Bank said Monday. "With the financial crisis in the advanced economies unfolding and recession appearing to last longer than anticipated, a growth rate in the range of 5.5-6 percent seems more likely in FY 09," says the ADB's Quarterly Economic Update for the fourth quarter, ending December 2008. The government and Bangladesh Bank have also forecast GDP growth at around 6 percent for the current fiscal year, 0.5 percentage points below the target. The ADB also said inflation is likely to drop to 7 percent in 2009 from 9.9 percent in 2008 because of a price slash in fuel, predictions of good farm output and the effects of raising interest rates by the central bank. The multilateral lending agency said the country's economy preformed reasonably well with sound growth in domestic economic activities and satisfactory growth in exports and remittances. Growth in readymade garments along with improved business confidence and recovery in housing and construction fuelled industrial activity, it added. On services, the ADB economic update said wholesale and retail trade, transport and telecommunication preformed well. ADB forecast a strong growth in agriculture supported by favourable weather conditions and policy support from the government such as fertiliser subsidies. It also added that prospects for non-crop farm sectors looked bright while the fisheries sector did well due to a rise in local demand.
