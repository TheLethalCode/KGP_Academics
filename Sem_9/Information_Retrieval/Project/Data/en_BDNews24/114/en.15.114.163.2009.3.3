 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  Army and police Tuesday retrieved mobile phone records, SIM cards, duty rosters and other "blood-stained" evidence from the BDR headquarters. Asked whether they had found any hard evidence to build the case, Brig Gen Ziaul Hasan, the army's director of military operations, told reporters he could not comment since the investigation was ongoing. Briefing reporters at Dhaka Cantonment, General Hasan said law-enforcers had also recovered 47 rifles, 46 sub-machine guns, 11 light machine guns, 50,000 bullets and 198 grenades from Peelkhana until Monday. He said he could not give any further details about the arms. "They are in police custody." The army official said they were moving cautiously with the thousands of BDR men reporting back to headquarters over the past three days. Medical teams were testing their physical fitness for return to duty, he added. On the army's missing list, Hasan said there were only five on the list after the identification of another officer's body Tuesday morning. However, three bodies were still unidentified at the Combined Military Hospital, he said. "We will need DNA tests now to be sure of their identities," said Hasan. bdn
