 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com) - The National Board of Revenue has given taxpayers until April 30 to legalise 'fake' TINs. "Those with counterfeit Tax Identification Numbers must get them legalised by the deadline or face legal action," NBR chairman Muhammad Abdul Mazid said. They will have to pay Tk 3,000 in advance income tax to correct their numbers, he said. The opportunity is meant to increase revenue and curb forgeries, he added. "Fake TIN holders who fail to act under this provision will face severe penalties," said Mazid. Asked what measures would be taken, the tax chief said, "If anyone has received plots from RAJUK by presenting counterfeit TINs, their allocation will be cancelled." Similar measures will be taken against those who have purchased homes, land or cars using fake TINs, he said. They may also face jail terms of 3 months to 3 years, said the top taxman. Forged TINs are mounting in cases of land and home purchases, securing trade licences and credit cards, said Mazid. bdne
