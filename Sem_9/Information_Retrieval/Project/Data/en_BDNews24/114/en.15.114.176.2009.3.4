 KUWAIT, Wed Mar 4,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kuwait's ruler could move to dissolve parliament in the leading oil exporter in the coming days to avoid deputies questioning the royal prime minister, media and parliamentary sources said on Wednesday. Frequent cabinet changes usually do not affect the oil policies of OPEC-member Kuwait, the world's seventh-largest oil exporter, which are set by a high state energy council.

Kuwait's parliament is the most outspoken in a region mostly governed by ruling families. Rows between the government and members of parliament have often led to cancellation of government projects and delays in proposed reforms. Kuwait's parliament has been dissolved four times since it was established in 1963. Sheikh Sabah's predecessors suspended the assembly for six years in 1986 and five years in
