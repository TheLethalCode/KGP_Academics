<TITLE> Pakistan to tour Bangladesh despite mutiny </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will go ahead with a tour of Bangladesh due to start later this week despite a mutiny in the paramilitary headquarters, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official said on Monday. Pakistan are scheduled to arrive on Saturday for a 16-day trip to play two Twenty20 Internationals and five one-day internationals against the hosts. "We have not received any message to postpone or defer the tour so far. So the series will go as planned," BCB media chief Jalal Yunus said. At least 80 people died, mostly army officers, in a two-day mutiny which erupted at the paramilitary headquarters, causing a major security alert in Bangladesh. "We have already taken tight security measures for the Pakistan series and if it is deemed necessary we will beef up the security further," said Yunus. The Pakistan series is a reciprocal trip as Bangladesh went on a tour last year to fill in after Australia cancelled a tour at the eleventh hour on security ground.
