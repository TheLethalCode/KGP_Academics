<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid to make the upcoming Super Cup a success, the Bangladesh Football Federation on Monday signed an agreement with Masthead PR, a leading public relations firm. "Nowadays there are some organisations who provide new ideas on how to make an event successful and that is why we have signed Masthead PR," competition committee chairman Harun-ur-Rashid said at a press conference. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin and Masthead PR CEO Fahad Karim signed the agreement on behalf of their respective organisations at the BFF conference room. The BFF had recently endured a bad experience during the grand reception to members of the Swadin Bangla Football Team and that might have prompted it to take such a decision. Referring to that episode the BFF president said, "The media criticised the programme and I do not want to give the media the same chance again." Though Fahad Karim admitted they had no experience in the sports sector, but they had been working with big companies like banglalink, British American Tobacco Bangladesh and Nokia. "It is a challenge but we are ready for it and hope to make the tournament a success," said Fahad. bdnew
