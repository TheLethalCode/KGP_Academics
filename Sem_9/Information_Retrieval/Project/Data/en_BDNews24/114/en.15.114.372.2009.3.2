 By Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  India Monday termed the massacre inside the BDR headquarters "barbaric acts" aimed at destabilising a democratically elected government. In his letter to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee has also conveyed "deepest condolences" of the Indian government to the people of Bangladesh, the army and the families of those who lost their near and dear ones. In a separate statement, Mukherjee also told reporters that Bangladesh was capable of resolving the problems stemming from the situation, and it would not meddle in Dhaka's internal affairs. "The Sheikh Hasina government is competent enough to solve the problem. They know how to deal with the current situation," Mukherjee said in Beherampore in West Bengal. "The country is being run by a democratically elected government which has come to power with a huge mandate. "Sheikh Hasina was a prime minister for five years earlier. They will solve all problems on their own," he said. In his letter, Mukherjee offered "whatever support and assistance that Bangladesh may require at this juncture". The contents of the letter were disclosed to reporters by external affairs ministry spokesperson Vishnu Prakash in the afternoon.
