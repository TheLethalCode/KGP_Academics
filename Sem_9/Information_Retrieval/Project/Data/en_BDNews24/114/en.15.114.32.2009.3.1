 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation on Sunday deferred the Super Cup by five days following the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny in the capital. The new competition was proposed to start on March 6. "Paying respect to those killed in the BDR mutiny and considering the overall situation in the country, we decided to defer the Super League by five days and so it will now kick off on March 11 and end on March 27, a day after Independence Day," competition committee chairman Harun-or-Rashid told reporters after the meeting at BFF House. "We did not want to defer the Super Cup for too long as the Challenge Cup follows shortly. Besides, the clubs have already hired their foreign players for the tournament," said the former BFF general secretary. The meeting was presided over BFF president Kazi Salahuddin. Asked whether it would affect the tournament especially as the Pakistan cricket team would be visiting Bangladesh, Salahuddin said, "I don't think so." Pakistan are scheduled to arrive here on March 7 to play a five-match one-day series against Bangladesh. The top eight teams of the just concluded B League, spilt into two groups, will compete in the Super Cup, which will see the champions get Tk 1 crore. The organisers also plan to hold a double-leg semi-final for the first time in the country and a plate cup with the four bottom teams. bd
