<TITLE> Israeli air strike kills two Gaza militants </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GAZA, March 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli air strike killed two Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, said medical workers in the Hamas-controlled coastal territory. They said the militants, members of the Islamic Jihad group, were killed near the Israel-Gaza border. An Israeli army spokesman had no immediate comment. On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes killed an Islamic Jihad field commander in the enclave and the militant group vowed to avenge his death. In late December, Israel launched a 22-day offensive in the Gaza Strip that was designed to punish militants for mounting cross-border rocket and mortar attacks on the Jewish state. While Egypt has been trying to consolidate a January 18 truce, militants have carried out sporadic attacks and Israel has usually responded with air strikes on suspected smuggling tunnels on the Gaza-Egypt border.
