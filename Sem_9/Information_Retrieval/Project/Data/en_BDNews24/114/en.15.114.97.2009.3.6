 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, March 6 (bdnews24.com)  Parliament secretariat has decided to shore up security at the parliament building and the complex after security concerns raised in the wake of the bloody BDR mutiny. The decision was taken at a meeting Friday with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. The meeting formed an 11-member committee, headed by deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, to review the parliament building's longer-term security arrangements. "The MPs will have to enter parliament building through a carefully-monitored archway so that no intruders can get through the gate," Ali told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said, no cars including those of the ministers and MPs will be allowed to be parked in the tunnel close to the parliament building. "All cars will go to the parking area and no gunman of the VIPs and the VVIPs will be allowed to enter the parliament building." He said the meeting discussed the possibility of prohibiting the visitors to use mobile phones inside parliament building. "But we will discuss the issue at our next meeting Monday," said the deputy speaker. The committee will meet again at 11am Monday. MPs now enter the parliament building through an archway but influential people very often enter the House using the archway defying security men's protests. Drivers of the most ministers and the MPs park vehicles inside the tunnel, hardly 20 metres from the parliament building. The parliament building endured an arson attack in April 2006. The chief whip, additional secretary at parliament secretariat (legislation), a home ministry joint-secretary, serjeant-at-arms, one member from such agencies as the National Security Intelligence (NSI), RAB, DMP, special security force (SSF) and special branch (SB) of police will also sit on the committee. Whip Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury Liton, directors general of RAB and NSI, one representative each from the DMP, the SSF and the SB attended the meeting.
