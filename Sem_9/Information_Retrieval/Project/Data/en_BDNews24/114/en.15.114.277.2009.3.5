<TITLE> Afghan candidate says Karzai should stand aside </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, March 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai should stand down when his constitutional term ends in May and let someone else take over until an election in August, likely presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah said. Abdullah, who served as Karzai's foreign minister from late 2001 before being replaced in 2006, said the credibility of the poll was at stake, and insisted the country's main political forces would be able to agree on an interim president. "But the first thing is that he has to agree that that is necessary and then to find a solution," Abdullah said, referring to Karzai. "That will be a credit for him, that will be credit for Afghans as well." Afghanistan has been plunged into a constitutional crisis over the election date. Karzai says the vote should be held according to the constitution, meaning it would have to take place in April, at least 30 days before his term ends on May 21. But the election commission says that is not possible, partly because of the harsh Afghan winter, and almost everyone agrees. On Wednesday it insisted the election would be held on Aug. 20. Many of Karzai's rivals worry the president is preparing to use the power of government to manipulate the poll in his favour, and want him to stand aside in May. "If his intention is to stay there and do something just to get elected, then don't do that," Abdullah said. "URGED TO STAND" Abdullah said he was being urged to stand as the candidate of the United National Front, a coalition of political parties and former warlords with its power base in northern Afghanistan. But he insisted he had not yet decided whether he would run, arguing the post was "not that tempting" and had been discredited by Karzai, who he accused of driving the country into a "ditch". Karzai, he said, blamed everyone but himself for the mess -- the warlords, other countries in the region, the international community -- but should "introspect". "He was in charge and people voted for him," he said. "The country was given to him on a plate ... nobody else is responsible for this situation." After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Karzai enjoyed enormous support and the backing of the international community, a "broad consensus" unprecedented in Afghan history. "There was a trust in the process and he broke that," he said, blaming Karzai for trying to do things "on his own, according to his own taste and style", of ignoring people and thinking he knew better. "There is such a gap between the people and the government, it is as if the two are living in two different worlds." Abdullah, looking dapper in a black suit with a pink striped silk tie and matching handkerchief in his top pocket, spoke in a plush Kabul house with a laptop at his side and a large flat-screen TV on the wall behind. Close by was a 1987 photo of him sitting alongside Ahmad Shah Masood, warlord, enemy of the Taliban and hero of the ethnic Tajiks, who was assassinated by al Qaeda just two days before the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Abdullah was a key figures in Masood's inner circle and the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance. As such, he may struggle to draw significant support from the south and the Pashtuns, the country's largest ethnic group. But although his mother was Tajik, Abdullah's father was a Pashtun and he was born in the southern city of Kandahar. He worked as an ophthalmologist until joining Masood in the 1980s, and says he stands for a peaceful, democratic Afghanistan which practices a moderate form of Islam. He is also seen as close to India and would be viewed with suspicion by neighbouring Pakistan. Like many Afghans he has just one name but has been known for years as Abdullah Abdullah and says he now prefers that formulation.
