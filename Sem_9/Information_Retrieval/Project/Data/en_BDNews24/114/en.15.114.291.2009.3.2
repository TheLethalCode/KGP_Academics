<TITLE> Afghan rival says Karzai trying to manipulate poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL Mon Mar 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai is trying to "wrongfoot" his opponents by demanding a presidential election be brought forward and must be prevented from using his position to manipulate the poll, a rival said on Monday. "I will not participate in sham elections in April," former finance minister and presidential contender Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai said. "It would be legitimising a Zimbabwe-type arrangement." On Saturday, Karzai sprung a surprise by saying the poll should be brought forward to April from Aug. 20, setting him at odds with his own election commission and with his Western backers, who see a meaningful early poll as almost impossible. The call was seen as a ploy to show he respected a May 21 constitutional deadline to leave office -- but at the same time force his opponents, none of whom are remotely ready to stand in April, to ask the president to stay on. The 59-year-old Ahmadzai, who has also worked for the World Bank and the United Nations and has widespread respect in the West, said he had decided to stand in August, adding Afghans needed time to debate the many challenges facing their nation. He said Karzai was already using the machinery of state to give himself an unfair advantage in the election, with ministers actively supporting the president's campaign. "This is a slippery slope we have to stop," he said. The United States has already said it believes August would be a better time to hold an election in a secure environment. U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan to try to secure the election in August against a powerful and growing Taliban insurgency. Bringing the poll forward would not give the troops time to arrive in the country. TALIBAN OBSTACLES The Taliban has denounced the democratic process as an "infidel system", and a former senior Taliban official said the movement would try to prevent the election taking place in swathes of the east and south of the country under its control. Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, said ordinary people were already tiring of Western-style democracy, which had failed to bring peace. "The Taliban will try to create obstacles about the holding of elections," the former Guantanamo detainee, now living under guard in Kabul, told Reuters. "But the Afghan people are not very interested in taking part in elections anyway." Ahmadzai was more optimistic, saying there were signs of significant voter registration in some areas controlled by Taliban, evidence perhaps of some debate within the movement about whether to oppose the poll. Much of the rest of the country could be secured given the political will, he said, adding that the biggest obstacle to a fair election was a "corrupt and criminalised" police force. Other presidential contenders accused Karzai on Sunday of trying to create "chaos and disorder" to hold an unfair vote. Almost no one believes an April poll is possible, especially because it would have to be organised during the harsh Afghan winter when many parts of the country are inaccessible. NATO's 56,000-strong force are due to back up the Afghan army and police whose job it is to provide security for the polls. "The bottom line is that we will be able to provide more support and more security for an August election than we would for an earlier one," NATO spokesman James Appathurai said, but stressed when the election was held was an Afghan decision. Karzai is unpopular due to his failure to bring security and development, to tackle corruption and prevent civilian casualties in the US-led war against the Taliban. About half a dozen people have said they might run against Karzai, but no strong rival has yet emerged from the pack. Ahmadzai, a formidable intellectual who might be popular in the West, remains an outside contender who is seen as lacking the domestic support and political clout to win
