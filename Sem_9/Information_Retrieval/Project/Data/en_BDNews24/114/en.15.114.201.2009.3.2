 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP came back to parliament an hour after walking out of the House Monday in protest at government-controlled BTV not broadcasting opposition leader Khaleda Zia's speech to condole BDR bloodbath the day before. The opposition MPs returned at around 7pm. "The speech of the opposition leader was not broadcast on BTV, but right after hers, the prime minister's speech was aired," opposition chief whip Joynal Abdin Farrouqe told deputy speaker Shawkat Ali on a point of order. The obituary reference was brought in parliament Sunday after the senseless carnage in the BDR headquarters in the capital during a revolt by some renegade BDR personnel on Feb. 25-26. He said the oath-taking ceremony of the opposition was also not aired even after the speaker had issued a warning. "BTV belongs to no-one alone, it belongs to the people of the country. "So we're walking out in protest at the opposition leader's speech not being broadcast," Farrouqe said. bdnews24.co
