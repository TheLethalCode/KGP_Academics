<TITLE> Extra bounce will suit Morkel, says South Africa coach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DURBAN, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa expect Morne Morkel's bowling to cause Australia trouble in the second test starting on Friday. He returned mediocre match figures of four for 158 in the opening-test defeat in Johannesburg but coach Mickey Arthur believes the lanky paceman will be more suited to the harder pitch at Kingsmead. "I thought he bowled a bit better in Johannesburg than his figures showed and I expect him to bounce back quickly especially since there is usually extra bounce here in Durban," Arthur told reporters on Wednesday. "I've chatted to some great batsmen and they all sing his praises. They hate facing guys like Morne because of that extra bounce." However, Arthur acknowledged the 24-year-old Morkel's bowling would have its ups and downs. "He's so exciting with the ball but he's going to have some good spells and some wonky spells," said the coach. "He is working on his consistency but he's probably a year behind (team mate) Dale Steyn in his development ... so we're going to have to live through some ordinary spells from him." BATTING IMPROVEMENT Arthur said he was also looking for an improvement in Morkel's batting after the all-rounder was out for two in each innings in the first test. "We were disappointed with his batting ... and we have chatted about it," said the coach. "He has a lot of potential." Arthur said it was possible South Africa could leave out spinner Paul Harris for the second test of the three-match series. "I'm not ruling out any option, it will depend on the overhead conditions on the morning of the game and the amount of grass they take off the pitch, but it is likely we will play the spinner," said Arthur. "We have done so for the last 18 months and he has brought a lot to our game. He's an integral part of our attack.
