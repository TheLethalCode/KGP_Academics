 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has cancelled her tour to Saudi Arabia, the foreign secretary said on Tuesday. A foreign ministry statement the day before had announced Hasina would depart for Makkah on March 7 to perform Umrah hajj and pray for the souls of the army officers killed in the BDR mutiny, and return on March 11. But foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com on Tuesday: "The prime minister decided late last night to cancel her trip." It would have been her first overseas visit since she took the office on Feb. 6. Saudi ambassador Abdullah Bin Naser Al Busairi, who saw foreign minister Dipu Moni on Monday, told reporters Hasina had been set to meet the Saudi king on March 8.
