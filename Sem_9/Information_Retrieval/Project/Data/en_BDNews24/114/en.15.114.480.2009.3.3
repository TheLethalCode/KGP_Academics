<TITLE> Sri Lanka army captures last key junction from Tigers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Tue Mar 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops on Tuesday seized the last road junction held by the Tamil Tigers, and now have about 3 km left to capture before reaching an expected final showdown in the 25-year-old war, the military said. Soldiers pushing east took Puthukudiyiruppu junction after heavy fighting on Tuesday morning, which is inside the last town the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) control in the Indian Ocean island nation. "When you get the junction, there are roads leading to all four directions, so now that we have captured that we can focus on the east," military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. To the east is a lagoon no more than 1 km (a half-mile) across at its widest, and then a narrow strip of coastal land where the military believes most, if not all, of the Tigers leaders are operating among tens of thousands of trapped civilians. Aid agencies estimate that about 200,000 people are there, while the military says it is no more than 70,000. Barely a half kilometre wide and 12 km long, the area is mostly coconut groves. Aid agencies fear people there are in increasingly dire conditions. Aid agencies, the government and witnesses who escaped the fighting say the Tigers are keeping most people there at gunpoint while still fighting. The rebels deny that. Diplomats say they are pressing hard to find a solution that will allow civilians to get out of the war zone, which has proven difficult because the Tigers are vastly outnumbered and outgunned and have little other protection from Sri Lanka's onslaught. The Tigers have offered a ceasefire, which the government rejected outright, though it has not ruled out a brief pause in combat operations to allow civilians to get out of harm's way. President Mahinda Rajapaksa says the Tigers must surrender or be destroyed. The military in two-and-a-half years has rapidly captured nearly all of the 15,00 square kms the Tigers controlled in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, with the goal of creating a separate nation for the Tamil ethnic minority. Now, the LTTE holds 50 square kms and many expect a swift end to a ground war that has raged off and on since 1983 and is Asia's longest run
