 AMSTERDAM, March 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Netherlands is considering sending extra troops to Afghanistan on a temporary basis to help secure safe elections, the Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Wednesday. "During elections extra troops are needed to support Afghan troops and police. This has happened at a previous election, and the Dutch made contributions at the time," a ministry spokesman said. A request for extra troops has been made to all countries who are participating in NATO's joint force in Afghanistan and it was not yet clear how many Dutch soldiers could go or when the Netherlands would make a decision, the spokesman said. The Netherlands currently has about 1,650 troops, most of whom are in the province of Uruzgan, while some are in the capital Kabul or in Kandahar. Afghan President Hamid Karzai last weekend called for elections in April instead of August but an election commission said earlier on Wednesday this was not possible due to organisational constraints. The deputy commander of the NATO-forces last week said he was confident that member states would be able to provide extra troops for the presidential election.
