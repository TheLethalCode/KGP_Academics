 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com) - The Rapid Action Battalion hinted Thursday at a major breakthrough in the BDR mutiny investigation. "We have something really big to help the CID in its investigation," Hasan Mahmud Khandker, chief of the elite anticrime force, told bdnews24.com. He would give no further details, but said to "wait and see." The Criminal Investigation Department joined the investigation into the mutiny after Lalbagh police filed a case on Feb 28 against more than 1000 BDR members, of whom six were named. Alleged mutiny leader BDR deputy assistant director Touhidul Alam, and four others, arrested Tuesday night, were remanded by CID for questioning the next day. The Feb. 25-26 armed uprising by rebel border guards at their Peelkhana headquarters left at least 62 army officers dead or missing. bdn
