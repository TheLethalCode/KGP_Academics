<TEXT>
 ANTANANARIVO, Sun Mar 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Madagascar's opposition leader says he will not take part in any more talks to resolve the Indian Ocean island's political crisis and that public anger will oust the president within months. A power struggle between the sacked mayor of the capital Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, and President Marc Ravalomanana has ignited the country's worst civil unrest for years, killing some 125 people and hammering the $390 tourism sector. "I will not be at the table. I have always claimed that the population wants a real change for Madagascar," Rajoelina told Reuters in an interview at his home late on Saturday. His comments came hours after he called for daily protests starting on Monday, and just a day after a UN envoy said the opposition leader and president had agreed to more negotiations. Rajoelina said no administration had been able to withstand pressure from the May 13 Plaza -- a reference to the capital's main square which has been the epicentre for popular revolt in the 37 years since Madagascar won independence from France. "When the people rise up, when they make demands, the government has never lasted more than a few months before tumbling," he said at his neo-classical villa, adding dialogue was impossible while the president flouted the constitution. Rajoelina, a 34-year-old former disc jockey who has come to represent a new political generation in Madagascar, accuses Ravalomanana of running a dictatorship for his own personal gain. Critics call Rajoelina a maverick. The former mayor has spearheaded a campaign of anti-government demonstrations and said he now has national backing with the support of more than 30 opposition parties. "Ravalomanana is no longer in control of Antananarivo or the provinces," he said. On Friday, the U.N. special envoy to Madagascar, Haile Menkerios, said both sides had assured him of their commitment to continuing discussions. Rajoelina accused the president of refusing to take the people's call for change seriously. He ruled out any suggestion he might accept a senior government post, including the job of prime minister, in the current administration. BLAMED FOR POVERTY Many Malagasy people blame Ravalomanana for insufferable poverty despite the economy of the world's fourth largest island growing steadily thanks to booming oil and minerals sectors. Popular resentment has become increasingly personal. Rajoelina denounced Ravalomanana, who launched his multi-million dollar empire selling yoghurt off the back of a bicycle, for monopolising business and selling off the country's assets. Last November, the announcement by South Korean industrial giant, Daewoo, that it was working on a deal to lease 1.3 million hectares of prime Madagascar farmland to meet its own food needs provoked public outcry. "You can not sell or hire out Madagascar's land, especially to foreigners," said Rajoelina. "I am not someone looking out for my own interests. I'm always looking for what is the best interest of the people and the best interest of this country." Daewoo says it has now shelved the land deal due to concerns over Madagascar's political instability. Some Malagasy say the inexperienced Rajoelina, who appointed himself president of a parallel Transitional High Authority, is a front man for other politicians. The current crisis was triggered when Ravalomanana closed Rajoelina's privately-owned Viva TV after it broadcast an interview with exiled former president Didier Ratsiraka. Rajoelina firmly denied the allegation: "There is no one pushing me, there is no one guiding me," he said. Rajoelina said he was comfortable challenging the president, despite the risks. At Saturday's 10,000-strong rally, his boyish looks were barely visible through a wall of bodyguards armed with an automatic rifle and binoculars. "The military does not hesitate to fire on the people. We can not eliminate such a possibility for myself," he said
