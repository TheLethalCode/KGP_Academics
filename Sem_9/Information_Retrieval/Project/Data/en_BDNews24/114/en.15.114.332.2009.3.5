 DURBAN, South Africa, March 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa captain Graeme Smith plans to put extra pressure on Australia's newcomers in the second test starting on Friday after his side's comprehensive defeat in the first test. Australia won the first game in the three-match series by 162 runs, with debutants Marcus North, Ben Hilfenhaus and Phillip Hughes all playing prominent roles. "We've now got a lot more footage on the new guys and we've done as much planning and technical work, if not more, than for any other series," Smith told a news conference on Thursday. "We can exploit their inexperience, but only if we play to our potential, stick to our disciplines and sustain the pressure from ball one to the end. We allowed them just to play the way they know in Johannesburg and we need to somehow create some doubt in their minds." Australia rallied after a shaky start to score 466 in their first innings in Johannesburg then dismissed South Africa for 220. "We didn't start at all well and we need to be more precise. If we had started well in Johannesburg and restricted them to 250-300, which would have been par on that pitch, we probably would have won," Smith said. "But we can take encouragement from the last couple of days in Johannesburg when we began to put them under pressure. We have to make sure we carry that into day one here, because day one in Durban is crucial." Australia captain Ricky Ponting said his side knew South Africa would have done their homework after the first test defeat. "We know South Africa will have planned very well and they've now had a good look at our debutants. So those guys will need to lift their games, take the next step. They can't stay where they are, one-off performances don't make a career and they need to think again about how to combat the quality opponents that are coming at them." Ponting said. Australia will make a decision on the fitness of pace bowlers Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle after practice on Thursday, with both carrying minor niggles. If either are unable to play, leg-spinner Bryce McGain could press for a place. Teams (from): South Africa - Graeme Smith, Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Mark Boucher, Morne Morkel, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Albie Morkel. Australia - Simon Katich, Phillip Hughes, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey, Marcus North, Brad Haddin, Andrew McDonald, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus, Bryce McGain, Nathan Hauritz, Doug Bollinger, Brett Geeves, Steve Magoffin
