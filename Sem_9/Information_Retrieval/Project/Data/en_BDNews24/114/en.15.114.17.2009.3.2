<TITLE> ICC mulls Johannesburg, UAE as Trophy venues </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAHORE, March 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Johannesburg, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are being considered as possible venues to host the Champions Trophy this year, a senior International Cricket Council (ICC) official said on Monday. The ICC executive board last month shifted the premier one-day tournament out of Pakistan with a possible boycott by five of the eight teams due to security concerns. Sri Lanka is the back-up venue but Dave Richardson, ICC general manager for cricket, said some doubts had been raised as September-October, when the event is planned, would be the monsoon season in the island nation. "Some doubts have been raised over Sri Lanka being a suitable venue more from a weather point of view," Richardson told a news conference. "What is decided is that the CT has to be held in one place with atleast two venues and completed in 12 days time so that narrows down the choice of other possible options," he said. Richardson said the possible options were the South African capital and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. "I think these options would be in the frame when the venue is finalised in March-April," he added. The tournament was postponed from last year before it was shifted out of Pakistan due to security issues.
