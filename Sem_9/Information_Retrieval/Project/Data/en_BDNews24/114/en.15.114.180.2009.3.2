<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com) Opposition leader Khaleda Zia said Sunday she expected to play her role in times of crisis but was not approached at all in the wake of the Feb 25-26 BDR bloodbath. "We are always ready to cooperate with the government," the former prime minister said in parliament. "(But I) have not received a single telephone call from the government though a grisly incident took place," she said. "It gives the impression that the government is not ready to accept opposition's cooperation," she said in her 20-minute speech. "The country is in great danger. We have to save the country and democracy," she said in her first major statement in the House since she returned to the desk of leader of the opposition after many years. "Let us work together," Khaleda said, speaking on an obituary reference. 'This (mutiny and the killings) is a deep-rooted conspiracy." The BNP chief was one of the 22 who spoke when the House spent six hours discussing the obituary reference at the initiative of speaker Abdul Hamid. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina followed Khaleda. Jatiya Party chief H M Ershad also spoke. "All of us are victims more or less of the circumstances," Khaleda said of the two-year caretaker rule. "So it is the duty of the government to create friendly relations [with the opposition] for the sake of country and democracy," she said. Parliament adopted the obituary reference unanimously to mourn the death. All the MPs termed the events "pre-planned" and demanded an impartial probe to find out the perpetrators and their instigators. The opposition leader repeated her observation that the government's announcement of a general amnesty for the rebel BDR personnel was a mistake. "I told this outside parliament. This sparked criticism from the government. I'm sorry. "If the government cannot tolerate criticism like this how will accountability be established? We only tried to point out the government's mistakes." She also criticised the government for what she said was naming 'rebel' deputy assistant director Touhidul Alam as BDR's director general, a charge the prime minister rejected outright, saying the government appointed a brigadier general to the post. Ruling alliance MPs defended Hasina's handling of the BDR mutiny, arguing that military action could have led to the killings of thousands of innocent civilians. Jatiya Party chairman H M Ershad said some lives could have been saved if timely measures were taken. He said the paramilitary BDR should be disbanded for mutiny. "According to law, this organisation should be disbanded if you call it a mutiny. He said one of the units of the armed forces resorted to mutiny and the unit was disbanded. "If the trouble was not resolved through negotiations, the military would have gone there with tanks," deputy leader of the house Sajeda Chowdhury said in her speech. "More killings would have taken place." "The country would have faced a civil war. The assault was carried out exactly for this purpose," she said. "We will find out the perpetrators and the masterminds," said Chowdhury. BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury said, "[The massacre] has [shaken] the very foundation of our sovereignty." Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzaq, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Jalil, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Rashed Khan Menon, Hasanul Haq Inu, Faruque Khan, G M Quader, M K Anwar, Zainul Abdin Farroque, Subid Ali Bhuiyan, Jahangir Kabir Nanak, Mirza Azam, Abul Khayer Bhuiyan, Shahid Uddin Chowdhury Anny, Nurul Islam Monju, Moinuddin Khan Badal, Mahbub Uddin Khokon, Anisul Islam Mahmood and Ruhul Amin Hawlader also condoled the deaths of the army officers. bdn
