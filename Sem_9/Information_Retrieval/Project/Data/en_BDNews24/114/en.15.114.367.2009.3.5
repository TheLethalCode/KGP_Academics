 Dhaka, March 5 (bdnews24.com)  The FBI and the Scotland Yard teams are likely to arrive next week, the foreign secretary said Thursday. They would provide forensic investigation support to trace some slain army officers who are still missing. "I hope they will arrive sometime next week," Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and foreign minister Dipu Moni sought forensic assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Scotland Yard of the UK following killing of army officers in the BDR mutiny on Feb. 25-26. The army could not confirm the identity of four army officers. US ambassador James F Moriarty and the British high commissioner Stephen Evans had separate meetings with the foreign minister last week. The FBI and Scotland Yard teams would visit the BDR headquarters in Pilkhana, the foreign ministry sources said. Richard Boucher, US assistance secretary of state, phoned the prime minister after the mutiny and assured her of all possible support to investigate the grisly events.
