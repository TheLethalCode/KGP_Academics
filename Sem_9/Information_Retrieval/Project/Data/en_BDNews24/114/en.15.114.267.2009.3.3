 Dhaka, March 3 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has asked the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, to watch her step since the road ahead is slippery in the wake of the Feb. 25-26 BDR mutiny. The former president also asked the ruling party to stop slurring the army in parliament. He renewed his support to the government at a joint meeting at Diploma Institution auditorium Tuesday. "The opposition BNP criticises the army in parliament because they have pains. But why is the ruling party doing the same?" "The government has been able to assume office due to 1/11. So I would tell them to express gratitude to (the army) instead of being critical of them," the former military chief said. "The BDR mutiny is not a discrete incident. It is a long-term plot perpetrated to destroy the BDR and the army," said the chief of Jatiya Party, a key component of the ruling grand alliance. He lauded the role of the army in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and other disasters. "The army has come forward with their service to assist the government." A minute's silence was observed in memory of the slain army officers and prayers were said for their souls before the programme began. b
