<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  April 15 is the last date for submission of applications to have "politically motivated cases" withdrawn, a home ministry circular said on Monday. The circular said applications must be accompanied by the first investigation report (FIR) of the case and, in certain cases, certified copies of charge-sheets. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed had previously announced the move to repeal such cases filed under previous governments. A ministerial committee and district-level scrutiny bodies have been formed to review the cases, said Monday's circular. Magistrates will head the committees at district-level. After submission, the case will be evaluated by a public prosecutor and then tabled before the district committee for review, all within 30 days of application. If it is evident that the case was aimed to harass or was politically motivated, a recommendation will be made to the government for its withdrawal, said the circular, with the FIR and charge-sheet being sent to the home ministry. The entire process, up to approval or rejection by the district-level committee, must be completed within 45 days from application, adds the circular. After recommendations from the district committee, the ministerial committee will review the cases and make a list of those that may be withdrawn. For Anticorruption Commission cases, the next decision will be taken after discussion with the Commission, said the circular. bdnew
