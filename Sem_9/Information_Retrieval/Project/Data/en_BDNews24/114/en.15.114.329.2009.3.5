<TITLE> Govt is mulling Upazila courts: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 04 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed told parliament the government had plans to set up Upazila level courts. But he said a paucity of judges and absence of good libraries were standing in the way. "Courts cannot be set up by constructing the buildings only," he said. "We need skilled judges and friendly relations between the bar (lawyers) and the benches (judges)," the minister said. "Otherwise, plaintiffs will still be deprived of justice". The minister was replying to a notice, submitted by Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, on setting up of courts at the local government level. Erased said he created the Upazila system to decentralise administration as well as judiciary. "Upazila elections have taken place. But courts are yet to be decentralised," said the former president. Ershad, during his rule, attempted to establish higher courts in four divisional headquarters during the late 1980s to decentralise Bangladesh's judicial system. The move angered lawyers at the time. bdn
