<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  The appellate division of the Supreme Court Wednesday felt embarrassed to hear the Rangs Bhaban case. The special vacation bench was dissolved when Justice Amirul Kabir Choudhury of the appellate division said that he felt embarrassed to hear the case, which was then forwarded to the Chief Justice for necessary action. After dissolution of the bench, barrister Sakhawat told reporters that the bench was dissolved as a member of the bench expressed embarrassment over the proceedings. A five-member special vacation bench led by Justice Md. Fazlul Karim sat at 9 am to hear the government's appeal arguments in the Rangs Bhaban case. Raising objections to the special hearing of the case during a vacation under an emergency rule, Rangs counsel barrister Rafiqul Haque said that as per the January 11 Presidential promulgation of the emergency rule, hearing of cases involving basic civic rights should be stayed. He further said that if this case involving basic rights was heard in the court, it should be deemed that the SC considered the country no longer under emergency rule as 120 days had elapsed since January 11. And as Justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury, a member of the special bench attended his farewell on June 7, he could not continue to act as a judge any more, Rafiq hastened to add. Responding, Fida M Kamal, the attorney general said that any such comment about a justice of the peace was not welcome at all, adding that Amirul Kabir Chowdhury was due to retire on June 23. At this stage, Justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury expressed his embarrassment over hearing the case proceedings. The senior judge of the bench Justice Md. Fazlul Karim then announced his decision to refer the Rangs Bhaban case to the Chief Justice's office. An SC source said that the case now lies in Justice Md Ruhul Amin's office for fresh orders on convening a new bench to hear the appeal. Decision on forming a new bench for the case may be taken after another appellate division Justice, Md Tafazzal Hossain, returns home from abroad in July. Earlier on February 18, 1993, the RAJUK approved a Rangs group proposal to construct a 22-storey building on the Vijay Sharanee, but cancelled the same on June 24, 1999. Rangs filed a writ petition against RAJUK in 1999 challenging the validity of its cancellation of approval when 16 floors of the building had already been erected. The High Court (HC) on May 2, 2000 declared the RAJUK cancellation of approval illegal. On filing of an appeal with the Supreme Court (SC) by the government and RAJUK against the HC verdict, the SC accepted it for hearing on December 5, 2005. The attorney general was assisted in the Wednesday hearing by the additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. Barrister Md Sakhawat Hossain assisted the Rangs counsel barrister Rafiqul Haque. bdnew
