 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) - The trial of former BNP minister Amanullah Aman and wife Sabera Aman gathered steam Tuesday with heated arguments and counter-arguments in a case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission. Judge Firoz Alam led the proceedings in a special court set up at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. During the trial, public prosecutor Mahbub Ahmed said, "Witness statements and the couple's wealth-report submitted to the ACC prove that the accused are guilty as charged." Ahmed demanded an exemplary verdict. The Amans' defence team referred to the revision of the ACC's ordinance and requested up to two weeks to submit an explanation of wealth. "The accused were told to produce financial papers within 72 hours after the charge-sheets were submitted on March 29. But the commission's clauses were revised on March 29," said a lawyer for the Amans. The case will continue to be heard on Wednesday. A prison-van carrying Amanullah Aman from Dhaka Central Jail reached the court at around 9:30am. Sabera was taken in from the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. Registering of witnesses in the Amans' case ended on June 5. bdnews24.
