<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's embattled monarchy could be abolished before this year's constituent assembly elections if the king attempts to sabotage the vote expected to decide his future, officials said on Thursday. Nepal is expected to hold elections in November or December for a special assembly to map its political future, including a decision on whether the Himalayan nation needs monarchy at all. "If the parliament finds that the king is creating obstacles to disrupt the constituent assembly elections, a two-thirds majority of its members can vote to abolish the monarchy," parliament speaker Subash Chandra Nemwang told Reuters. Nemwang said the interim parliament, which includes the Maoists, agreed late on Wednesday to change the provisional constitution and empower MPs to decide the fate of the centuries-old monarchy. The monarchy's popularity has dipped since King Gyanendra took over absolute powers in 2005, only to bow to popular protests last year and step down. A new, multi-party government has since stripped him of nearly all powers. Although the king has remained largely confined to the palace since he stepped down, some politicians and the Maoists fear the monarch or his supporters could create hurdles for the vote. Elections were due to be held this month but the election commission said it wanted more time to prepare for Nepal's first national vote in eight years. The polls are expected to cap a fast-moving peace process with the Maoists, who ended their decade-long civil war and joined the political mainstream. More than 13,000 people were killed in the conflict before the Maoists agreed to hand over their weapons for UN monitoring under a peace deal with the government
