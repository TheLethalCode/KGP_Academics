<TITLE> Rafique teaches Harbhajan a thing or two! </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammad Rafique gave struggling Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh hands-on lessons on his magic delivery with which he bowled South African Justin Kemp in the final one-dayer of the Afro-Asia Cup series in India. "Harbhajan's relentless requests persuaded me to show him how I deliver the ball," Rafique told bdnews24.com after attending his first-day training with the Tigers for the Sri Lanka tour at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Wednesday. "For the last two to three years, I have added this delivery to my armour. It is an in-swinger for a right-handed batsman who often mistakes it for an arm-ball or out-swinger," explained Rafique, who has grabbed 125 wickets in many one-dayers. "It is not easy to figure out this delivery for anyone as I spent three years behind this," the 36-year old left-arm spinners said when asked why he easily taught Harbhajan his magic delivery. Harbhajan was dropped from the Indian one-day squad after the World Cup and missed out the three-match Test series against South Africa in June 2006 and two-match Test series against Bangladesh last month. Rafique said Harbhajan might have followed his new delivery in the West Indies where he first bowled it against India during the World Cup. "I first bowled this kind of delivery in our first World Cup match against India. I succeeded in getting Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni out. "Then Harbhajan might have followed my new delivery," said Rafique. He said he also had success with the stock delivery in the Afro-Asia Cup series. Harbhajan had also turned to Rafique during India's tour of Bangladesh in 2004. Rafique then showed him the technique of bowling the arm-ball and suggested him to change his bowling grip. The Bangladesh veteran also taught the Indian youngsters as renowned TV commentator Ravi Shastri asked him to give them some tips. "They (learners) wanted to learn how to bowl doosra, but I told them that they should first try to bowl in their own style," said Rafique. bdnew
