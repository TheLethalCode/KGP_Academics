 Dhaka, June (bdnews24.com)--Speakers at a roundtable Tuesday urged the Election Commission to set up separate booths for disabled people on ground floors of buildingswhere there are buildingsin all polling stations across the country. They also recommended engaging assistants to take the disabled voters to the booths so that they could cast their votes without any hassle. But two lawmakers opposed the idea on engaging assistants. "Take assistantsone male and one femalefor each polling station. Besides, there should be separate booths for voters with disabilities on ground floors," A Sattar Dulal, president of the National Alliance of Disabled Persons Organisation (NADPO), said in his paper presented at the roundtable on "Electoral Assistance for the Disabled". The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the NADPO organised the roundtable at the Spectra Convention Centre. Dr Atiur Rahman, chief of the Unnayan Sumonnay, presented the keynote paper. "I think engaging assistants for helping the disabled voters is not necessary as the political parties, candidates and their agents help the disabled persons cast their votes," said GM Quader, a former lawmaker of the Jatiya Party. He said that people took persons with disabilities to polling stations even on their laps to cast votes. Former agriculture minister MK Anwar supported Quader and said the voting rights of disabled people must be protected at any cost. Nurul Kabir, New Age editor, Owen Lippert, resident director of the NDI, Todd Sorenson, director of the USAID's Democracy, Governance and Education Programme, among others, joined the roundtable. bdnews
