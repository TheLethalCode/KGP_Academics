 CANBERRA June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The trial of an Australian police officer over the death of an Aborigine in custody, which sparked a race riot in 2004, will be a benchmark in black justice, said aboriginal leaders on Wednesday. The trial underway in the tropical city of Townsville on Australia's northeast coast has heard gruesome details that Aborigine Mulrunji Doomadgee's liver was "virtually cleaved in two" during a struggle with the police officer. Senior police sergeant Chris Hurley pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to the unlawful assault and manslaughter of Doomadgee in a police station on Palm Island, off the coast of tropical Queensland state, in November 2004. Palm Island Aborigines rioted after the death. Aboriginal leaders have welcomed the start of the trial, the first into an aboriginal death in custody for decades. "Aboriginal people feel it's been a long hard road. The justice structure has certainly failed Mulrunji's family up to now, but it's finally happening," Socialist Alliance indigenous spokesman Sam Watson told Reuters on Wednesday. Doomadgee's liver was "cleaved in two" and he bled to death after Hurley deliberately used "massive compressive force, probably by using his knee", during a scuffle, prosecutor Peter Davies told Townsville court on Tuesday. Hurley arrested Doomadgee, 36, for being drunk and swearing in a public place. He died an hour afterwards with wounds including four broken ribs and a punctured liver. The death sparked riots which led to the destruction of the police station and a police barracks on Palm Island, which has a record of aboriginal disadvantage and violence since being used as a resettlement site for "disruptive" Aborigines last century. It also raised questions about Australia's commitment to the nearby 340 recommendations of an independent judicial inquiry set up in the late 1980s after a string of aboriginal deaths in jail. Only one group of five police have faced court before and were acquitted in 1984 over an incident in Western Australia. A report this month showed Aborigines were 13 times more likely than other Australians to go to prison, while black youths were 23 times more likely to be detained. Hurley, who says he landed beside Doomadgee in a fall, was cleared by Queensland's deputy public prosecutor, but charged later following an inquiry and public outcry. Doomadgee supporters have worn yellow wristbands saying "Justice Now, Mulrunji 19-11-04". Queensland police donned blue bands to raise funds for Hurley's legal costs. Watson and other aboriginal leaders vowed to attend every day of the trial to ensure its fairness, but said they would not be encouraging more riots. "We are trying to keep tensions low," he said. Judge Peter Dutney appealed to trial watchers on all sides to act with "decorum and respect" when the verdict is delivered. Australia's 460,000 Aborigines make up about 2 percent of the country's 20 million population. They are consistently the nation's most disadvantaged group, with far higher rates of unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, and domestic violence.
