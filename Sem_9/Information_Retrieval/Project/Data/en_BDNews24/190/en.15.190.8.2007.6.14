 LOS ANGELES, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oscar wants to show a little more flexibility. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Wednesday announced a few tweaks in its Oscar rules, including a change to allow more than three producers to pick up statuettes for a best picture win in a 'rare and extraordinary circumstance.' The Academy didn't specify what might be considered such a circumstance but stipulated that an executive committee would review relevant cases if and when necessary. The change follows a situation in which five producers of Oscar best picture nominee 'Little Miss Sunshine' were narrowed to just three during the most recent Academy Awards, even though all five received Producers Guild Awards for their work on the indie comedy.

That resulted in writer/producer Paul Haggis being denied a nomination. The Academy instituted the rule in 1999, a year after five people bounded on stage to accept the award for 'Shakespeare in Love.' Two Oscar seasons ago, the Academy tightened guidelines governing what sort of producers would be eligible for best picture consideration. That change was blamed for investor-turned-producer Bob Yari being excluded from the Oscar spotlight in 2005, when 'Crash' won best picture and only Haggis and Cathy Schulman were deemed eligible to receive a statuette. A lawsuit filed in the aftermath of that dispute was dismissed by California Superior Court, but Yari continues to navigate an appeals process.
