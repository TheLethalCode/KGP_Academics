<TITLE> Africa business rosier but more aid needed-W Bank </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAPE TOWN, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prospects for doing business in Africa have never been rosier, but more efforts are still needed to improve roads and energy and cut out red tape, a senior World Bank official said on Wednesday. At the same time, the world's richest nations, or G8, must speed up aid for Africa in order to complement the continent's drive to put its house in order, said Obiageli Ezekwisili, the World Bank's new vice-president for the Africa region. "Prospects for Africa have never been rosier," Ezekwisili said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum for Africa, due to officially kick off later in the day. "The rewards of doing business in Africa are starting to outweigh the risks, and there are a number of bright spots (countries) that have seen strong growth, averaging some 5 percent for a number of years." "But we still have some laggard states and huge problems that raise the cost of doing business," she added. Ghana, Tanzania and Nigeria were among the countries riding a crest of new-found growth. She said visible and invisible barriers to funds flow into Africa were still in place, citing the "energy crisis" on the continent and a poor transport network as key stumbling blocks. Lack of skills, brain drain and poor education were a major worry. These would be some of the key challenges during her tenure, plus reforming public procurement and introducing legislation on crucial sectors such as mining and energy. Ezekwisili, nicknamed "Madam Due Process" for her transparency drive as a cabinet minister in Nigeria, said the concerns over corruption and good governance in Africa have fallen somewhat lower on the radar screen. Unlike in the past, African governments are starting to acknowledge graft and taking measures to tackle it. "This is not an African issue per se, as there is a demand and supply side to this story. That said, citizens are speaking up and demanding change, and governments that were once in denial are now saying 'let us do something about it'," she said. Without giving figures, Ezekwisili said the inflow of private capital into Africa was rising, especially from India and China, which are pumping billions of dollars into infrastructure and natural resources, and were leading the charge by new investors. But a lack of adequate overseas development assistance (ODA) pledged by rich nations was holding Africa back. "ODA into Africa is flat, contrary to the spirit of the Gleaneagles G8 summit. This is not impressive and needs to be reversed especially as African countries have improved their scorecard on governance and economic reforms," Ezekwisili said. Leaders of the G8 last week reiterated an overall pledge made at the Gleneagles G8 summit in 2005 to raise annual aid by $50 billion by 2010, $25 billion of which is for Africa. The G8 also vowed to provide at least $60 billion to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, global diseases that have devastated African countries and their economies. "The G8 must keep their promise, we need to see the mone
