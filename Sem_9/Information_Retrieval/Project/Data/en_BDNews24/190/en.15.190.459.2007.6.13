 JAKARTA, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian police have captured the country's most-wanted militant, Abu Dujana, who heads a military wing of the Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a police spokesman said on Wednesday. Dujana had been sought in connection with several deadly bomb attacks, including the 2004 Australian embassy blast and a car bombing at the JW Marriot hotel in Jakarta a year earlier. The Indonesian anti-terrorist unit, Detachment 88, caught a number of suspects during raids in Central Java at the weekend. "After interrogating all suspects we know that Abu Dujana alias Yusron Mahmudi is the chief of the military wing of JI," National Police spokesman Sisno Adiwinoto told a news conference. The spokesman said investigations had shown that 37-year-old Dujana went by a number of names, but DNA tests and fingerprints proved the man they held was the wanted suspect. Dujana was shot in the thigh during his capture on Saturday, police said. After a series of raids earlier this year, police revealed that Dujana had emerged as the head of a military wing of JI after the death in 2005 of master bomb-maker Azahari Husin. Asian and Western authorities blame Jemaah Islamiah for a series of attacks in Southeast Asia, including the 2002 bombings that killed more than 200 people on the resort island of Bali. Police said previously that Dujana had direct control of JI's ammunition and explosives, including distribution and storage. In the March raids, police said they had also found a huge cache of weapons, explosives and chemicals that could be used to make a bomb bigger than the main device used in Bali. Although there has not been a major bomb attack since 2005, police say Indonesia still faces a considerable threat from Islamic militants.
