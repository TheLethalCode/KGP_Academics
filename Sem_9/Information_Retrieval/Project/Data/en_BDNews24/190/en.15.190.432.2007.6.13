 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Businessman Mahbub Alam Liton, who was found with serious injuries after being seized from his home by an army officer with six other uniformed men, returned home from hospital in Dhaka Wednesday. The family of the injured businessman plans to file a case against the officer identified as Captain Shibly of the Army Engineering Corps. Liton told bdnews24.com Wednesday, "My family originally planned to file the case today but had to delay as they were busy collecting clearance papers from the hospital and with other necessary procedures. "The case will be filed with the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrates court tomorrow (Thursday)," said Liton was taken from his home two days ago at Concept Tower, Green Road. Secretary of Concept Tower Flat Owners Association Emdadul Haque told bdnews24.com: "The apartment owners will decide this evening on filing a separate case against Captain Shibly." Liton was taken by force from his house by Captain Shibly Monday morning in connection with a brawl over modifying the high-rise building Concept Tower, the victim's wife Meher Afroz said in written complaint. He was later left injured at the apartment's main entrance. Neighbours eventually rescued him and admitted him to Samorita Hospital where he was found suffering from chest and hip injuries. Liton's wife filed a complaint of torture at the Science Lab army camp Monday, but it was not clear whether the army officers logged the charges. bdnews
