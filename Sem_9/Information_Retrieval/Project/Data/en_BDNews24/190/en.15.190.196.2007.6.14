 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday asked the police and the immigration to stop Sheikh Hasina going abroad if it was necessary for the sake of investigation into two extortion cases against the former prime minister. The latest court order came after the police sought approval from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka, a day after the Awami League chief was sued for what two businessmen said was extorting Tk 8 crore in two cases. Hasina is scheduled to fly to the US Friday to see her relatives. In separate appeals, investigating officers from Gulshan and Tejgaon police stations said the absence of Hasina during the investigations, which were already underway, might hamper the probes. The investigators told the court it was suspected that Hasina might not come back home. After a hearing, metropolitan magistrate Shamsul Alam said: "The investigators may take necessary action as the cases were filed on cognisable charges." CASE DETAILS Businessman Noor Ali filed a Tk 5 crore case with Tejgaon Police Station Wednesday. Ali sought Awami League nomination for the forestalled Jan 22 elections but was denied the ticket to the polls. Azam J Chowdhury, managing director of East Coast Trading Limited, filed another case with Gulshan Police Station, accusing Hasina and her cousin Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of squeezing Tk 2.99 crore from him. The latest two take the number of extortion cases against Hasina to three, all filed during the state of emergency. Ali in the case details said he had handed 12 cheques of Standard Chartered bank and IFIC Bank to Hasina in Gono Bhaban when she was the prime minister. He said he had paid the money to get permission for his business firm Fortune Ltd to set up three power plants in Haripur of Narayanganj, in Shikalbaha of Chittagong and in Khulna. Fortune chairman Dr Makbul Hossain, managing director Abdur Rouf and accountant Khaled accompanied Ali to the police station. Two other accused in the case are Hasina's another cousin Sheikh Helaluddin and wife Rupa Chowdhury. Ali alleged Sheikh Helal demanded Tk 1 crore or a flat worth the sum for helping him to get the permission. Ali handed over the documents of two flats to Rupa. The two flats in House no 20 in Borak Real State, Baridhara, are now rented. Tejgaon police chief Jan-e-Alam said primary investigation into the case has begun. In the other case, Azam Chowdhury alleged Sheikh Selim, the prime accused in the case, and Hasina had taken Tk 2.99 crore in 2000-01 in instalments in exchange for permission to set up Siddhirganj Power Plant in Narayanganj. Chowdhury, who filed the case in person, said he had paid the money through eight cheques of Standard Chartered and Southeast Bank. The first extortion case was filed against the Awami League chief on April 9. Tajul Islam Faruk from Habiganj filed the Tk 3 crore case when Hasina was away in the US. bdnew
