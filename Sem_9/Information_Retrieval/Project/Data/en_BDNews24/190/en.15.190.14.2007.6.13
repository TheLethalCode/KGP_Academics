<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)At one of her last public appearances US ambassador Patricia A Butenis said she would remember Bangladeshis as cultured, generous, and hard-working people with open minds and open homes. Speaking at an American Alumni Association Wednesday evening she said, "I have been touched by the openness and friendship of Bangladeshis across the country." Some of her fondest memories were from her travels outside Dhaka and the opportunity to learn about the country's culture and natural beauty. "The Sundarbans is a natural treasure for the entire world," said the outgoing ambassador. After her diplomatic job in Bangladesh, Butenis will take up a senior position in the United States Embassy in Baghdad. In her travels, Butenis said, she found that Bangladeshis share the American passion for democracy. "They too want good governance, prosperity and a better future for their children and their country." Bangladeshis want an end to political violence and the corruption that robs them of justice and opportunity, she added. The ambassador praised the country's commitment to helping others around the world, mentioning Bangladesh's leadership role in international peacekeeping. "Americans learned after Hurricane Katrina that humanitarian aid can flow both ways when the Bangladesh government made a generous contribution of one million dollars to the relief fund and offered to send specialised relief teams." Speaking of humanitarian responses to disasters, Butenis expressed her condolences to the families of the victims of the flooding and landslides in Chittagong, mentioning that USAID had authorised immediate assistance including $43,000 worth of relief supplies. The outgoing ambassador congratulated Bangladesh on coming to grips with the threat posed by Jamaatul Mujahideen in 2005, but warned "the battle against extremist violence is never brief but constant and difficult". She acknowledged that the present government had identified anti-corruption as a long overdue priority, but stressed that due process and constitutional rights must be ensured for all detainees. Mentioning the importance of economic growth and trade for driving national development, Butenis highlighted the dramatic improvements at Chittagong port "as a clear example of how Bangladesh can seize control of its own economic future". The ambassador stated her country's strong support for the government's commitment to promote reforms and to hold free and fair elections, but expressed concerns over "unnecessary delays". "As a friend of Bangladesh, I hope the government can come to grips with the human rights problems that have threatened to undermine its reformist credentials abroad and the integrity of its political agenda here in Bangladesh," she stressed. As a last word, Butenis said: "Some Bangladeshis believe I was too outspoken." However, she added that ambassadors must be clear about their country's interests and viewpoints in dealing forthrightly with the critical issues of the day. "I leave Bangladesh at an exciting time, a moment of great opportunity but also a period of some peril," said the outgoing US ambassador, wishing the country well "as a diplomat and friend of Bangladesh". bdn
