 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday sent Lutfozzaman Babar to jail in an arms case after the former state minister for home was remanded in custody thrice for 11 days for questioning. In another case, the same court sent controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun to jail at the end of his five-day remand. Magistrate Mosammat Kamrun Nahar of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka ordered Babar behind bars after he was taken to court at 3:45pm at the end of the latest three-day remand. Babar's lawyer Sanaullah Miah appealed to the court that if Babar was refused bail, he be given proper treatment and division in jail as he was suffering from asthma and peptic ulcer. The court directed jail authorities to follow the jail code for his treatment and division in jail. The former junior minister's wife and two sons embraced him in the courtroom. Miah told the court Babar knew nothing about the unlicensed revolver and 25 cartridges retrieved from his house. He also said Babar had told him the press reports based on his confessional statement were not true. The former BNP lawmaker did not divulge any such information to anybody during interrogation, Miah quoted him as saying. bdnew
