<TEXT>
 ROME, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italians and Jewish groups reacted with anger on Wednesday to a court ruling that a 93-year-old Nazi war criminal can leave house arrest every day to work. Former SS Captain Erich Priebke was jailed for life by a military court for the massacre of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome during World War Two. The killings were in reprisal for a partisan attack on Germans. He was extradited to Italy in 1995 from Argentina, where he fled after the war. Priebke has been allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest for health reasons, in a Rome flat lent by a lawyer who campaigned for his freedom. A military tribunal announced on Thursday that he can also work at the lawyer's office in an unspecified role. The ruling lets him go to the office "every day, freely" and "go out to satisfy, at nearby places and for the time strictly necessary, the indispensable necessities of life" -- meaning he can pop out for lunch. Rome's Mayor Walter Veltroni reacted by expressing his solidarity with "all the victims of Nazi fascist barbarianism, their families and the Jewish community". "Rome cannot forget," he said. Nazi hunters at the Simon Wiesenthal Centre said the ruling "insults the family and friends of those murdered by Priebke and his cohorts" and was "based on a totally false assumption that, as an elderly person, Priebke deserves a measure of sympathy". The president of Rome's ancient Jewish community, Leone Paserman, questioned why military courts believed Priebke was too old to be kept in a prison, but not too old to work. "They should abolish life sentences if not even those who have committed crimes against humanity have to serve them," he said. Politicians from the ruling centre-left alliance called for the city of Rome to stage a protest. "Priebke being free is an offence to memory, to the city of Rome ... and to the Italian Jewish community who have our full solidarity," said Pino Sgobio, a communist lawmaker. Priebke admitted he participated in the massacre but said he was obeying orders on pain of death. In Argentina, he lived for half a century as a schoolmaster in the Andean town Bariloche. It was unclear what work Priebke would carry out at the lawyer's office but local media speculated that he might be doing research for a second book of memoir
