 SINGAPORE, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday, with rate-sensitive property shares among the worst hit, as US Treasury yields hovered near five-year highs, stoking fears a rise in global interest rates may curb spending. Although many investors were nervous that Treasury yields might head higher still, some players tiptoed back into the bond market during Asian trading hours. Financial spread-betting firms in London expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open 20 points lower, Germany's DAX to lose 50 points and France's CAC 40 15 points. The dollar shot up to a 4-1/2-year high against the yen. "An extremely pessimistic outlook on the US economy has given way to views that US fundamentals are solid and are reflected in the sharp rise in yields," said a chief dealer at a US securities firm in Tokyo. US Treasuries recovered slightly from an early slide on Wednesday and yields dipped. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note retreated a few basis points to 5.275 percent, having earlier raced up to a five-year high of 5.312 percent. The modest recovery in Treasuries took a little pressure off stock markets. Japan's Nikkei, which had fallen 1 percent at one point, recovered to post a closing loss of just 0.2 percent. Although rate-sensitive property stocks like Mitsui Fudosan Co Ltd fell, exporters such as Sony Corp rose, benefiting from yen weakness as the dollar climbed. South Korea's KOSPI ended down 0.5 percent, slightly above earlier lows. A fall in industrial metal prices kept Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index at a six-week low, with miners such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto hit by weakness in metals such as nickel and copper. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan fell 0.5 percent, erasing gains seen on Tuesday. Other stock indexes in the region were also lower, but off their worst levels. "Are we greatly concerned? No, we don't really believe that inflation is about to spiral out of control and bond yields will rise substantially higher. So we're still breathing easily," said Sydney-based Hans Kunnen, head of investment markets research at Colonial First State. But Japanese government bond (JGB) futures remained on the back foot, unsettled by the dramatic fall in Treasuries and growing concern that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will raise interest rates in the next few months. Although the BOJ is expected to keep rates on hold at a two-day policy meeting that ends on Friday, investors fretted that jumps in overseas yields could fuel speculation that BOJ rates might go up more rapidly than expected. September JGB futures fell 0.37 point to 131.05 by 0631 GMT, while the 10-year yield rose 4 basis points to 1.965 percent, its highest level in more than a year. The euro stood at $1.3305 at 0316 GMT, just off an 11-week low hit earlier in the day. Against the yen, the euro stood at 162.58, hovering near a one-month low. The dollar traded at 122.25 yen, up from around 121.70 yen late on Tuesday. The dollar's strength helped to drive gold prices lower, with spot gold under $646 an ounce. Oil prices dropped further below $69 a barrel on expectations that US gasoline supplies rose for the sixth straight week, easing worries of a crunch during the summer vacation season. Concern that interest rates worldwide are heading higher, choking off some demand for commodities, added to the pressure. London Brent crude, currently seen as more representative of the global market than US oil, fell 18 cents to $68.61 per barrel, after falling 77 cents in New York
