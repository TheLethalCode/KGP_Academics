 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Tuesday directed bankers to speed up work to achieve the goals of the budget announced by the interim government. Ahmed sat with the senior bankers for the first time after the budget was announced Thursday. "I've discussed with senior bankers how to attain growth projected in the proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08," Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with managing directors of state-run and private banks in his office. "Bankers are major stakeholders of the economy. They can help the government achieve the objectives and growth targeted in the proposed budget and development programmes," he said. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday presented the country's budget of Tk 87,137 crore for the upcoming fiscal year. Of the total amount, Tk 26,500 crore has been allocated for the annual development programme. GDP growth has been projected at 7 percent, up from 6.5 percent for the outgoing fiscal year. Total budget spending has increased more than 25 percent, which is a 23 percent rise for ADP for fiscal 2007-08 from the outgoing fiscal year. Analysts have said the implementation of the hefty budget would be tough for the government because of poor revenue collections and slowing foreign fund inflows. The central bank chief directed the bankers to add speed to their services through quick disbursement of loans and to ensure internal control in banks. Ahmed asked the bankers to extend more credit to agriculturea sector that attracted special attention from the government. "I've asked them to give farmers seasonal loans, for two or three months," he said. He said loan-default is a major problem for the banks in Bangladesh. "We've discussed whether they (bankers) appointed asset managers to recover the default loans," he added. A banker, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that 13 banks out of 40 did not agree to hire asset managers because of their previous bitter experience. "Bankers could sell their default loans to the asset management companies, as adopted by Pakistan," Ahmed said. Another banker who joined the meeting said the governor has asked the bankers to open a special cell to deal with loan defaults. The bankers however asked the governor to provide a specific guideline to seek account statements of customers. Ahmed expressed his satisfaction over the LC openings and settlements. He hoped the withdrawal of duties on some essentials would leave a positive impact on the market. bdnew
