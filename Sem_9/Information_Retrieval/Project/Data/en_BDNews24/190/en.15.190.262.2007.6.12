 GAZA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Fatah movement led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will decide within hours if it should quit the three-month-old unity government with Hamas Islamists, officials from the secular group said on Tuesday. After fierce factional clashes between the rivals in the Gaza Strip, Fatah spokesman Abdel-Hakim Awad said: "Fatah will in the coming hours decide its position on staying in the unity government and whether to withdraw its members from parliament." An aide to Abbas said Fatah's Central Committee planned to meet on Tuesday evening in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss whether to quit the unity government. Minutes after Hamas fighters raided Fatah security force buildings in Gaza City, spokesman Awad said: "The security forces will not pay attention to this nonsense and will defend the security headquarters with all their might." Awad said: "The political leadership of Fatah has wanted to give a chance to efforts to spare Palestinian blood but if that fails and Hamas continues its aggression, things will change. "Hamas is wrong if they thought they could end the Fatah movement and bring down the Authority by a bloody war." Egyptian mediators in Gaza said officials from neither Hamas nor Fatah attended talks arranged to discuss a truce on Tuesday. Awad accused a foreign "regional power" of working with Hamas members in a plot against Abbas's Palestinian Authority. He did not name the state but Fatah officials accuse allies Iran and Syria of funding and equipping Hamas. Hamas's most powerful leader, Khaled Meshaal, lives in exile in the Syrian capital Damascus. "What happens in Gaza is a regional plot and serving a regional agenda. There are political leaders in Hamas involved in the plot," Awad said. An official close to Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas accused Fatah members of trying to topple the unity government by force while "collaborating with forces hostile to our people". Washington has spearheaded efforts to bolster Abbas's security forces as a counterweight to Hama
