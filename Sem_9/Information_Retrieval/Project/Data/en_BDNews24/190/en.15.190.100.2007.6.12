 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)- The Appellate Division Tuesday stayed a High Court verdict that ordered the Wonderland Park in Gulshan to remove all its installations in six months. The chamber judge for the Supreme Court Appellate Division, Justice Joynul Abedin, stayed the High Court verdict until July 26 after an appeal from Bhaya Media that runs the park. On May 24, the High Court cancelled the Wonderland Park commercial allotment built within Gulshan Central Park as it had breached the original Rajuk master plan. Dhaka City Corporation had allotted a portion of Gulshan Central Park to Bhaya Media in 1990. A resident of Gulshan, MA Reza, filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the legality of the allotment in 1995. The challenge was based on commercial activities ongoing in a residential area. The High court had directed city developer Rajuk and Dhaka City Corporation to give fresh permission to re-establish Wonderland at a proper place for the entertainment of Dhaka city's children. bdnew
