 LONDON, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's First Choice Holidays said on Thursday its first-half loss widened to 82.5 million pounds ($162.8 million) as it paid for acquisitions and selling package holidays remained tough. First Choice, which is merging with German rival TUI, said it expected margins at it core Mainstream package holiday business would continue to suffer as a result of increased taxes on holidaymakers and the higher cost of fuelling its planes as it moves into the key summer period. "In Mainstream Holidays our performance has tracked in line with our expectations in what remains a challenging market," First Choice said. Profits at its specialist holidays such as skiing had risen 16 percent to 10.9 million pounds and losses at its activity holidays units had narrowed to 6.8 million from 7.5 million a year ago. It said it would raise its interim dividend 11 percent to 2.5 pence per share and said trading in the last six weeks was in line with its expectations. "The company's prospects will of course depend on the success of the merger with TUI," said Panmure Gordon analyst Gert Zonneveld. "Overall, interim results are reasonably good in what has been a challenging market, particularly in the UK." Shares in the firm, which have trebled in the last two years, rose 2.1 percent to 340 pence by 0758 GMT. This month the European Commission conditionally approved the firm's plans to tie up with Germany's TUI AG. The two companies plan to create TUI Travel Plc, a London-based company 51 percent owned by TUI. First Choice shareholders would own 49 percent. In May, German-owned Thomas Cook won permission from the Commission to buy British package holiday rival MyTravel
