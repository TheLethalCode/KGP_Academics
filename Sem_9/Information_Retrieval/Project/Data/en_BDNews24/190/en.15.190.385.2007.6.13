<TITLE> Jamaica red-faced at twists, turns of Woolmer saga </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaicans reacted with embarrassment to news that former Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was not, in fact, murdered, after a saga that started as a tragedy, became a mystery, and now turned into a farce. Attention focused on how police appeared to botch their highest-profile investigation in years by announcing on March 22 that they were treating Woolmer's death as murder, and then declaring nearly three months later he died of natural causes. Police defended their performance but commentators said Jamaica's image had taken a hit and the way the probe was conducted could even affect voter perceptions of the ruling People's National Party ahead of elections due by October. "First it was shock," said political commentator Kevin O'Brien Chang on reaction to news of Woolmer's death on March 18. "Then horror at the fact that he was murdered. Now we feel ashamed at the gross incompetence on the part of our guys." It has been "a real comedy of errors. You couldn't get any more errors than that. It's a bunch of clowns," he said of detectives involved in the case. Woolmer was found unconscious in his Kingston hotel room on March 18 and later pronounced dead one day after Pakistan had suffered a shock defeat to Ireland in the World Cup. The news cast a shadow over the island of 2.7 million, which deepened when police announced he had been murdered. POLITICAL IMPACT The potential impact of the Woolmer affair may go beyond Jamaica's international reputation. When Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller took power in February 2006 she rode a wave of popularity as the country's first female leader but a series of scandals have damaged the fortunes of a party in power since 1989. Cricket fever and a successful World Cup could have boosted the party's fortunes despite criticism over the amount of money spent on rehabilitating Sabina Park stadium in Kingston and building a second stadium near Montego Bay. In one speech, Simpson-Miller, often called "Sista P" by her supporters, sought to capitalize on the attention given to the national sport. "I have the strength to swing the bat," Simpson-Miller, was quoted as telling a campaign rally. In the event, the failure of the West Indies to progress beyond the second round of the competition and Woolmer's death in a Kingston hotel dampened euphoria. The opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) said it would not seek to turn the investigation into a political issue, arguing voters were more concerned about government failure to invest in health, education, water and rural infrastructure. "We would never expect it (Tuesday's announcement) to have political repercussions," said James Robertson, a deputy leader of the JLP. "It does make our police force look incompetent ... As a country we must be embarrassed by what took place (but) the opposition would never make a political football out of this. We would never take advantage," he said. Jamaicans were more concerned about crime and the high murder rate than about Woolmer's death, said former West Indies cricketer Maurice Foster, who now hosts a radio talk show. Even though Woolmer died of natural causes, the effect of the saga would be to focus attention on the ability of the police to combat crime, he said
