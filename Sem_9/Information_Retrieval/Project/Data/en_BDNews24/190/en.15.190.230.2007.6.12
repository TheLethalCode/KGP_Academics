<TITLE> Interest rate worries haunt markets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Concerns about inflation and higher borrowing costs dominated financial markets on Tuesday, underlined by unusually blunt comments from Bank of England Governor Mervyn King. Equities were mixed and yields on government bonds were generally higher. The dollar was flat against the euro and yen, but the British pound strengthened after a hawkish King said interest rates may need to rise again. King's comments came as markets have already been shaken by global propects that rising inflation may force tighter monetary policy, putting a lid on liquidity and raising costs for companies as bond yields rise. "Inflationary pressures are all over the place, be it in the form of labour costs ... or be it in commodities or be it in food," said Heino Ruland, a European equities strategist at German brokerage Steubing. "Equities need to cope with that." Despite the concern about rising rates and higher yields, however, most investors appear to believe that bonds have still got some way to go before they begin to rival equities. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent. London's FTSE 100 index and Frankfurt's DAX were up 0.1 percent and Paris's CAC 40 was down 0.2 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average slipped 0.41 percent or 73.57 points to 17,760.91, while the broader TOPIX index was 0.54 percent lower at 1,751.62. Caution ahead of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting ending on Friday helped keep the market in a tight range. The pound gained broadly after King said UK interest rates may need to rise again, while the New Zealand dollar rose despite Reserve Bank of New Zealand intervention on Monday. The US dollar held steady near recent 2-1/2 month highs versus the euro. Sterling was up 0.2 percent on the day at $1.9728. The dollar was flat at 121.69 yen, hovering near the 4-1/2-year high around 122.20 yen hit in January. The euro was steady at $1.3345, near a two-month low of $1.3319 touched on Friday. The single currency was little changed at 162.68 yen. Euro zone government bond prices were slightly lower, dragged down by weaker US Treasuries and the worries about rates. The 10-year Bund yield was up 0.5 basis points at 4.57 percent
