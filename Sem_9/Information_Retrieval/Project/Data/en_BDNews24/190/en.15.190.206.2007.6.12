 GAZA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's largest security force ordered its men on Tuesday to defend their positions and counter a "coup" by Hamas Islamists. "Advance, our forces! Confront the seekers of the coup. Defend your dignity and your military honour. Defend the security of your people," the command of Abbas's National Security Forces said in a statement issued in Gaza. The statement giving the order described Hamas as a "bloody party which is launching a coup against the president and against the authority and national unity government". Witnesses said they saw vehicles carrying members of the National Security Forces (NSF) to battles waging in western and northern Gaza City. The NSF is the largest security force under Abbas's control and is viewed by many Palestinians to be the equivalent of an army, though it is not as well equipped and trained as Abbas's US supported Presidential Guard. Palestinian officials estimate that the National Security Forces have as many as 30,000 members, divided between the West Bank and Gaza. Western diplomats say the number of active members is closer to 20,0
