 CARACAS, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela's government on Wednesday ordered the brief closure of two leading pollsters, citing tax violations. Datanalisis and Consultores 21, which published polls showing most Venezuelans opposed President Hugo Chavez's closure of the opposition RCTV network last month, were closed for two days by the Seniat tax agency. Chavez's closure of Venezuela's most popular channel, RCTV, sparked days of protests, sometimes drawing crowds tens of thousands strong. They complained the leftist protege of Cuban leader Fidel Castro was damaging democracy in the OPEC nation. Chavez argues private television channels backed a bungled coup that briefly toppled him in 2002 and says their glitzy soap operas promote immorality. Chavez's critics say moves against media are part of his drive to centralise power and politicize the OPEC nation's military, judiciary and oil industry. The Seniat tax authority is headed by Jose Vielma Mora, one of the officers who joined a failed coup led by Chavez in 1992. The body regularly closes companies for short periods and Datanalisis said it saw no grounds for concern in the two-day shutdown. Seniat recently has been used to spearhead Chavez's policies, particularly in the oil sector where the country is levying back taxes against US and European majors that Chavez accuses of looting natural resources
