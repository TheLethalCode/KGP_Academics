<TITLE> Kosovo told to give up Albanian eagle flag </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PRISTINA, Serbia, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo must give up the black-on-red, double-headed eagle of the Albanian national flag under the terms of a design competition published on Wednesday for the flag and symbols of the aspiring state. The province, most of whose population is ethnic Albanian, has used the flag of neighbouring Albania since NATO drove out Serb forces in 1999 and the United Nations took control. It was carried into battle by guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and now flies from state buildings and homes across the territory. But under a Western-backed United Nations blueprint for a Kosovo state, the new symbols must reflect the multi-ethnic character of a region that is also home to 100,000 Serbs as well as Roma and Turkish minorities. "Every bid to distance us from our Albanian identity is unacceptable," said Faik Fazliu, head of the KLA veterans' union. "We have our flag, red and black. And we fought for years with that flag." Efforts to grant Kosovo independence from Serbia at the United Nations have prompted a deepening diplomatic standoff between the West and Russia, a Serb ally. Serbia says it will never consent to independence. The 15-day design competition was advertised in Kosovo newspapers in four languages -- Albanian, Serbian, English and Turkish -- on Wednesday. The advertisement said submissions "must not utilize the representation of any eagle symbol, particularly with regard to such depictions in the symbols of other states; and must not solely utilize red and black colour schemes, or red, white and blue colour schemes." The Serbian flag is red, white and blue. "Entrants should bear in mind that the people of Kosovo should be able to identify with their flag and emblem," said the ad, the product of weeks of negotiation between Kosovo leaders and diplomats from the United States and European Union. "Accordingly, the flag and emblem should reflect a commitment to a common future in a spirit of respect and tolerance in Kosovo." Some 10,000 Albanians were killed and almost one million expelled in Serbia's 1998-99 war against ethnic Albanian guerrillas. NATO bombed for 78 days before Serb forces pulled out eight years ago this week. Russia has so far blocked the adoption of a UN resolution at the Security Council, and NATO powers leading 16,500 troops in Kosovo fear unrest if a decision does not come so
