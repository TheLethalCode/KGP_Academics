<TITLE> Japan opposition says election make-or-break test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition Democratic Party has a good shot at defeating the ruling bloc in an upper house election next month, but losing would put the party's very existence in danger, a top party executive said on Thursday. "We can't be overly optimistic about the numbers, but it's not impossible," Democratic Party Secretary General Yukio Hatoyama said of prospects that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's two-party coalition would lose its majority in the chamber. The election, expected on July 22 although it could be delayed if parliament's session is extended, is the first big electoral test for Abe since he took office last September. Abe is battling to soothe voter outrage over mismanaged pensions and concern about corruption after his scandal-tainted farm minister killed himself in May. That public anger has slashed Abe's support rates to just above 30 percent, or half what he enjoyed in his early days in office. The Democratic Party, an amalgam of former ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers, ex-socialists and younger conservatives, hopes to tap into the outrage with pledges to reform the pension system and break bureaucrats' stranglehold on policy. "The people's anger over the 'vanished pensions' is spreading to the regions," Hatoyama told Reuters in an interview. "Given the present situation, we are quite confident. "But there are almost 40 more days ... so the strategy of boosting the presence of the Democratic Party through our actions in parliament is vital." Despite his guarded optimism, Hatoyama said the election would be a make or break test not only for the LDP but for the Democratic Party as well. "If the Democratic Party is defeated, cracks could emerge within the party," he said. The party has long struggled to overcome policy differences, on security matters especially. "So this is an election we must not lose ... If the Democratic Party loses, the party's very existence would fall into crisis," added Hatoyama -- the grandson of a former prime minister and himself a one-time LDP member who bolted the party with a group of pro-reform politicians more than a decade ago. Abe would not automatically have to resign if his coalition lost its majority in the upper house, and if the ruling camp fell short by a few seats they could woo independents or members of a tiny conservative party to keep control of the chamber. But a big loss would mean the ruling camp would be unable to enact legislation, which must be approved by both houses of parliament, threatening political paralysis and prompting calls for Abe to resign or even call a snap lower house election. Abe had hoped to make his pledge to rewrite Japan's pacifist constitution a focus of the election campaign, but the pension furore is making that tough -- a plus for the divided Democrats. Still, Hatoyama said there were key differences on foreign policy. The Democrats want to alter Japan's US-centric diplomacy and pay more heed to Asian neighbours, he said. Abe has tightened ties with close ally the United States and won praise for repairing ties with China and South Korea, chilled by his predecessor's visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, seen by many in Asia as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. But he has visited the shrine in the past and declined to make clear whether he would do so again while in office. "He (Abe) has skilfully and strategically taken the stance of being vague as to whether or not he will pay his respects at Yasukuni. Business circles are happy that ties with China and South Korea have improved. That is true," Hatoyama said. "But this ambiguity will eventually break down. For example, he cannot keep avoiding saying whether he will go to Yasukuni or not. This is not a true relationship of trust," he added. "What we want to do is to make efforts to create a true relationship of trust with China and South Korea." The LDP and its junior coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, need to win a combined total of 64 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the election to keep their majority in the 242-member upper house
