<TITLE> Comoros mulls military options for rebel island </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MORONI, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Comoros said on Wednesday it was considering military action against a rebellious island whose self-proclaimed leadership held elections in defiance of both the international community and its own coup-prone government. The election on the island of Anjouan went ahead on Sunday despite the national government's decision to postpone it by one week because of security concerns. Two of the Indian Ocean archipelago's other islands voted as planned. Despite a boycott by Anjouan's five other candidates and non-recognition by the international community, the politically unstable island held its election and proclaimed its former president, Mohamed Bacar, as leader. "Forty eight hours of talks by the international community under African Union leadership have failed to persuade Anjouan's authorities to cancel those election results and organise the first round for Sunday 17th," Foreign Minister Ahmed Jaffar told Reuters. "Now all options are open, including the military," he said. Sunday's election came amid growing tensions on Anjouan where forces loyal to Bacar had killed two federal soldiers last month and police shot three people last week. International observers from the African Union and other groups had been withdrawn from the island before the vote, national government officials said. In a statement released in Washington on Tuesday, the United States commended successful elections on Comoros' two other islands of Grande Comore and Moheli, and urged "former island governor Bacar" to respect the will of Anjouan's population. "The people of Anjouan should be able to express their will in a peaceful, free, fair, and transparent democratic vote," the statement said, referring to elections "scheduled for June 17". Comoros' three islands, whose total population is 670,000, retain autonomy via local presidencies under the terms of a 2001 peace deal and share a rotating national presidency. Last year's national presidential elections were Comoros' first peaceful transition of power since independence in 1975. It has suffered 19 coups or attempted coups since its liberation from colonial rule. First settled by Arab seafarers 1,000 years ago and later a haven for pirates pillaging ships across the Indian Ocean, the rocky islands were annexed by France in 1904
