 SINGAPORE, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Wednesday and US Treasury yields scaled a new 5-year high, as investors fretted that strong global growth will prompt central banks to raise interest rates, crimping consumer and corporate spending. Japanese and Australian stock indexes shed nearly 1 percent. Metals and mining companies, such as Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd and BHP Billiton were among the worst hit as commodity prices slid. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note extended losses on Wednesday, driving the yield to a five-year high of 5.312 percent and surpassing the fed funds rate of 5.25 percent. Debt investors have all but given up expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut this year as the pace of economic activity strengthens, and many anticipate higher interest rates in Australia, China and Britain following increases in Europe and New Zealand last week. Japanese government bonds were unseated by the slide in Treasuries, the fall compounded by mounting concerns that the Bank of Japan will raise rates in the next few months. The benchmark bond future sank to 130.76, the lowest level since 2000. The rise in Treasury yields boosted the dollar against most major currencies, taking it to an 11-week high against the euro. Stocks resumed their fall, amid concerned that rising rates would eat into growth and may discourage takeovers, a key driver of the global equity boom. On Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index both lost nearly 1 percent. Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.8 percent by 0132 GMT to a two-week low as exporters suffered. Camera-and-copier-maker Canon Inc. and Toyota Motor both fell more than 1 percent. "I'm seeing some equity sell-off as global money that has been going into investment is gradually unwinding on worries that higher borrowing costs could cut into corporate profits," said Norihiro Fujito, general manager of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities' investment research and information division. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan fell 0.4 percent, erasing gains seen on Tuesday. In South Korea, steep declines for Samsung Electronics and shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries helped drag the benchmark KOSPI down 0.5 percent. Australia's key S&P/ASX 200 index shed 0.9 percent to six-week lows, with miners such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto hit by weakness in metals prices such as nickel and copper. Benchmark Japanese government bond September futures fell 0.40 of a point to 130.99 by 0123 GMT, while the 10-year yield rose 4.5 basis points to 1.970 percent, having earlier hit 1.980 percent, its highest level since July. The euro stood at $1.3295 at 0126 GMT, just off an 11-week low earlier in the day. Against the yen, the euro stood at 161.73 hovering near a one-month low. The dollar traded at 121.62 yen down from around 121.70 yen late on Tuesday. The dollar's strength against the euro helped to drive gold prices lower, with spot gold under $648 an ounce. Oil prices dropped further below $69 a barrel on expectations that US gasoline supplies rose for the sixth straight week, easing worries of a crunch during the summer vacation season. Concerns that interest rates worldwide are heading higher, choking off some demand for commodities added to the pressure. London Brent crude currently seen as more representative of the global market than US oil, fell 11 cents to $68.68, after falling 77 cents in New York
