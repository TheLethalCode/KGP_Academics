 Butenis slams 'secret detentions' Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Outgoing US ambassador Patricia A Butenis Wednesday decried "deaths in custody" and "secret detentions" as she criticised the government for not lifting the ban on all political activity. "I am disappointed that I am leaving Bangladesh with the ban still in place on all political party activity, a ban which does not seem to apply to some behind-the-scenes activity promoting the concept of a new party." Butenis spoke to an evening programme of the American Alumni Association at Gulshan Club in Dhaka Wednesday. "There are interesting reform proposals on the table to improve the country's electoral and political process, but I believe that the engagement and, ideally, the support of the established parties are essential," she said. "Because, at the end of the day, it is hard to build a viable political process without them," said Butenis who monitored Bangladesh's bickering politics and the state of emergency for more than a year. "As a friend of Bangladesh, I hope that the government can come to grips with the human rights problems that have threatened to undermine its reformist credentials abroad and the integrity of its political agenda here in Bangladesh." "Deaths in custody, the mistreatment of detainees, the lack of clarity on who gets arrested and why, and so-called "secret" detentions are all unacceptable in a country that is justly proud of the high price it has paid over decades to achieve and defend democracy. Butenis referred to the death of Choilesh Ritchil, the Garo activist apparently tortured to death in March, which "is particularly disturbing, though it is encouraging that the government is now taking action to deliver justice in this matter". "The Bangladesh government has identified anti-corruption as a top priority, a long overdue recognition of an insidious disease that saps the nation's vitality and promise." "Combating corruption around the world is a long-standing priority of the US government, but so is protecting the human rights of anyone held in government custody." Butenis called for the safeguard of human rights: "It is important that all detainees are treated fairly and accorded the full range of their constitutional and due process rights." "We strongly support the government's commitment to hold free, fair and credible elections as soon as possible. As a government sworn into office under the constitution's caretaker government provision, its mandate is clearly to produce good elections without unnecessary delay." "...very few Bangladeshis want to revert to politics as they were practised before January 11. That is very clear. However, it is also clear that a government that is seen to deny the people their fundamental, sovereign right to pick their leaders and determine their future does so at the risk of legitimacy and legacy. Butenis ruled out the alleged role of the US in the state of emergency slapped by the government on January 11. "My biggest regret is that I did not witness the free, fair, and credible elections we had hoped to see on January 22." "Some people have suggested that the United States engineered or condoned the declaration of a State of Emergency," she said. "Like many other things fancifully attributed to the US government, the reality here is quite different." "While we shared the sense of relief of many Bangladeshis that the disaster of a one-sided, violent election had been averted, this was not the outcome we wanted." "I know that some Bangladeshis believe that I was sometimes too outspoken. For better or worse, the days are long gone when diplomacy revolved around diplomatic notes and formal dinners." "I leave Bangladesh at an exciting time, a moment of great opportunity but also a period of great peril," said Butenis who was posted to Bangladesh on March 17, 2006. bd
