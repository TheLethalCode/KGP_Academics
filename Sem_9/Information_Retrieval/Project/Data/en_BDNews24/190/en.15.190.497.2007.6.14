 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) Awami League President Sheikh Hasina is virtually 'surrounded by the police' and she has not been allowed to go to Chittagong Thursday, says party presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury. 'Stopping Hasina from going to Chittagong is similar to violation of her individual freedom, which is against the Constitution', Chowdhury said quoting the AL chief. The AL chief termed the extortion case filed against her a 'conspiracy'. The former prime minister has not changed her schedule to go to the USA, the AL confirms. "Sheikh Hasina is surrounded by the police and she has not been allowed to go to Chittagong," said Sajeda Chowdhury who read out Hasina's statement at the entrance of the road leading to Sudha Sadan. Sajeda Chwodhury went to visit Hasina at her Sudha Sadan residence at around 10.00 am and briefed journalists at around 11.35 am. "I wanted to go to Chittagong as a human and moral being only, but I have not been allowed to do so. It is inhuman, undemocratic, unconstitutional and against my individual rights", Hasina said in the statement. "Besides, cases have been filed against me as a part of conspiracy". The AL presidium member said the police verbally told the AL chief that 'they have been instructed by the higher authorities not to allow Sheikh Hasina to go to Chittagong'. Sajeda Chowdhury said no change has been made in Hasina's scheduled US tour on June 15. AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury, former lawmaker Col (Rtd) Faruk Khan, Major Gen (Rtd) Subid Ali Bhuiyan and AL leader Nazma Rahman met Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home. The security measures Thursday have been tightened around the residence. The police were seen active. b
