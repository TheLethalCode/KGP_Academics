 CANBERRA, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The theft of a rare 17th-century Dutch painting from a major Sydney gallery has overshadowed a new record price for an Australian artwork and underscored the country's ongoing art frenzy. The self portrait "A Cavalier" by Frans van Mieris the Elder was stolen with five other paintings from the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) on Sunday, police said on Thursday. The theft was not reported for several days. "We believe that it was removed expertly from the gallery," Superintendent Simon Hardman told journalists in Sydney. Gallery director Edmund Capon said the small 20cm by 16cm artwork, insured for A$1.4 million ($1.2 million) and painted between 1657 and 1659, would be "completely unmarketable", even in Australia's current art market boom. Overseas art galleries had been alerted to the heist due to fears the painting -- well known in art circles -- could be sold on the international art black market. It was unclear how the paintings including The Cavalier had been stolen from the gallery, although empty screw holes were visible in the walls behind. There were no security cameras or guards in the room at the time of the theft. The Australian art market saw a new high mark on Wednesday with the A$3.48 million sale of an erotic outback landscape by Brett Whiteley, the late bad boy of Australian art. The huge 1985 work "The Olgas for Ernest Giles" mixes Whiteley's interest in the outback with his love of female form, showing rock formations near Ayres Rock as curves suggesting female buttocks and breasts, as well as male genitalia. "I always felt the picture was going to break the record," Deutscher-Menzies auction house owner Rod Menzies told local papers. Whiteley, who died in Sydney of a heroin overdose in 1992, aged 52, painted the ochre-and-sky work in memory of Giles, a 19th century explorer, as the artist battled alcohol, drugs and schizophrenia. The sale eclipsed the previous Australian art auction record of $3.36 million, set at the Sotheby's May sale by John Brack's The Old Time, a picture of two ballroom dancers. Critics have attributed Australia's art frenzy to the ongoing mining boom, helping pack the purses of new Australian investors, as well as strong interest from overseas buyers in London, New York and Europe. "Years ago, I could tell you all the big collectors ... (now) it's just faceless people with disgusting amounts of money," AGNSW Curator Barry Pearce told Australia's Bulletin magazine. Whiteley paintings sold in 2007 have so far drawn almost A$7 million, followed by Brack at A$4.5 million. Total sales are expected to top A$120 million, up A$15 million on 2006. "The pictures coming onto the market are unprecedented in quality and people are taking advantage of strong prices," Georgina Pemberton, head of Australian art at Sotheby's auction house, told Reuters. Pemberton said the Australian market was also seen as good value in the leadup to a week of art auctions in London expected to see over $1 billion worth of works change hands. ($1=A$1.19
