 LONDON, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 index of Britain's leading shares edged up on Thursday on the back of the overnight rise in Asian and US markets following US economic data. The Dow posted its best day since July after the data signalled strength in US consumer spending and a Federal Reserve report showed no increase in wage pressures while the economy grew last month. And higher bond prices in the US, eased investors' concerns over global interest rate rises, helping both Asian and US markets to rebound. At 0737 GMT the FTSE 100 was 43.3 points, or 0.7 percent higher at 6,602.9. On the economic calendar UK retail sales numbers are due at 0830 GMT and the US Labour Department's PPI data is due at 1230 GMT. "It's all looking a bit positive," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at 7 Investment Management. "We've got a situation where we've seen some excellent growth over the past few years but there is a natural concern that things will be going too far too fast." "There are big picture issues that people should not miss - the cost of money is rising ... (this) will have an impact on the global economy and the ability for continued growth." The positive sentiment helped banks rebound with HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Northern Rock all gaining. Bradford & Bingley also supported, up 4.6 percent after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to "neutral" from "underperform". Centrica tacked on 2.9 percent after Citigroup raised its target on the utility firm to "buy" from "hold". In other individual stocks, Home Retail Group climbed 2.3 percent after it said that while it had made a strong start to its financial year with like-for-like sales growth at its Argos and Homebase businesses, it remained cautious for the future. Britain's biggest household goods retailer said like-for-like sales at its catalogue-based Argos stores rose 0.9 percent in the 13 weeks to June 2 while its Homebase do-it-yourself chain saw like-for-like sales rise 2.7 percent. Miners also advanced as firm metal prices and the positive economic data from the US buoying demand hopes. Kazakhmys was up 1.6 percent, Lonmin gained 1.5 percent and BLT Billiton added 1.4 percent. Rio Tinto climbed 2.3 percent after it reached an agreement with the Australian Taxation Office to settle their outstanding dispute regarding a past tax assessments. In other commodities, London Brent crude oil steadied at around $70 a barrel, with traders catching their breath after a $1 spike on unexpectedly flat gasoline stocks and a deepening deficit in heating fuel supplies. BP added 0.9 percent but said on Wednesday that it had suspended plans to conduct exploration work off the Vietnamese coast due to a territorial dispute between Hanoi and China. Rival Royal Dutch Shell tacked on 0.8 percent. "At the moment there is a little bit of people coming back in and purchasing," said Urquhart Stewart. "There is still concern over the US housing market ...(the US PPI data) is very, very important. It's another one of those areas that if we get some positive numbers, which they should be, then that will give us a good opening for New York." In other news, BAE Systems added 1.5 percent after the firm dismissed claims that the US Department of Justice is readying an investigation into its Saudi Arabian dealings, the Daily Mail newspaper said. In midcaps, recruitment firm Hays gained 6.2 percent after it said it expects current year pretax profits at the top end of market consensus, as the permanent job market continues to show strong growth and the temp market remains stable. "The range that the market is expecting is between 205 and 210 (million pounds) ... and we are happy with the consensus and we'd expect to see a modest increase toward the top end of the range," Finance Director Paul Venables told Reuters
