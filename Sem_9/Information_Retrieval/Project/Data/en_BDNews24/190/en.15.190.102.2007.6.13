 ISLAMABAD, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior US official visiting Islamabad this week was expected to offer some support for President Pervez Musharraf, while staying out of a crisis brought on by his attempt to oust Pakistan's top judge. Having arrived in the Pakistani capital overnight, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher was due to meet Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri on Wednesday, and Musharraf possibly the next day. Visiting US officials usually focus on the need to intensify efforts to destroy surviving al Qaeda networks and help quash a Taliban insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan. But Boucher's discussions will inevitably also focus on a crisis brewing ahead of elections due in Pakistan this year. Although Boucher, who handles South Asia, is expected to praise General Musharraf as an ally in the war on terrorism, what he says to the general about the need to promote democracy will probably remain private. Addressing a news conference in Washington on Monday, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack set the tone for Boucher's visit, alluding to progress Musharraf has made in political and economic reforms since coming to power in a coup in 1999. McCormack touched on an issue analysts believe lies at the heart of the political crisis -- President Musharraf's dual role as army chief, which he is required to give up by the year end. Many people doubt Musharraf's intentions. Analysts suspect the motive for ousting Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was fear the judge would not protect Musharraf from constitutional challenges if he seeks re-election in uniform. Washington, however, expects Musharraf to keep his promise. "I know that he has pledged to make the choice and to -- if he continues in political life -- to put aside the uniform. And we take him at his word at that, and we would expect him to follow through on his commitments," McCormack said. US officials have expressed Washington's hope Musharraf's confrontation with Chaudhry will be settled smoothly through a judicial process. They have also denied Washington was trying to help Musharraf seal a power-sharing deal with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who has vowed to return from self-exile. Officials have also reiterated that the United States expected the coming elections to be free and fair, after widespread allegations polls five years ago were rigged. This week, New York Times and International Herald Tribune editorials argued Washington should distance itself from Musharraf, and put more faith in democratic forces if Pakistan is to become a stable democracy, less susceptible to extremism
