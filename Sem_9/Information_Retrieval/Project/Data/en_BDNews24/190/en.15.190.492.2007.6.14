 NEW DELHI, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chaos ruled at airports across India on Thursday as a strike by employees of state-run airline Indian entered its third day, stranding thousands of passengers as scores of flights were cancelled. Thousands of ground-staff and some cabin crew of the predominantly domestic carrier defied a court order to end their protest, as well as warnings of suspension and closure from the government, saying they would not be cowed by threats. The disruptions began late on Tuesday when employees of Indian, formerly known as Indian Airlines, stopped work demanding higher wages and benefits amid a boom in air travel in the country, the world's fastest growing aviation market. "The strike continues. We met the management today, the government is not positive in the talks," said J.K. Badola, general-secretary of the Air Corporation Employees Union which is leading the strike. Asked about a suspension notice issued by management to 23 employees, he said: "This can't scare us; 12,000 employees are ready to face suspension." Indian, which had a monopoly of the skies before the sector was opened up to private carriers in the early 1990s, operates about 330 flights every day, carrying about 30,000 passengers. The airline was notorious for its poor service but has pulled up its socks since the entry of private players triggered intense competition. Analysts said Indian currently had nearly a quarter of the country's domestic aviation business, as a booming economy has led to a sharp rise in air travel and the launch of several private, low-fare airlines. Indian is being merged with Air India, the state-run international flagship, to take on the competition. On Thursday, 103 flights had been cancelled and 121 would operate, an Indian spokesman said, adding that the schedule of the rest was yet to be decided. The strike began after talks between the union and the management on wage revision, promotions and payment of arrears failed on Tuesday. But the government said the industrial action was launched even as the two sides were in talks and the government had agreed to pay arrears. For many harried passengers, the disruptions were a throwback to the days when strikes or delays were frequent. Vinoth Kumar, an engineer, was not sure if he could be by the side of his wife, expected to deliver their first child on Thursday in Coimbatore. "I don't think I can get there, I am just having to talk to her by phone. I think I will miss the birth," he said outside Delhi airport, adding that some private carriers had raised fares to take advantage of the strike. Susan Montez, a tourist from Texas, said she was stuck at Delhi airport since she arrived from Dubai on her way to Amritsar. "They just have me running back and forth. This is my first trip to India, it's going to be the last too," she said
