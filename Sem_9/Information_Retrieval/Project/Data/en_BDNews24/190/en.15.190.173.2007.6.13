 PARIS, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France called on Wednesday for the European Union to resume its direct financial aid to the divided Palestinian government, arguing that the cash would bring stability as rival factions clashed in Gaza. At least 65 Palestinian deaths have been confirmed by hospital officials since Saturday in the fiercest internal violence in months between Hamas and Fatah, which together formed a unity government in March under Saudi mediation.

The EU provides direct support to the Authority's workers outside of security forces, paying allowances through a mechanism that bypasses the Hamas-led unity government, and Western diplomats said last week the EU and other Western donors were considering expanded aid programmes.

EU officials have insisted that despite its formation of a unity government with Fatah, they will not help Hamas until it clearly renounces violence and recognises Israel. Some Palestinian officials argue that Hamas is already de facto engaging with Israel. "The stabilisation of the Palestinian territories, the support of the moderates and the revival of the peace process are at stake," Mattei sa
