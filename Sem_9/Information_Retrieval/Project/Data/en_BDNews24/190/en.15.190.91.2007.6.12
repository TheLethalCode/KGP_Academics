<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday dismissed the realtors' demand that the government allowed them to invest untaxed money in the housing sector. The government has proposed in the budget for fiscal 2007-08 a ban on use of untaxed or undisclosed money for purchase or construction of buildings, lands and cars in. "The government has proposed a ban on the facility on moral grounds," Mirza Azizul told reporters after a meeting with the Real Estate Housing Association of Bangladesh (Rehab) at the finance ministry. "We would not go back on the proposal. The government's recent anticorruption drive has forced it to withdraw the facility for buying apartments, lands and cars," he said. The use of untaxed money is allowed under Sections 19B, 19BB and 19BBB of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 for the outgoing fiscal year ending on June 30. The Rehab had asked the finance adviser to lift the ban on the grounds that otherwise investment in the housing sector that accounts for 15 percent of the GDP could shrink significantly. Until June 30, one can buy an apartment with use untaxed money at a tax rate of Tk 300 per square metre for an area up to 200 square metres and Tk 500 for an area over 200 square metres. The rate is applicable to areas in Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, Bashundhara, Dhanmondi and DOHS in Dhaka and Panchlaish, Khulshi in Chittagong. The rate is 7.5 percent for the purchase of land under Section 19BB of the ordinance. For purchase of a car, the rates are 10 percent and 15 percent respectively on the basis of the engine power. On the other Rehab proposals, the adviser said he would consider duty reduction of construction materials for the housing sector. bd
