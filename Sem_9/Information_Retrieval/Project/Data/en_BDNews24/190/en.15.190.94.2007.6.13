 GAZA, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas Islamist gunmen pressed on with their Gaza offensive on Wednesday, killing eight fighters loyal to Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas in a Palestinian supremacy struggle escalating steadily into civil war. "What is happening in Gaza is madness," Abbas, the Fatah leader, told reporters in the occupied West Bank after meeting a foreign diplomat. Chanting "stop the killing", some 1,000 Palestinians marched through Gaza City, only to draw gunfire that killed a 16-year-old demonstrator and wounded four people. It was not immediately clear who shot at them. At least 60 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday in the fiercest internal violence in months between Hamas and Fatah, hospital officials said, with no end in sight after a series of failed Egyptian-brokered truces. Hamas's armed wing, which has tightened its hold on the northern Gaza Strip by seizing a major Fatah security base, said it was giving "the seekers of a coup" -- a reference to Fatah -- in that area until Friday evening to hand over their weapons. There was no immediate response from Fatah to the statement. The bloodshed has prompted Fatah, which appears to be losing ground to Hamas in Gaza, to say it was suspending participation in the unity government with Hamas without an immediate ceasefire. The government was formed in March under Saudi mediation to try to end infighting and ease Western sanctions. Abbas's group stopped short of withdrawing outright, a move that could lead to presidential rule by decree and widen a divide between the occupied West Bank, where Fatah is dominant and factional fighting is rare, and Gaza, the Hamas powerbase. Twelve people were killed in fresh violence. Hamas gunmen attacked an area near the home of a Fatah official, killing six of the group's men in fighting that went on for several hours, members of Abbas's faction said. Two more Fatah gunmen, a 15-year-old girl and three unidentified people were killed in separate clashes with Hamas, hospital officials said, and 10 other people were wounded, including a Hamas gunman, who was critically hurt. Israel, which has pledged to stay out of the internal violence, said the outcome of the fighting would weigh heavily on prospects for a peace deal with the Palestinians. "If Hamas takes control of Gaza, this will be significant not only for what happens in Gaza but for the ability to reach agreements with (Abbas) and whether it would be possible to implement them in Gaza," Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said in Jerusalem. "There is almost a complete separation between Gaza and the West Bank," she said. Israel pulled troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005. Abbas has failed to persuade Hamas to accept Western demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and abide by previous Israeli-Palestinian interim peace deals -- conditions for ending international sanctions that have deepened Palestinian poverty. Peace efforts with Israel also have gone nowhere, despite US attempts to foster a dialogue between Abbas and Olmert and elicit confidence-building steps to bolster the Fatah leader. Hamas fighters seemed to be in no mood to halt the campaign. Wearing black ski masks and aiming their assault rifles in the air, they posed for television cameras at the security compound they wrested from Fatah in a battle in the northern Gaza Strip where 15 people were killed on Tuesday. Piling into the back of a pickup truck, the gunmen tore through its courtyard, kicking up dust in a show of bravado
