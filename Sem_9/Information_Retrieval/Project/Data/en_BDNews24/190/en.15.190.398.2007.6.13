<TITLE> Blast hits revered Shia shrine in Iraq's Samarra </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Militants blew up two minarets of a revered Shia mosque in the Iraqi city of Samarra on Wednesday, targeting a shrine that had already been badly damaged in a 2006 attack, Shia officials said. One witness said the minarets at Samarra's Golden Mosque had been largely destroyed. The attack on the mosque last year was a turning point in Iraq, sparking a wave of sectarian violence that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed the country to the brink of all-out civil war. "The explosion targeted the two golden minarets. They have been damaged ... This is a criminal act which aims at creating sectarian strife," Saleh al-Haidari, the head of the Shia endowment in Iraq, a major religious body, told Reuters. He blamed "extremists" for the attack. It was unclear exactly how the minarets had been blown up, but residents said there had been clashes between gunmen and police in the area before the blast, which occurred around 9.00 am (0500 GMT). A senior Iraqi government official said the attack was "very bad news for Iraq". The Golden Mosque is one of the four major Shia shrines in Iraq. Samarra, north of Baghdad, is a predominantly Sunni city. Other major sites are in the holy Shia cities of Najaf and Kerbala and the Baghdad district of Kadhimiya, also mainly home to Shias. Two of the 12 revered Shia imams are buried in the Samarra shrine -- Imam Ali al-Hadi, who died in 868 and his son, the 11th imam, Hasan al-Askari, who died in 874. Iraq's Shia-led government has blamed Sunni Islamist al Qaeda for the attack on Feb 22 last year, when militants entered the Golden Mosque in Samarra at dawn and set off charges that destroyed its dome, one of the biggest in the Islamic world. That attack did not damage the minarets. The 2006 bombing quickly prompted a wave of revenge attacks against Sunni Arabs by Shia militia death squads, mostly in Baghdad. Police and the senior government official said the Shia-dominated Interior Ministry had been responsible for security at the mosque. Police said the ministry took over from local security forces in April. "We know that two weeks ago there was an attempt to also target it, but it was foiled," the official said. Asked how it could have been attacked with the Interior Ministry in charge of security, the official said: "Apparently the force was not enough". US military officials have accused al Qaeda of trying to ignite sectarian tensions by attacking Shia targets. There have been several large car bombings in key Shia cities in southern Iraq in recent months. The 2006 Samarra bombing lifted the lid on tensions that had been boiling between majority Shias and minority Sunni Arabs. Before the bombing, sectarian violence was on the rise. But attention was still on the Sunni Arab insurgency against American and Iraqi security forces, which erupted soon after the US-led invasion in 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein and enabled Shias to assume power for the first time in Iraq. In Baghdad in the months after the 2006 attack, Shia and Sunni gunmen forced members of the opposing sect to leave mixed neighbourhoods. For centuries a proudly mixed city, Baghdad is now roughly divided: Shias on the east side of the Tigris River and Sunnis on the west. Some Iraqis believe rebuilding the Golden Mosque in Samarra could help reconciliation, but there has been no reconstruction, partly because of disagreements over how the work will be carried out
