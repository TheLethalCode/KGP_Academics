<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday stalled the long-pending verdict on a gold smuggling case against former president HM Ershad. The pause came after first additional sessions judge Md Abul Basar, who has recently been assigned to handle the case after transfer of his predecessor, decided to hear the arguments of the opposing counsels afresh. The judge wants to hear the arguments to get a clear picture of the previous legal proceedings to issue a "fair judgment". Tuesday's pause was for the sixth time in passing the verdict, and the court fixed July 15 to hear the arguments. Ershad was in the dock when the judge made the order. On April 16, previous judge SM Mojibur Rahman set June 12 to deliver the verdict. But he was posted outside Dhaka in May. Assistant public prosecutor Md Abdul Hannan told the new judge that it might be appropriate if he heard the proceedings afresh since he was not in court during the prolonged legal battle. The judge took the prosecutor's argument into account and set the new date for hearing only the counsels' arguments. On July 17, 1990, a case was filed with the Cantonment Police Station involving an incident of seizing about 33.5 kg gold worth Tk 2.5 crore at Zia International Airport. Police submitted the chargesheet in the case on Aug 30, 1990. In a supplementary chargesheet submitted on Aug 31, 1991, the police said Ershad was involved in the smuggling effort. bdnews24.com
