 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The family of businessman Mahbub Alam Liton, who was tortured allegedly by an army captain in Dhaka, will file a case against the officer with a Dhaka court, the victim's wife said Tuesday. "We'll file a case with Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate's Court tomorrow (Wednesday) since the (Dhanmondi) police station refused to register the complaint," Liton's wife Meher Afroz told bdnews24.com. Earlier Monday, Dhanmondi police refused to take the case against Captain Shibly of the Army Engineering Corps. The owners of the apartment building where Liton lives have also planned to file a separate case against the officer. The captain allegedly dragged Liton out of his apartment and tortured him Monday. Liton is a businessman and a resident of 69 Green Road. When Liton was taken away from his flat, the officer identified himself as captain Shibly. Shibly was accompanied by another plainclothes officer and six others in uniform when he knocked the door at 7am, Afroz said. The 35-year-old man had been left with injuries back at the gate of Concept Tower where Liton and his wife own an apartment, Afroz alleged in a written complaint to the local army camp Monday. Liton was later taken to Samorita Hospital. bdnews24.com posted pictures of Liton lying in hospital bed with clear red marks of the alleged torture. An attending doctor had told bdnews24.com that he suffered chest and hip injuries. "It's inhuman. They (army officers) beat my husband and left him back with injuries," she said Monday . In her written complaint, Afroz identified Captain Shibly as son of Roksana Begum, owner of Flat 13D of the building. Meanwhile, army officers from the Science Laboratory army camp visited the victim Tuesday and questioned him for one and a half hours. Afroz told bdnews24.com that a three-member team of the camp questioned Liton and other members of his family in hospital. Afroz quoted one of the officers as telling her: "You'll gain nothing from going to police stations. You'll get better justice from us." The officers also asked Afroz to contact the local army camp if she faces any trouble, she said. Afroz said Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain went to Concept Tower Tuesday morning and questioned her neighbours. Monwar denied. "None of my officers went there," he told bdnews24.com in the evening. "The army will deal with the matter since it involves their men." The president and the general secretary of Concept Tower Flat Owners Association said that they would sit in a meeting Tuesday night. President Akhtar Hossain and secretary Md Emdadul Haque said they would also file a case Wednesday. Meanwhile, members of the two human-rights groups visited Liton and assured the family of extending legal assistance. Ain-o-Salish Kendra and Odhikar officials recorded the incident. Odhikar official Ilias Ali told bdnews24.com that his organisation would file a writ petition if necessary. Dr Shahjalal, who was treating Liton, said that the man was suffering from multiple injuries. "We're trying to spot internal injuries. We'll get a clear idea about his condition after getting some test results," he told bdnews24.com. bdnews
