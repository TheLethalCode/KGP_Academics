<TEXT>
 KARACHI, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq said on Tuesday his players should not take legal action over the way they were treated after the death of their coach Bob Woolmer. Jamaican police said earlier that Woolmer, 58, had died of natural causes in Kingston after his team lost to Ireland at the cricket World Cup in March after initially treating the death as a murder inquiry. The Pakistan players were questioned, finger printed, asked to give DNA tests and detained in Kingston for 11 days after Woolmer's death on March 18. Inzamam, who stepped down as captain shortly after Woolmer's death, told Reuters he did not believe that taking court action would help anybody. "What is done is done because the trauma we suffered cannot be erased from our memories," he said. "A nightmare is over for us. But the scars will not go away so easily. We co-operated with the Jamaican police but we were left alone to fend for ourselves and that still hurts." Inzamam said he and the other players had always believed the death was natural. "Bob had ailments and the circumstances of his death were such that we thought 'why would anyone want to murder him?' He was a peace-loving and friendly man with no enemies," said Inzamam. Present captain Shoaib Malik said the team had co-operated with the police because they wanted the truth to come out. "We knew they were wrong when they talked about murder," he said. Senior batsman Mohammad Yousuf said he would still press the board to at least seek some compensation and apology from the Jamaican authorities for making such a big mistake. "It was terrible what we went through from the day he (Woolmer) died and the day we returned home," he said. Pakistan manager Talat Ali said he was very relieved the ordeal was over. Ali, a former test player was the first man called to Woolmer's hotel room in Kingston where he was found unconscious in his bathroom. Woolmer later died in hospital. "I am happy for Bob's family that this is all over for them now. I can feel for them. It was a tragic event for us and what happened afterwards didn't help matters at all. It was painful," he said
