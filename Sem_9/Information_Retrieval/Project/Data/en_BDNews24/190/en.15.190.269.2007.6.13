 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad Wednesday said there was no need for a rushed election in the country, the party said in a statement. The Election Commission should be allowed enough time to make the electoral roll with photographs and create a congenial atmosphere for the polls, Ershad said in a meeting with US ambassador Patricia A Butenis at his Baridhara home. The JP chief told Butenis that he believed people welcomed the situation. He hoped the election would be held by 2008. Butenis thanked Ershad for his cooperation while discharging her duties in Bangladesh, the statement said. JP presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed was present. bdnew
