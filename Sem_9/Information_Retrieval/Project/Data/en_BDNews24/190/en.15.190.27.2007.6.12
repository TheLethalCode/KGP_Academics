<TITLE> Subcontinent teams respect Tigers: Mashrafee </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Vice-captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza Tuesday said Bangladeshi cricketers were well respected by Indian, Sri Lankan and Pakistani players in the Afro-Asia Cup series in India. "Every one showed us respect. They were also enthusiasm with me and I very much enjoyed every moment," said Mashrafee, who Tuesday joined the Tigers in practice for the Sri Lanka tour at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Mashrafee and Mohammad Rafique Monday returned home playing the Afro-Asia Cup where Asia XI whitewashed Africa XI 3-0 in one-day series. Evaluating his one-day performances in the series, Mashrafee said he is used to bowl with new ball, but he was brought as first change, which he was not accustomed to. He, however, believes he had good match practice having played in the series. The Bangladesh pace spearhead is now keen to impressive in the three Test matches and as many one-dayers in Sri Lanka. "I am keen to do something impressive in Sri Lanka this time as I bowled only one ball in a practice match and then returned home with an injury the last time Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka," said Mashrafee. "This time I have no fitness concern. So I want to do something," he added. Mashrafee thinks the tour of Sri Lanka would be tough for them and the Tigers must play their natural games and stay positive. "We would want to take at least one Test to the fifth day. If we can do this, it would be a big achievement for us," said Mashrafee. "To take a Test to its fifth day, the batsmen must put their best as only the bowlers cannot do this," said the 23-year old pacer.
