 DURBAN, South Africa, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The family of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer expressed relief on Tuesday at the Jamaican police announcement that he had died of natural causes and not murder as initially suspected. Woolmer, 58, was found unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston on March 18 afer his team had been upset by Ireland in the cricket World Cup. "We hope that this matter will now be closed and that our family will be left to grieve in peace," his widow Gill Woolmer said in a media statement. In South Africa, where Woolmer was cremated in May near his family home, the reaction combined relief for his family with anger at the three-month investigation. "Bob left a tremendous legacy in cricket, and to have to go through all this fumbling and bumbling without knowing what happened has been tough," Gary Kirsten, a former South Africa opener, told Reuters. His sentiment was echoed in Pakistan. "It has been a traumatic period for all of us because of the unnecessary delay in resolving the cause of Woolmer's death. But finally we are relieved it is all over now," Ehsan Malik a spokesman for the Pakistan Cricket Board said
