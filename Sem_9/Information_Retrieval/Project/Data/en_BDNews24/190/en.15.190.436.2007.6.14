 DODOMA, Tanzania, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tanzania's economy is expected to grow by 7.3 percent in 2007, up from a stronger than expected 6.2 percent in 2006, a planning ministry survey showed on Thursday. "Economic growth will be 7.3 percent in 2007 and 7.7 percent in 2008," said Juma Ngasongwa, planning, economy and empowerment minister in an economic survey presented to parliament ahead of Tanzania's budget speech later on Thursday. "In 2006, GDP grew by 6.2 percent compared with an earlier projection of 5.9 percent," he said. The government targets average inflation at below 4.0 percent by the end of the current (July-June) fiscal year and 4.5 percent in 2007/08, Ngasongwa said adding that average inflation stood at 7.3 percent in 2006. The economy grew by 6.7 percent in 2005 but drought in the first quarter of 2006 hit productivity, with many industries resorting to expensive fuel-powered generators during power interruptions. The drought caused food shortages which led to higher imports and contributed to higher inflation that peaked at 7.7 percent in May 2006. After that good weather boosted food production and inflation eased to 5 percent in May this year. "The inflation rate is expected to reduce further due to better food production in various parts of the country," the survey said. Tanzania's foreign exchange reserves rose to $2.26 billion in 2006, equivalent to 5.3 months of import cover, from $2.048 billion in 2005. "This amount was below the target of seven months of import cover, due to imports of generators after drought caused water levels to drop in hydroelectric dams," the survey said. Mining, tourism, manufacturing, farming, construction and transport and communications sectors were among main contributors to the country's economy. Agriculture, the main economic activity for more than half of the country's population, contributed 44.7 percent of GDP in 2006 compared with 45.6 percent in 2005
