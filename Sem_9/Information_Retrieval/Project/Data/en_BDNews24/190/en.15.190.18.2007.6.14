 GARISSA, Kenya, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Kenyan policemen believed kidnapped by Islamist fighters have been found murdered on the border with Somalia, police said on Thursday. "At 0730 this morning (0430 GMT), the two officers were found murdered, on a hill about 500 meters inside Kenya," Kenyan police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. "Initial investigations show that they were murdered elsewhere and dumped at the scene." A local Somali reporter said nomads in the region discovered the bodies well inside Somalia. "One of them told me that when he was watering his camels this morning, he found the bodies of two men with Kenyan police uniforms," journalist Mohamed Aden told Reuters from the area. "Kenyan security forces have arrived and taken the bodies away." The pair vanished on Sunday on the remote border, where tensions are running high over the arrest of scores of suspected Somali Islamists trying to enter Kenya after they were routed from Mogadishu in January by Somali and Ethiopian troops. On Wednesday, Kenyan infantry joined Somali and Ethiopian forces searching for the pair, questioning the pastoralists who criss-cross the remote, arid region with their animals. Leaders of Somalia's former Islamist movement see Kenya as an enemy after it detained members trying to flee over the border in January and February and then sent scores into the custody of the Somali government and its Ethiopian allies. Dozens of them were later flown to Addis Ababa for interrogation by Ethiopian and Western intelligence agencies in a case rights groups have dubbed an "African Guantanamo"
