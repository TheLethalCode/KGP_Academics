 LONDON, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading shares edged down on Wednesday amid a global slide triggered by US Treasury bond yields hitting their highest in five years and exacerbating fears that central banks around the world may hike interest rates. At 0722 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 26.8 points, or 0.4 percent lower at 6,493.6. With inflationary concerns high on the agenda, the banking sector weighed, with HBOS, HSBC, Northern Rock all dragging into the red. "Banks are off a bit, Alliance Leicester doing better than HBOS, but it's a smaller operation ... They have a new CEO coming on, and he's seen as very positive, said David Buik of Cantor Index. "I think we'll be trading in a fairly wide range today, wider than normal." "Bond yields and the equity ratios will take some sorting out. If the cost of borrowing goes up substantially, then it remains to be seen. But the equity market is by no means on its death bed." With little on the economic calendar to offer market direction, investors will eye the US Federal Reserve releasing its Beige Book of regional economic conditions at 1800 GMT. Before that, the US retail sales numbers at 1230 GMT and UK unemployment data at 0830 GMT will also be watched closely. Among individual stocks, BT Group added 0.7 percent after a Bear Stearns upgrade, traders said. But Alliance & Leicester topped the FTSE 100 leader board, climbing 1 percent after it said 2007 core operating profit is expected to be near the top of the current range of analysts' forecasts, marking a slim rise for the year. Estimates ranged from 571 million to 608 million pounds, the bank said, compared with 585 million pounds ($1.15 billion) last year. Finance Director David Bennett will also take over as chief executive next month, replacing Richard Pym, who announced plans to step down in February. Barclays fell 0.6 percent after media reports that the bank has drawn up contingency plans to restructure its all-share offer for ABN AMRO with a significant cash sweetener in case it is forced into a full-blown battle for control of the Dutch lender. "The market feels that things are heading back in Barclays direction, and gatecrashers don't typically win deals of this nature," said Buik. In commodities, miners were mixed as base metal prices dipped. Xstrata added 0.3 percent, Rio Tinto climbed 0.2 percent, Kazakhmys lost 1.3 percent and Antofagasta was down 0.3 percent ahead of its annual general meeting. Cadbury Schweppes dipped 0.4 percent as at least two bidding groups planned to submit offers on Friday to acquire its US beverage unit for as much as $15.8 billion (8 billion pounds), sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. British-based Cadbury, the world's biggest confectionery company, plans to weigh the proposals before outlining its strategic plans and cost-cutting initiatives on June 19, the sources said. Further on the downside, a number of companies going ex-dividend featured, including Johnson Matthey, Cable & Wireless and Kelda Group
