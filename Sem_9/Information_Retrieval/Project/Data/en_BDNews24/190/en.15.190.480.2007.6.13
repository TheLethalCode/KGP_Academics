<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com) -- The interim administration is preparing to file up to 16 major tax evasion cases to tighten its move against corruption, the chairman of the National Board of Revenue said Wednesday. "We're getting ready to sue the big tax evaders to show them the government's intention in fighting corruption," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told reporters after a meeting with the national coordination committee on curbing serious crimes. The cases will more or less parallel the one filed against former BNP lawmaker Ali Asgar Loby, according to Rahman. On May 23, the NBR filed a case against Loby for evading income tax amounting to Tk 17.23 crore. Joint forces had earlier arrested Loby at his Gulshan home and seized Tk 9.75 crore FDR. The Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) of the NBR also collected information on his various bank accounts where they found Tk 22.25 crore. "In total, some 400 to 500 cases will be lodged in phases against tax dodgers," a senior NBR official, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com. "Some 70 cases are in the final stage," he added. The NBR chairman sat with the national coordination committee members for the first time Wednesday to foster collaboration between the NBR and the coordination committee. He said the meeting also discussed details of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 to familiarise committee members with it. "We're conversant with the anti-corruption laws, but we know little about the NBR laws," a committee member said at the meeting. The NBR boss said some committee members had been unsure about some provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. "We've tried today to remove the uncertainties," he said. The meeting also discussed the problems faces by the anti-graft committee, but the NBR chief did not elaborate on these. Replying to a query, he said that he has no plan as yet to sue the top two political leaders  Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. He said the NBR's move to net the tax evaders should not alarm the general public. Rahman also told bdnews24.com that the siphoning of money through the hundi system had reduced recently due to the anti-graft drive. bdn
