<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)--Chinua Achebe born on November 16, 1930 is a Nigerian novelist and poet, an esteemed and controversial literary critic and one of the most widely read 20th century author. Once a diplomat in the ill-fated Biafran government of 1967-1970, Achebe is primarily interested in African politics, the depiction of Africa and Africans in the West, and the intricacies of pre-colonial African culture and civilization, as well as the effects of colonialization on African societies. Achebe's 1958 magnum opus Things Fall Apart, a historical novel that considers the effects of colonialization on an indigenous society, has been translated into over 50 languages. Well known for his criticism onJoseph Conrad, Achebe's 2001 Home and Exile reiterated his long-standing belief that Africa and Africans were being unfairly marginalized and dismissed by the European and Western-oriented intellectuals. Albert Chinualumogu Achebe was born in Ogidi, Nigeria, the son of Protestant converts Isaiah Okafo and Janet N. Iloegbunam Achebe. He attended the University of Ibadan, then known as the University of London, from 1948 to 1953, studying English, history, and theology. The University of Ibadan produced a plethora of remarkable poets and authors in the years before and after Achebe's presence there, including Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, Elechi Amadi, John Pepper Clark, and Christopher Okigbo. Paralysed from the waist down in a 1990 car accident, Achebe is currently Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He is married to Professor Christie Chinwe Achebe, with whom he has four children. Achebe is the recipient of over 30 honorary degrees from universities in England, Scotland, Canada, South Africa, Nigeria and the United States. Achebe has received numerous awards for his work, including the Commonwealth Poetry Prize; the New Statesman Jock Campbell Prize; the Margaret Wrong Prize; the Nigerian National Trophy in 1961; and the Nigerian National Merit Award. In 2002 he was awarded the prestigious Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. In 2004, Achebe declined to accept the Commander of the Federal Republic (CFR) - Nigeria's second highest honor - in protest of the state of affairs in his native country. Achebe was announced the winner of the 2007 Man Booker International Prize in honour of his literary career.
