 BHOPAL, India, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An agriculture engineering institute in Madhya Pradesh has designed a light-weight, steel bullock-cart with brakes for farmers, which can carry bigger loads but will be easier on the animals.

The new cart would be made of stainless steel and will be at least 30 kg lighter than the wooden one, officials said on Wednesday. It will cost 10,000 rupees, compared to the wooden ones which cost 14,000 rupees, and can carry loads of up to 2 tonnes. To begin with, more than 700 such carts would be manufactured and given to farmers at a subsidised price of 5,000 rupees.
