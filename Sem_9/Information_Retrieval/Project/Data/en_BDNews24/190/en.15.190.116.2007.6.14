 MANILA, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Philippine navy officer who led an attempted coup against the government of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has been elected to the Senate, the Commission on Elections said on Thursday. Commission chairman Benjamin Abalos told Reuters that Lieutenant Antonio Trillanes had clinched the 11th seat of the 12 that were contested in the May 14 elections. "His election will be formally proclaimed on Friday," Abalos said. Trillanes is still in jail awaiting trial, and it was not immediately clear if he would be able to attend the proclamation. Ten candidates have already been proclaimed winners while the 12th and final place will be decided after disputed votes are dealt with. The Senatorial election has been a setback for Arroyo -- only two of her supporters are among the 11 winners so far. The opposition has seven seats, including Trillanes, and independents two. The two contenders for the last seat include one from the administration and one from the opposition
