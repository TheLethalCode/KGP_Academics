 BAGHDAD, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Sunni Muslim mosques were attacked and burned south of Baghdad on Thursday, Iraqi police said, in apparent reprisal attacks after suspected al Qaeda militants blew up the minarets of a revered Shia shrine. Tens of thousands of Iraqi and US soldiers were on the streets of Baghdad and other cities enforcing curfews imposed after Wednesday's bombing at Samarra's al-Askari mosque toppled its two golden minarets. An attack on the same mosque in February 2006 unleashed waves of sectarian violence in which tens of thousands of people were killed, tipping Iraq close to all-out civil war between majority Shias and minority Sunni Arabs. The latest Samarra attack, condemned by US President George W Bush and other world leaders, immediately raised fears of similar retaliatory violence. Police said unidentified gunmen on Thursday attacked the al-Mustafa and Huteen mosques in the town of Iskandariya, where the Sunni Grand Mosque was destroyed on Wednesday. The al-Bashir mosque in nearby Mahaweel was also attacked. The streets of Baghdad rang with gunfire overnight as gunmen attempted to attack a major Sunni mosque in the centre of the city, residents said. The mosque attacks south of Baghdad happened a day before US commanders have said all American troop reinforcements would be in place as part of a security crackdown in the capital involving 28,000 extra US soldiers. The crackdown is aimed at securing the capital so Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government can reach political targets set by Washington aimed at promoting national reconciliation
