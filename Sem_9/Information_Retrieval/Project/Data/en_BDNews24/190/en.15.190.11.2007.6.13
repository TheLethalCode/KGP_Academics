 NEW DELHI, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will hold elections next month to choose a new president if the ruling coalition and the opposition do not agree on a consensus candidate, the Election Commission said on Wednesday. The five-year term of APJ Abdul Kalam, a former missile scientist who became popular as the "people's president" for his easy accessibility and friendly demeanour, expires on July 24. Elections, if necessary, would be held on July 19, the Election Commission said. The president of India is the titular head of state, like the British monarch. Executive power is exercised in the name of the president by the council of ministers headed by the prime minister. But the president has important discretionary powers in the appointment of the prime minister, especially when no party wins a majority in parliamentary elections, and can also return bills sent for assent before they become law. Although the constitution allows a second term, all presidents barring the first, Rajendra Prasad, have served only one term as a convention. Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil is tipped to be the candidate of the ruling Congress party, while Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekawat, a former leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, is expected to run for the opposition. The president is elected by an electoral college of MPs and elected members of state legislatures
