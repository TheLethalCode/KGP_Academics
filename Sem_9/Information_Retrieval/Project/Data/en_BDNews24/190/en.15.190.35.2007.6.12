<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Jail authorities Tuesday allotted a first-class division to Tarique Rahman in Dhaka Central Jail, a senior prison official said. Tarique, who faces charges of extortion, landed in jail after he was arrested in March. Last week the High Court asked the government to allot a division to the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. "Now he'll enjoy all the benefits of the division," deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com late Tuesday. He said Tarique had been sleeping on the floor as an ordinary inmate after he was brought to jail. Now, he will get a bed to sleep in, the official said. Tarique will also get a chair, a table, a toothbrush and a mirror under the new arrangement, he said. Siddiqui said the menu would now be different for Tarique. Joint forces arrested the senior joint secretary general of Bangladesh Nationalist party at his mother's Moinul Road home in Dhaka cantonment on the night of March 7. Three separate extortion cases have been filed against Tarique amid allegations that the man misused his power as a son of the prime minister in 2001-2006. Tarique and his close friends allegedly manipulated many official decisions for personal benefits, especially to spin off money from government schemes or business contracts. After the chief metropolitan magistrate and the district court rejected Tarique's prayer for division, his counsels appealed to the High Court for a remedy. Last week, the HC ordered the jail authorities to grant Tarique division in jail, considering his "social status". Tarique was kept in the Champa Koli cell of Dhaka Central Jail as an ordinary inmate before he was given the new allotment. bdnews24
