<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry says in a US interview with his brother that no one will ever know the truth about the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a car crash in a Paris tunnel almost a decade ago. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer to air on Monday on the 'Today' show and 'Dateline NBC,' Harry said: "Whatever happened in that tunnel ... you know no one will ever know. And I'm sure people will always think about that the whole time ... I'll never stop wondering about that." Harry, 22, and his brother William, 24, try to describe the impact of their mother's death on their lives. Princess Diana died on August 31, 1997 after a high-speed car crash in a Paris tunnel along with her boyfriend, Dodi Al-Fayed, and their driver. Both princes said in the interview conducted last month that in the decade since their mother's death, time had passed very slowly, with William, 24, adding that not a day goes by that he doesn't think about her and her death. Lauer said Diana wanted her sons to live lives as normal as possible and asked the princes if they thought they had. Harry answered, "I think she'd be happy in the way that we're going about it but slightly unhappy about the way the other people were going about it, as in saying, 'Look you're not normal so stop trying' to be normal,' which is very much what we get a lot." He added: "Within our private life and within certain other parts of our life we want to be as normal as possible. And yes it's hard -- 'cause to a certain respect we never will be normal." Asked what they would do if they weren't princes, William joked that when he was younger, he wanted to be a police officer "but not now." Then he added that he'd like to fly helicopters, "you know, working for the UN maybe or something like that." When Lauer asked Harry, William cut in and said, amid laughter, "He'd probably play computer games and drink beer." But Harry said he'd like to live in Africa, be involved in humanitarian activities and work as a safari guide. In their mother's honor, the two princes have organized a concert for July 1, which would have been her 46th birthd
