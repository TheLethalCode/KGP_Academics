<TITLE> Old motels evoke past glory of US 'Mother Road' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 EL RENO, Okla, June (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anna Boevers remembers when the Motel Reno did a brisk trade on Route 66, America's first roadway linking the broad interior to the West Coast. "It was here when I moved here in 1946 but it caught fire and burnt out about 20 years ago," she said as she watered her flower beds under a scorching Oklahoma sun. The motel still stands across the road from Boevers' home and well-manicured lawn but is abandoned and dilapidated, its windows smashed. Vagrants appear to inhabit it now, with tough-looking characters entering through gaping holes in the glass. Such motels, with their trademark neon signs and family-run simplicity, are an endangered species which evoke the glory days of a route that once symbolized America's embrace of the auto age and travel across its vast expanse. They are among a list of irreplaceable landmarks on the brink of extinction that the National Trust for Historic Preservation highlighted on Thursday. Such 'mom and pop motels' -- so-called because they were close-knit family affairs -- are instantly recognizable by their colorful neon signs that light up garishly at night. "It was a lot busier here until they put the interstate through and it bypassed El Reno," Boevers said of her small town, which lies about 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. It is a familiar refrain for communities that once thrived because of their location on "the long concrete path across the country," as John Steinbeck memorably described Route 66 in his famous novel 'The Grapes of Wrath.' "Highway 66 is the main migrant road ... the mother road, the road of flight," Steinbeck wrote of the stream of dispossessed humanity who fled the drought-stricken Oklahoma Dust Bowl in the 1930s in search of the promised land in California. The road also stirs memories of the era of post-World War Two prosperity in America when working-class families could afford to buy and drive big cars on long trips -- hence the nostalgia for the route. But the interstate highway system, begun in the 1950s, offered a faster, safer way of crisscrossing the country and many of the old roads that gave rise to motels saw a decline in traffic and customers. FEW LEFT The few such establishments near Oklahoma City on old Route 66 that remain are still family-run and offer what they always have -- a no-frills room at a rock-bottom price. And as in Steinbeck's day they still draw migrants escaping poverty back home -- in this case South Asian immigrants known for their work ethic and emphasis on family-run businesses. Several of the motels visited by Reuters were run by immigrant families from South Asia -- for whom long hours and small profit margins are the price to be paid for their own updated version of the flight to the 'promised land.' "I'm fixing things up, I plan on redoing the parking lot," said Ken Patel, the owner of the Western Motel just west of Oklahoma City, as he sat in his office on a warm Saturday night. His lit up neon sign outside is a classic of the genre, beckoning customers in glowing shades of red and green. An unlit sombrero-style hat is perched jauntily atop one corner. A few miles east lies the Carlyle Motel, its neon sign an eye-catching mix of turquoise, brown and yellow cut at sharp angles. It stands out starkly in a drab modern strip of used-car lots and fast-food joints. Such development -- and the retail chains they bring -- are among the threats to the last of these motels. "You have an older couple who have had this property for say 30 years and they want to retire and so they sell out to developers. These are the people we want to work to preserve these old motels," said Michael Taylor, a program manager for the National Park Servi
