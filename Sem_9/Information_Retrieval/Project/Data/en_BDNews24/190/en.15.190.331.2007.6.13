 BAGHDAD, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Shia group loyal to cleric Moqtada al-Sadr urged its supporters on Wednesday to exercise calm after militants again attacked a revered Shia mosque in the Iraqi city of Samarra. After the bombing of the Golden Shrine of Samarra in 2006, which left it partly destroyed, militants from the Mehdi Army militia, loyal to Sadr, targeted members of Iraq's Sunni Arab community in Baghdad in revenge. "Our reaction is the opposite of what the occupation wants. We are calling on our people to show restraint, unity and to reject sectarian strife. We are also urging them to exercise calm," said Abdul Mahdi al-Mutiri, a senior Sadr movement official. He said the movement held the US forces and the Iraqi government responsible for the attack. "This is a terrorist act. How did the terrorists manage to go inside the shrine, plant the explosives and then blow it up, unless they have some people in the forces there helping them.
