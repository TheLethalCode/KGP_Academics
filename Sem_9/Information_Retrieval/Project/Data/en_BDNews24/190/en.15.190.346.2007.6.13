<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei average slipped 0.16 percent on Wednesday as Mitsui Fudosan Co Ltd and other property firms fell on concerns about rising interest rates, while a slide in metals prices hit metal shares. But the market received support from exporters such as Sony Corp after the dollar struck a 4-1/2-year high against the yen on Wednesday as a sharp rise in US bond yields boosted the dollar's allure while carry trades proved resilient. Trading houses, which have large investments in the metal industry, were also hit, with Mitsubishi Corp down 1.8 percent to 3,130 yen and Mitsui & Co falling 1.6 percent to 2,405. Nova Corp, one of the nation's biggest operators of English language schools, tumbled 10 percent to 88 yen after government sources said the government will issue an administrative penalty against the company. Caution ahead of the Bank of Japan's decision on interest rates on Friday and US producer and inflation prices data later in the week helped cap gains in the market. "Investors fear the US economy is headed to a downtrend in which it cannot cope with higher interest rates, but if that proves not to be the case, there's no more need to worry," said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities. "We need to understand the relation between interest rates and stock prices. Higher rates and growing economies can co-exist for a while as strong growth prompts a rate hike in the first place." The Nikkei shed 28.14 points to 17,732.77, while the broader TOPIX index was 0.33 percent lower at 1,745.92. Japanese government bond futures tumbled to a seven-year low on Wednesday on the continuing slide in US Treasuries and mounting concerns that the Bank of Japan could lift interest rates as soon as August. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 3.5 basis points to 1.960 percent, off an 11-month high of 1.985 percent hit earlier, but still near last year's peak of 2.005 percent. Norihiro Fujito, general manager of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities' investment research and information division, said there was a shift in global money due to higher interest rates. "I'm seeing some equity sell-offs as global money that has been going into investment is gradually unwinding on worries that higher borrowing costs could cut corporate profits," Fujito said. Trade slowed with 2.1 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section, compared with last week's daily average of 2.7 billion shares. Declining shares outpaced advancers by 942 to 640. Property firms fell with Mitsui Fudosan down 1.9 percent at 3,540 yen and Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd losing 1.7 percent to 3,470 yen. Shares of Nippon Building Fund Inc declined 1.7 percent to 1.72 million yen, helping the Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT index move down 2.5 percent. The REIT index climbed 24 percent in 2006, compared with about a 2 percent rise in the TOPIX, and it has been seen as ready for correction. Dowa Mining Co Ltd, a nonferrous metal manufacturer, dropped 3 percent to 1,216 yen, one of the stocks most affected by a slide in metal prices. On Tuesday, nickel prices fell more than 6 percent and copper shed more than 2 percent after a slowdown in Chinese imports and a fall in global equity markets dampened sentiment. Copper smelter Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd tumbled 4.2 percent to 2,620 yen, while Toho Zinc Co Ltd lost 1.7 percent to 1,113 yen. Elsewhere, NEC Tokin Corp fell 3.3 percent to 465 yen after it announced a recall of 134,000 cell phone battery packs that could generate heat in some circumstances. Exporters Sony Corp rose 1.2 percent to 6,660 yen and Tokyo Electron Ltd gained 1.5 percent to 8,580 yen
