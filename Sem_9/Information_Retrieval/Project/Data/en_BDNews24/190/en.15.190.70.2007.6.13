 By Anisur Rahman, bdnews24.com Sports Correspondent Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Some sports organisers are making money hand over fist allegedly by using their offices to get contracts. Anwarul Haq Helal, general secretary of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF), former national footballer Syed Hasan Kanon, a BFF executive committee member, and Abdur Rashid Shikdar, joint secretary of the Bangladesh Athletics Federation (BAF), are some of them. The trio assumed their posts during the BNP-led government. A conflict of interests exists where the office of national federations are being used to generate private incomes. Any advantage gained from winning construction work, tendered by the National Sports Council (NSC), is unethical, if not strictly illegal, sources with knowledge of the sports regulatory framework said. Kanon, the former Bangladesh goalkeeper, earned nearly Tk 4. 57 crore from four contracts, including for ground development at Kishoreganj stadium, supplying building materials for the Dhanmondi Women's Complex and upgrading the Dhanmondi Gymnasium, according to NSC sources. Allegations have it that Helal made about Tk 97 lakh after winning a contract for work at Chandpur stadium. He used licence of his uncle's firm Ataul Haq & Company to bid for the contract. He saw no conflict between his BFF position and gaining personally from NSC work contracts. "I worked with my uncle's licence and see no wrong in that as I have been working for the BFF without any remuneration," Helal told bdnews24.com. Abdur Rashid Shikdar became a BAF official after supplying fake councillorship credentials from Cox's Bazar, an investigation of the Bangladesh Olympic Association revealed. He earned nearly Tk 15 lakh in profits from Kushtia stadium, according to the sources. Helal, the BFF general secretary, however, accepted that it was not fair for officials to get involved with NSC tenders. Dhaka City Mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, a former sports minister and former BFF joint secretary, said, "Considering their self-respect, sports organisers should refrain from working with the NSC, though there is no restriction on it." "If officials do this, it may hamper the greater interest of their federations," Khoka said. "It must be corruption," said Asaf-Ud-Dowllah, former sports secretary. "They have come to these positions in order to benefit as contractors, they are not true sport organisers," added the former bureaucrat. bdnew
