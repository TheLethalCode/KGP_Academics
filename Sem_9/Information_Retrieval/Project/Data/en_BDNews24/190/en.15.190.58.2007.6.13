 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Former LDP organising secretary Mahi B Chowdhury Wednesday launched a new platform styled "The Reformists" to bring what he said were drastic changes to politics. Mahi announced the venture in a press briefing at Summer Palace, a hotel at Baridhara, to promote "politics based on merit". He said the organisation draws on the resources of some 100 people. "We dream of a revolution without blood-letting that starts today. Breaking law will not bring about positive reforms. "Curbing the rights of the people is not politics as well. The streets need to be kept free for people to work," he said. Lawyer Tanzida Mina, Dr Sannun Taha, businessman Musa Md Haminur Rahman Henry and garment unit owner Mahbub Ali who along with Mahi form the steering committee were present in the briefing. Mahi will work as moderator of The Reformists that he said has nothing to do with mainstream politics, Mahi evaded a clear answer on whether the latest move was meant to facilitate the military/backed interim government. "This is our responsibility to assist the present government." Asked if Jamaat-e-Islami will be a part of his new venture. he said, "I do not have anything to do with anyone who does not believe in our independence." He said he would finalise the goals of The Reformists after a cross-country tour next month. Son of former president and LDP chief AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury, Mahi said they would value opinions of the young. He said government permitting he will exchange views with a cross-section of people on June 17 in Munshiganj, June 20 in Bogra, June 21 in Rajshahi and June 24 in Mymensingh. Tanzida Mina said reform does not mean only a change on leadership, it means a comprehensive change in politics. "We have advanced in everything except in politics," Dr. Sannun Taha said. Mahi also answered questions covering issues like his resignation from the LDP's policymaking presidium. He said he had tried to reform the party and purge it of identified, corrupt people. A plan to try reforms made him leave LDP, he said. He ruled out going back to the BNP. "No. Never. No question of that. I left the BNP so that I can do something good." bdnews24.
