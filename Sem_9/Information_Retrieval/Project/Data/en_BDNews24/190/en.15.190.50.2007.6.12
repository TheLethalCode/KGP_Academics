 NEW DELHI, India, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian board named former chief selector Chandu Borde as cricket manager for the tours of Ireland and England on Tuesday. The board's decision-making working committee chose to go in for an interim arrangement as they had done for the recent tour of Bangladesh after Australian Greg Chappell resigned as coach following the World Cup debacle. South African Graham Ford declined the offer to coach the national team on Monday. Borde, 72, played 55 tests and has served as manager in the past. India play a three-match one-day series against South Africa in Ireland later this month before heading to England in July for three tests and seven one-dayers. The board is scheduled to hold a press conference later on Tuesday
