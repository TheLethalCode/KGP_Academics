<TITLE> High-risk behaviours help AIDS spread: health adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Occurrence of the HIV/AIDS virus in high-risk behaviour groups has reached epidemic proportions in parts of Bangladesh, health experts have claimed. They told a workshop Tuesday that several high-risk behaviours, such as unprotected sex, needle sharing among drug users, an increasingly mobile population and bordering countries with high HIV prevalence, were contributing to the crisis. Poor knowledge of reproductive health was also a factor. Experts said that the rate of HIV found among intravenous drug users increased from 1.4 percent in 1999 to 4 percent in 2002. Addressing the workshop, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman said: "Youth groups should be mobilised in order to build awareness on the preventive aspects of HIV/AIDS. The youth are those most at risk, given that 85 percent of HIV transmission in Bangladesh is through unsafe sex." UNAIDS Country representative, Dan Odallo added. "It is time we recognise and empower the youth of Bangladesh. Let them act as peer group educators so they can take leadership in raising awareness." M Ataur Rahman, secretary for Religious Affairs commented, "Community religious leaders are often ignored when they can play a vital role in building awareness on HIV transmission. NGO workers and religious leaders should work in partnership to spread prevention messages in places others cannot reach." The speakers also called for increased involvement with street and hotel based sex workers as well as internal migrant workers. More than 500 officials from various ministries engaged in the HIV/AIDS programmes took part in the workshop held at the Officer's Club, and jointly organised by National AIDS/STD Programme, Padakkhep Manabik Unnayan Kendra and Save the Children, USA. bdnew
