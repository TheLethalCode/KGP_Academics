 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks passed a subdued day Tuesday, influenced by bad weather and speculations on legalising untaxed investment, securities analysts said. An analyst said a move to legalise untaxed investment in the capital market by July 31 has spawned a lot of speculations, contributing to the fall. Imtiyaz Husain, a market analyst, told bdnews24.com: "Bad weather and the announcement of the budget have triggered the downfall." Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh, said: "We were worried a bit to see a continued decline in the stock market." "Speculations created by a government move to legalise untaxed investment in the capital market by July 31 have impacted the market," Sayeed said. In late May, the government allowed people to legalise undisclosed money for the two months to July 31. Transactions on the Dhaka Stock Exchange recorded Tk 106.5 crore, which was Tk 109.6 crore Monday and Tk 116 crore Sunday despite incessant rains much across the country. The DSI or all-share price index ended 29.94 points or 1.84 percent lower at 1596.76 Tuesday. The DGEN or general index dropped 25.15 points or 1.26 percent to 1961.21 at the close of the market. The DSE-20 blue-chip index declined 20.86 points or 1.16 percent at 1765.47 Tuesday. On the DSE, 58 issues advanced, 117 dropped and 18 remained unchanged. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, 24 issues gained, 61 fell and 10 held steady. Imtiyaz Husain said the announcement of the budget that has failed to reflect people's expectations has also influenced the downfall in the market. "Perhaps people are not happy with the budget," he said. bd
