 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Two girls Khukumoni and Mazeda Khatun Wednesday committed suicide in the capital following exam result disappointments. Both sat their SSC exams this year. Khukumoni, 17, of Khilgaon was the daughter of SM Kholilur Rahman. Rahman told bdnews24.com that Khukumoni attended Khaled Haider Memorial High School in Khilgaon. After receiving her SSC results, she retreated to her room Tuesday evening never to be seen alive. The following morning her dead body was found hanging from the ceiling fan. Khukumoni's uncle filed a case of abnormal death with Khilgaon Police Station. In a separate incident in the city, a housemaid named 19-year-old Mazeda Khatun took her own life following exam result frustrations. Mazeda had been working at Ziauddin Ahmed's house in Badda since she was 7. From an early age Mazeda had shown an interest in academic studies and was admitted to Badda High School to encourage her inquisitiveness. Tuesday's SSC results were a severe disappointment to Mazeda. At around 10pm, she withdrew to her room in a sullen mood and locked herself in. Her dead body was discovered later. Marzina's father Osman Ali lives in Harirampur in Mymensingh. An abnormal death incident was filed with the police station. The dead bodies are being kept at Dhaka Medical College Hospital for autopsy. bdnew
