 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Children engaged in agricultural labour must be acknowledged in the mainstream agricultural sector to ensure them a sound economic future, a seminar was told Tuesday. Speakers at a seminar on child labour in agriculture highlighted the need for developing accurate data and information on agricultural child labour in the country. The seminar, marking World Day Against Child Labour (WDACL), was co-organised by the ILO, FAO, Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Ministry of Agriculture. ILO director Gopal Bhattacharya stressed that the absence of hard data, low awareness of the problem in general and virtually non-existent institutional mechanisms to monitor the situation or provide protection against accidents and death impede appropriate action for addressing the issue of child labour. Bhattacharya said the sector has its own peculiarities such as predominantly family-based subsistence work with seasonal variations. The difficulty of distinguishing between working and living spaceand hence elimination of child labour from the sectorrequires a unique approach. According to the National Child Labour Survey 2002-03, the number of economically active children (working children) in Bangladesh aged 5-17 is 7.4 million, with 65 percent of rural working children engaged in agriculture. But the issue of child labour is not addressed adequately in the Labour Law (2006), the speakers said. Labour secretary Ashfaque Hamid, who also spoke at the seminar, said the child labour policy was under consideration by the government and expected to be final soon. He said child labour particularly in agriculture is a dilemma for the nation as the sector is dependent on family-based labour and the growing demands of the sector cannot avoid the necessity of children being engaged in it. "Despite that fact we do need to eliminate child labour from the sector," Hamid pointed out. The WDACL is observed in ILO member countries on June 12 every year, this year's focus being the elimination of child labour in agriculture. Globally, over 132 million children aged 5-14 years work on farms and plantations, sowing and harvesting crops, spraying pesticides, and tending livestock. Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of child labour worldwide, according to the ILO. bdn
