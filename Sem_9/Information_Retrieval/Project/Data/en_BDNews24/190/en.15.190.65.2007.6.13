<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka Stock Exchange Wednesday asked the government to approve investment of untaxed money in the capital market. The DSE sought a waiver of 5 percent penalty charge, which has been imposed on the people who will take the opportunity to legalise their untaxed money by the government deadline of July 31. "We hope the government will consider changes to its income tax law to keep up dynamism in the economy as untaxed money contributes a lot to the economy," DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan told a post-budget press conference. The DSE plea came after the National Board of Revenue, the official tax collector, allowed the legalising of untaxed money for the two months to July 31. The NBR gave the opportunity with a 5 percent penalty on the total amount of untaxed money, plus normal taxes. The bourse however greeted the government for offering a 35 percent corporate tax on mobile phone operators to encourage them to go public. It also welcomed government moves to bring dynamism to the ports and pledges to offload a portion of shares of state-run power, telecommunications and energy sectors. "Offloading the shares of state-run companies and offering of tax incentives to the private cell-phone operators will strengthen the capital market," Khan said. The DSE chief, citing Chittagong and Mongla ports, asked the government to convert the two ports into public limited companies and raise a portion of funds from the market to bring transparency and accountability to the port management. The DSE chief also asked the government to bring Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation to the capital market. "If the BPC raises capital through the stock markets, the base of the company will increase and dependency on the government will be reduced. The government's liability will decline as well," the DSE CEO said. bd
