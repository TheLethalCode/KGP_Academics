 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)The Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms Tuesday filed a case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 12 other directors of Dinkal Publications Limited. The regulatory body's deputy registrar Abdul Mannan filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, accusing them of not submitting the publication's financial statements for 2000-2007 to the registrar's office. According to case details, Dinkal authorities did not submit the returns of allotment and balance sheets to the registrar for the past seven years. A registered company must turn in its returns of allotment and balance sheet to the registrar every year under the Companies Act 1994. The other directors include Khaleda's elder son Tarique Rahman, former speaker Sheikh Razzak Ali, controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun, former communications minister Nazmul Huda, former BNP lawmaker and now LDP secretary general Abdul Mannan, former state minister for energy Mosharraf Hossain and former BNP lawmaker Ali Asghar Loby. bdnews24.co
