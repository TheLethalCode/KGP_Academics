<TITLE> Despite new laws, China still an adoption magnet </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GUANGZHOU, China, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It's the moment some foreign couples have waited years for -- the chance to adopt a Chinese baby. On May 1, Beijing tightened the rules, barring overweight, depressed or unmarried couples. It says it wants to ensure ethnic-Chinese children are raised in the best possible conditions. Yet this has failed to deter the thousands who flock to China every year to adopt. Many come to Guangzhou, the booming southern metropolis not far from Hong Kong, to complete the paperwork. "Perhaps it's a perception," Jeffrey Reed says of the new rules. "Every government wants to give the perception to the rest of the world that they are protecting their children and China is doing that. Reed, who already has three biological children and now wants to adopt in China, went on: "I mean, they are giving their perception but at the same time there are so many orphans in the orphanages that they are going to create a bigger log jam." He said that he was lucky to get in before the new regulations began, as he and his wife only earn a combined annual salary of $56,000, far less than the $80,000 now required. China has been the No 1 choice for US foreign adoptions for the past six years, according to the US State Department. Beijing says four-fifths of foreign adoptions in the past decade involved American families. When it announced its latest tightening in adoption rules in December, the Chinese government said it was an effort to shorten the wait -- now up to 16 months -- for prospective parents as international demand for Chinese babies skyrockets. But the regulations have been criticized in the United States, where the divorce rate is about six times that of China and where thousands of single mothers have already provided homes for Chinese babies. In 2006, Americans adopted 6,493 children from China, the largest number of any country, while in the past 21 years US parents have adopted 55,446 Chinese children. 'CHINA'S CHILDREN' US couple David and Jane Beckus, who had just completed their fourth adoption, said they understood China's policy changes and would not be deterred by the new law as they would have qualified anyway. "They are China's children and China has the right to impose whatever policies they would like to," Jane said. "And I know they need to slow down the flood of people trying to come over here. It doesn't affect us so I don't feel really strongly one way or another." The emotional two-year adoption process, which can cost upwards of $25,000, ends for many at the US consulate in Guangzhou, where couples collect their child's or children's visa pack. A whole industry has grown up around adoption in Guangzhou. Hotels offer special services to help US and European couples, and clinics advertise that they have English-speaking doctors and nurses on hand to do medical checks. Most of the babies offered are girls, abandoned because of China's one-child policy and a traditional preference for boys. Another US couple, Eric and Alice Kilian, adopting twin baby girls, said China remained an ideal place to adopt. "With China, you know you only have to travel one time. It's a lot safer place to go with all the issues in the world, you feel very comfortable and safe walking on the streets at night," Eric sa
