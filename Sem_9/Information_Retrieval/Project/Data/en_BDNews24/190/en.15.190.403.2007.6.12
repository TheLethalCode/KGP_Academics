<TITLE> New Iranian atomic secrecy may prompt more sanctions </TITLE>

 VIENNA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's decision to no longer tell U.N. inspectors about future nuclear plans will be considered in steps to toughen sanctions on Tehran over fears it secretly seeks atom bombs, a senior US official said. The International Atomic Energy Agency's governing body, meeting this week, is scrutinising Iran's simultaneous expansion of uranium enrichment and reduction in cooperation with IAEA monitors in defiance of UN Security Council demands. World powers are concerned the Islamic Republic is trying to develop atomic bombs behind the facade of a civilian nuclear energy programme it says is for generating electricity. The festering standoff has stoked fear of US Iranian conflict. "Iran would seem to be signalling, by refusing to provide early design-verification information, that it is prepared to develop new nuclear facilities in secret," Gregory Schulte, U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. In April, Iran stopped providing advance design information on planned nuclear sites. They include a heavy-water reactor being built that Western officials say could be configured to produce plutonium, the key component in many nuclear explosives. It said the move was retaliation for what it sees as illegal pressure to deny its right to peaceful nuclear energy. Schulte said: "Iran is putting itself in further violation of its international commitments (against nuclear proliferation) and clearly it's something our colleagues in New York will have to consider." Asked if he meant this would influence the tailoring of a third, stiffer sanctions resolution against Iran by world powers at the Security Council after two mild ones, he said: "Yes." IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei, in a report opening the agency's board session on Monday, said Iran had become the No. 1 nuclear proliferation concern in part due to "disconcerting" further restrictions Tehran had imposed on inspector access. Tehran has refused to stop enriching uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for a suspension in UN sanctions and negotiations on trade benefits offered by world powers. The United States, backed to varying degrees by European allies, is pushing for swift action to draft a new resolution after an IAEA report last month that Iran not only ignored a Council deadline for it to stop enrichment but had substantially advanced the programme in its fortified Natanz bunker plant. ElBaradei has sometimes clashed with Washington over its campaign to isolate Iran. He says only a face-saving diplomatic compromise that might allow Iran a limited programme under close monitoring, not sanctions, can resolve the dispute short of war. But he stressed to the board that Iran was undermining its claims to probity by denying an IAEA right to re-verify Arak's design. He also alluded to Iran's 16-month-old ban on IAEA "transparency" checks at sites not declared to be nuclear. "In my statement to the board (due Wednesday), we will raise real concerns about this. I'm sure the Europeans ... and many member states on the board will (do the same)," said Schulte. "This is why ElBaradei has warned us that the agency's knowledge about what's going on in Iran is deteriorating. "Countries are asking, if this is a truly peaceful programme, if Iran says its cooperating and being fully transparent, why are they saying they will keep secret information on new nuclear facilities?" Schulte said. Iran has denied any intention to derive plutonium from reprocessed nuclear fuel at Arak, saying the complex will be used to produce isotopes for medicine and agriculture. Some diplomats monitoring IAEA relations with Iran say Tehran has also been sporadically impeding inspections at Natanz. IAEA officials have denied problems, saying inspectors have enough presence to ensure no covert activity is going on. But a Western diplomat suggested there was room for doubt. "The agency appears to have basic access to the underground facility. But it is important that it has full and unimpeded access there," he sa
