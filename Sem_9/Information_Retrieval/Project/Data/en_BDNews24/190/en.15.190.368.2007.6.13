 NEW DELHI, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's biggest private refiner Reliance Industries Ltd has shut a 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) delayed coker unit at its Jamnagar refinery, industry sources said on Wednesday. A company source confirmed the unit was shut down, while an India-based trade source said the 660,000 bpd refinery's throughput will be reduced by about 20 percent after a shutdown on Tuesday and likely to last another 10 days because of a crack in the coker's drum. The company has stopped production of residue petroleum coke, the trade source said, while a second trade source said there was a problem with the coker and loadings of a residue product had been delayed. "Because of the stoppage of delayed coker, the refinery residue bottom of the VDU (Vacuum distillation unit) has started accumulating and the refinery has no facility to store this. So the company has reduced throughput of the refinery to reduce the residue production," the first trade source told Reuters
