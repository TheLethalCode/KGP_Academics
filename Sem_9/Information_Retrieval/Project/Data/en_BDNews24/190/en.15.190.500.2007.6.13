<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra shelled out close to US$27 million this month for a townhouse in Hong Kong's most prestigious neighbourhood, setting an Asian record, a Hong Kong newspaper said on Wednesday. The exiled politician paid about HK$210 million (US$27 million) -- HK$41,000 per square foot -- for a 5,100 sq ft (474 sq m) house on the Peak, the highest ever unit price in the region's luxury real estate arena, the Standard cited several unidentified sources as saying. "It would require someone who either loves the property very much or who does not care about money at all to make the call of buying it for more than HK$41,000 per square foot," it quoted a source who had been in property for over 30 years as saying. The house is said to be in the "Severn 8" development sold by Sun Hung Kai Properties, a 22-house project on Severn Road. Sun Hung Kai declined to comment, saying it would not talk about individual property transactions. Local newspapers had reported previously that the ultra-luxury house had been sold to a local businessman. Telecoms tycoon Thaksin came to power in 2001 promising to improve the lives of the rural poor, but was then ousted in a September military coup. Thailand's army-backed government has since told the country's banks to freeze bank accounts holding more than $1 billion held by Thaksin and his family. But the tycoon remains keen on buying English Premier League soccer team Manchester City, his lawyer said this month. (US$1=HK$7.8)
