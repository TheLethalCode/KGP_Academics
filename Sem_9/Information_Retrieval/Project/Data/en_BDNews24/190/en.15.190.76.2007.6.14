 KABUL, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A member of Afghanistan's US-led coalition force who has gone missing is a United Arab Emirates national, a coalition official said on Thursday. The official, who declined to be identified, gave no further details about the male soldier who the Taliban say they kidnapped in the southern province of Helmand on Wednesday. A UAE government official said on Wednesday a member of a team providing security for a UAE aid mission had gone missing in Afghanistan. The UAE has been providing aid -- including setting up a field hospital, schools and mosques -- under an agreement with Afghanistan's government since 2003. A Taliban spokesman said on Wednesday the group had kidnapped a foreign soldier in Helmand and it would decide his fate. No members of the Taliban, who are fighting to oust foreign troops and defeat the government of President Hamid Karzai, could be reached for comment on Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the first kidnapping of a coalition soldier by the Taliban, whose hardline Kabul government was overthrown in 2001. Helmand, long a Taliban stronghold, is the main opium poppy-growing region of Afghanistan, the world's biggest heroin producer. The Taliban have kidnapped several Westerners and Afghans in recent months from Helmand and an adjacent province. The group freed an Italian journalist, whom it had kidnapped in March, after the Afghan government released five Taliban members in a widely criticized deal. The Taliban beheaded the journalist's interpreter and his driver. The Taliban later freed two French aid workers, although it was not clear if any ransom had been paid. The UAE was one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban government after they captured Kabul in 1996
