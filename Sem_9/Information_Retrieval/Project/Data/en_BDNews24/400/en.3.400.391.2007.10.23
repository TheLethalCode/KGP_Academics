 ATLANTA, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp , the world's largest appliance maker, reported higher third-quarter profit on Tuesday on rising international demand and lower taxes, but sales missed estimates on weaker US results and its shares dropped more than 5 percent. The maker of Maytag, Amana and KitchenAid appliances backed its prior full-year profit outlook but cut its forecast for industry shipments in North America, its biggest market.

Operating profit in North America fell 24 percent, pressured by higher oil and metals costs and the lower sales. Revenue rose 12 percent in Europe, 23 percent in Latin America and 18 percent in Asia. Whirlpool, which acquired smaller rival Maytag in 2006, said it still expects full-year earnings of $8 to $8.50 a share. Analysts expect $8.28, according to Reuters Estimates. Whirlpool's stock was off $5.04, or 5.7 percent, at $82.95 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. With that drop, Whirlpool's stock is now about flat for the ye
