<TITLE> Sarkozy says won't be blackmailed by strikers </TITLE>

 SAINT-DENIS, France, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy told railway workers on Friday he would not be blackmailed into withdrawing a reform of their pensions privileges by strikes and street protests. Sarkozy made his comments during an unscheduled visit to a depot of state train operator SNCF, just over a week after transport strikes caused widespread disruption in France. The unions have threatened further strikes unless the government backs down over the reform and will meet again on Wednesday to decide what to do. If they do decide on further action it may coincide with a nationwide strike by civil servants on Nov. 20, compounding the disruption. "The street will not make us give in because we're in a democracy. Street blackmail will not work," Sarkozy told a group of workers, who warned him of new stoppages in the weeks ahead. "I don't agree with you," said Fabien Monteil, of the Sud-Rail union, one of the most militant railway unions. "I think the street will speak. We will be in the streets soon. It has always worked like that and each time we have made the prime ministers give in," he told Sarkozy. There are 1,000 workers at the site and the strike rate was 73 percent on Oct. 18. One member of the CGT union, wearing red overalls, refused to shake his hand. "You are in your role, defending your social benefits. I'm in my role by saying ... you cannot go on like that. And deep down you know that perfectly well," Sarkozy said. The special pension regimes were set up last century for those with arduous jobs and allows some workers to retire as early as 50 compared to 60 years for most other French workers. Previous attempts to reform them have all failed in the face of street protests. But Sarkozy has refused to countenance any compromise this time over his key demand -- to raise the contribution period needed for a full pension to 40 years from 37.5 years, bringing the scheme into line with other pensions. ROOM FOR MANOEVRE Sarkozy's visit, the first by a president to the rail company in 24 years, signals a different approach from previous presidents who often stayed in their palaces, leaving their prime ministers to talk to the troublesome unions. Looking to break the deadlock, Sarkozy has tried to show he is open to negotiation. He said there was room for discussion on peripheral issues such as salaries and the grading system which reduces pension payouts if someone seeks early retirement. That is likely to annoy the influential CGT union, which has said it will not take part in internal discussions with SNCF and wants to negotiate directly with the government. The reform has wide public support but Sarkozy's success in dealing with the unions is seen as a key test of his ability to push through promised reforms that economists say are needed to boost growth and reduce the deficit and the debt. Only 8 percent of French workers are union members but they have a powerful grip on public services and Sarkozy will want to avoid any prolonged shutdown of the transport system. Last week's strike cost businesses and workers in the Paris region 150 million euros, according to an internal report by the French economy ministry quoted in Le Figaro newspaper on Friday. The report estimated total losses equivalent to 0.03 percent of the region's gross domestic product, which makes up a third of national G
