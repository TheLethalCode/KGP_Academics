 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The government has moved to bring back to the country the remains of independence war martyr Bir Shrestha Hamidur Rahman from the Indian state of Tripura. Liberation War Affairs adviser MA Matin told reporters after a meeting in the ministry Thursday that talks with the Indian central government and Tripura state authorities were on. The adviser said chances were that the remains would be brought back in the first week of December, the month in which the country was liberated. He also said a five-member committee to get back the remains had been formed. The initiative to bring back the remains of the martyr has been taken in a show of respect to him. The adviser said Hamidur Rahman was buried in Ambasa village under Tripura state. "The Tripura state authorities have expressed interest to hand over the remains of Hamidur on Nov 6. However, we want to bring the remains in the Month of Victory to show respect to Hamidur." Asked where the remains of Hamidur would be buried again, Matin said the remains would be buried either at his village home in Noakhali or at the Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard in Dhaka. Matin said a final decision would be taken at the meeting of interim cabinet. bdnews2
