 LONDON, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders AC Milan will play their 200th match in Europe's top club competition on Wednesday without goalkeeper Dida. The Brazilian had his two-match ban for feigning injury against Celtic reduced to one game by UEFA on Monday and misses Wednesday's Champions League Group D home match against Shakhtar Donetsk. Milan beat the Ukrainian team 4-0 at the San Siro nearly three years ago and are looking for a victory that would end Shakhtar's excellent start to the campaign. The visitors are top of the table after winning their first two matches without conceding a goal. In the other game in the group Celtic return to Lisbon, where they won the 1967 European Cup, to face bottom team Benfica. Liverpool are another club returning to a city with great memories. The Merseysiders play Group A rivals Besiktas in Istanbul, where they won the 2005 Champions League final against Milan on penalties. The other Group A fixture features leaders Olympique Marseille, who have won their opening two matches, at home to second-placed Porto. Chelsea aim to consolidate their lead in Group B when they host Schalke 04 while Rosenborg Trondheim face Valencia in the other match. Real Madrid attempt to go clear on top of Group C as they entertain Olympiakos Piraeus while Werder Bremen search for their first win of the campaign against Lazio
