<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government Wednesday approved import of 1.38 lakh tons of urea fertiliser and 37 tons of phosphoric acid at a cost of Tk 504 crore. The advisory committee on government purchase approved the import at a meeting held at the conference room of the Cabinet Division with member of the committee and information adviser Mainul Hosein in the chair. "The country now has a stock of 4.60 lakh metric tons of urea fertiliser. Approval for import of fertiliser has been given to increase the stock," Mainul said. He claimed there was no dearth of fertiliser stock in the country. "The problem is with distribution. Though the fertiliser price has gone up and there has been a crisis in the international market there was no fertiliser crunch in the country." He said 37 tons phosphoric acid would be imported as a raw material for the DOP plant that went into operation in Chittagong last year. An official of the agriculture ministry preferring to remain unnamed said this year the total demand of fertiliser was about 28 lakh tons. Six fertiliser factories in the country would produce 17 lakh tons fertiliser and the remaining 11 lakh tons would be imported. Communications adviser MA Matin, industries adviser Geeteara Shafiya Chowdhury, cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder and officials of the relevant ministries were present. bdne
