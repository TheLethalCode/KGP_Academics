 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong opener Tamim Iqbal and Barisal pacer Talha Jubair will have to forego playing two four-dayers or four one-dayers in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea 9th National Cricket League. Tamim and Talha were given the suspensions by match referee Akhtar Ahmed following following a breach of conduct. Tamim and Talha were involved in a scuffle during the Chittagong-Barisal match at Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra Tuesday. Sources said that Talha glared angrily at Tamim after being beaten for a boundary. In response Tamim pushed Talha with his helmet before the umpires and players calmed the two. A Bangladesh Cricket Board press release Tuesday said both cricketers confessed to their offenses at the post-match hearing. Chittagong beat Barisal by eight wickets in the first-round one-dayer as Tamim blazed a 92-ball 133. Meanwhile, the Khulna divisional team were fined for a slow over rate during their four-dayer opener against the Dhaka divisional team in the National Cricket League at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Khulna skipper Habibul Bashar was fined ten percent of his match fee, while the rest of the players in the first eleven were fined five percent of their match fees, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release Tuesday. The match between Khulna and Dhaka ended in a draw Monday.
