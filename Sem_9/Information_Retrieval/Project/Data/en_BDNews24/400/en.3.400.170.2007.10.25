 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The first round of the national polio vaccination drive will begin on Saturday, October 27, officials said Thursday. This will be the 16th year of the National Immunisation Day (NID) programme. Health Adviser ASM Matiur Rahman inaugurated the vaccination drive Thursday afternoon at the Extended Programme of Immunisation (EPI) building in Mahakhali by orally administering two drops of polio vaccine to a child. "Some two and a half crore (25 million) children aged up to five years will be covered by this year's national polio vaccination drive," Rahman said. In the second round, the same children will receive the second dose of the vaccine. The second round has been scheduled for December 8, 2007. Poliovirus causes permanent paralysis in the lower limbs and abdomen of the host one in a million cases. Rahman, addressing a large audience, said "We must continue polio vaccination drive until we are free from the viral attack in the region." About 140,000 vaccination centres have already been set up. Vaccination centres will also be placed at transportation hubs across the country in order to reach as many children as possible, including those without fixed addresses. "The government and donor agencies will spend approximately Tk 80 - 90 crore on the two rounds of vaccinations," Health Secretary AKM Zafar Ullah Khan said. In the first round, children aged between one and five years will also be given Vitamin A capsules to combat night blindness in addition to their oral polio drops. In the second round on December 8, children will be given their second dose of polio drops as well as Albendazol, a medication in single tablet form to fight intestinal tapeworm. The adviser said Bangladesh has been polio-free for the past ten months with the last case reported in November 2006 in Chandpur. About 700,000 volunteers plus another 100,000 health providers will take part in the nationwide polio drive. Bangladesh's polio coverage is appreciated worldwide. The World Health Organisation's Representative in Bangladesh said, "Bangladesh is a model for timely response and maximum coverage of polio vaccine." NID in Bangladesh started in 1995. The highest polio coverage rate was recorded in 2005 with 98.2 per cent. The highest number of polio-positive cases was recorded in 1999 with 29 cases.
