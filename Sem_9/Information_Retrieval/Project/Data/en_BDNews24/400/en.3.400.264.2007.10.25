 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Communications adviser MA Matin Thursday said the interim cabinet would soon discuss formation of a national security council (NSC). "The issue of the formation of a national security council will soon be presented in the meeting of the advisory council for discussion," he said to journalists at the communications ministry. Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed in a function on New York recently stressed a national security council. "If there was such a council it would have been possible to maintain a balance in the administration in tackling the pre-January 11 situation," he told expatriate Bangladeshis. Law adviser Mainul Hosein on March 8 told journalists there was no need to amend the law or frame a new one for instituting a national security council. The government can form such council under the law already in force. Government sources said expert opinions were being taken to form the council with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed head it. The council would include the chiefs of the three forces, chiefs of law-enforcing agencies, representatives of the intelligence agencies and noted personalities. The council would work to ensure national security, and check corruption and other crimes. bdne
