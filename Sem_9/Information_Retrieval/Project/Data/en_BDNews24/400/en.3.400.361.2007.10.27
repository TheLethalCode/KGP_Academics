 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Jatiya Party led by HM Ershad Saturday asked for banning those who had opposed the liberation war from running elections while criticising Jamaat-e-Islami's recent statement. "It is possible to try those who were involved in different activities against humanity including murder, rape, plundering and arson under existing laws. They must not be allowed to contest the elections if they are found guilty in trial," the party said in a press statement. The statement was released after a meeting of the party's policymaking presidium at its Banani office. Jamaat did not offer public apology for opposing the independence war, rather it give a provocative statement recently, the meeting observed. The meeting thanked the caretaker government for starting the process of separating the judiciary from the executive from Nov 1. It decided to prepare a proposal for discussion with the Election Commission on Nov 1. The proposal would be presented in the next presidium meeting slated for Oct 31. A five-member committee led by party acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud as its head was formed to draft the proposal. Anisul Islam Mahmud presided over the meeting. Kazi Zafar Ahmed, secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader, MA Sattar, TIM Fazle Rabbi, GM Quader, Nasim Osman, Abul Kashem, MA Hannan and Syed Abu Hossain Babla, among others, were present. After presidium meeting, the leaders exchanged Eid greetings with Ershad. bdne
