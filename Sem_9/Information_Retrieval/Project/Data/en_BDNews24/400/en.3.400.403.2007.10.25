 SYDNEY, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world's biggest jumbo jet landed safely in Sydney on Thursday, ending its first commercial flight from Singapore. The Singapore Airlines' Airbus A380 superjumbo emerged from low-lying cloud to touch down on time on a damp Sydney afternoon, completing its flight from Singapore's Changi Airport. The aircraft will return to Singapore on Friday. Passengers paid between $560 and $100,380 to be on the inaugural flight, after bidding for the tickets as part of a charity auction to drum up publicity. The new aircraft -- which boasts two passenger decks and, in Singapore Airlines' version, first-class suites with proper beds -- suffered two years of delays caused by wiring glitches, which pushed the planemaker into a loss and led to 10,000 lost jobs. Singapore Airlines is to take delivery of another five A380s in 2008.
