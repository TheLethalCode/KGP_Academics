 MOSCOW, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian supermarket worker branded `the chessboard murderer' was found guilty on Wednesday of killing 48 people after he confessed in court that the first time he took a life was like falling in love.

According to the prosecution case, Pichushkin lured some of his intended victims by saying he wanted company as he drank to the memory of a dead dog. "He threw some of his victims down a drain when they were still alive and in some cases still conscious, even though some of them begged him to spare them," Syomin said.
