 MILAN, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan's Patrick Vieira could be out until next year after suffering a calf strain in midweek, Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Friday. Vieira had been diagnosed with a second degree strain of his right medial calf, according to Inter's Web site (www.inter.it), bit it gave no indication of when he might return. The 31-year-old missed Inter's early league games with a hamstring strain but managed to play in France's Euro 2008 qualifiers against Italy and Scotland in early September. However, he aggravated his hamstring in those matches and had only just returned to action for Inter when he suffered the calf strain. He left the field after 17 minutes of Tuesday's 2-1 Champions League win at CSKA Moscow. Gazzetta said he would not be able to return until Jan. 13 at the earliest. This would mean he would miss France's crunch Euro 2008 qualifier in Ukraine on Nov. 21, Inter's remaining Champions League group games and the league derby with AC Milan on Dec. 23
