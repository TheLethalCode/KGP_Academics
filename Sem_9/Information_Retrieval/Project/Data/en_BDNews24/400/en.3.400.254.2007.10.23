 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Rokanuddowla, who Sunday demanded a halt to the separation of the judiciary from the executive until 2021, has been removed from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Rokanuddowla has been made officer on special duty (OSD) at the establishment ministry. Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Tuesday approved the removal of the controversial magistrate after the establishment ministry Monday sent a letter to the Supreme Court seeking approval to remove him from the magistracy. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed acknowledged the approval by the chief justice. But there was no formal announcement from the government. A circular is expected to come after presidential approval. Law adviser Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com: "He (Rokanuddowla) has been made an OSD." An official at the ministry preferring to remain unnamed said Rokanuddowla would be charged with treason. At a seminar on "Independence of the judiciary for good governance", Rokanuddowla urged executive officials to stop work from Nov 1 if the government did not clearly state that it would halt the separation process by that date. Rokanuddowla at the seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Administration Management. said the postponement was necessary to remove the inequality created between executive magistrates and judicial magistrates. But Abu Md Moniruzzaman, president of Bangladesh Administrative Service Association, Monday said Rokanuddowla had violated the code of conduct for administrative officials by making remarks against the separation of the judiciary. "The statement by Rokanuddowla is solely of his own," Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com by phone. "The association has no links with it," he said. Moniruzzaman said Sunday's seminar was organised to find ways to cooperate with the government about implementing the separation. "His (Rokanuddowla) speech created chaos at the seminar. I tried to stop him but he did not listen to me," he said. "It seems to me that he was not mentally sound then," Moniruzzaman said. bdnews
