 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  As stocks soar, everybody wants in. Bourses are on a roll, indices have hit new highs drawing in new investors. But the price of many issues rising far beyond their fundamentals has led the Securities and Exchange Commission to voice concern recently on the "abnormal" state of the stock market. As economic indicators show signs of sluggishness in countrywide business and investment, the stock market's remarkable buoyancy would appear to oppose rational behaviour. Analysts say the market is behaving in apparent opposition, however, precisely because excess liquidity is being diverted to the stock market. A lack of business and investment opportunities has resulted in idle funds, which have been pouring into stocks. "The share market usually rises if there are signs of hopes in the economy. [At present] pessimism prevails in the economy while optimism prevails in the stock market. It is contradictory," said Abu Ahmed, who teaches economics at Dhaka University. "Bangladesh's share market is proving the existing economic theories wrong simply because the economy is slowing down while the market is getting overheated," he said. Official statistics shows that business and industry performances, as evidenced by exports and investments, are not healthy. Overall earnings from exports declined 21.08 percent to $902.33 million in July, from the same month a year ago, depressed by a 24 percent fall in export earnings from garment, the main foreign exchange earner. Local and foreign investment proposals with the Board of Investment also dropped substantially, although banks are sitting with over Tk 142 billion in excess liquidity. By contrast, the stock market except for price correctionsand occasional shocks on fears of anticorruption and anti-tax evasion driveshas been heating up since January as investors regained confidence after fears of a political fallout. The market's buoyancy may not bring any positive impact on economic growth in the short-run, say analysts, but could be a future avenue for raising capital for industrialisation after the economy passes a correction phase. "Theoretically, economic indicators are not attractive for good returns against investment. Given this, it appears that general investors are considering the current stage as a short-term phenomenon," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. "It may be an indicator of future prospects after the economy passes the correction phase," he said. The recent surge in fund inflows has come from the entry of banks and financial institutions, real estate investors, savings certificate investors and the bulk of small and large retail investors from other sectors. This influx of new investors, according to market players, has been driving stocks higher amid limited supply of good issues Citing one of his studies, Dr Mahmood Osman Imam, who teaches finance at Dhaka University, observed that the market had yet to become the barometer of the economy. "The market is rising because too much money is chasing too few shares. The money is coming from various other sectors because of the stagnant state of business and industry." "It is unhealthy. Prices are going up beyond company fundamentals," he said. The main DGEN or general index on the DSE added 1292 points or 80.30 percent to 2901.99 on Oct 25, in just 10 months, from 1609.51 at the end of Dec 2006. Issue of rights or bonus shares, the listing of some new issuesincluding banksand above all, the steady rise in prices have also driven market capitalisation to Tk 707.94 billion on Oct 25, from Tk 315.45 billion at the end of December. Mamun Rashid, a banker, said: "Money is flowing into the market because of a lack of alternative investment avenues." "It [the rally] is good for the growth of the stock market. But it will not bring about better results unless domestic and foreign investment increased." Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion funds at AIMS of Bangladesh, also said: "It [the rally] has nothing to do with the economy. It rather indicates the slump in other sectors such as the real estate and fixed income securities markets." "But its trickle down effect may extend some benefit to the economy," he said. bdnew
