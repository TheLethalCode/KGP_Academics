<TITLE> Myanmar junta names new senior official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's ruling junta has named a new first secretary of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to replace Lieutenant-General Thein Sein who has taken over as prime minister, China's Xinhua news agency reported. Xinhua quoted an SPDC announcement on Wednesday carried by state-run Radio Myanmar as saying the new first secretary was to be Lieutenant-General Thiha Thura Tin Aung Myint Oo, current SPDC member and Quartermaster-General. The news comes in the aftermath of a turbulent few weeks in which the junta crushed monk-led mass street protests against military rule, to a chorus of angry denunciation from the international community. Thein Sein, as acting premier, met U.N. special envoy Ibrahim Gambari in early October on his mission to end the military crackdown. China, the closest the generals have to an ally, has resisted imposition of United Nations sanctions on its impoverished southern neighbour. Thein Sein took over the premiership after the long-ailing Soe Win died on Oct.
