<TITLE> Polio vaccination of 2.5 crore children kicks off </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Some 800,000 health workers and volunteers Saturday fanned out across the country to vaccinate about 25 million children aged 5 and under in a relentless effort to eliminate polio, according to a health ministry statement. In the first round, children will also be given vitamin A capsules to combat night blindness in addition to their oral polio drops. Health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman inaugurated the vaccination drive earlier on Thursday at the Extended Programme of Immunisation (EPI) building in Mohakhali through administering two drops of polio vaccine to a child. Polio clawed its way back last year after a nearly six-year pause, prompting the government to launch a new series of campaigns in April 2006 with the help of the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization. The government earlier vowed to continue its fight to check spread of polio. Health authorities in Cox's Bazar recently vaccinated thousands of children against polio in the wake of reports of a new case in Myanmar. The special drive in Cox's Bazar was part of a campaign to reinforce efforts to prevent cross-border infections after the WHO recently warned Bangladesh about a 3-year-old boy who was diagnosed with polio in Myanmar's Rakhine or Arakan state, just 10 kilometres across the border. Fresh cases have been reported in some Indian states last year, according to WHO. Saturday's anti-polio drive is being carried out with the help of the Global Polio Eradication Initiativea partnership among UNICEF, Rotary International, WHO and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. UNICEF and WHO helped the government conduct extensive polio vaccination programmes in 1995-2004. In August 2000, the country believed it had seen the last case of polio. But the country's efforts to be declared polio-free were dented last year when the virus left a 9-year-old girl paralysed in Chandpur. It was not clear how she became infected, but the virus has also been found in parts of neighbouring India. Since then, the health ministry said, at least 16 other new cases have been found. On Saturday, the officials are also camping at bus and train stations in the capital and elsewhere to make sure children who have no permanent address or are travelling are not left out. In the second round of vaccination scheduled to start Dec 8, children will be given their second dose of polio drops as well as Albendazol, a medication in single tablet form to fight intestinal tapeworms. The polio virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. It invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis within hours. It can be fatal in some cases. The virus can cause permanent paralysis in the lower limbs and abdomen of the sufferer. About 1,880 people were sickened by polio worldwide in 2005, down from more than 350,000 before 1988, when WHO launched a global anti-polio campaign, WHO said. In 2006, the worldwide cases reduced to 1,526, the statement said. bdnews24.c
