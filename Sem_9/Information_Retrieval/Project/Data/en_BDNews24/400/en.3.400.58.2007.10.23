<TEXT>
 FAISALABAD, Pakistan, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Another splendid innings from Mohammad Yousuf led Pakistan to a six-wicket win over South Africa in the third one-dayer at the Iqbal stadium on Tuesday. Yousuf followed up scores of 53 and 117 with an unbeaten 58 as Pakistan reached their target of 198 with 11 balls to spare to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. The experienced Yousuf shared a stand of 79 with captain Shoaib Malik (42) and an unbroken partnership of 55 with Misbah-ul-Haq (29 not out). Earlier, South Africa were bowled out for 197 in 49.2 overs. Skipper Graeme Smith top-scored with 48 while Justin Kemp contributed 42. Shahid Afridi (three for 37) and Rao Iftikhar (three for 33) made the visitors rue their decision to bat first as they lost their last six wickets for 35 runs. Afridi, promoted to opener, then gave the Pakistan reply a rousing start by smashing 32 from 18 balls with two sixes and four fours on a pitch that was slow and sluggish. When Afridi was caught by Smith at mid-off from Shaun Pollock's bowling, the hosts struggled to maintain the same scoring rate. Yasir Hameed (18) fell driving at a wide ball from Makhaya Ntini and Younis Khan went for 10 when he flicked Albie Morkel to Johan Botha at short mid-wicket. Yousuf and Malik steadied the innings before the skipper was caught behind trying to cut Morkel in the 39th over. Misbah then joined forces with Yousuf to clinch victory
