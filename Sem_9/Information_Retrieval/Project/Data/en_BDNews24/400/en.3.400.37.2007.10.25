 LOS ANGELES, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Here's some advice for guys looking to be a real 'man's man' -- get a life. More than 1 million readers of men's lifestyle Web site AskMen.com were asked to name the Top 49 Men who exemplified 'a true man's man' with British soccer star David Beckham scoring top place in the wide-ranging list. Beckham was followed in the No 2 position by actor Matt Damon, star of the hit movie 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' and just behind him was record music producer Timbaland. The list featured a broad group in both occupation and age, and AskMen.com editor-in-chief James Bassil said the key factor uniting them seemed to be a willingness to engage in life beyond simply accomplishing career goals. "These are not the guys you always see on magazine covers or who get the most media play, and they all have secondary pursuits that become expressions of their values," Bassil said. "When our readers can see the guy behind the guy, they appreciate that." Beckham, whose wife Victoria is a member of the Spice Girls pop group, does see his name in tabloid headlines but amid the media frenzy surrounding him, the sports star seems to stay levelheaded with a good sense of humor, Bassil said. Likewise, Damon scored a smash box office hit with the recent 'Bourne Ultimatum' action flick ($410 million worldwide ticket sales to date), yet he is active in charities such as raising money for victims of the genocide in Darfur. Others on the list included Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs, 53, at No. 7, and Richard Branson, 57, who is an adventurer outside running his Virgin companies in airlines, music and numerous other businesses. He was No. 20. Britain's Prince Harry made the list at No 23, but Prince William was no where in sight. Bassil said the younger prince was appreciated by readers for his willingness earlier this year to serve with the British Army in southern Iraq. Rounding out the top five were tennis star Roger Federer at No 4, followed by singer/actor/clothes designer Justin Timberlake. Among the top 10 were actors Daniel Craig, George Clooney and Christian Bale and race car driver Lewis Hamilton. A complete list is posted at AskMen.com (www.askmen.com), which boasts more than 8 million monthly reade
