 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  A rights group in Dhaka Wednesday accused Indian border guards of killing at least 94 Bangladeshis on the porous frontier this year. Odhikar, a leading human-rights organisation, also said in a media statement that the Indian Border Security Force kidnapped 89 people between Jan and Oct 23. The report was released a day before the director generals of the BSF and the Bangladesh Rifles were set to meet in Dhaka. The group regularly publishes such report based on media reports and often conducts its own investigation. An 18-strong team led by BSF DG Ashish Kumar Mitra arrived in the capital Wednesday to meet their counterparts. Odhikar said some 701 Bangladeshis were killed by the BSF between 2000 and Oct 23, 2007 and asked the Indian government to stop such "border terrorism". SM Nasiruddin Elan, acting director of Odhikar, said such incidents were increasing along the border in what he said was part of a process to create pressure on small nations. "Farmers and other low-income people are being made victim. Farmers are being killed when they work in their fields. It (such incident) is on the rise," Elan told bdnews24.com by phone. Border skirmishes are common along the porous 4,000-kilometre (2,500-mile) India-Bangladesh border. India is building a barbed-wire fence for what it says is to check unbridled smuggling by Bangladeshis and illegal migration. Bangladesh trashes the charges. bdnew
