<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak gave the green light on Thursday to reduce Israel's supply of electricity to the Gaza Strip as a response to Palestinian rocket attacks from the territory, political sources said. It was not immediately clear when power cuts would begin in Hamas-controlled Gaza, where 1.5 million Palestinians live, the Israeli sources said. Barak's approval was the final step needed before any reduction of electrical supplies could be implemented following an Israeli security cabinet decision last month to declare the Gaza Strip an "enemy entity" and impose sanctions.
