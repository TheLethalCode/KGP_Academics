<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga is scheduled for a one-week visit next April to provide batting tips for the future stars of Bangladesh. Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Romes Kaluwitharana, Pakistani pacer Aaqib Javed and his compatriot spinner Iqbal Sikandar are also scheduled to provide tips in their respective fields to the Bangladesh youngsters. "All four were scheduled to come here in November under the development programme," said Istiaq Ahmed, vice chairman of the Game Development Committee of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "But we have revised the schedules to next April following the ongoing National Cricket League so that the league faces no interruption," he added. Ranatunga captained Sri Lanka to win the 1996 World Cup and wicketkeeper-cum-opener Kaluwitharana was a key member of the squad. Aaqib and Iqbal were both members of the Pakistan 1992 World Cup team. "Our national team can also take tips from them if they feel they need to, as we would provide places for the national cricketers on the cricket camp," said Ahmed. "Ranatunga is currently busy, but he has assured us he will come here according to our revised scheduled," said Ahmed.
