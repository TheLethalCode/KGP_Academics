 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin and ace spinner Mohammad Rafique shared seven wickets as holders Dhaka forced Sylhet to follow on in the second four-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League Saturday. Trailing by 254 runs in the first innings, Sylhet with unbeaten openers Golam Rahman (1) and Imtiaz Hossain (0) begin their second innings on the third day Sunday at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Barisal were also on the verge of a follow-on against runners-up Rajshahi after being reduced to 77 for nine in the first innings at the close of Day 2 at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. The visitors still need 124 runs to avoid a follow-on in reply to Rajshahi's 301 all out. Chittagong, however, were comparatively in a better position against Khulna with 231 for seven at stumps, but they still need another 29 runs to send Khulna to bat again. Chittagong were trailing by 179 runs after Khulna raked up a massive 410 all out in the first innings. Dhaka vs Sylhet The Dhaka bowlers were too good for Sylhet, whose nine batsmen failed to cross double digits as pacer Robin grabbed four wickets for just 14 runs while left-arm spinner Rafique took three for 36. Only their national wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim crossed the double- digit hurdle with 36 runs. Earlier, Dhaka, having resumed the day on 227 for four, added another 124 runs to declare at 351 for nine in 128.2 overs. Mehrab Hossain Junior converted his overnight 49 to 60 and Rafique and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel made 39 and an unbeaten 35 to take Dhaka beyond the 350-mark. Pacer Nazmul Hossain took three wickets for 51 while Imtiaz Hossain and Alok Kapali chipped in with two wickets each for 26 and 47. Rajshahi vs Barisal Like those of Sylhet, Barisal batsmen also returned to the dressing room at regular intervals as spinner Nayeem Islam and medium pacer Farhad Reza were too good for the Barisal batsmen taking three wickets each for seven and 12 runs. Opener Shahriar Nafees topscored with 19 followed by Iftekhar's 13. Earlier, hosts Rajshahi resumed the second day on 187 for five and finished their first innings at 301 all out as Farhad Reza and Anisur Rahman contributed 52 and 32 runs. Rajshahi skipper Khaled Mashud, resuming on an overnight 86, fell at 89. Talha Jubaer captured three wickets for 70 while Arafat Salahuddin and Sajedul Islam each took two wickets for 52 and 64. Khulna vs Chittagong Chittagong try to avoid a follow- on against Khulna when overnight batsmen Ashiqur Rahman (0) and Tarek Aziz (2) open the third day after their top order failed to lay a solid foundation. However, a fine 85 runs from middle order Faysal Hossain and a timely 46 runs from wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh salvaged Chittagong from trouble. Left-arm spinner Murad Khan wrecked the Chittaong innings with four for 67 after pacers Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel each came out with a wicket apiece early. Earlier, Khulna resumed the first innings at 361 for seven and finished at 410 all out in 103.2 overs. Ashiqur, Suja Datta and Tareq Aziz each grabbed three wickets for 71, 79 and 82 respectively.
