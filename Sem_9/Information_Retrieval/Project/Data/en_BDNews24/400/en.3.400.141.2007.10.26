 London, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com) The fourth International British Fusion Food Festival begins at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel on Nov 4 and runs through to Nov 7. British High Commissioner in Dhaka Anwar Choudhury will formally inaugurate the four-day festival, disclosed Curry Life, a premier trade magazine for Indian restaurants in the UK and the festival organiser, at a UK launch event Thursday at Red Fort Restaurant. A team of five British chefs is jetting out to Bangladesh to put their curry-cooking skills on display. They will design dishes that combine the traditional with contemporary and will create the ultimate fusion of East and West, the organiser says. A fusion recipe book, a collection of recipes by the participating chefs, will be launched at the event, they added. A delegation of journalists, restaurateurs, community leaders and festival leaders will also take part in the festival as observers. Robert Evans, member of European Parliament, will lead the special delegation. British MP Frank Dobson, Bangladesh High Commissioner in the UK Shafi U Ahmed and community leaders attended the UK launch Thursday. bd
