<TITLE> Bhuiyan says his reforms plan did not exclude Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Expelled pro-reform BNP stalwart Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday said his reform proposal did not mean to exclude party chief Khaleda Zia. "Our reform proposal does not contain anything about excluding [Khaleda]. We did not present the reform proposals to remove any individual," he said to reporters at his Gulshan home. "We have said earlier and are saying now that our reform proposals are not the final proposal. More proposals are in the offing." "The party councillors will take a decision after the proposals are presented in the party council. We will hold council with Khaleda Zia present." "In my reform proposal there is nothing about excluding the two leaders. I have suggested a change in the system," he said. He believed the party could be united and strengthened through reform dialogues. "I put forward the reform proposal to save the party from disaster and make it stronger and acceptable to the people after January 11. "There is no alternative to reform to overcome the party's crisis. I want both reform and unity." "Whatever is done will be done keeping Khaleda Zia. There is no alternative to unity for the party's victory in the next elections," said Bhuiyan, who party chief Khaleda expelled as secretary general just before her arrest on Sep 3. Pro-reform BNP lawmakers were present during Bhuiyan's media briefing. The gathering of the pro-reformists at his home is believed to have been arranged as a counterweight to a meeting of 25 former MPs with BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Thursday. Bhuiyan said he expected more than 100 pro-reformists to attend a function next week that he would chair. "Most of the party's former lawmakers and present central leaders are with me on the question of reform," claimed Bhuiyan. In an apparent broadside against the anti-reform faction, Bhuiyan said: "Those who are speaking against reform and unity will soon understand that they are mistaken." He asked the party followers not to submit to any confusion about unity. Asked whether he accepts Delwar as the secretary general, he said: "I think the decision of [my] expulsion is unconstitutional. I do not accept the decision." On a question on whether there was any possibility of unity with Delwar, he said senior party leaders were discussing the matter without elaborating further. He hoped the party central office at Naya Paltan would be re-opened once unity in the party was achieved. "We don't want confrontation. There may be a clash between the two groups if the party office is opened. So we do not want any division in the party over this issue." "BNP is an election-oriented party. If it does not participate in the election it will be isolated from the people." He urged party leaders and workers to prepare for the local government elections and enlist as voters. On Jamaat-e-Islami's claims Thursday that there was no anti-liberation force or war criminal in the country, Bhuiyan said: "During the independence war there were Razakars, Al Badrs and Al Shams (collaborators of Pakistan army), but after the war the party that came to power did not try them, Instead they granted them amnesty." Asked if there would be any alliance with Jamaat in the next election, he said there would be unity with any political party on the basis of ideals and goals when the election neared. bdnews24
