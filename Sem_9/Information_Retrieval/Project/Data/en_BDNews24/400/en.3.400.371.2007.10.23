 PRISTINA, Serbia, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations administration in Kosovo urged Serb leaders on Tuesday to stop intimidating their ethnic kin who want to vote in the Albanian-dominated province's polls in November.

The envoys are due to report on the progress to the UN Security Council on Dec. 10 and the EU's man in the troika, Wolfgang Ischinger, said the talks now had to intensify. Russia wants talks to continue until a solution is agreed, irrespective of the Dec. 10 deadline, while Kosovo Albanians say they are ready to declare independence with or without a deal. "A certain amount of time pressure, really, is not so bad ....It would be dangerous to negotiate endlessly," Ischinger said in an interview to Austrian daily Die Presse on Tuesday.
