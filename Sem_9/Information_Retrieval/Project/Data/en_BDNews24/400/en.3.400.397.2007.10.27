<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday said his expelled predecessor Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and his pro-reform followers had proposed to return to the party. "If they want to return to the party they will have to do so following the party constitution. In the past, many like them were brought back to the party. "If Khaleda Zia wishes she can bring back all to the party. As far as I'm concerned it is positive," he told journalists at his NAM flat at the Sangsad Bhaban. The secretary general however did not elaborate on the proposal or when and how it had been made. Khaleda expelled secretary general Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain on Sept 3 before her arrest. Delwar expressed outrage at his being stopped by police from entering Sylhet city Friday to offer prayers at the shrines of Shah Jalal and Shah Poran. "It was entirely a personal visit. I went there to offer fateha at the mazaars of Hajrat Shah Jalal and Shah Poran. Such kind of obstruction amounts to infringement on my normal movements." He said: "BNP is united. Those who are now speaking of unity are actually searching a way to return to the party. "Bhuiyan was the party secretary general for 11 years. He was also a minister. He knows how those that had been expelled in the past returned to the party. He can follow the process. There is nothing to show off." "Those who are [in the pro-reform camp] have been held there under duress and intimidation. The crowd is gradually thinning there. In future none will remain with them," Delwar said. Asked to comment on the Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid's statement that the country had no war criminals and anti-liberation forces, he said, "The people of the country know the names of those who opposed the independence war. Who does not know the names of Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams? "However, it needs to be seen on what context he (Mujahid) said this. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman granted amnesty to the war criminals since there were war criminals." Asked if they would forge alliance with Jamaat in the next election, he said, "We will make a decision when the election approaches." Party joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said, "Bhuiyan was not elected secretary general. The decision of his expulsion was constitutional. He was expelled in the same way he had been appointed as secretary general. "If he wants to return to the party admitting mistake, he will have to find the way." Goyeshwar alleged that Bhuiyan dropped him from the elected post of Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal general secretary in 2002, which was not constitutional. Earlier leaders and workers of Jubo Dal led by its general secretary Moazzem Hossain Alal presented a bouquet to the party secretary general on the occasion of the 29th founding anniversary of the BNP's youth front. Jubo Dal organising secretary Khairul Kabir Khokan, former MPs Mohammad Shahjahan, Abul Hossain, Shah Nurul Kabir Khokan, Gazi Rafiqul Islam, Abdul Momin Talukder and central acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were present. Jubo Dal cancelled its programme to offer prayers at the grave of BNP founder late president Ziaur Rahman as authorities had not granted permission. bdn
