<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) - A lawyer Thursday served a legal notice on the government seeking cancellation of Debapriya Bhattacharya's appointment as Bangladesh's permanent representative to the United Nations Offices in Geneva. The notice asked the government to scrap the appointment by Oct 29, saying the appointment was a violation of public services rules. Lawyer Mohammad Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan served the notice on the chief adviser, the foreign affairs adviser, the foreign secretary and the secretary of the establishment ministry. Bhuiyan served the notice on behalf of Mostafa Minhaz, a PhD research fellow of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Quoting rules on public servants, the notice said a person, who got married or promised to get married to a foreigner, cannot be assigned to any diplomatic position. The notice threatened to take further legal action if the appointment is not cancelled. Debapriya, who was made ambassador to the UN offices in Geneva in September, is married to Irina Bhattacharya, a Russian national. bdnew
