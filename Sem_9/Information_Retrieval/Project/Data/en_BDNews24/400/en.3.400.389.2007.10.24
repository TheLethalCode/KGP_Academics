 KINSHASA, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congolese renegade General Laurent Nkunda said he would send a group of his rebel fighters on Wednesday to be reintegrated into the national army to help bring peace to a conflict-torn eastern province. "Today, I am going to send more than 500 of my soldiers to the Kirolirwe integration camp," he told Reuters by telephone from his stronghold at Masisi in Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has threatened a military offensive in North Kivu to forcibly disarm Nkunda's rebel Tutsi soldiers, who have fought battles against the government army since August when they abandoned a January peace deal. Nkunda, who has led a rebellion since 2004 in defence of the Congolese Tutsi community, said he was in contact with MONUC, the United Nations mission, which he said had prepared the logistics to receive his men. "I'm doing this to show the international community that we Congolese want peace ... because civilians are continuing to die without reason," Nkunda said, referring to the recent fighting. United Nations officials and diplomats reacted cautiously to the announcement by Nkunda, who has made such public statements before without following through. Experts estimate Nkunda's forces may number at least 4,000 and it was not clear whether he intended to disband all of them, or just some. "We'll believe it when we see it. We've seen these promises before," a Western diplomat in Kinshasa said. MONUC has called on Nkunda's men to come out of the bush and enter special camps so they can be integrated into the national army as part of a nationwide peace process that followed the country's 1998-2003 war. "We hope they will come very soon with no conditions," Sylvie Van Den Wildenberg, MONUC spokeswoman in North Kivu, told Reuters, adding that no Nkunda fighters had so far turned up at the Kirolirwe camp. Kabila, who has vowed to pacify all of his vast, mineral-rich country since winning elections in the former Belgian colony last year, said last week he had given a "green light" for the armed forces to move against Nkunda. But the president, who is currently visiting the United States, declined to say when the offensive would start. Nkunda says he is defending Congo's Tutsi ethnic community against attacks by Rwandan Hutu rebels he says are supported by Kabila's army. The Congolese leader denies such support and says he also plans to disarm the Hutu rebels, who are accused of involvement in Rwanda's 1994 genocide killings of Tutsis. UN relief agencies fear an all-out army offensive will sharply worsen the humanitarian situation in North Kivu, where 370,000 people have fled fighting this ye
