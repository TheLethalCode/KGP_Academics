 By Fayen Wong SYDNEY, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices extended gains to a new all-time high of $91.10 a barrel in early electronic trade on Friday, bolstered by supply concerns during the northern Hemisphere winter and growing political tensions in Middle East. NYMEX crude for December delivery, which rose to a record high of $91.10 barrel, was up 31 cents at $90.77 by 0001 GMT. U.S. crude settled up $3.36 to $90.46 a barrel on Thursday after striking a record $90.60. London Brent crude also hit a new record high of $88.01 a barrel. "The rebound in oil prices has been remarkable. With all the bullish news flow in the market, I think there is potential for oil to rise further for the rest of the day and in the near term," said David Moore, an analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Oil, which was falling at the start of the week on concerns about the strength U.S. economy, has gained over $6 since Wednesday, after government data revealed a larger-than-expected 5.3-million-barrel drawdown in U.S. crude inventories. The sharp fall in crude stocks, combined with fresh signs that oil cartel OPEC will shrug off calls for additional oil from big consumer nations, have exacerbated fears of a possible supply crunch in the coming winter. Energy officials from OPEC nations Venezuela and Algeria said the producer group will not boost output when it meets informally in Saudi Arabia next month. "The high prices are not coming from a lack of production," Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil said. OPEC already has agreed to boost production by 500,000 barrels per day from November 1, but the United States has called on the group to increase output further, while No. 2 consumer China has said prices are too high. Increased U.S. pressure on major oil producer Iran has also played up investors' worries that Tehran could retaliate by cutting oil exports to Western nations. The United States slapped new sanctions on Iran and accused its Revolutionary Guard of spreading weapons of mass destruction on Thursday, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said such moves only forced Tehran into a corner over its nuclear program. Also labeling Iran's Qods military force a supporter of terrorism, Washington imposed sanctions on more than 20 Iranian companies, banks and individuals as well as the defense ministry, hoping to increase pressure on Tehran to stop uranium enrichment and curb its "terrorist" activities. Simmering tensions between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq also heightened fears that crude supplies from Iraq would be disrupted should Turkish forces launch an attack. President Abdullah Gul warned Kurdish rebels on Thursday that Turkey's patience was running out after Turkish forces said they had repelled a guerrilla attack near the Iraqi border. Ankara has massed up to 100,000 troops along the mountainous border before a possible cross-border operation to crush about 3,000 rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who launch attacks into Turkey from northern Iraq. MORE THAN QUADRUPLED Oil prices have more than quadrupled since the start of 2002. Prices have jumped roughly 45 percent this year on supply concerns, unprecedented dollar weakness and a shift of investor money into energy and commodities from other asset classes. Gains have been limited only by concerns a U.S. housing slump could draw the economy into recession and limit deman
