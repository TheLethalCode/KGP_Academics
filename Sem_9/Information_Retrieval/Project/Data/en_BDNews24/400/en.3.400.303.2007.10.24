 KATHMANDU, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's political parties need to sink their differences to save a peace process that ended a civil war and brought Maoist rebels into the mainstream, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged on Wednesday. He said the peace deal, signed last November, was at a crossroads after the former rebels quit the interim government last month following a dispute with their six coalition partners over abolishing the monarchy immediately.

Under the peace deal, thousands of former Maoist fighters are confined to UN-monitored camps and have locked up their weapons. But they have been complaining against the poor condition of the camps managed by the government, while mainstream political parties say the Maoists have failed to return property seized by them during the conflict. This month, the UN Mission in Nepal blamed both the Maoists and the government for the cracks in the peace deal. The Maoists had long been demanding the assembly during the conflict and believe it will give them what they had been fighting for -- the abolition of the monarchy.
