<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  India will continue to send suspected Bangladeshi criminals back home although the two neighbours have no extradition treaty, Indian border guard chief said Thursday. "The suspects who are living in India and facing cases would be sent back to Bangladesh. A list of 10 to 12 such suspects is under consideration of the Indian government for that. They will be repatriated after necessary procedures," said Ashish Kumar Mitra, director general of the Indian Border Security Force. He made the comment after a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at his ministry office. Currently about 12 such suspects are being held in Kolkata, he said. Earlier, the BSF chief led an Indian team to a meeting with Bangladeshi border guards at BDR headquarters in the city. The Indian delegation came to Dhaka Wednesday to join a five-day border talks with Bangladesh. "We have reached a consensus about construction on no-man's land. There's a consensus to construct 27 infrastructures in 150 yards of the both sides of the border. The decision has been taken to ease the people's movement from the two countries," he said. The foreign adviser said a peaceful border relation was important for both Dhaka and New Delhi. "We hope this meeting will provide us a structure (of further cooperation)," the adviser said. Indian high commissioner in Dhaka Pinak Ranjan Chakrawarty accompanied Mitra during his meeting with Iftekhar. Issues of smuggling, fencing by India along the border and border tension would feature the five-day meeting, the officials said. The two neighbours share a porous border of about 4,000 kilometres where small skirmishes between the border guards are common. bdnew
