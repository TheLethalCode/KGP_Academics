<TITLE> Darfur peace talks to begin without key rebels </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SIRTE, Libya, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Delegations gathered in Libya on Saturday to launch talks to end 4-1/2 years of conflict in Sudan's Darfur region but the absence of key rebels cast doubt on whether negotiations could produce any meaningful deal. On the eve of the African Union-United Nations-mediated talks in Sirte, two main rebel groups -- the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Army Unity faction -- said they would not attend. That decision came after another rebel leader, Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur, founder of a third group, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), said he would not travel to Libya for the talks. JEM-SLA Unity represent the biggest military threat to the Sudanese government and Nur has the most popular support among Darfuris. Analysts say without their representation in Libya peace talks had little chance of success. UN envoy Jan Eliasson, who helped organise the talks, held out hope the groups would still be persuaded to join negotiations. "Time is on no one's side ... This is a ticking bomb," Eliasson told reporters in Libya. "We hope these negotiations will include everybody." The talks are the first attempt to gather Darfur rebels and the Sudanese government around a negotiating table since 2006 when the AU mediated Darfur peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria. Signed by only one rebel faction, that agreement had little support among the 2 million Darfuris trapped in displacement camps. Rather than bring peace, the deal triggered fresh violence, as rebels split into more than a dozen factions, some preying on civilians, aid workers and AU troops sent to the region to quell the violence but unable to protect themselves. International experts say 200,000 people have died since rebels rose up against the government in 2003, charging it with neglect. The Sudanese government says the Western media exaggerates the crisis and only 9,000 people have died. "SERIOUS SETBACK" Analysts have warned that without full rebel representation the Libya talks would go the way of the Abuja deal. JEM chief negotiator Ahmed Tugod Lissan told Reuters on Friday his group and SLA Unity decided not to go because mediators had not invited the "genuine parties that should be part of the peace process". He said organisers sided with the Sudanese government by inviting people specified by Khartoum. Darfur expert Alex de Waal called the withdrawal of JEM and SLA Unity "a very serious setback". "A (peace) process can be started but in the aftermath of Abuja it is essential that any agreement that is reached includes everybody. No process can be successful in the absence of JEM and SLA Unity," de Waal said. Rebel delegates in Sirte said up to seven factions would take part in the talks. Also attending is a large Sudanese government delegation and international representatives from the United States, the Arab League, China, Eritrea, Britain and Russia, among others. Opening speeches were expected on Saturday afternoon and after that, it was expected the delegations would break off into smaller groups. "Mostly what's going to happen is they'll try to get through this phase and put a longer time frame on it," said Stephen Morrison, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "(UN Secretary-General) Ban Ki-moon's push for these talks is twinned with getting some progress before some of the 26,000 forces deploy," he added. Khartoum agreed in July to allow a hybrid force of 26,000 UN-AU troops to deploy in Sudan to replace and absorb some 7,000 AU peacekeepers in western Sudan. That deployment is expected to begin by the end of this year but Morrison said without a deal, some nations might be loath to commit troops.
