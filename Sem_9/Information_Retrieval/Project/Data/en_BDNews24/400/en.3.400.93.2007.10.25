<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday officials from the Islamist group Hamas were holding meetings with Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and ease access for goods and people. Asked by al-Arabiya television if he was aware of such meetings, Abbas said: "There are meetings taking place between Hamas and Israel, there were meetings held on Erez (crossing point) and there are ongoing meetings in other places." Abbas, speaking in the Jordanian capital Amman after talks with King Abdullah, gave no further details of the Gaza discussions. Hamas seized control of the enclave in June after fighting with Abbas's security forces. Israel declared Gaza an "enemy entity" in September as the Islamist movement refused to halt firing makeshift rockets into Israel. Israel has closed the Gaza border to everything but humanitarian supplies since Hamas routed Abbas's forces.
