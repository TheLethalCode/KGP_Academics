 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday deferred until Oct 29 a hearing on Arafat Rahman Coco's remand in the GATCO corruption case. Metropolitan magistrate Md Mizanur Rahman rescheduled the hearing as the authorities failed to produce former prime minister Khaleda Zia's younger son before court because he is ill. ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda, the investigating officer in the GATCO case, appealed for a seven-day police remand for Coco on Oct 22. The senior jail superintendent of Dhaka Central Jail informed the court in a letter that Coco was sick and could not be produced before the court. The letter said Coco had been receiving treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital since Sept 7. Coco was taken on a seven-day remand on Sept 3, the day he was arrested along with his mother. But he was sent to jail on Sept 5, before the remand expired, leaving the interrogation incomplete. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury filed the GATCO corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. Thirteen people, including Khaleda and Coco, stand accused. The case details say a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor to Chittagong Port and Kamalapur inland container depots. The accused are charged with acting in collusion with each other to fix the GATCO tender even though the company did not meet the requirements of the bidding. The case alleges that the deal cost the government Tk 1,000 crore in losses. Khaleda was arrested and Coco taken on remand under the GATCO case. Two directors of GATCO and a son of former shipping minister late Col (retd) Akbar Hossain, Ismail Hossain Saimon, gave confessional statements to the court. Taskforce officials investigating the case against Khaleda Wednesday interrogated four officers and employees of GATCO. They are GATCO director Faisal Haider, project manager Abdul Hye, and operators Abdul Azim and Moazzem Hossain. Taskforce chief Major Md Mostafa Kamal, ACC deputy director Zahirul Huda and CID inspector Nurul Islam quizzed them at the ACC office. bdnews2
