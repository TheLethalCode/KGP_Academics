 AHMEDABAD, India, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian selectors have dropped experienced batsman Rahul Dravid for the first two one-day internationals against Pakistan next month. Dravid, 34, averages less than 10 in his last 10 one-day matches and was dropped for the final one-dayer against Australia earlier this month. "We wanted to give him a break for a while," chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar told a news conference on Saturday. "He is a great player. He will be back very soon." Pakistan will play five one-day internationals and three tests in India from Nov. 5. Explosive opener Virender Sehwag, dropped for the England tour due to poor form, regained his place. Squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Yuvraj Singh, Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Robin Uthappa, Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Rohit Sharma, Murali Kartik, Zaheer Khan, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Harbhajan Singh, Praveen Kumar
