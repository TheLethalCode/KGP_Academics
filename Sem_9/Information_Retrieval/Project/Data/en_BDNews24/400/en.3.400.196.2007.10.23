<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN special envoy for Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, expects to go to that country in the first week of November after the government there agreed to bring forward his visit, a UN spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Exact dates have yet to be arranged, but Gambari will go to Myanmar directly from the region, which he is currently touring to discuss the crisis following the Myanmar junta's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, spokeswoman Michele Montas told a news briefing. Myanmar had earlier agreed to a visit by Gambari in mid-November. He previously visited the country three weeks ago.
