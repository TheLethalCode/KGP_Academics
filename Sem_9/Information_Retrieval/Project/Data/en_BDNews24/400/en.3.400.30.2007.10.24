<TITLE> Kazakhstan to build up navy to protect oil </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ASTANA, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan plans to build up its naval force on the Caspian Sea to guard its vast offshore oilfields and diversify arms imports, the Central Asian state's defence minister said on Wednesday. Kazakhstan inherited its military force from Russia and it relies on its former Soviet overlord for most of its defence contracts. Any deviation from this tradition would annoy Russia which sees Central Asia as its sphere of interest. Defence Minister Danial Akhmetov told Reuters in an interview that Kazakhstan sought to significantly expand its small fleet on the Caspian Sea and promote military contacts with countries such as Turkey and Israel. "We are beginning to develop our navy for the first time. Of course it's very costly but given that Kazakhstan is home to serious oil resources in the Caspian Sea, it is our duty ... to create a stable and calm environment," he said. "In the sphere of arms equipment and defence technology we believe in a wide-ranging approach. It is Russia on one side, and on the other it's Israel, Turkey's military-industrial complex and other countries where we try to buy everything that is new." Kazakhstan's relations with Russia somewhat cooled this year as the steppe nation, awash with booming oil revenues and home to some of the world's biggest oilfields, seeks to pursue a more independent foreign policy. In a symbolic gesture of support for the West, Kazakhstan has deployed a contingent of military engineers to assist U.S. military efforts in Iraq. Its biggest oilfields, Kashagan and Tengiz, are being developed by Western oil majors including Italy's Eni , Exxon Mobil , and Royal Dutch Shell . Akhmetov said Kazakhstan, which operates only a handful of ships to guard its energy interests, has mapped out a strategy and would set up a separate naval authority next year. He said his ministry would soon pick a country to supply it with military ships and help develop its coastal infrastructure. "As our economy grows, our defence budget will also grow accordingly," he said. This year's defence budget is $1.2 billion, or just over one percent of gross domestic product. But Akhmetov said Russia would remain Kazakhstan's key suppliers in anti-aircraft technology and aviation. "We have very simple principles in this respect," he said. "Certain types of complex technology such as aviation we will still continue to develop with Russi
