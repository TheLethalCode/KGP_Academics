 SINGAPORE, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US oil prices and Brent crude rocketed to all-time highs on Friday on a record-low dollar, tensions in the Middle East and worries over energy supply shortages ahead of the northern hemisphere's winter. US crude for December jumped to a record-peak of $92.22 a barrel, and was at $91.69 at 0745 GMT, up $1.23 from Thursday's close and about 50 percent from the start of the year. But US crude is still below the inflation-adjusted high of $101.70 hit in April 1980, a year after the Iranian revolution. London Brent crude also hit a fresh all-time high of $89.30. Rising global crude oil demand, especially from top consumers the United States and rapidly growing China, has driven oil's current rally, helped by a low dollar and investment flows from pension and hedge funds into commodities and oil. Fears of a supply crunch have helped the surge. Producer cartel OPEC has signalled it is unlikely to boost supply further and political tensions in the Middle East have increased investors' worries that some output could be disrupted. Higher prices have so far had a limited impact on economic growth and demand. Only concerns that a US housing slump may crimp economic growth could weigh on the rally in oil prices, and signs are emerging of a slowdown in China's demand growth. In anticipation that the US Federal Reserve may cut interest rates next week, the US dollar hit fresh record lows against the euro and a basket of currencies on Friday. The weak dollar fuels oil buying as investors view dollar assets as relatively cheap FEAR FACTOR "The market is founded on fear and supply-side concerns," said Gerard Burg, an analyst at National Australia Bank. "The US moves on Iran and continued worries of supply are the factors now." The United States slapped new sanctions on Iran and accused its Revolutionary Guard of spreading weapons of mass destruction, but Russia said such moves only forced Tehran into a corner over its nuclear programme. Oil, which was falling at the start of the week on concerns about the strength of the US economy, has rallied since US data on Wednesday showed a larger-than-expected 5.3-million barrel drawdown in US crude inventories. "With all the bullish news flow in the market, I think there is potential for oil to rise further for the rest of the day and in the near term," said David Moore, an analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. SUPPLY CRUNCH FEARS Exacerbating fears of a possible supply crunch, OPEC's Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri said world oil markets were well supplied, while dollar weakness and a flood of speculative investment had helped push prices up to record levels. Al-Badri added that $90 a barrel oil was not bringing a windfall to OPEC, which is investing in new production and seeing revenues eroded by the weak dollar. Energy officials from OPEC nations Venezuela and Algeria said the producer group would not boost output when it meets informally in Saudi Arabia next month. "The high prices are not coming from a lack of production," Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil said. OPEC has already agreed to boost production by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Nov. 1, but the United States has called on the group to increase output further, while No. 2 consumer China has said prices are too high. The gap between record world oil markets and low state-set Chinese prices have pushed refiners to cut runs and choke supplies to the market to limit losses, leading to some diesel pumps running dry in the southwest of the country. China is rationing diesel at pump stations in at least four coastal provinces, in the widest-scale rationing since 2003. Signs of slowing demand growth in China, whose insatiable consumption was one of the key drivers of oil's four-year rally, is seen in its apparent oil demand growing at the slowest rate in 20 months in September, up just 0.3 percent from a year earlier. Simmering tensions between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq also heightened fears that crude supplies from Iraq would be disrupted should Turkish forces launch an attack. President Abdullah Gul warned Kurdish rebels on Thursday that Turkey's patience was running out after Turkish forces said they had repelled a guerrilla attack near the Iraqi border.
