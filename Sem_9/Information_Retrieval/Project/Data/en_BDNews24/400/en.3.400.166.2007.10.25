 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  RAB early Thursday arrested two persons, including a nephew of businessman Aziz Mohammad Bhai, and recovered nearly five kg of Yaba tablets and other drugs from their possession. RAB Legal and Media Wing director Commander AK Azad said that the elite force also recovered a Yaba tablet-producing machine and a good number of 'ice pills', a drug which RAB sources said was more powerful than Yaba, during the raid. In the raid on two residences in Gulshan, the RAB men also seized Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) equipment worth Tk 5 crore, foreign currency worth over Tk 50 lakh and a huge quantity of foreign liquor. One of the arrestees was Aminul Huda, a senior official of MB Multicare Technology and nephew of Aziz Mohammad Bhai, said Azad. Azad told bdnews24.com Thursday morning that the forces began the raids late Wednesday night on house numbers 41 and 116 of Road 123 in Gulshan-1. He said the raids ended early Thursday morning. The second arrestee could not be immediately identified. Meanwhile a raid by the Directorate of Narcotics Control in Moghbazar yielded another hoard of illicit drugs, including Yaba and Phensidyl. Drug dealers Shaheen, 30, Mohammad Bashar, 25, and Liton Debnath, 35, were arrested in the raid.
