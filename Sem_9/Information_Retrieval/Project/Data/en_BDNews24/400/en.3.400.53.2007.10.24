 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government has granted one month's leave to former chairman of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) Badiur Rahman. With the approval of the leave, according to rules, he became an officer on special duty (OSD) at the establishment ministry. The ministry on Tuesday issued order on his leave. The former NBR chairman submitted an application for leave from Oct 22 to Nov 21 expressing his willingness to go into voluntary retirement. Rahman was transferred as the secretary to the food and disaster management ministry on Oct 18. But he did not join the new assignment and applied for leave. He has been made OSD so that some other official could be made secretary to the food and disaster management ministry or a top official at the ministry could be made acting secretary while Rahman is on leave. bdne
