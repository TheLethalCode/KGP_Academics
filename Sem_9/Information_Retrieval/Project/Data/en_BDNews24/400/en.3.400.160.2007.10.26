 BRIDGETOWN, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaica beat Guyana in the Caribbean's first competitive day-night cricket match at the picturesque Three Ws Oval just outside Bridgetown on Thursday. Over 2,000 spectators watched the game in a carnival-like atmosphere, Guyana making 159 for nine from their allotted 43 overs after a damp outfield had delayed the start. The floodlights were switched on before the end of the Guyana innings and Jamaica reached their target for the loss of three wickets with nearly three overs to spare in the first semi-final of the premier one-day competition in the West Indies. Australian-born Brendan Nash was Jamaica's leading bowler, completing figures of four for 20 to rip out the Guyanan top order. "The ball was coming out really nicely today," Nash told reporters. "The scoreboard will show that I had the best figures but I got a lot of assistance from the guys at the other end. We played brilliantly as a team."
