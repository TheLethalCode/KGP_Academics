 By Ian Chua HONG KONG, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks hit an all-time high on Friday as upbeat earnings from the likes of Sony Corp lifted investor sentiment, while a rally in oil prices to a record high above $91 a barrel boosted energy shares. Swept up by the surge in US crude, gold rose to $773 an ounce, its best level in 28 years. "With all the bullish news flow in the market, I think there is potential for oil to rise further for the rest of the day and in the near term," said David Moore, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The dollar languished near its life lows on expectations of further US interest rate cuts after data showed unexpectedly poor sales of new US homes and falls in orders for durable or long-lasting goods, underscoring weakness in the world's biggest economy. "The Fed will have to cut rates to tackle a slowing US economy, but oil prices surged again overnight, making matters complicated," said Rho Y.S., a market strategist at Hyundai Securities in Seoul. Bolstered by gains in energy stocks, expectations of a US rate cut and strong earnings from major firms such as Japan's Sony Corp and South Korea's top automaker Hyundai Motors, equity markets rose across the region. At 0200 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had climbed 0.6 percent, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks added 1.3 percent to a new life high. The MSCI index hit 570.00, surpassing its October 11 peak of 569.13. EARNINGS BOOST Investors snapped up Sony Corp, sending the stock up 7.2 percent, a day after the firm swung to a quarterly operating profit, while Hyundai Motor advanced 2.3 percent after exceeding expectations with a 45 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday. Also in favor, Singapore's DBS Group Holdings climbed 2.4 percent as investors cheered better-than-expected results from Southeast Asia's biggest bank. But disappointing earnings from Kia Motor prompted investors to punish the stock, knocking it down 5.7 percent. Energy shares gained ground on hopes that record high oil prices will boost their earnings. Japan's INPEX Holdings put on 1.6 percent and Woodside Petroleum advanced 2.0 percent. Strong bullion also gave gold miners a shot in the arm with Newcrest Mining climbing 5 percent and Zijin Mining gaining 3.3 percent. US crude was up 43 cents at $90.89 a barrel, while cash gold rose to $772.60 after peaking at $773 an ounce. DOLLAR WEAK In the forex market, the dollar hovered near a life low against a basket of major currencies and the euro on expectations the Fed will lower lending costs at next week's meeting. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, eased to 77.268, not far off a record trough of 77.093 plumbed on Monday. The euro bought $1.4321, nearing the all-time high of about $1.4350 touched on Monday, while it edged up to 163.63 yen, off Thursday's low near 162.40 yen. "The much lower-than-expected durable goods data was a dollar negative ... and it feeds into the notion that the Fed will cut rates by another 25 basis points on October 31," said David Powell, currency strategist at IDEAglobal in New York. Caught between expectations of a US rate cut and strength in stocks, Japanese government bond yields were little changed. The benchmark 10-year Japanese bonds were yielding 1.585 percent, up just half a basis poin
