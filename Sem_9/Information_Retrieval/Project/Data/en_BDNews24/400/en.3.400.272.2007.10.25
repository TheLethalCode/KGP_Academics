<TEXT>
 Naogaon, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's advisor ASM Hannan Shah said Thursday they would free the party chief from jail through legal course before Eid ul-Azha. His announcement may sound ambitious to many, but Hannan, a retired brigadier, was upbeat when he made the comment to bdnews24.com during a personal visit to Patnitola Upazila in the district. "She would be freed legally before Eid ul-Azha. All case documents have been handed over to renowned lawyers for that," he said. He accused the government of making an effort to smear party chief Khaleda Zia by arresting her. Asked if he believed the next polls would be held in line with the announcement of the Election Commission, Hannan said, "Many things depend on the government's sincerity. We would like to believe that the elections would be on time." He said Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan would have to wait and follow party constitution if he wanted to come back to the party. bdnews24.com/
