<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury Friday demanded a smooth distribution of fertiliser among farmers for a bumper Boro crop. Motia, who served as the minister for agriculture during her party's rule in 1996-2001, alleged that the farmers were not getting adequate fertiliser despite a government announcement that there was no dearth of stock. "The government must handle any mismanagement in case of fertiliser distribution. The distribution of quality seeds is also important. It's our clear demand," she told reporters at her home in the city. "Last year the farmers had suffered from power and fuel crises. The government must take necessary steps this year so that the farmers do not face any trouble." She added that the government should give subsidy to them. bdnew
