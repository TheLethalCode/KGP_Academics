 Dhaka University, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University, which is restarting classes from Oct 28, has delayed admission tests to its Kha unit by 14 days to Jan 11. The test was originally scheduled for Dec 28. Prof Aminul Islam of the arts faculty appealed for the extension on the ground that the admission tests fell too soon after the Eid-ul Azha holiday, which ends on Dec 26. The dates for admission tests for other faculties remain unchanged. bdnews24.co
