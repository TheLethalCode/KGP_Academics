<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  A bill introduced in the US House of Representative by a Congressman would ensure duty-free access of some Bangladeshi apparel products to that country once approved, the BGMEA chief said Thursday. The bill, "New Partnership for Development Act 2007", was placed by congressman Jim McDermott on Oct 18, said Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association. "We greatly appreciate the efforts...in introducing the bill that will benefit all LDCs including Bangladesh," Chowdhury said at a news briefing with members of the Overseas Correspondent Association of Bangladesh at BGMEA office in the city. The meeting was arranged to brief the media about the association's annual garments show, called BATEXPO. This year's show is scheduled for Nov 15-17. He said an association team would visit Washington next week to discuss the bill. "We are hopeful that the United States Congress will pass such LDC legislation as soon as possible, on the most liberal terms, as it is critical to the economic and political future of Bangladesh," Chowdhury said. If the bill is passed it could help boom the country's burgeoning garments sector further as it is continuously gaining more export earnings despite an end to quota system for export to the developed countries. Chowdhury said the country could increase its annual earning from garments export to $15-18 billion annually by 2010 despite many challenges ahead. Narrating the prospect, the apex body chief said Bangladesh has earned a reputation as a "very good RMG manufacturer". He said despite stiff competition on the global market, Bangladesh has good scope to grow over next 10 years. "We're not that much worried," he said, adding that garment sector leaders such as India and China are not competitors of Bangladesh since they produce another type of products. "We have ample scope to grow if we get support from the government. It will matter if our entrepreneurs get bank loans with competitive interest rates," he said. Chowdhury said entrepreneurs in India, China and Pakistan get bank loan with a rate of less than 5 percent but it is much higher in Bangladesh. He said Bangladesh even can export a good volume of garment products to India. "India could be the third largest destination of our garment products after the US and Europe," Chowdhury said. "India's concentration is on mainly fashion and casual products but we produce mainly formal garment that has a scope to grow there." Bangladesh's garment sector earns nearly $10 billion in exports annually. About 2.4 million workers, mostly women, are directly employed in the country's more than 4,000 factories. But unrest over low wage or irregular payment often breaks out. Chowdhury however said Thursday they were "working hard" to improve the situation. Allegations have it that the workers work in hazardous environment in many factories since owners often ignore compliance factors. "We have many problems. But we are trying hard and already we have achieved a lot. Our effort is on," Chowdhury said. This year's BATEXPO will be held at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. The exposition will compose of display of products, fashion show and cultural events. Chowdhury said they expected a huge participation of organisations from Pakistan, India, China, Japan, Hong Kong while buyers are expected from USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Middle East and many Southeast Asian countries. b
