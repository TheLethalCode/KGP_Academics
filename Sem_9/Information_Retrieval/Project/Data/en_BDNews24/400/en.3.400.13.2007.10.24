<TITLE> EU urges Turkish rights reforms as new talks loom </TITLE>

 STRASBOURG, France, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union told Turkey on Wednesday to improve its rights record at home and establish stronger civilian control over the army, but said it expected to broaden talks soon on Ankara joining the bloc. The executive European Commission and current EU president Portugal warned Ankara against a military incursion into Iraq and urged it to work out with Baghdad ways of ending attacks from Kurdish separatists based in northern Iraq. "The time has come to reach a new momentum in the reform process," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the European Parliament during a debate on Turkey. His comments gave a foretaste of criticism Turkey is likely to face in the Commission's annual report on Ankara's progress towards EU membership, due to be published in early November. "Further efforts are needed to ensure democratic supremacy in civil-military relations, protect the rights of women, children and trade unions, improve the judiciary system and enhance the fight against corruption," Rehn said. The EU urged Turkey to act to mend ties with Cyprus. Turkey started EU entry talks in 2005 but is not expected to join the bloc before 2015, if at all, as some member states are sceptical towards its membership. Portugal reiterated that Turkey should scrap or change article 301 of its penal code, which makes it a criminal offence to "insult Turkishness". It was used in a now lapsed attempt to prosecute Nobel Prize-winning Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk. "On freedom of expression, we regret the lack of progress. We are worried about growing nationalism leading to self-censorship," said Manuel Lobo Antunes, Portugal's secretary of state for EU affairs. SENSITIVE ISSUE The European Parliament passed a resolution on Wednesday containing similar criticisms but, unlike the legislature's report last year, it did not mention the World War One killings of 1.5 million Armenians in Ottoman Turkey, a highly sensitive issue. Some deputies presented amendments calling the killing a genocide. However, a majority rejected the amendments after Turkey, a NATO member, responded angrily to the approval by a U.S. Congressional committee of an Armenian genocide resolution. Antunes and Rehn criticised Turkey for failing to keep a promise to open its ports to vessels from Cyprus as part of a normalisation of relations with the southern part of the divided island, an EU member. The EU froze talks with Turkey last year on eight of 35 policy areas that need to be agreed before the country joins the bloc, because Ankara had not moved on Cyprus. Rehn said the EU could open talks in two more policy areas with Turkey in the coming weeks -- consumer protection and trans-European rail, motor and energy transport routes. The Union needed to show its commitment to talks with Turkey, Rehn said, if it was to have any leverage on reforms in the country -- a gateway to the Middle East and a provider of major routes for the delivery of gas and oil from Asia. Rehn and Antunes repeated the EU's condemnation of Kurdish attacks on Turkey launched from Iraq. "We call on Turkey to abstain from military incursion or any other disproportionate military measure," Antunes sa
