<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Wednesday said the government wanted to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before the separation of the judiciary. The government had taken initiatives to amend the CrPC to give some judicial power to executive magistrates, he told bdnews24.com after a meeting with Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed at the adviser's office. Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal was also present. Mainul said the meeting discussed how the amendments could be made and added that he would meet the chief justice in a few days. "Since the judiciary will be separated on November 1, the issue needs to be settled before that. We have to run the administration." He said the matter would be finalised after discussion with the chief justice. The adviser Tuesday told reporters after a meeting that executive magistrates would have judicial powers in some cases. The powers included maintaining law and order through summary trials, conducting anti-adulteration and eviction drives, visiting examination halls and conducting mobile courts under powers stipulated in sections 260 to 265 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). "The separation of the judiciary from the executive is a new phenomenon. Laws will be amended to remove the problems." "The laws will have to be amended time and again if necessary. The separation of the judiciary is a continuous process. Work on the issue needs to continue after November 1," the adviser said at Tuesday's meeting. After returning to his court office, the Surpreme Court registrar told bdnews24.com the adviser had sought cooperation of all to separate the judiciary from the executive branch. He however claimed that he did not discuss further amendment to the amended CrPC. Asked about the matter, he said, "We had talks about the separation of the judiciary. The adviser sought cooperation from all in this respect. No talks were held on the amendment to the law." Asked whether legal action would be taken against Rokanuddowla who offered apology to the chief justice and for his recent demand to a halt to the separation of judiciary until 2021, the registrar said, "The Supreme Court will take a decision on the matter after it is presented to the court." "The separation of the judiciary is now under process. The Supreme Court will give the next order in this regard on October 31. If the court wants it can take the matter into cognisance then." The Supreme Court on Sep 18 directed the government to complete all steps for separation of the judiciary including arranging court rooms for judicial magistrates by Oct 28. ] It also ordered the government to inform the court about the progress on Oct 29. bdnews24.com/m
