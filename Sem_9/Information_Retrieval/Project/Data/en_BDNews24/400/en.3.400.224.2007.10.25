 KARACHI, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "Welcome Home Benazir Bhutto". The message on hoardings looming over Karachi's streets seemed to possess a chilling sub-text a week after the suicide attack that killed 139 people during what was supposed to have been Bhutto's triumphant homecoming. The ensuing security scare means Bhutto hasn't left Karachi since, though her aides said on Thursday she would visit her ancestral home near the city of Larkana in the north of Sindh province over the weekend. Hundreds of thousands of supporters came out to greet Bhutto on her return from eight years of self-imposed exile, and she will expect another big turnout in the family's feudal fiefdom, regardless of the assassination threat against her. A new officer took charge of the investigation into the suicide attack by at least one bomber, possibly two, on Thursday after Bhutto complained that the policeman originally appointed had been present when her husband Asif Ali Zardari was tortured while in custody in 2000. Government officials have blamed Islamist militants based in tribal areas where al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are operating near the Afghan border, but Bhutto has said influential members of the Pakistani establishment are also out to get her. A statement issued by Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) inferred that the head of one of Pakistan's security agencies, Intelligence Bureau Chief Ijaz Shah, was one of the people Bhutto had named in a letter to President Pervez Musharraf. Bhutto and General Musharraf have begun a rapprochement ahead of elections due in January as part of a transition toward civilian-led democracy. There is some speculation they could end up sharing power in a partnership that would have the blessings of the United States. Rising militancy in nuclear-armed Pakistan is causing unease among Western allies. On Thursday, a suspected roadside bomb or suicide blast killed 21 soldiers in northwest Pakistan's Swat valley, a tourist destination where a Taliban-style movement has taken root. KARACHI TENSE But it is Bhutto's return that appears to have caused great unease within the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML). While its leaders have reacted bitterly to Bhutto's inferences about plots against her, little has been heard from Musharraf since the attack in Karachi. Nor has there been any breakthrough in the investigation. "I will get the case file today, read and analyse it and only then can I comment," said Deputy Inspector General Saud Mirza. In Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, a PPP-dominated area, Bhutto supporters burnt tyres amd threw stones, and there was some shooting, as violence broke out over a remark by Sindh province's chief minister that Bhutto had "cast an ill-omen". The violence was also in reaction to a police search for one of Bhutto's most trusted aides. Police earlier this week raided the house of Zulfiqar Mirza, who was on the truck with Bhutto when the assassination attempt was made, but he was not at home. Mirza is wanted in connection with the 1998 murder of a former Pakistan Steel Mills chairman, gunned down days before he was due to testify before a panel investigating charges of corruption against Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari. Zardari was imprisoned for eight years before being released in 2004, and while still in prison courts exonerated him of any involvement in either the murder or the related graft case. The corruption cases against Bhutto and her husband were brought before General Musharraf came to power in a coup that overthrew then prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Musharraf granted an amnesty in order to allow Bhutto to return without fear of prosecution in the old cases against her and her husband.
