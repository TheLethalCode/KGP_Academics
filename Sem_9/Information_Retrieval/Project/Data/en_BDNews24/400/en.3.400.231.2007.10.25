 LISBON, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives in Lisbon on Thursday to try to charm Portuguese leaders in a prelude to an EU-Russia summit on Friday that could be soured by bickering over energy and trade disagreements. The beginning of Putin's two-day trip to Portugal, which holds the EU presidency, comes as a Russian official said an EU proposal on restricting foreigners' ownership of pipelines and energy grids could be "discriminatory." Putin is due to arrive in Lisbon around 1330 GMT and will meet Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva and Prime Minister Jose Socrates in the afternoon. Lisbon will also host on Thursday an EU-Russia meeting of industrialists, bringing together leading businesses.

Portuguese officials say Socrates and Putin enjoy friendly personal relations, which could smooth some of the biggest headaches in EU-Russian ties during the summit. At the summit on Friday, a key concern of Russia's will be the European Commission's proposal to break up big utilities that control power supply, generation and transmission. In last month's proposal the Commission also included a clause to prevent foreign firms from buying pipelines and power grids if their home countries do not have similarly open markets and an agreement with Brussels. That was seen as targeting Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's top adviser on EU issues, said on Wednesday the plan could hurt competition and raise the price of gas. Russia is Europe's main gas supplier. Yastrzhembsky told Reuters that the proposals "could become the basis for a discriminatory approach to, say, Gazprom, which could restrict the principle of free competition." European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso will discuss the proposal with Putin on Friday. Portuguese officials say other key issues on the agenda on Friday are Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation while hotspots like Kosovo and Iran will also be discuss
