 LONDON, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At 1034 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.9 percent, taking its gains for the year to 5.3 percent. The index's performance to date this year is anaemic compared to 14 percent gains at this time in 2006, but European shares have risen 9.5 percent from a low plumbed in August when fears over a crunch in credit markets were at their worst. Shares in France Telecom vaulted 6.5 percent after it posted strong results, also lifting Vodafone by 4 percent and making telecoms the best performing sector in Europe. Swiss engineering group ABB rose 3.7 percent after an 86 percent rise in quarterly earnings boosted by strong demand for power generation infrastructure, while French rival Alstom rose 5.6 percent as Lehman Brothers raised its target price for the stock. Earnings growth has widely been expected to slow this quarter after a strong run, but many companies have reported strong numbers. "The earnings season has the potential to reassure investors, and the results compared to what was feared have had a positive impact on sentiment," said Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at Unicredit in Munich. "It's clear though that there's a trend of increased selectivity, and it's too early to conclude that earnings growth in Europe will decelerate less than in the United States." German auto group Daimler reported third-quarter earnings that were ahead of forecasts, sending its stock up 1.5 percent. On the macroeconomic front, U.S. durable goods orders and a reading on U.S. new home sales are due later in the day and financial markets are already pricing in a 100 percent chance of a cut in U.S. interest rates next week. Data earlier from the Ifo economic research institute showed its German business climate index dipped in October, in line with market expectations. Around European markets, London's FTSE 100, Frankfurt's DAX and Paris's CAC-40 all gained more than 1 percent. SEVEN DOWN, SEVEN UP: A ROLLERCOASTER European stocks have staged a recovery after falling 13 percent in one month from mid-July, helped by cuts in the Federal Reserve's discount and main funds rates. But the recovery has been sensitive to any bad news on banks' exposure to the credit market problems, and the European benchmark has fallen one week for every week it has gained in the 14 weeks since mid-August. U.S. stocks recovered on Wednesday on talk of an imminent cut in the discount rate. "The Fed has remained tight-lipped over market speculation but with risk sentiment showing clear signs of stress after several downside earnings surprises and worries about credit market resurfacing, anticipation of another Fed easing move to provide some relief has grown significantly," UBS's forex strategists said in a note on Thursday. Merger and acquisitions, a key driver of a multi-year bull run, continued to boost stocks. Shares in French electrical supplier Rexel jumped 8.5 percent after the company said it was planning, along with privately held Sonepar, to carve up Dutch competitor Hagemeyer, whose shares fell 3.3 percent. Generali rose 5.7 percent, adding to Wednesday's 2.6 percent rise, after British fund Algebris attacked the Italian insurer's corporate governance and pushed for change. And Spanish bank Santander advanced 1.6 percent as the company's nine-month net profit came in ahead of market estimat
