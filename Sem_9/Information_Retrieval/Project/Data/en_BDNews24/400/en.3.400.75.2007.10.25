 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Wednesday declined an offer from Australian Colin Miller to coach the national team, an official said. "We declined former Australian spinner Miller's offer as we are looking for a batting-oriented coach," said Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, chairman of the BCB coach selection committee, Thursday. "Miller was frequently wanting know about the BCB decision claiming that he had also got an offer from India. "We have told him to keep in touch with India as we are looking for a batting- oriented coach," said Lipu. The former Bangladesh captain said that they told Miller they would contact him if the board needed a specialist spinner. The BCB has been looking for a coach since Dav Whatmore quit following the ICC World Cup, and Australians John Dyson, Jamie Siddons, John Harmer, South African Kepler Wessels and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton pulled out of the race citing personal grounds. The BCB have also given up hope of getting the West Indies legend and former Bangladesh coach Gordon Greenidge, now chief selector of the Caribbean board. "It is not possible for Greenidge to guide Bangladesh as head coach as he is contracted to the West Indies board till June next, so we dropped his name from our list," said Lipu. Lipu said that they would try to get Greenidge as an interim batting coach after confirming a head coach for the national side. Lipu, without naming the coach, said that they had had a positive conversation with another Australian and hoped to get him as a coach. "I don't want to name the Australian, but I can say we had a positive discussion. "We let him know that what we want from him and we hope for a positive response from him in a couple of days," said Lipu.
