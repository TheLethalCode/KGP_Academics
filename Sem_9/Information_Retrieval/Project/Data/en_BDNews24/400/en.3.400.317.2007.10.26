 Sylhet, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com) BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain was barred from entering Sylhet city by police Friday morning, said party officials. BNP acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "We were travelling to Sylhet city to offer prayers at the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal (R), when the police stopped us at Lalabazar." After they were barred entry to the city, Khandakar's party stopped at a local mosque to say jumma prayers. Leaving the mosque, Delwar told assembled reporters: "Not allowing me to offer my prayers at the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal (R) is curtailing my religious rights." "I was going to Sylhet as a private citizen. It was nothing to do with politics." "I leave this matter to divine justice," he added. Assistant police commissioner Nazmul Islam told reporters: "If Delwar had been allowed to enter Sylhet city, there may have been a threat to the law and order situation as well as his own security." Rizvi told bdnews24.com: "When we questioned the police, they told us they had 'higher orders'." "We cannot abide by a situation whereby the police stop people from going to prayers." Rizvi said that he believed the government was acting purposely "to weaken BNP". "But we will not be intimidated," he added. Former BNP lawmaker Sohrab Hossain was travelling with Delwar as their convoy was stopped by police at 11.45am, 12 km from the city at Lalabaza
