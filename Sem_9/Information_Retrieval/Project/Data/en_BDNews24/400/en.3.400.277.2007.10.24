 LONDON, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene will join Derbyshire for the first half of 2008, the English county side said. The 30-year-old batsman will arrive before the end of April and stay at the club until mid-July, Derbyshire said on their Web site www.derbyshireccc.com. "Signing such a world-class player and current international captain is a massive boost for the club ahead of the 2008 season," Derbyshire chairman Don Amott said. Jayawardene is the second highest run-scorer in Sri Lankan test history and led the side to the World Cup final earlier this year
