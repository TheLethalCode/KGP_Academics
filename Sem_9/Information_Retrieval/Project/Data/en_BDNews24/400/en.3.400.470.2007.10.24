 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has welcomed the government's move to separate the judiciary. Presidium member Tofail Ahmed Wednesday said that the AL had taken initiatives to carve out a free judiciary. "We congratulate the government for separating the judiciary from Nov 1," he said after a meeting with the leaders of National Awami Party (NAP). The meeting was held as part of a series of meetings with the components in the 14-party alliance to thrash out strategy for electoral reforms talks with the Election Commission (EC). The AL has sat with four out of the six parties in the 14-party alliance that have been invited by the EC. The previous meeting was held on Oct 3 with the Samyabadi Dal. The EC has invited AL, Worker's Party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, NAP, Samyabadi Dal and Gonotontri Party of the 14-party alliance for dialogues. The AL leaders went to NAP chief Prof Mozaffar Ahmed's home at Segun Bagicha for the half-hour meeting that started at 11:30am. AL presidium member Matia Chowdhury, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, central AL leaders Abdul Mannan, Akhtaruzzaman and Latif Siddiqui were with Tofail at the meeting. NAP vice president Amina Ahmed, senior leader MA Gani and general secretary Enamul Haque accompanied Prof Mozaffar. Prof Mozaffar said he had nothing to say about their discussions with the AL. "A lot can be said if there is opposition. However, we are not opposing. We came to the 14-party alliance by our own consent. "And there is nothing to say about a unified proposal for free and fair polls from the 14-party. We will abide by the alliance's decision while we are in it. "From now all the talks will be on behalf of the 14-party alliance. This will be the base for the talks with the EC," he said. He said the EC's move to hold talks with the political parties was childish. "I don't want to make any comments on the Election Commission, they are all kids. His (chief election commissioner) move for dialogues is childish and he is taking three months for it. "The people suspect there's something else to it, whatever you and I think. The press is saying that it is done to prolong the election process." He said Gono Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain was with them. "He (Kamal) is appropriate for these matters. I would not have gone without him. I did not hear the EC inviting him. "However, now I will go to the EC if I have to. The talks will be based on the groundwork chalked out by the 14-party alliance," he said. Recalling Prof Mozaffar's role in '62, '66, '69 and '71, Tofail said, "We came here not only to discuss but also to pay our respect to him (Mozaffar) and to take suggestions from him in this situation. "We came here for his suggestions about our political intentions, especially about the talks with the EC." He said they had agreed that 14-party's base for the talks with the EC would be the one that detained party chief Sheikh Hasina had announced on electoral reforms on behalf of the alliance at the National Press Club. "The parties would sit for talks with EC based on the proposal of the 14-party alliance announced earlier," Tofail said. bdnew
