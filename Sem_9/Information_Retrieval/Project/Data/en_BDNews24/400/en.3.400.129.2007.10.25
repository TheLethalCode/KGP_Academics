<TITLE> Britain angers Cyprus over document on island </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus said it was reassessing its relationship with former colonial master Britain on Thursday after a British policy document called for closer links with the island's Turkish-held north. Greece, Cyprus's closest ally, also summoned Britain's ambassador to Athens to protest the wording in the document, part of a cooperation protocol signed between Britain and Turkey earlier this week. The island, an EU member since 2004, was partitioned in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek inspired coup. The breakaway Turkish north is recognised only by Ankara, while Cyprus's Greek Cypriot government is internationally recognised. The British-Turkey policy document contained a call to promote direct commercial, political and economic ties with northern Cyprus. Britain, Greece and Turkey are guarantor powers of Cypriot independence. "We view this as a statement which attempts to promote partition," Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou Marcoullis told Reuters. "When you have two guarrantor powers, Turkey and the United Kingdom, taking such a stand... you have to appreciate that we are, and we have to be, in a process of re-evaluating this relationship. This is a very serious issue." One newspaper called the protocol "British spite". In Athens, the Greek Foreign Ministry said it had called in ambassador Simon Gass to lodge a protest. "The meeting ... was a strong demarche from the Greek side," a source close to the meeting told Reuters. "The ambassador assured the Greek side London had not changed its stance on Cyprus and does not recognise any authority other than the Greek Cypriot government." Local media reported a possible response by the Cypriots would be to question the legal status of Britain's sprawling military facilities on the island. Marcoullis declined to speculate. Britain has kept two military bases on Cyprus since granting the east Mediterranean island independence in 1960. The compounds are supply posts for British operations in the Middle East. Talks aimed at reuniting the island have stalled since Greek Cypriots rejected a UN peace deal in a referendum in 2004. Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of it.
