 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Saqib Al Hasan Friday smashed the first century in the four-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League to put hosts Khulna in the driving seat against Chittagong on the first day. The hosts racked up 361 for seven in 90 overs at the close of Day 1 at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna.

Two fifties from national discards Khaled Mashud and Musfiqur Rahman took hosts Rajshahi to 187 for five at stumps against visitors Barisal at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. At Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra, holders Dhaka playing without Mohammad Ashraful made 227 for five in 90 overs against Sylhet. Fifties from Al Shariar Rokon and wicketkeeper Anwar Hossain helped Dhaka. Khulna vs Chittagong Put in to bat first, Khulna lost opener Nazmus Sadat (15) cheaply before Imrul Kayes and captain Habibul Bashar put on 40 runs for the second wicket. Ehsanul Haq bowled Bashar (22) and Saju Datta removed Kayes (52) but Tushar and Saqib belted the Chittagong bowlers all around the wicket to add 96 runs for the fourth wicket.

Mashud was 14 runs shorts to his century along with Anisur Rahman (0) when the bails were drawn for the day. Talha Jubair and Sajedul Islam took two wickets each for 34 and 43.
