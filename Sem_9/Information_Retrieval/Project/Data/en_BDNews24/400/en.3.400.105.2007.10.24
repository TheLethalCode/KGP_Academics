<TEXT>
 MULTAN, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leading Pakistan paceman Mohammad Asif is unlikely to play in the last two one-day internationals against South Africa as the national selectors are keen to give him a proper rest before next month's tour of India. Asif has missed the first three matches of the series due to an elbow injury after breaking down while bowling in the second test against South Africa earlier this month in Lahore. "He is not certain to play in the last two games because we need him in India for the tests and one-day internationals and he is a proven performer," chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed told Reuters on Wednesday. Pakistan, who lead South Africa 2-1 in the one-day series, are due to play three tests and five one-dayers on the India tour starting on Nov. 3. The hosts are also monitoring the fitness of left-arm spinner Abdul Rehman, who has played a vital role in his team's victories in the last two one-dayers against South Africa. A team official said Rehman was suffering from a groin problem and the player's availability for Thursday's match would be confirmed closer to the contest
