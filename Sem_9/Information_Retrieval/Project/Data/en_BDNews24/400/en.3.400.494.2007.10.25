 COPENHAGEN, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen stands to win a third term in a snap general election he has called for Nov. 13, a poll showed on Thursday. Rasmussen called the early election on Wednesday, 15 months ahead of a February 2009 deadline, launching a campaign he hopes to win on the back of tax cuts, a healthy economy and record-low unemployment. According to the Gallup poll, Rasmussen's Liberals would come out on top with 27.6 percent of the votes, followed by the leading opposition Social Democrats with 26.4 percent. The prime minister's Liberal-Conservative coalition and its anti-immigrant ally the Danish People's Party were seen taking 49.3 percent of the votes in all, versus 45.3 percent for the opposition. The poll, conducted among 1,285 people for daily Berlingske Tidende in the week to Oct. 23, showed the small opposition Red-Green Alliance under the 2 percent threshold needed to win seats in the chamber, boosting Rasmussen's advantage. A new centre party called the New Alliance was seen winning 3.8 percent, enough to secure seats in parliament but not enough to change the current balance of power. Rasmussen did not have to call a vote before early 2009. He swept to power in 2001 and won re-election in 2005 on the back of a crack-down on asylum-seekers and tax cuts.
