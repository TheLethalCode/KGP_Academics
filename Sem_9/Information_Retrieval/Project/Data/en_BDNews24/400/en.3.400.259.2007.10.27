Mediapro denied the debt existed and, taking advantage of the fact that it handles television production for many clubs, it increased the number of free live weekend matches it transmitted to three, undermining Sogecable's pay-TV operations. On Oct. 9, a judge ordered Mediapro to cut its broadcasts back to one live match a week as a precautionary measure while the dispute is settled by the courts.
