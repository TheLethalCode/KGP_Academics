 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Sunday marks the first anniversary of the violence that erupted between the Awami League-led 14-party alliance and four-party coalition headed by BNP on Oct 28, 2006 that left at least four dead. Leaders and workers from the two main political groupings took on each other on the streets of Dhaka on the eve of the day Khaleda Zia was due to relinquish power to the caretaker administration. Khaleda delayed the handover by one day following the troubles, which resulted in the deaths. The AL will observe the day as 'Mass Upsurge Day' for what they describe as an end to misrule from the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami alliance. The Workers' Party will commemorate the death of one of their members, Russel Ahmed Khan, who was killed by gunfire during the street battle. They have dubbed the day as "Shaheed Russel Day". The BNP has declined to mark the anniversary of the clashes, although last year a call went out to party activists to come to the capital carrying oars and sticks for what they then termed a "Day of Terror". Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said in a statement Saturday: "October 28, 2006 marks the end of misrule by the BNP and Jamaat alliance through a civil uprising." "On this day the 14-party alliance, led by the Awami League, called for a peaceful blockade throughout the country to demand free and fair elections." "During the peaceful blockade the BNP-Jaamat coalition made a ferocious attack on the people to destroy any democratic movement. In this way a brutal chapter in country's history began." Continued Zillur: "Today it has been proved that the BNP-Jamaat administration prepared a blueprint for returning to power through election engineering. This caused the bloody incidents of that day." Zillur asked the government to take steps against war criminals of 1971 as well as those involved in the killings that took place on Oct 28. The Workers' Party will hoist a black flag at their party office Sunday and don black badges to commemorate the death of Russel. bdnews24.co
