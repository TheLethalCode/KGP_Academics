<TITLE> Astronauts use robot arm for shuttle safety scan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HOUSTON, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Astronauts used a sensor-equipped robot arm to look for damage to space shuttle Discovery's heat shield on Wednesday as the orbiter headed toward a rendezvous with the International Space Station. They remotely maneuvered the arm to slowly scan the shuttle wings and nose in a now mandatory post-launch inspection begun after space shuttle Columbia broke apart while returning to Earth in 2003. The scan, which takes several hours, looks for any damage to the heat shield that might have occurred when Discovery hurtled into space from Florida on Tuesday. Data collected will be beamed back to Earth for study by NASA engineers. Columbia was doomed by a hole in its wing heat shield from a blow by fuel tank insulation foam that broke loose during takeoff. The damage was not detected and the shuttle was destroyed by the high heat of re-entry into the atmosphere, killing the seven astronauts on board. Loose tank foam has been a recurring problem on shuttle flights. NASA says it cannot be eliminated, but it has taken many steps to reduce the danger. Video of Tuesday's liftoff showed several pieces of insulation flying off the tank late in the ascent when debris strikes pose less danger because they occur with less force. Discovery is scheduled to link up with the space station on Thursday on a construction mission that sets the stage for the addition of European and Japanese laboratories to the space outpost. The shuttle is carrying the 24-feet-long Harmony, an Italian-built unit that will be installed on the station and to which Europe's Columbus and Japan's Kibo modules will be attached on space missions starting in December. Five spacewalks are planned during Discovery's 10-day stay. The mission's other major project is to reposition a solar power panel that has been in a temporary location awaiting this mission. The seven-member shuttle crew is led by retired U.S. Air Force Col. Pam Melroy. They will link up with a space station crew led by NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson. Discovery, scheduled to return to Earth on Nov. 6, is making the third of four planned shuttle flights this year. NASA is trying to finish the $100 billion space station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 20
