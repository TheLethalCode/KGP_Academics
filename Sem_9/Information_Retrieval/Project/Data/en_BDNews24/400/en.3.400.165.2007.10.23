 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh football team leave here for Tajikistan Wednesday morning to play their World Cup pre-qualifying away round against Tajikistan with hopes of a good performance. Bangladesh, that played a 1-1 draw against the Central Asian country at home, are scheduled to take on Tajikistan on October 28. Though Bangladesh had disclosed their wish before the home match and succeeded in their match plan, this time they plan to perform better rather than winning or drawing the match. "I believe the Bangladesh boys will fight like lions in Tajikistan," coach Syed Nayeemuddin told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "The key inspiration of the side is to fight for triumph from the beginning to the end," Nayeemuddin said, "It is not that Tajikistan are very good opponents and an invincible side." "We proved it in the home match and it is possible to get good results against them," said the Indian coach. Bangladesh, however, will miss the services of central defender Nazrul Islam, who pulled himself out of the Tajikistan-bound squad, citing personal grounds. "Nothing stops for anybody. Someone from Arif (Islam), (Amit) Shuvro to Mahmudul Hasan will fill up the gap, and I believe they will not under-perform in the match," said Nayeemuddin. It's learnt that the Tajikistan tie might be the last assignment for Nayeemuddin as a few Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) officials want to see the Indian coach off. The BFF officials, however, said that Nayeemuddin's future would depend on the success of the Tajikistan game. bdn
