<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi won their first-round one-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea 9th National Cricket League Tuesday. Tamim Iqbal blazed to a 92-ball 133 to power Chittagong to a convincing eight-wicket win over hosts Barisal, who beat the visitors Chittagong in the first-round four-dayer Monday. Chittagong raced to 225 for two in 36 overs in reply to Barisal's moderate 224 all out in 49.3 overs at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Syed Rasel and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza shared eight wickets to give Khulna an easy 39-run win over hosts Dhaka at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, where the four-dayer between the rivals ended in an exciting draw the previous day. Khulna bowled Dhaka out for 201 in 44.5 overs after posting a challenging 240 for eight in 50 overs. After an emphatic win over visitors Sylhet in the four-dayer, hosts Rajshahi registered a hard-fought two-wicket win over the same rivals in their first one-dayer, riding on national discard Mushfiqur Rahim's half-century. Last year's one-day runners-up Rajshahi reached home making 169 for eight in 48 overs after restricting Sylhet to 168 for nine in 50 overs at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Chittagong vs Barisal Put in to bat first, Barisal were reeling at 48 for four inside 15 overs, but Raisul Islam anchored the innings to safety. He put on 80 runs for the fifth wicket with Abul Bashar (42) and added another 78 runs for the sixth wicket with Arafat Salahuddin (41). Raisul made 70 off 89 balls featuring four fours before being stumped by Dhiman Ghosh off Saju Datta to leave his side at 206 for six. Left-arm spinner Elias Sunny grabbed four wickets in a row to wrap up Barisal innings at 224 all out. Sunny conceded 36 runs in 7.3 overs. Chittagong started their reply at a brisk pace to reach 54 in 5.3 overs after losing opener Gazi Salahuddin (1). His opening partner Tamim Iqbal along with his elder brother Nafis Iqbal put on 146 runs for the second wicket before Tamim was stumped by keeper Shaheen Hossain off Tariqul Islam. Tamim's 133-run innings was studded with 15 fours. Nafis and Nazimuddin remained unbeaten on 56 and 19 to take the side home. Khulna vs Dhaka Khulna got over a slow start to put on a challenging total after deciding to bat first on a slow outfield. Opener Imrul Kayes (71), Saqib Al Hasan (56) and Mashrafee (35) took Khulna to near 250-mark, but Habibul Bashar (17), Tushar Imran (4) and Abdur Razzak (0) failed to put the finishing touches. Kayes hit two sixes and three fours in his 121-ball knock. Saqib hammered five boundaries facing 51 balls and Mashrafee smashed M Rafique twice for sixes in his 25-ball knock. Dhaka, in reply, faced a big blow losing openers Al Shahriar (1), Javed Omar (3) and Mohammad Ashraful (1) for 13 as Syed Rasel removed both openers and Mashrafee trapped Ashraful lbw. However, Mosharraf Hossain Rubel and Mahmuddullah Riad raised hopes for Dhaka in a fourth-wicket partnership. Rubel's dismissal slowed down Dhaka runs and they were eventually bundled out with 5.1 overs left. Rubel and Riad put on 101 runs before Rubel swept Abdur Razzak to Saqib at short fine leg, leaving the side to 161 for five. After the new ball was taken in the 35th over, Mashrafee removed two Dhaka batsmen in the 38th and 40th over. Syed Rasel then dismissed Mohammad Rafique (7) and Mohammad Sharif (0) in the 42nd over before Riad was run out for 65 off 74 balls. Joint man of the match Rasel returned with five for 35 while Mashrafee took three wickets conceding as many runs. Rajshahi vs Sylhet Deciding to bat first, Sylhet never recovered after they were in tatters at 48 for five. Sharifullah topscored with 56 off 90 balls and put on 77 runs for the sixth wicket with Saif Mahmud, who scored a 71-ball 30. Farhad Reza, Saqlaine Sajib and Mohammad Shahazada each took two wickets giving away 23, 29 and 37 runs. Rajshahi also got off to a horrible start having been reduced to 36 for three, but middle-order batsmen Nayeem Islam (24) and Anisur Rahman (22) steadied the innings. At one stage, Rajshahi were 98 for eight, but Mushfiqur Rahman and Shahazada took their side home remaining unbeaten on 50 and 35. Saif returned figures of 3/36 and Rezaul Haque 2/42 for Sylhet. b
