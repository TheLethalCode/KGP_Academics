 GAZA, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops killed two Palestinian gunmen in separate clashes in the Gaza Strip on Friday, Palestinian sources said. The Islamist Hamas movement, which controls the coastal territory, said one of its fighters was killed in northern Gaza and Islamic Jihad militants said a gunman killed near the southern town of Khan Younis belonged to their group. An Israeli army spokesman said troops had clashed with Palestinian militants in what he described as two routine operations. Palestinian militant sources said Israeli troops, accompanied by tanks and helicopter gunships, had thrust 1 km (0.6 miles) into the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops frequently conduct raids into Gaza in an effort to prevent Palestinian militants from firing short-range rockets into southern Israel.
