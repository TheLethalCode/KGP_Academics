 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion Friday arrested top Dhanmondi area criminal Nazimuddin Babu and an associate and seized their weapons. A RAB-2 team arrested Babu in Khilgaon Thursday evening. Babu was presented at a press conference at RAB-3 headquarters in Tikatuli at Friday noon after interrogation. Babu is the president of the Dhanmondi thana Chhatra League and claimed to be a relative of crime boss Pichchi Hannan who is a wanted criminal. The government has announced reward for information leading to Hannan's arrest. RAB said Babu disclosed sensational information about violence in the Dhanmondi area following incidents on Dhaka University campus on Aug 20. RAB-3 commander Wing Commander Sultan Muhammad Nurani said RAB officials arrested Babu at a house at Sipahibagh in Khilgaon Thursday evening. Babu told interrogators that his criminal gang controlled the Dhanmondi area in collaboration with Rumi, Saiman, Mamun and Dhali Babu. Rumi was arrested in a raid on the Kathalbagan area Thursday night, following a tip-off from Babu. Later, following Babu and Rumi's confessional statements, RAB raided the house of their accomplice Swapan and recovered a foreign pistol with two rounds of bullets. The RAB commander said Babu confessed to his involvement in the killing of Sagar of Panthapath, Pintu in front of Dhaka College, notorious Green Road area muggers Sekendar and Laiakat, and Rupak and Halim of Crescent Road. Babu said he and his accomplices set fire to 4 or 5 vehicles on the main road under Dhanmondi Police Station following the incidents at Dhaka University in August, under orders from Chhatra League high-ups. The RAB commander said Babu used to collect Tk 80,000 every month in extortion money from garment factories in Dhanmondi area. He used credit cards with three different banks to transact the extortion money, RAB officials said. Babu told journalists, "After the Dhaka University incident we were directed by higher-ups through Dhaka City Chhatra League president Anu to bring out processions. I along with Saimon, Mamun, Rumi, Dhali Babu and Anu brought out processions." "Local leaders and workers of the BNP, under the orders of the party high command, participated in our procession," Babu added. The RAB commander said, "During the interrogation Babu disclosed sensitive information including the names of his godfathers. But that cannot be disclosed until further investigations are completed." "You will be informed in detail after they give confessional statements in the court." In a separate raid, a RAB-3 team rescued an abducted boy named Amit Hasan Khan Raja, 13), and arrested three of his abductors. The arrestees are Md Atiqul Islam Chunnu, 35, Md Tuhin, 20, and Md Sabbir Ahmed, 20. Raja was kidnapped from in front of his Rampura house on Oct 21. bdnews24
