 LOS ANGELES, Friday Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lawyers for Britney Spears and ex-husband Kevin Federline returned to court on Friday in the bitter custody battle over the celebrities' two sons that is expected to yield information on whether Spears has complied with random drug tests. In a morning session, lawyers for Spears, the pop singer who rose to stardom on the Disney Channel, and Federline sparred over whether Spears' planned deposition would be videotaped. A court official ruled it would not. Spears' attorney, Thomas Paine Dunlap, argued that if it were, the tape inevitably would be leaked to the media and infringe her privacy. "If something exists, there is a great likelihood it will get out," Dunlap told the Commissioner. Federline's lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, said videotaped depositions yielded information such as body language and voice inflection that was just as important as words. In the end, Court Commissioner Scott Gordon sided with Dunlap. Spears and Federline have been ordered to appear in person in family court on Friday afternoon when Gordon is expected to hear updates on whether the parents have complied with previous orders dealing with counseling and, in Spears' case, random drug tests. Spears, 25, and Federline, 29, split up a year ago. For months they have waged a custody war over Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1, as Spears' life slipped out of control. She has spent time in drug and alcohol rehab, clashed with paparazzi and become the fodder for numerous jokes after being photographed in public without wearing her underwear. On Thursday, a judge dismissed an automobile hit-and-run case against her after she settled with the owner of a car she hit, and she pleaded not guilty to a lesser charge of driving without a license. But her singing career appears to be rebounding with a recent single, "Gimme More," topping digital download charts and a new album, "Blackout," set for release on October 30. Still, Commissioner Gordon in recent weeks has yanked visitation rights from Spears only to reinstate them after she complied with his rulings. Gordon has ordered both parents to seek counseling and hire a parenting coach. He has told Spears she must submit to random drug testing twice a week. bd
