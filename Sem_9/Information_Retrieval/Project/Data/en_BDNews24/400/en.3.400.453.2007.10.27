<TITLE> Bangladesh face Tajikistan Sunday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will yearn for a triumph against Tajikistan in their away match of the FIFA World Cup pre-qualifying round in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, Sunday. A win against Tajikistan would throw Bangladesh directly into the qualifying round getting it six more matches to play. Besides, if Bangladesh are able to hold the hosts to a 2-2 draw Sunday, they would be thrown into the qualifying round on goal tally. Bangladesh has never tamed Tajikistan in the four matches played so far. However, Bangladesh got a 1-1 draw in their home match on October 8. Before leaving here for Dushanbe, Bangladesh coach Syed Nayeemuddin said that his boys would try to put up a better show against Tajikistan. Bangladesh apparently dominated Tajikistan in the home match and unfortunately drew against them after conceding a last moment goal from a penalty shot. However, Bangladesh will certainly miss the services of central defender Nazrul Islam, who pulled out of camp at the fag end.
