<TITLE> No risk of Serbs 'turning to Russia' over Kosovo </TITLE>

 ANKARA, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears that Serbia may turn away from its European Union membership goal for a closer alliance with Russia are unfounded, Serb Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said. "Russia has been an ally of Serbia for generations and is a close economic partner. Having said that, Serbia's goal is EU membership. Serbia is a European nation and it belongs to the European family," he told Reuters late on Thursday. Russia backs Serbia in opposing the independence of its southern province of Kosovo, under United Nations rule for the past eight years, while the West favours granting statehood to the territory's 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority. Jeremic said he hoped the Kosovo Albanians would be persuaded at talks due to end on Dec. 10 to accept wide autonomy rather than declare independence from Serbia. But he denied Serbia's future direction hangs on the fate of Kosovo, and said a national ballot in December would confirm that Serbs see their future as members of the EU and NATO, not as a satellite of Russia, as some Serb hardliners advocate. bdnews24.com/lq/1956hrs "We have a presidential election in December and it is important to choose a pro-EU path," said Jeremic, an ally of Serbia's pro-Western President Boris Tadic, who is seeking a second term as head of state. "It will be like a referendum." UNEASY COALITION Tadic's Democratic Party sits in uneasy coalition with the much more nationalist party of Prime Minister Vojilsav Kostunica, whose rhetoric over Kosovo has been increasingly anti-Western. Kostunica rules out joining NATO and some party officials have suggested Serbia would drop the goal of EU membership if the West backs independence for Kosovo. Belgrade daily Politika said on Friday the coalition was on the verge of breaking up over the date of the presidential poll, which has not yet been agreed. Tadic wants the election before the deadline for Kosovo talks expires on Dec. 10, while Kostunica wants a vote next spring. Mediators from the United States, Russia and the European Union began a fresh round of talks on Kosovo in August seeking to bridge the gap between the Serb offer of broad autonomy and the Albanian demand for full independence. "Serbia is absolutely ready to make concessions to make progress before Dec. 10," Jeremic said, but gave no details. Jeremic warned that if Kosovo's Albanians declare independence and win recognition it would be a dangerous precedent for secessionist movements around the world. "Once this proceeds, many other deep ethnic tensions beyond the Balkans will exacerbated. We should work as an international community against any kind of unilateral action," he said, mentioning Turkey's Kurds, Georgia's South Ossetia and others. The United States and most EU countries are expected to recognise independence for Kosovo under European Union supervision if the talks fail to achieve a compromise, but half a dozen EU members are opposed and some seem ambivalent. Serbia has focused its diplomatic efforts on raising doubts among the 27 EU members and sowing division between Brussels
