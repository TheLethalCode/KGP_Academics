<TITLE> Grameenphone's earnings drop in third quarter </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone has added 1.17 million new customers during the previous third quarter (July-September), and celebrated the crossing of the 15 million clientele mark. But intense competition, mainly from Banglalink, coupled with regulatory penalty has impacted its quarterly balance sheet. The largest mobile phone operator's quarterly market share dropped from 60 percent in the second quarter to 59 percent. The company's new CEO attributed the fall mainly to competition. "Bangladesh is a highly competitive market and it is expected to see such variations between the quarters," Grameenphone's CEO Anders Jensen told bdnews24.com Thursday. "The growth is very promising for the market in general and for GP in particular. We expect to maintain a healthy market share." Jensen said, "[GP] had a very successful Eid sales campaign bundled with Nokia handsets and this is also quite promising for the future." However, in October the regulator penalised GP Tk168.40 crore, "for revenues lost due to the use of Grameenphone subscriptions by some customers to illegally transfer international calls," the company declared Thursday in its third quarter statement. The penalty constitutes 12.50 percent of GP's total quarterly earning. As a result its operating profit nosedived by 77 percent, causing an 80 percent sequential drop in its operating margin. Jensen said: "The margin pressure is due to the competitive situation in the market." He is confident of being "more competitive to face such pressure in future." The company's revenue from subscription and calls was also down slightly  about 0.3 per cent. Depreciation and amortisation rose by 11 percent due to increased capital expenditure. Higher capital expenditure was up as the company had to spend on network expansion necessitated by subscription growth. Grameenphone secured ninth position among the top 10 Asia Pacific operators in terms of annual customer intake ending June 2006. The operator is clearly facing challenges to remain in the regional hall of fame. Its will be also a mammoth task for GP's new boss to lift the operating profit as well as keeping the investor's confidence high.
