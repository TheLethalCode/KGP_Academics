<TITLE> Govt will decide on polls fate of politicians charged: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Communications adviser MA Matin Wednesday said the government would think about whether to let politicians facing various charges run national polls if their trial was not complete before its term. He said caretaker administration would make its best efforts to try political leaders facing charges before the next elections. "We'll take a timely decision about that in line with the law," Matin told reporters at a news briefing after a meeting of the national coordination committee of the taskforce on serious crimes. "We'll try to end all trials before December 2008," said Matin, who heads the committee, as the government had earlier announced to hold national elections before the end of next year. He said more courts and manpower were required to complete all the cases. "If this government fails to end all trials the next government will deal with them. Because it's a continuous process," he said. Matin said 62 taskforces had been investigating corruption charges. "The number of taskforces would be increased. The number of courts to deal with such cases would also see a rise," he said. The government recently published a list of 50 corruption suspects out of 80 in its latest effort to clamp down on corruption. Asked when the names of the rest would be released, Matin said charges against the rest were being scrutinised. "The whole list will come out once primary investigations into the allegations are complete," he said. "None of the 80 suspects would be spared." Detailing the work of the taskforce, the adviser said it had already reviewed 573 allegations, of which 44 cases had been settled. Currently, 59 cases among 131 are on trial. bdnews24.co
