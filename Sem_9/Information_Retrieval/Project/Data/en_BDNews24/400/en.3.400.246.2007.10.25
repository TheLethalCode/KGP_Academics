 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Members of the Rapid Action Battalion have arrested four people, including two women, for their alleged involvement with yaba trade in Dhaka, a battalion official said Wednesday. The arrests were made early Wednesday in separate raids when the crime busters recovered 425 yaba tablets and Tk 4000 from the detainees' possession, said Rab-1 Major Mohammad Saiful Islam Chowdhury. Tipped-off, the officials posed as yaba buyers from one of the detainees, Anisur Rahman, in the city's Uttar Badda area. The officials told him they were interested to buy a large number of tablets from him. Fooled by the officials Anisur took them to a house in the area where they met two of the other detainees, Baby and Al Amin, who were then arrested. The RAB officials conducted a thorough search of the house and seized the tablets. On the basis of confessions of the three, they later arrested another woman, Prema, from a nearby house. The officials produced the detainees before reporters at a media briefing Wednesday where the suspects narrated their background. Baby said she resided in the house with her husband Waliur Rahman, whom the officials said was the leader of the gang. Prema used to ferry the tablets collecting them from Waliur. Major Saiful said they could not arrest Waliur since he fled the scene, sensing their presence during the raid. He said RAB were trying to determine their links with other gangs of yaba dealers. In particular, he said, they were interrogating the four suspects to know if they had any link with six young men who were arrested earlier in the week in the city's Gulshan/Banani area. He said they would be able to know details about the source of the drugs if they could arrest Waliur.
