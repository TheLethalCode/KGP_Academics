 WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - US sales of previously owned homes fell 8.0 percent in September to a record low 5.04 million unit pace amid troubles in the subprime mortgage and credit markets, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday. It was the lowest sales pace since the group began tracking both single-family and condo sales jointly in 1999. Total existing home sales, which include condominiums, fell in September from a downwardly revised pace of 5.48 million in August.

Single-family home sales fell 8.6 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 4.38 million-unit pace from 4.79 million, which was the slowest pace in nearly 10 years. The national median existing home price for both single-family and condos dropped 4.2 percent from a year ago to $211,7
