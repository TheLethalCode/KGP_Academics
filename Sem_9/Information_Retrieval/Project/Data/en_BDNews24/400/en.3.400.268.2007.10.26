 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA) Friday demanded the immediate release of four detained teachers and the withdrawal of cases filed against teachers and students of the university. DUTA acting president and dean of the science faculty Prof Tajmeri SA Islam told journalists that there was apprehension that the situation might become unstable if the teachers were not released. She said, "We do not want that kind of situation." She said university teachers have decided to go to classes from Sunday to "uphold the reputation" of Dhaka University and because they were "thinking about the future of the students." The teachers, however, demanded the release of their colleagues to avoid trouble on campus. Earlier this week two delegations of teachers met with vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz and demanded the release of the detained teachers. bdne
