<TEXT>
 NEW YORK (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's memoirs will be published in Britain and the United States by Random House Inc., the world's biggest book publisher said on Thursday. "I hope my memoirs will provide a serious and thoughtful, but also entertaining, reflection on my time as a member of Parliament and as prime minister," Blair, 54, who stepped down in June after 10 years as prime minister, said in a statement. Random House Inc., a unit of German media group Bertelsmann, said the book would be published in Britain by Hutchinson and in the United States and Canada by Alfred A. Knopf. A publication date has not been set and the terms of the deal were not disclosed. Blair is now the Middle East envoy for the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia. His task is to raise aid for the Palestinians, seek to build their ruling institutions and promote their economic development. "Tony Blair is one of the most significant world leaders of the modern era," said Sonny Mehta, chairman and editor-in-chief at Knopf. "He has a remarkable story to tell." "His tenure as prime minister was marked by close relationships with Presidents (Bill) Clinton and George W. Bush, and he enjoys a profile in this country that is rare among foreign leaders," he said. bd
