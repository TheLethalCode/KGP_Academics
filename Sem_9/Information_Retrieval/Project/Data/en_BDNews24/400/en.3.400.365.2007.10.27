<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Saturday approved in principle giving specific judicial powers to executive magistrates under the proposed Mobile Court Ordinance 2007. A final approval is expected Sunday. "There was earlier no ordinance for conducting mobile courts. This is the first time a Mobile Court Ordinance is being formulated," chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said to reporters after the meeting. "There are some jobs like imposing section 144, conducting mobile courts, and inspecting examination centres that will be performed by executive magistrates." "If persons charged in the executive magistrate's court confess to their crimes, the executive magistrate can award a three-month jail term or a monetary fine. "But the law secretary has been directed to determine whether the police will accompany the magistrate if the persons concerned do not confess to a crime." Munaim said the law secretary would discuss the matter further at Sunday's cabinet meeting. The decision to allow executive magistrates to retain some judicial powers follows a meeting of the leaders of the Administration Cadre Association with the law adviser. The association asked the government to grant some judicial power to administrative magistrates. The council of advisers decided to repatriate the remains of Bir Shrestha Shahid Sipahi Hamidur Rahman from the Indian state of Tripura before Dec 16. A Bangladeshi team identified the grave of Shahid Bir Shrestha Sipahi Hamidur Rahman in East Raipur village, Ambasha sub-division, Tripura. The government will request the Indian authorities for permission to bring Shahid Bir Shrestha Sipahi Hamidur Rahman's remains back. The meeting decided that the remains would be buried with state honours next to the grave of Shahid Bir Shrestha Flight Lt Motiur Rahman. The cabinet asked the communications ministry to amend the coordinated multidimensional transport policy and asked it to table it again. The advisors discussed essentials prices and fertiliser stocks, and decided that the press would regularly be briefed on the price of essentials and the status of fertiliser stocks. bdnews24.com
