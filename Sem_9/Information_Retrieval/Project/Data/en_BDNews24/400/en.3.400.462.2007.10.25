 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board Thursday announced a cut in NWD call charges from Nov 1. A BTTB press statement said NWD calls would now cost Tk 1.50 per minute with a fixed pulse every 30 seconds. Charges for other services have also been decreased, the state-run telecom operator said. It said NWD calls would cost 75 paisa for each 30 second pulse. That translates into an NWD call rate of Tk 1.50 per minute irrespective of peak or off-peak hours. The whole country will be considered one zone. The release said peak hours for local calls would remain unchanged from 8am to 8pm with off-peak hours from 8pm to 8am. In multi-exchange and divisional towns, peak hour local calls will be of five minutes' duration and of eight minutes' duration at off peak hours. Monthly line rents have been set at Tk 80 for the Dhaka-Chittagong multi-exchange area, Tk 70 at divisional and districts and Tk 50 at the upazilas. bdnews2
