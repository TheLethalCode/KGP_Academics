<TITLE> Colombia says rebel leader, 17 more killed in attack </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BOGOTA, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian troops killed a top guerrilla commander in a fight at his camp, delivering another major blow to the leadership of the country's largest rebel group, authorities said on Thursday. The guerrilla commander known as Martin Caballero and at least 17 other fighters were killed during a military attack on his base near the Caribbean coast, Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. The strike hits at the structure of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which has been weakened by President Alvaro Uribe's US-backed security crackdown against Latin America's longest-running guerrilla insurgency. In September, authorities said Tomas Medina, known as "Black Acacio" and a senior figure purportedly involved in drugs and arms smuggling for the FARC, was killed with 16 other guerrillas in a bombardment of his jungle camp. Under Uribe, Colombia's armed forces have driven the FARC back into the jungles. Violence, bombings and kidnappings from the 40-year conflict have eased, but the rebels are still a potent force in remote rural areas.
