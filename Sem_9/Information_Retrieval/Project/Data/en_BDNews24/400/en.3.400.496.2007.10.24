 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The benchmark index DGEN on the Dhaka Stock Exchange slipped on profit-taking on a volatile Wednesday amid both buying and selling pressure. The index lost about 50 points within half an hour of opening on selling pressure for profit-taking, after merchant banks moved to comply with a regulatory tightening of margin loan rules. The DGEN recovered losses in midday trade amid speculative buying, but slumped later as profit takers moved to lock in gains. "The market has shown its resilience even after merchant banks moved to stop extending loans of more than 100 percent margin. It reflects that investors still had interest to buy," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance. "It appears that there is an in-built strength in the market. Both the buying and selling pressure was effective," said Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst. The DGEN or general index slipped 17.27 points or 0.60 percent to 2856.51. The DSI or all-share price index closed almost flat at 2427.81, up 1.46 points or 0.06 percent. The DSE-20 blue chip index slumped 26.79 points or 1.21 percent to 2181.09.

Of the issues traded, 100 gained, 105 declined and 18 held steady. Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion in funds, said the market was volatile. "But it was not unwarranted," he said. "Profit takers were active in the morning session. Speculators and bargain hunters dominated the remaining part of the day," said Yawer Sayeed. Trust Bank led the losses in banking stocks dipping 2.09 percent to Tk 1130.75 on profit-taking. BRAC Bank slipped for the second day on profit taking, losing 1.17 percent to Tk 1507.75. AB Bank also declined. Rumours of bonus shares drove Social Investment Bank, the third most active issue, to surge 17.70 percent to Tk 425.5. Power stocks closed mixed. Speculation of attractive dividends pulled DESCO 8.12 percent up to Tk 1327.25. Summit Power also recovered from losses. Mutual funds gained.
