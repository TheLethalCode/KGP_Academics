 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday ordered arrest of Sheikh Rehana, younger sister of detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, in an extortion case. Magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's (CMM) Court for Dhaka issued the warrant of arrest at 11:15am after accepting the charge sheet in the case. He also ordered authorities to attach all her movable property. The court set Nov 11 for the next hearing of the extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited, on June 13. Rehana lives in England. The police on July 24 pressed extortion charges against Hasina, Rehana and their cousin and AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque filed the chargesheet with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka in the Tk 3 crore case. Azam filed the case against Hasina and Selim, but Rehana was implicated in it later by the investigating officer of the case. During hearing on the charges, a heated debate erupted between police sub-inspector Babul Mia and lawyers for the accused. A writ petition was filed in the High Court challenging the authorities taking the case under the emergency powers rules. The High Court stayed the case and granted bail to Hasina. The Supreme Court however overturned the judgment and ordered the High Court to dispose of the case within the shortest possible time. bdnews2
