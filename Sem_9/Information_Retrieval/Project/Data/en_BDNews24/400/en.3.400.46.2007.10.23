<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com) A senior lawyer Tuesday served a legal notice on five leading administration officials including the Bangladesh Administrative Services Association president Moniruzzaman Khan and Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Rokanuddowla, for what he said was contempt of court. ZI Khan Panna, who was a member of Bangladesh Bar Council executive committee, also asked the five to make a public apology to the chief justice, through the media, within the next 24 hours. The three who were given legal notice in addition to Khan and Rokanuddowla are Dhaka district magistrate and deputy commissioner Mohammad Kamal Uddin, Biman Bangladesh Airlines managing director MA Momen and project director of the women and children affairs ministry Abul Hossain. Unless the public apology was made, contempt of court cases would be filed against the five officials for holding a meeting Sunday in which they demanded a halt to a Supreme Court verdict ordering separation of the judiciary. They are also accused of contempt of court for calling the Supreme Court an "NGO". "Mr Rokanuddowla not only called for suspending all the activities but also remarked that [it was] as if the court has become an NGO," said lawyer Md Asaduzzaman in the notice served on behalf of Panna. "All others provoked, instigated and supported him in showing dishonour, disrespect and disregard to the court." The remarks and steps have been made by the five officials to tarnish the "fame and image" of the Supreme Court, the notice alleged. "For which, all are liable to prosecution in accordance with the law." "We would like to call upon you (officials) to stop any kind of further step to show disrespect and disregard to the order of the Supreme Court. The lawyer asserted that failure to comply with the notice would prompt his "client to make a contempt of court petition". bdnews24.com/at
