 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has decided to postpone the football camp from Friday if it gets no response from the authority of the Grand Royal Challenge Cup Thursday night. "We have decided to postpone the booters' camp for the Grand Royal Challenge Cup on Friday if we get no response till Thursday night," BFF acting general secretary Mazoor Hossain Malu told bdnews24.com. Some 14 Under-23 footballers have been training under the supervision of local coach Golam Jilani at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. Besides, some national booters are to join the Under-23 squad after the World Cup pre-qualifier match against Tajikistan on October 28. The six-nation Under-23 tournament is scheduled for November 1-7 in Myanmar, but uncertainty looms over holding the tournament following anti-government protests last September in that country. "Till Tuesday, we mailed the authority concerned thrice to know about the tournament, following the protests, but we have still not gotten any response from them," said Malu.
