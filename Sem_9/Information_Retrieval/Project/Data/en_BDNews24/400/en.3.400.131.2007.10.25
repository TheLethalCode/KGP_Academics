 MULTAN, Pakistan, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paceman Shoaib Akhtar is set to earn selection by Pakistan on Friday for their tour of India having completed a 13-match suspension. "Shoaib has bowled impressively in a domestic first class game and unless something dramatic happens he is inked into our list of 15 players for India," a national selector told Reuters on Thursday. The fast bowler's ban for misconduct ends after Pakistan's fourth one-day international against South Africa in Multan and he becomes eligible for the fifth and final game in Lahore on Monday. Pakistan, who will name their squad for the first half of the tour on Friday, will play five one-day internationals in early November in India before three tests in New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangalore. "Mohammad Asif is also cleared for the tour," the selector said. Paceman Asif has struggled with an elbow injury and missed the first three one-day internationals against South Africa. Shoaib, Pakistan's most senior bowler, has played only one test and four one-dayers since February 2006 due to fitness problems and disciplinary issues. "He looked a bit rusty but was good in his strides and is keen to make a comeback for the Indian tour," the selector said
