 MAFRA, Portugal, Fri Oct 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin sparred with European Union leaders on Friday over EU plans to limit foreign investment in its energy markets and Russia's stalled bid to join the World Trade Organization. One EU source called the talks "tough, frank" and described the players as "still trying to make each other hear the other." Putin, in his final EU summit as president, took a swipe at proposals from Brussels that could prevent gas monopoly Gazprom from buying up power grids and pipelines while the 27-nation bloc revamps its gas and electricity markets. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso denied the draft laws would discriminate against Moscow and said Russian companies must play by the same rules as anyone else. Putin said European investment in his country far outstripped Russian investment in Europe. "When we hear from some European capitals that 'the Russians are coming with their horrible money to buy everything', that makes me laugh," Putin told EU officials, including Barroso and Socrates, at the one-day meeting. "A total sum of European investment in Russia is 30 billion euros ($43 billion). I don't know whether it is big or not, but Russian investment in the European Union is 10-fold lower, just 3 billion euros." Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, whose country holds the bloc's rotating presidency, pleaded for a smooth relationship between the EU and its biggest gas supplier. "Politicians have to know how to respond to current uncertainties and tensions in the world. Nothing would contribute more to peace in the world than a good, stable and lasting relationship between the EU and Russia," he said. ECONOMIC TIES, POLITICAL TENSION Russia is the bloc's third biggest trading partner after the United States and China. "There are two trends: economic ties go up, while political ties go down," Anatoly Chubais, head of Russian electricity grid RAO UES, told reporters after EU and Russian businesses leaders met Putin and the top European officials. He said Russian investment in the EU was comparable or near European investment in Russia, contradicting Putin's assessment. A dispute over Russia's ban on the import of Polish meat has stopped the EU and Russia starting talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) to replace one which expires in December. "The new PCA is one of the acute problems... I expect talks on the new treaty will start in the near future," Putin said. Russian officials say they hope a new government in Poland, following an election, could become friendlier to Moscow. Brussels and Moscow are also haggling over other trade issues, including Russia's export duties on timber, which the EU wants resolved before blessing Moscow's entry into the WTO. Political issues to be discussed include Iran and Kosovo. Moscow has said it will not support independence for the breakaway Serbian province unless it is agreed by Belgrade. Brussels fears that if UN-sponsored talks fail before a December 10 deadline Kosovo will declare independence unilateral
