 Khulna, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  RAB in overnight raids on several factories near a depot of the state-owned Padma Oil Company seized about 10 lakh litres of adulterated furnace oil, an official said Friday. In the raids on the city's Khalishpur for about 14 hours the crime-busters unearthed six tanks full of adulterated furnace oil, said RAB commanding officer Meftaul Karim. He put the price of the seized furnace oil at about Tk 2.40 crore. The officials also arrested three people for their alleged involvement with the rogue trade. The factories were sealed off in presence of a magistrate. According to investigators, hundreds of barrels of adulterated furnace oil have been supplied to different parts of the country from these factories every day. They said such factories had been set up in violation of the rules since law does not permit any such establishment within one square kilometre of a state-owned oil depot or a residential area. bdnews24.
