<TITLE> US space shuttle Discovery blasts off from Florida </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US space shuttle Discovery blasted off atop a cloud of smoke on Tuesday, soaring above Florida marshlands toward a rendezvous in two days with the International Space Station. Discovery's 14-day mission kicks off a two-month refurbishment of the $100 billion outpost that prepares the way for Europe's first permanent laboratory in orbit. The shuttle roared through a partly cloudy sky at 11:38 a.m. EDT (1538 GMT), defying predictions by meteorologists that clouds and rain could force a delay. A buildup of ice on the external fuel tank, which could have fallen off and hit the shuttle, was ruled out as a threat by NASA engineers. Cameras showed a lot of debris coming off once the shuttle reached space, where there is little chance of it resulting in serious damage. "I'd like to wish you good luck, Godspeed and have a little fun up there," launch director Mike Leinbach told the crew shortly before liftoff. Seconds after the launch Discovery disappeared into the clouds and accelerated toward a top speed of 17,500 mph (28,400 km per hour) once in orbit. During the flight, astronauts will install a new module called Harmony on the space station that will anchor the long-awaited Columbus laboratory, the European Space Agency's main contribution to the project. A woman was at the helm of the shuttle for only the second time in NASA's history. Retired Air Force Col. Pamela Melroy heads a five-man, two-woman crew. "We are ready to take Harmony to her new home," Melroy said minutes before launch. The shuttle Atlantis will take the Columbus laboratory into orbit on Dec. 6, five years behind schedule. Columbus has already cost the European Space Agency 5 billion euros ($7.08 billion) with another 4 billion euros ($5.66 billion) to come. The astronauts also will move a huge pair of solar panels to a new location on the station's backbone, a daunting task that will push the station's robotic crane to its limit. Once Discovery departs the station, the Harmony module must be moved to a temporary location before Atlantis's arrival with the Columbus lab because the shuttle's docking port is located where Harmony will be positioned. Five spacewalks are planned during Discovery's flight, including one devoted to testing a technique to repair the shuttle's heat shield in orbit.
