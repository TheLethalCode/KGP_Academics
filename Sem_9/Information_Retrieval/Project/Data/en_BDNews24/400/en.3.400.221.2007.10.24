<TEXT>
 New York, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Sajeeb Wazed Joy has said he sought an explanation from General Moeen U Ahmed on the detention of his mother Sheikh Hasina "without trial". The former prime minister's son ran into the army chief at lunch after a seminar at Harvard University in the US Tuesday. In an interview with private TV station Channel i Wednesday, Sajeeb said he had asked Moeen why many including Hasina have been detained in jail "without trial". Hasina's son, who was a student of Harvard University, quoted Moeen as saying: "It is completely beyond our jurisdiction. The Anticorruption Commission is looking into the matter." "However I will be very happy if your mother gets released after being proved innocent," Moeen was quoted to have told Sajeeb. "It was not a formal meeting. There was a seminar organised by the teachers and students of Harvard University. I spoke to General Moeen at lunch. I wanted to know from him about the release of my mother and others," Sajeeb told the TV station. Sajeeb claimed that his mother had never done injustice or corruption. When Sajeeb was asked to comment on the general as a person, he said, "I find him very gentle and, personally, I think he is a good man." Moeen left John F Kennedy Airport for Macao Tuesday night after a seven-day visit to the US. bdnews24.co
