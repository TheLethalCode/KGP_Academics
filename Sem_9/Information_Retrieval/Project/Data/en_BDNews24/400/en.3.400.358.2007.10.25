<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A copy of the first trade edition of "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", the first book in the seven-volume series, fetched 19,700 pounds ($40,000) at auction on Thursday, Christie's said. The book was one of only 500 copies made of the edition, many of which were bought up by libraries, making pristine copies scarce and highly sought-after. Crispin Jackson, head of books at Christie's, South Kensington, said the copy sold was the best he had seen. The book, published in 1997, had been expected to make 8-12,000 pounds. J.K. Rowling's stories of Harry Potter and his fellow wizards have sold over 335 million copies worldwide. The seventh and final book in the series -- "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" -- was published in July.
