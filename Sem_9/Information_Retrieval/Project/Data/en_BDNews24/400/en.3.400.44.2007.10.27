<TEXT>
 BRISBANE, Australia, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya served warning to the Australian team when he smashed 154 on the first day of the tourists' three-day match against a Chairman's XI in Adelaide on Saturday. At stumps on the first day, Sri Lanka were 335-4 with Thilan Samaraweera not out on 53. Recalled batsman Marvan Atapattu made 56 and Michael Vandort 55 on a day when the Sri Lankans dominated an attack made up of players not needed for domestic duty this weekend. The only sour news was a thigh injury to batsman/keeper Kumar Sangakkara, who retired hurt after making just one. Captain Mahela Jayawardene looked worried by the injury and popped a return catch to left-arm spinner Aaron Heal soon after Sangakkara retired hurt. Atapattu, who has looked rusty in the nets over the past two days, was helped by a 10-ball first over from Doug Bollinger, who sent down four no balls in a nervous opener. He scored most of his early runs through the third man region but showed greater composure as the morning went on. Scores: Sri Lanka 335-4 (S. Jayasuriya 154, M. Atapattu 56, M. Vandort 55, T. Samaraweena 53 not out, A. Heal 3-30) v Chairman's XI
