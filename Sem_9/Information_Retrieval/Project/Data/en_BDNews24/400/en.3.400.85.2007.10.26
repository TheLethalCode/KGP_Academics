 PARIS, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks made slim gains around midday on Friday, as energy stocks rallied on record high oil prices while telecom stocks rose on strong corporate results in the sector. GlaxoSmithKline continued to drift lower, down 2.3 percent, following the drugmaker's weak results posted earlier in the week. At 1101 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent at 1,568.76 points. While Friday's corporate results in Europe were mixed, telecoms presented a rosy picture with Teliasonera up 6.4 percent after robust numbers a day after France Telecom also pleased investors. Telefonica gained 2.3 percent, while Vodafone rose 1.2 percent. U.S. crude oil futures surged to a record high over $92 a barrel, lifted by supply worries, tensions in the Middle East as well as a record-low dollar. The rise lent support to energy stocks, with BP up 1.1 percent, Royal Dutch Shell up 1.6 percent, and Total up 1.5 percent. But the high oil price put downward pressure on the overall market, as it raised the prospect of higher inflation and higher energy costs for companies. "Record oil prices and the strong euro are enormous threats to European companies," Marie-Pierre Peillon, head of equity and credit research at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris. "With geopolitical risks adding to oil prices' momentum, we don't see how prices will start falling. The question is: are we in a new oil crisis like we've seen in the past?," she said. Banking shares fell, hit by renewed concerns over the credit market. The U.S. asset-backed commercial paper market that played a key role in financing the housing boom shrank to its smallest in 18 months in the latest week, according to government data released on Thursday, a sign that credit turmoil which has hit banking shares hard over the past months is far from over. UBS shed 1.6 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland lost 1.3 percent. "We've had a lot of negative news over the past couple of days on the banking sector and the credit situation as well as on U.S. quarterly results, but the stock market has been resilient to all that so far. I think stocks should have been retreating on these elements," Groupama's Peillon said. "The only real support at this point is the anticipation of a rate cut by the Fed on Oct. 31." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 was up 0.05 percent. Swedish engineering group Sandvik fell 5 percent after posting poor quarterly results, while Ahold dropped 5.5 percent after the Dutch supermarket group said its revamp of stores in the United States would continue to hurt margins. "The earnings season -- some good, some bad. Generally speaking I think the market is focusing a lot on earnings risk and you can see that with some of the price moves," said Philip Isherwood, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort. On the upside, auto stocks surged on robust results. PSA Peugeot Citroen gained 4 percent after the French car maker posted a 12 percent rise in third-quarter sales, beating market expectations. Rival Renault SA gained 3.4 percent after Nissan Motor Co, in which Renault has a 44 percent stake, reported a surprise 12 percent gain in quarterly operating prof
