<TEXT>
 KIEV, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Manchester United romped to a 4-2 away win at Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday to make it three wins from three in Champions League Group F. United had returned from all three previous away games against teams from the former Soviet Union with a goalless draw, but the Premier League champions showed their attacking prowess. "Our attacking play was excellent, I can't ask for better than that," United manager Alex Ferguson told ITV. "We could have scored a lot of goals, we had to defend some moments in the second half when they were a bigger threat but all in all very pleased with that result." United won their first three games in the tournament last season before successive defeats meant they only secured their passage to the knockout stage in the final group game. "I think this team is more mature now," added Ferguson, whose team can qualify if they beat Dynamo at Old Trafford next month. England defender Rio Ferdinand headed home a Ryan Giggs freekick on 10 minutes and an unmarked Wayne Rooney doubled the lead with a simple tap-in from a Wes Brown cross eight minutes later after a strong run from Ronaldo. Dynamo, having been outplayed for the opening half hour, got one back against the run of play when Brazilian Diogo Rincon powerfully headed home Carlos Correa's corner 10 minutes before halftime. But their joy was shortlived as Portuguese winger Ronaldo headed home another precision Giggs cross to restore United's two-goal lead before the break. Dynamo improved in the second half and began chipping away at United's defence. Correa fired a free kick narrowly wide while substitute Artem Milevskiy wasted a good opportunity after losing his balance. United continued to threaten on the break and Ronaldo grabbed his second from the penalty spot on 68 minutes after Goran Gavrancic had handled just inside the area. Ismael Bangoura pulled another back on 78 minutes with a low shot but defeat leaves Kiev without a point from three games, stretching their winless streak to 10 Champions League games. "We conceded because of our own mistakes," said Dynamo coach Josef Sabo. "We made many mistakes and what can we do if players run in just one (forward) direction?" "I hope that some players understand that they still have to work because they can't play the full 90 minutes.
