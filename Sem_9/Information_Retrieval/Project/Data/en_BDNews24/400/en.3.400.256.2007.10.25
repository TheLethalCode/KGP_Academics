 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks rebounded Thursday, led by the banking and power sectors, following a two-day correction. Trust Bank and DESCO guided the rally. "There was more correction in the market because many issues still remain overpriced considering their fundamentals," said Saiful Islam, an analyst at Equity Partners Ltd. "Investors are not behaving with caution despite repeated warnings from the regulator," added Islam. The market rose in morning trade amid intense buying, partly because of the start of trading on Paramount Insurance's secondary shares. The market remained relatively steady throughout the day following the initial flurry of activity. Trust Bank, the leader in turnover, added 3.13 percent to end on Tk 1166.25. With annualised earnings per share of Tk 35.20, Trust Bank's price-earnings ratio, an indicator of returns from invested funds, stood at 33.13. BRAC Bank's price-earnings (P/E) ratio remained almost the same, at 35.05, against its annualised EPS of Tk 43.40. BRAC Bank rose 1.01 percent to Tk 1523. Rupali Bank, one of the biggest issues by market capitalisation, increased pace supported by Social Investment Bank. DESCO continued its rise on the speculation of attractive dividends, breaching its previous high to touch Tk 1381, equivalent to an increase of 4.04 percent. State-run power company DESCO, whose P/E ratio reached 19.51 on Thursday, issued a 20 percent dividend in 2006. "Investors should pay attention to a company's fundamentals, rather than speculating on rumours," said Sharif Ataur Rahman, who has 30 years of experience in stocks with SAR Securities. "Too many buyers are chasing too few issues. The market will remain hungry for shares until the supply of quality issues is increased," added Rahman. The benchmark DGEN or general index rallied 45.48 points or 1.59 percent to move closer to the previous record of 2901.99. The DSI or all-share price index ended up at 42.97 points or 1.77 percent to close at 2470.79. The DSE-20 blue chip index climbed 50.03 points or 2.29 percent to 2231.13. Of the issues traded, 154 added, 52 lost and 17 held steady. Turnover stood at Tk 2.27 billion, with 18,319,346 shares changing hands. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh also advanced, although profit taking drove Summit Power to end 0.58 percent lower at Tk 1560. Pharmaceutical stocks gained, led by Beximco Pharma, which grew 9.90 percent to end at Tk 69.90, following two days of losses. Grameen 1 Mutual Fund and AIMS 1st MF buoyed mutual funds. Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst, advised investors to take their profits. "It's time to lock in gains," he said. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange gained, with 90 issues gaining, 30 declining and eight closing unchanged. A total of 3,919,796 shares traded on the bourse to the value of Tk 351.67 million. bdnew
