<TEXT>
 Tangail, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  US charge d'affaires in Dhaka Geeta Pasi Friday said it was time for Bangladeshis to rewrite their political future at this critical juncture. She hoped Bangladesh would take advantage of the scope to construct a base for a sustainable democracy and economy through reforms. She made the remarks at a prize distribution ceremony organised by Justice Debesh Chandra Bhattacharya Foundation at Elenga in the district. Geeta said elections were not enough for a democracy, rather it deserved something more. She promised US support to help strengthen government offices for the growth of democracy in the country. The US, she said, suggested the government to uphold human rights. The US continued to put "pressure" on the government so that the administration investigates all allegations of human rights violation, she said. Debapriya Bhattacharya, president of the foundation, also spoke on the occasion. bdnews24.
