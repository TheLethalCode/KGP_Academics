<TEXT>
 Chuadanga, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  A firefight erupted between the border guards of India and Bangladesh early Friday along the border in the district, a BDR official said. But no casualties were reported. The latest skirmish broke out at a time when the chiefs of the Indian Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles are leading their sides at border talks in Dhaka to find out ways for more cooperation. The countries share a porous border of 4,000 kilometres where small skirmishes are common. India has been building a barbed-wire fence along the border ignoring official protest by Bangladesh. India claims smuggling and illegal migration are rampant from Bangladesh, which denies the charges. BDR official Lt Col Meer Motahar Hasan said the Indian side started firing at about 1am along the border at Damurhuda in the district without any provocation. The BDR just responded, he said. Bangladeshi rights group, Odhikar, Tuesday accused the BSF of killing innocent Bangladeshis on the border. It said at least 94 Bangladeshis have been killed by the BSF along the border since January this year. bdnews24.c
