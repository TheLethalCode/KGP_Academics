 ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Election Commission has issued a "final list" of voters, putting the electorate at 80 million, an increase of 28 million from the first draft list published in June, an official said on Friday. Pakistan is expected to hold national elections by early January that are supposed to represent a transition to civilian-led democracy. The missing voters became a contentious topic earlier this year after the commission's first draft put the number at 52 million, 20 million fewer than voted in the 2002 election. President Pervez Musharraf, who came to power in a coup eight years ago, has promised to quit the army and become a civilian leader if his re-election on Oct. 6 by parliament and the provincial assemblies is accepted by the Supreme Court. The court is currently hearing challenges to his right to run while still serving as army chief. The government is negotiating with Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) over the formation of an interim government. Former Prime Minister Bhutto has disputed the independence of the Election Commission, and her earlier challenge in the Supreme Court prompted the commission to redraw the voter list. Bhutto survived an assassination attempt that killed 139 people in a suicide bomb attack when she returned from self-imposed exile last week. "We have issued the final list of 80 million voters for the next polls," commission Secretary Kanwar Muhammad Dilshad told Reuters. "This is an ongoing process and voters can still be included until the election schedule is announced." The commission had argued that the 72 million-strong electorate in 2002 was inflated, saying the state-run National Database and Registration Authority made an error by registering many people who did not have national identity cards. However, the new list builds on the original 2002 voter base and adds millions of people who have since turned 18, Dilshad said. Roughly half of Pakistan's 160 million people are below 18. Musharraf is under international pressure to ensure polls due early next year are free and fair. The last elections in 2002, which brought Musharraf's allies to power, were widely believed to have been rigged. However, some independent poll observers still had reservations about the new list, saying the process had not been transparent. "We have doubts about the new list. It is not the question of the number but how reliable these lists are," said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, head of non-government advocacy group PILDAT. "There are still millions of people who have been issued new national identity cards but their names are not on the lis
