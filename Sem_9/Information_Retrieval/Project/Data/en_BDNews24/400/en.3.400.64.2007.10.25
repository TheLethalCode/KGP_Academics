 SINGAPORE, Thu Oct 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brent crude hit all-time highs and US oil prices surged more than $1 to above $88 on Thursday, after a slide in US oil stocks renewed fears of an energy crunch in the northern hemisphere's winter heating season. London Brent crude rose $1.20 a barrel to $85.57, a record peak. US light crude for December delivery jumped $1.21 to $88.31 a barrel, up almost $3.00 from around the same time on Wednesday.

OPEC members, who have already agreed to boost production by 500,000 barrels per day from November 1, will meet informally in Saudi Arabia next month. A senior OPEC delegate said another OPEC output hike may be needed.

A storm killed 18 Mexican oil workers fleeing a battered offshore rig. Closely watched tensions between Iraq and Turkey over Kurdish rebels operating from the north of Iraq are also supporting oil prices. Turkish warplanes attacked a village in northern Iraq on Wednesday, an Iraqi Kurdish security official said, but Turkey said it wanted to hold back from a major incursion to give diplomacy a chan
