<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  An initial investigation by Anticorruption Commission has found no evidence of corruption by former prime minister Khaleda Zia in the lease of Magurchhara gas field to US firm Occidental and Phulbari coal field to British firm Asia Energy. ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman speaking at a regular press briefing at the Segun Bagicha office, however, could not say whether the primary investigation focused on any specific allegation against Khaleda. "The investigation officer in his report mentioned that in the primary investigation into the allegation against Khaleda Zia regarding Magurchhara gas field and Occidental Oil and Gas Corporation no evidence to prove the allegations have been found," he said. "The investigation officer in his report also mentioned that in the primary investigation into the allegations against Khaleda Zia regarding leasing out Phulbari coal field to Asia Energy no evidence was found." The ACC secretary said there was no possibility of further investigation into these two matters. A fire broke out in Magurchhara gas field in Sylhet region under the management of Occidental in 1997. A government estimate put the loss due to the blowout at $650 crore. Asia Energy was given the charge of extracting coal from Phulbari coal field in Dinajpur in 1998. Local people obstructed their attempt to extract coal through open-pit mining citing mainly environmental risks. Local residents clashed with the security forces on several occasions and one demonstrator was killed in the latest clash in August. On Jan 11, the name of Asia Energy has been changed to Global Coal Management Private Limited. bdnew
