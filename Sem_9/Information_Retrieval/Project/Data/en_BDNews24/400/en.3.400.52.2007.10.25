<TITLE> Turkey's patience with PKK running out says Gul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Abdullah Gul warned the PKK on Thursday that Turkey's patience was running out after Turkish forces said they repelled a Kurdish guerrilla attack near the Iraqi border. Ankara has massed as many as 100,000 troops along the mountainous border ahead of a possible cross-border operation to crush around 3,000 rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who use northern Iraq as a launchpad for attacks on Turkey. Iraqi, Turkish and U.S. diplomats have stepped up efforts to avert a large-scale Turkish incursion but Gul said NATO-member Turkey would not tolerate more PKK attacks from Iraq. "We are totally determined to take all necessary steps to end this threat... Iraq should not be a source of threat for its neighbours," Gul told an economic conference in Ankara. "Although we respect the territorial integrity and unity of Iraq, Turkey is running out of patience and will not tolerate the use of Iraqi soil for the purpose of terrorist activities." The United States is keen to avert a major Turkish offensive in northern Iraq, fearing it would destabilise not only the most peaceful part of that country but potentially the wider region. "(The United States) may not want us to carry out a cross-border operation. But it is we who will decide whether to do one or not," Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told reporters during a visit to Romania. Public pressure on the Turkish authorities to act has grown since rebels killed 12 soldiers last weekend. The PKK, branded a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and the European Union, have also said they captured eight soldiers. Turkish security sources have confirmed a series of sorties by warplanes and ground troops since Sunday into Iraqi territory, though Ankara has said it still hopes diplomacy can stave off the need for a full-blown ground invasion. Turkish tanks and artillery helped beat off an attack by up to 40 PKK rebels late on Wednesday on a military post in Hakkari province near the border, security officials told Reuters. After heavy clashes, the guerrillas withdrew into northern Iraq and took with them an unknown number of dead and wounded, the officials said. One Turkish soldier was injured. FIGHTER JETS F-16 fighter jets took off early on Thursday from the airport in Diyarbakir, the largest city of Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast region. It was not known where they headed. An Iraqi Kurdish security official said a Turkish warplane had bombed a Kurdish village on Wednesday but gave no details of any damage. In a visit billed by Turkish officials as "a final chance" for diplomacy, an Iraqi team led by Defence Minister General Abdel Qader Jassim and including members of northern Iraq's Kurdish administration was due in Ankara later on Thursday. The Baghdad government has promised to shut down PKK camps but Ankara knows the central Iraqi government has little clout in the autonomous Kurdish north. Turkish newspapers on Thursday accused Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish leaders of dishonesty and unreliability for promising much and delivering virtually nothing. They were especially angry with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, whom senior Turkish officials quoted on Wednesday as saying Baghdad might hand over PKK rebels to Turkey. Talabani's office later denied he said this. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due to visit Turkey on Nov. 2-3 to try to reduce tensions between Turkey and Iraq. Erdogan is also expected to meet President George W Bush in Washington on Nov. 5 "As a strategic ally of Turkey, the United States has to act together with Turkey," Erdogan said. "We acted together with them in Afghanistan. We must take and we will take steps against terrorism both on a national and an international level." A senior Turkish diplomat, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters Ankara was waiting for the United States to come up with a response to their requests for action against the PKK. "The real deadline is the Bush-Erdogan meeting. There will be no major military action before that," the diplomat said. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since the group launched its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984. Following the arrest of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1999 the insurgent group began calling for greater political and cultural rights for Kur
