 WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The 16 women members of the US Senate sent a letter to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday urging his government to press neighbor Myanmar to end its crackdown on pro-democracy campaigners. The letter to Singh by the Senate Women's Caucus on Burma, which stressed shared U.S.-Indian democratic values and responsibilities, also registered strong concern at Indian arms sales and oil dealings with the military regime in Yangon. "As the world's largest democracy, India should use its influence to put pressure on the regime to stop the violence against pro-democracy activists, release all political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, and begin a true national dialogue on national reconciliation that will lead to a restoration of democratic government," said the letter. Democracy leader Suu Kyi, a woman who marked 12 years in captivity on Wednesday, enjoys widespread bipartisan support in the United States, where first lady Laura Bush has taken a high-profile stance on the issue since early this year. "We are concerned that recent actions by India, including high-level visits by members of your government to Burma, may be interpreted as implicitly supporting the military junta," said the caucus, which is led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican. The letter noted that Indian Petroleum Minister Murli Deora visited Myanmar to sign energy deals at the height of last month's pro-democracy protests and that New Delhi had sold the junta maritime surveillance aircraft and a range of weapons. Indian officials who hosted special UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari in New Delhi this week promised to help push Myanmar toward democracy but stopped short of committing to a tougher line against its military rule
