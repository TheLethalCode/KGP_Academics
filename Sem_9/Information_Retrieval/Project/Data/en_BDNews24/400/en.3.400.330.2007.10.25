 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The business community has urged the government to frame a long-term and attainable policy to improve the investment climate, in its recommendations on forming a Better Business Forum. "We have requested the government to frame a long-term and achievable policy within a couple of months," FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "We have requested they make the policy a final one so that the next government do not bring any changes," said Nasir. The recommendations came after the government sent a draft framework on its plan to form a 'Better Business Forum' to regain business confidence in a bid to improve the investment climate and accelerate the pace of the economy. The recommendations from the private sector were submitted to the chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday, according to Nasir, coordinator of representatives from business and industry. The proposed forum is expected to have a central body, comprising senior advisers, top business leaders, representatives of government agencies like the Bangladesh Bank, National Board of Revenue and government secretaries. The government took the initiative to form the forum amid deterioration of business confidence, resulting in a steady decline in both domestic and foreign investment. Deterioration of business confidence also affected demands for credit from the banking sector holding over Tk 140 billion in excess liquidity by the end of July. FDI in Bangladesh had dropped 6 percent to $792 million in 2006, from $845 million the previous year, mainly due to political unrest, volatility and changes in governments, according to the World Investment Report 2007. Local investment proposals also dropped, according to Board of Investment figures. The proposed forum will be headed by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, and finance adviser Mirza Azizul islam will act as executive chairman of the forum. The body is also expected to have sub-forums on different issues such as ports, export, import, banking and investment. Advisers of the concerned ministries are expected to chair the committees with leaders of the associations and government officials concerned to act as members. The forum will discuss the problems and grievances of the business community and suggest remedies and action plans, according to businessmen. Nasir said they urged the government to include private sector representatives and recommended selection of the working groups as early as possible. "We have also proposed bringing changes in amendments in laws to smooth business activities," he said. b
