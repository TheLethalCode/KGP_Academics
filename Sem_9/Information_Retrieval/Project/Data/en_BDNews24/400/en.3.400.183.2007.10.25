 RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Brazil striker Romario made his coaching debut on Wednesday but was unable to stop Vasco da Gama being knocked out of the Copa Sudamericana. Vasco, with Romario taking a player-coaching role on an interim basis, beat Mexico's America 1-0 in the quarter-final second leg but went out 2-1 on aggregate. The former Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven player was appointed on Monday after Celso Roth became the second coach this year to be fired by the club. Romario, 41, brought himself on as a second-half substitute for his first game in four months and wasted a chance to level the aggregate scores when he mis-timed a free header. Leandro Amaral gave Vasco a 10th-minute lead following a corner but, despite creating a wealth of chances, the Brazilians were unable to find a second goal. America goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa made a superb save to deny Alan Kardec before halftime, while Luizao headed against the crossbar and the Mexicans cleared two balls off the line. Brazil's interest in the tournament ended in Bogota where Sao Paulo were knocked out by Colombia's Millonarios, who won 2-0 to complete a surprise 3-0 aggregate win. Despite struggling in the Colombian league, Millonarios dominated the game against the Brazilian champions and championship leaders. Two late goals from captain Ricardo Ciciliano gave Millonarios victory on the night. In the 77th minute, the shaven-headed striker met a cross with a first-time shot which found the bottom left hand corner of Rogerio Ceni's goal. Five minutes later, Millonarios broke out of defence and Ciciliano burst clear from the halfway line unchallenged before placing a low shot under Ceni
