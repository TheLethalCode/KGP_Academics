<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com) - A correction centre for drug addicts is to be opened soon at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The centre, being introduced for the first time by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, would have 50 beds and be run by a specialized team of doctors, nurses and health technicians. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Professor A H M Firoz, Director of NIMH said, "The centre is a demand we placed with the ministry a long time ago. We expect to see the centre opened at our hospital within a very short time." The centre would be the 7th unit of the hospital. The ministry has already spent Tk 17 lakh to operate the correction centre to be located on the 3rd floor of the hospital building the city's Shaymoli area. Professor Mohammad Faruq Alam, also a working psychiatrist of NIMH, told bdnews24.com that the hospital would not require any extra manpower. The existing 30 doctors and 17 professors would also take care of the patients admitted to the unit. The 50-bed unit within the 150-bed mental hospital would offer 60 per cent of the beds for those who can afford to pay beds while the rest would be free of cost mostly for poor patients. The ministry of home affairs currently operates a correction centre for drug addicts in the city's Tejgaon area. However, due to a limited number of beds, many patients willing to withdraw from drug addiction are forced to wait, often for months for admission. An estimate shows that on an average there are more than about 100,000 drug addicts in the city alone. b
