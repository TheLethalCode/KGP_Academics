 BELGRADE, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal equalled the record Champions League victory with a 7-0 thumping of Slavia Prague on Tuesday as Manchester United also took a major step towards a place in the last 16 with a 4-2 win at Dynamo Kiev. Arsenal made it three wins out of three as they matched the record set by Juventus against Olympiakos in 2003 with a breathtaking display of passing football. Two goals each from Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott, his first in Europe's premier club competition, one apiece by Aleksandr Hleb and Nicklas Bendtner as well as a David Hubacek own-goal left Arsenal top of Group H with a maximum nine points. "We wanted three points and to play well but you can't predict that," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who celebrated his 58th birthday on Monday. "Everything went for us." Double UEFA Cup winners Sevilla are second with six after first-half goals from Frederic Kanoute and Luis Fabiano helped them to a 2-1 home success against Steaua Bucharest. United also maintained their perfect start in Group F after Cristiano Ronaldo scored a brace and Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand added a goal each against Kiev, who gained some consolation thanks to Diogo Rincon and Ismael Bangoura. Roma moved into second position with a 2-1 defeat of Sporting Lisbon at the Olympic Stadium with Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic scoring a 70th-minute winner after coming on as a first-half substitute for injured Francesco Totti. Juan gave Roma a 15th-minute lead, fellow Brazilian Liedson equalised shortly afterwards and their countryman Mancini missed a 49th-minute penalty for the home side before Vucinic capped a dazzling solo run with a rising shot into the top corner. A goalless draw at Ibrox left Rangers and Barcelona joint top of Group E with seven points while Lyon kept alive their hopes of finishing at least third and securing a UEFA Cup spot after the winter break with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. MEMORABLE EVENING It was one way-traffic in north London after Fabregas drilled in a powerful shot in the fifth minute to send Arsenal on their way on a memorable evening for Arsene Wenger's side. Hubacek turned into his own net and Belarus midfielder Hleb put his name on the scoresheet after Walcott scored his first and Arsenal's third. Walcott made it 5-0 and Fabregas added the sixth to finish a glorious sweeping move before the hour while Bendtner's tap-in completed the rout in the 89th minute. An excellent first-half performance helped United to a fine win in Kiev as Ferdinand headed them into an early lead and Rooney made it 2-0 in the 18th minute after good work by Ronaldo and Wes Brown. Rincon pulled one back for Kiev before Ronaldo struck twice to put the game beyond the home team, who salvaged some pride through Guinea striker Bangoura. In the afternoon kick-off, Inter Milan fought back to beat CSKA Moscow 2-1 in the Russian capital and go top of Group G a point ahead of Fenerbahce, who were held to a 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven. Brazilian striker Jo Alves fired CSKA into a 32nd-minute lead when he curled in a delightful shot into the top corner but the home side were let down by poor defending as Inter capitalised on two howlers to come away with all three points. Hernan Crespo drilled in a 52nd-minute equaliser after a clumsy clearance by Milos Krasic and fellow Argentine Walter Samuel grabbed the winner with a soft header that bounced awkwardly in front of the keeper. Inter have six points while Fenerbahce have five and PSV Eindhoven four after their 0-0 draw that ended the Dutch team's six-game winning streak at home against Turkish rivals
