 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP communications minister Nazmul Huda Thursday found himself in a spot of embarrassment after questioning a judge on judicial independence. Defending himself in a corruption case at the Special Judge's Court-5, he asked judge Md Ashraf Hossain, "Since this is a special court, are you going to be independent from November 1?" Hossain said, "You once stood in parliament and said the judiciary would never become independent as long as you were in power." Huda, who was standing in the dock, seemed baffled by the judge's reply. The judge went on to say, "We realised then that politicians and bureaucrats had an interest in not separating the judiciary." The people present at the court quipped that the honourable judge had given a befitting reply. Huda was sentenced to seven years in jail and his wife three years on Aug 27 on bribery charges. Several other cases against him are on trial on various charges including corruption and extortion. bdnews2
