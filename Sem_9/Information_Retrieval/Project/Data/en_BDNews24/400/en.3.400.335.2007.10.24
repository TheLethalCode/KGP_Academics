 ROME, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The EU's top diplomat said on Wednesday that Iran's new chief nuclear negotiator was upstaged by his predecessor at Rome talks, and warned that `multiple players' from Iran could further complicate negotiations with the West. Javier Solana met with Iran's newly appointed chief negotiator Saeed Jalili for the first time on Tuesday. But the EU foreign policy chief said that former chief negotiator Ali Larijani, who was also in Rome, appeared to be leading the Iranian team. "We have to let some time pass to see how these latest waves in Iran's power structure settle," Solana said in an interview with Italian state broadcaster RAI's Italia News programme, which Reuters viewed ahead of its full release later this week. "It will be very important because the negotiation is already a difficult negotiation. If you also must negotiate with various players at the same time, it will be more complicated still." Jalili replaced Larijani after his resignation was announced in a move described by analysts said could present the West with a harder line in its dispute over Tehran's atomic ambitions. Solana noted that Larijani was still on the Supreme National Security Council as a representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. "In this capacity (as Khamenei's representative) he was in Rome talking to me," Solana said. "They were both at the meeting, Larijani and Jalili. Larijani led the meeting, he was the one that took on all of the weight of the meeting," he said. "So he will continue to play an important role, in my judgement, in Iran's power structure." Despite speculation that Jalili's appointment might signal a harder Iranian negotiating line, Larijani said on Tuesday his departure was part of the normal "rotation" in a democratic country. "Jalili is a friend of mine, seven or eight years younger than me. Energetic. He will come to the stage and continue doing the work," Larijani told reporters in Rome after the talks. Both sides called the talks `constructive' and talked about meeting again before the end of November. Six world powers have agreed to delay any further U.N. penalties until at least November, when Solana is due to deliver a report. But the Rome talks were overshadowed by comments from Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad rejecting calls to suspend uranium enrichment -- the UN Security Council's key demand -- and saying Iran would not retreat "one iota" on its nuclear plans. The Security Council has imposed two sets of limited sanctions because of Iran's failure to heed a demand to halt nuclear work the West believes is aimed at building atomic bombs. Tehran denies any such military plans. Ahmadinejad on Wednesday called such sanction resolutions "just a pile of pape
