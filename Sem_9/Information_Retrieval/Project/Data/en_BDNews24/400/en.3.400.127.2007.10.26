 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  A 90-strong police team leaves the country Friday midnight to join the UN peacekeeping mission in the West African nation of Ivory Coast, a press statement said. The officers are set to fly by a chartered aircraft, said the statement of the Police Headquarters. Earlier, 149 Bangladeshi police had joined the mission in the troubled country, which is struggling hard to overcome years of unrest. The country has been divided into a rebel-held north and government-run south since a brief 2002-2003 civil war. French and UN peacekeeping troops are engaged to protect a fragile ceasefire line separating the rival forces. bdne
