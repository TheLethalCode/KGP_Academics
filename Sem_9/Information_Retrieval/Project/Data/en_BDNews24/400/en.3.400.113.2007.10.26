 BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - EU steelmakers are set to ask the European Commission as soon as Monday to impose anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports, an industry official said, signalling what could be the start of a major trade dispute. European steel companies have been working for months towards filing formal anti-dumping complaints with the European Union's executive after Chinese steel exports to the 27-nation bloc surged. "It will probably be next week, perhaps as soon as Monday," the official told Reuters on Friday, asking not to be named. The official declined to give details of the complaints but said they affected "more than one" type of steel product. European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has voiced increasing frustration with China for not taking enough action about its snowballing trade surplus with the EU, and he has mentioned steel as a specific problem. But a Commission official said the case was complex. European engineering groups, which are big consumers of steel, urged Brussels not to hit China with anti-dumping duties, arguing that far more jobs in Europe are linked to using steel than producing it. A move by the Commission to impose duties would have to be approved by a majority of the EU's member states, about half of which are often reluctant to take measures to slow imports. The European Commission would have up to 45 days upon receiving a request for anti-dumping duties to decide whether to launch an investigation. It could then impose provisional anti-dumping duties after nine months, followed six months later by definitive duties that would normally last five years.
