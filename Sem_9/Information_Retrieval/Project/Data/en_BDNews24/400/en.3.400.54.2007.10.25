<TITLE> China Communists issue new charter with Hu's imprint </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party on Thursday issued an amended version of its charter enshrining the slogans and enhanced influence of President Hu Jintao after its Congress last week. The Party "constitution" is less a legal document and more an organisational guide and compilation of the ideological justifications that China's Communists have accumulated -- and often quietly shelved -- in their 30-year evolution from a party of Mao Zedong and mass revolution to one of mass markets and dynamic growth. Hu's vow of a society cleansed of conflict by combining rapid economic growth with environmental safeguards and social equity was introduced into the charter after ritual approval by a five-yearly Party Congress last week, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The changes were a symbolic victory for Hu in this top-down one-party state where ideological jargon is the language of power, telling officials and citizens which leaders to heed. With five more years as Party chief and state president, Hu occupies an ideological mantel alongside his predecessor Jiang Zemin, as well Marx, Mao, and reformist patriarch Deng Xiaoping. The revised text acclaims Hu's slogan of a "scientific outlook on development" as "an important guiding policy for our country's economic and social development." "The Chinese Communist Party leads the people in building a socialist harmonious society", it says, referring to Hu's promise to ease social inequality and tensions. The charter and Hu's speech to the Congress have become the focus of a nationwide propaganda campaign that shunted even China's launch of a lunar orbiting satellite to a bottom corner of the official People's Daily front page on Thursday. At the Congress, Hu bolstered his power through a leadership overhaul that promoted two potential successors and ushered into retirement several officials installed under his predecessor, Jiang. Jiang was able to push his slogans into the charter only just before his retirement as Party boss in 2002. An unnamed Party official said Hu's changes were a way of "unifying the thoughts and actions and concentrating the wisdom and strength of the whole Party and mobilizing all Party members' enthusiasm", Xinhua reported. The charter now also mentions "religion" in what Xinhua earlier said was a first. The amendment is not a promise of religious freedom, but of recruiting believers to serve state policy. "Fully implement the Party's basic policies on religious work and unify believers to make contributions to economic and social development," the charter tells Party members.
