 STRASBOURG, France, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France and the Netherlands will put forward proposals to regulate soccer agents and over the numbers of locally based players in teams involved in European club competition, a French minister said on Tuesday. The EU is currently reviewing its sports policy which will be discussed by ministers in Lisbon on Thursday. "There will be a Franco-Dutch memorandum on sport," French European Affairs Minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet told reporters. "The memorandum will recognise the special character of sport and ensure there is a collective distribution of broadcasting rights reserved for financing all sport," Jouyet said. EU sports ministers are due to discuss the implications of the bloc's new reform treaty -- agreed by EU leaders last Friday -- for sport. Sports bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and soccer's governing body FIFA claim a new clause in the treaty gives them more autonomy in running their affairs and allows them to be exempt from interference by Brussels. But some officials in Brussels said the sports organisations were jumping the gun and further analysis is needed. Jouyet said he was also concerned about big European clubs snapping up players trained at the expense of smaller clubs. "We want a framework for this system so that the clubs that train the players can benefit from the training," Jouyet said. A rule introduced by soccer's European body UEFA, known as the "home grown player rule", which sets a quota on the number of locally trained players at clubs, is currently being reviewed by Brussels as part of its strategy paper launched in July. The president of soccer's world governing body FIFA, Sepp Blatter, has run into opposition recently over proposals to limit the number of foreign players at European clubs which EU officials say contravene its rules on the free movement of workers. "We also want to have a framework for the intermediaries in the area of sports contracts. As you know it's a profession today that has no rules. It's a totally unregulated area," Jouyet said. Regarding players' agents, FIFA intends to introduce its own regulations in January which, according to sources, will limit the amount of money agents can receive. However, these rules are also set to attract the attention of the EU executive European Commission as they may contravene its competition rul
