<TITLE> Milk Vita prices to see further hike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com) - The largest dairy producer in the country, the Milk Vita Company, is set to increase the price at which it buys and sells liquid milk from Nov 7. Milk Vita chairman Mosharaf Hossain Bhuiyan said Saturday that the company will purchase 1 kg of raw milk at Tk 25 from their suppliers, and sell it for Tk 40 after pasteurising. This amounts to a Tk 3 rise in the purchasing price, and a Tk 4 hike in the selling price, of liquid milk. Bhuiyan announced the change at a meeting of the Primary Milk Producers' Co-operative Society at the Baghabari Milk Vita Unit, where local milk producers demanded the purchasing rate be increased to Tk 30 from its current level of Tk 22. They also demanded the creation of a modern fodder producing factory at the Baghabari Unit to mitigate the ongoing crisis in cattle feed. The Milk Vita chairman said he would raise their concerns with officials at the company and assured milk producers that the purchasing price would be gradually increased over time. bdn
