 JOHANNESBURG, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's producer price inflation was steady at 9.4 percent year-on-year in September, below forecasts, official data showed on Thursday. Statistics South Africa said PPI declined by 0.7 percent on a month-on-month basis after a 0.7 percent rise in August -- figures which boosted bonds after surprisingly high consumer inflation data on Wednesday. Analysts said the slower-than-expected factory gate inflation was welcome but was still at levels which will worry a central bank struggling to tame rising prices. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast annual PPI at 9.6 percent, while the monthly drop was seen at 0.6 percent. "It's a bit of a relief especially after the really terrible CPI numbers received yesterday ... but I'm afraid this doesn't change anything," Efficient Research economist Dawie Roodt said. "I don't know what the Reserve Bank is going to do but I know what they have to do, and that is to increase rates." The targeted CPIX gauge jumped to a four-year high of 6.7 percent year-on-year in September from 6.3 percent in August, outpacing forecasts and rising further away from the top end of the central bank's 3 to 6 percent band. But the bond market took solace from the producer price data, with the yield on the benchmark 2015 government bond falling 9.5 basis points to 8.255 percent, reversing a leap in the wake of the consumer inflation numbers. Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni has warned the bank remains focused on returning CPIX into the range. Producer inflation, driven by high food and fuel costs, has consistently outstripped consumer inflation, keeping pressure on CPIX. Stats S.A. said the locally-produced PPI ticked up to 9.7 percent in September while the imported component eased to 8.5 percent year-on-year from 9.7 percent previous
