 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Former Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Rokanuddowla Wednesday apologised unconditionally to the chief justice, the government and others for speaking against the separation of the judiciary. "In trying to express my feelings, I became rude. I therefore offer unconditional and sincere apology to the chief justice, government and all concerned," he told reporters "I have always been in favour of the separation of the judiciary. My appeal had been to uphold the prestige of the administrative cadre while implementing the separation. However as some discrepancies were created, I was hurt," he told journalists at his chamber. The apology came a day after a senior lawyer served a legal notice on five leading administration officials including the Bangladesh Administrative Services Association president Moniruzzaman Khan and Rokanuddowla, for what he said was contempt of court. The lawyer also asked the five to make a public apology to the chief justice, through the media, within the next 24 hours. Rokanuddowla at a seminar Sunday demanded a halt to the separation of the judiciary from the executive until 2021. He had urged executive officials to stop work from Nov 1 if the government did not clearly state that it would halt the separation process by that date. He was removed from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Tuesday and made officer on special duty (OSD) at the establishment ministry. "The government has realised our anguish and has taken initiative to uphold our honour. Now we do not have any disappointment in our mind. "All officials of BCS administration cadre including myself believe that there will be no more dissatisfaction among us. I was loyal to the government in the past, I am so now and will remain so in future." He broke down in tears while talking to reporters. He said he had not received any order of his withdrawal until 1:30pm. He said, "The chief justice is like my father. I apologise to him." bdnews24.co
