<TITLE> Debapriya calls for private sector representative to WTO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed ambassador and permanent representative of Bangladesh to the WTO and UN Offices in Geneva Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya Saturday urged business leaders to appoint an experienced private sector representative to the WTO to work alongside the permanent representative. He called for the private sector initiative at a meeting organised by the FBCCI in the morning. "The world economic and political situation is complex. Fuel prices are rising in the international market. Food crop prices have increased by more than 40 percent in the last year. Inflation is on an upward trend," he said. He said it would be very difficult to negotiate trade preferences in such an economic environment. "Government level effort will not be enough. The private sector must get involved," he said. Debapriya suggested the private sector appoint a permanent representative to the Geneva mission to work as a focal point for talks. Trade bodies including the FBCCI could jointly foot the bill for such a representative's monthly salary. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain responded positively to the proposal. "A decision in this regard will be taken soon after consulting the various trade bodies," Mir Nasir said. Debapriya said, "The US presidential election will be held next year. If duty-free access to the US market for Bangladeshi goods cannot be ensured before that, it will be very difficult to get it after elections." "The Republicans will probably not win. It is not likely that Democrats will give trade preferences to Bangladesh. So duty-free access must be achieved before US polls through a joint public sector- private sector effort." "The world trade environment offers two ways to get preferential market access. One way is through the WTO. The other way is to negotiate directly with Washington. Experience shows that it is very difficult to obtain preferential trade through the WTO. Bangladesh has to emphasise talks with Washington to target the US market." "The main challenge of the hour is to take the country forward using the opportunities offered by the changed world situation." "I will do my best to discharge my responsibility," Debapriya said. Mir Nasir said, "This is the first time a private sector representative will be appointed to the Geneva mission. This is a good thing. It will help Bangladeshi business progress." bdnews24
