<TITLE> Autonomy proposed for ACC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission has proposed that the government bring a few amendments to the ACC Act to make the institution autonomous, an official said Tuesday. ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman said: "Though the ACC has been independent and impartial, its status has never been well-defined. At a meeting Thursday, we decided to initiate autonomy for the commission and have sent a proposal to the cabinet division Tuesday." He said autonomy to the commission would make its activities in recruitment and job descriptions a lot easier. It would also help discipline the commission further, he added. Although a few amendments have been made to the act this year, this is for the first time that efforts are underway to give autonomy to the country's graft watchdog. bdnews2
