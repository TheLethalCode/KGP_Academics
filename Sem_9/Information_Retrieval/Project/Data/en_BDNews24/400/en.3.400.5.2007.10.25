 BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union lawmakers voted on Thursday to boost the bloc's collective spending on planned satellite navigation system Galileo by 739 million euros ($1.06 billion) in the first reading of the EU's 2008 budget draft. The new funds for the system aimed to compete with the US Global Positioning System (GPS) were part of a 4.8 billion-euro general increase in the EU budget proposed by the European Parliament, against 119.4 billion euros set by EU governments. "The parliament will now hold talks with the Council (of EU governments) on the final shape of the budget," a spokesman for the parliament said. The proposed funds for Galileo come on the top of 151 million euros already earmarked next year for the project, which has faced a 2.4 billion euro hole in funding as private companies have proven reluctant to foot the bill. The European Commission has proposed amending the EU's long-term budget for 2007-2013 to generate the missing 2.4 billion over the period from unused agricultural funds. But Germany has opposed the measure, saying the Commission should propose more options for financing the project, which has been haunted by delays. Representatives of national governments will now negotiate with parliament on final spending levels, which usually end up somewhat higher than proposed by governments. Parliament is due to have a final vote on the budget in December. The spokesman for the parliament said most of the increase in the 2008 budget proposed by the assembly was earmarked for regional aid for poorer regions and measures to promote growth, jobs and scientific research. The 2008 budget will be the first in which spending for regional aid, growth and jobs will exceed spending on farm subsidies, which has traditionally dominated EU expenditure.
