<TITLE> Soaring oil price will hit hard Asia's poor: UNDP report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Soaring oil prices are threatening the future of millions of Asia's poor and forcing them into further poverty, according to a report released in Bangkok Thursday by the UN Development Programme. "Oil prices have tripled over the last four years. Today the price is approaching $90 a barrel," said the report. "This has meant that the Asia and Pacific region has had to pay an additional bill of almost $400 billion for imports, compared to the amount spent in 2003," the report continued. Hafiz Pasha, UNDP regional director for the Asia and Pacific region, spoke at the launch of the report in Bangkok. "This additional bill is 20 times the annual aid flow to the region." "It has become a real issue for an otherwise fast-growing region to absorb this staggeringly large bill," added Pasha. Piyasvasti Amranand, the Thailand's minister for energy, signaled an alternative solution to the crises at the launch. "This time around, the price of oil has gone up so much that we are seeing renewable technologies developing and materializing. These new technologies will be beneficial to everyone," Amranand said. Interviews conducted for the report among poor rural and urban households in China, India, Indonesia and Laos reveal that rising oil prices are starting to put a brake on human development and in some cases shifting it into reverse. Between 2002 and 2005, the households interviewed suffered dramatic price increases, paying on average 74 percent more for their energy needs over the period. This included 171 percent more for cooking fuels; 120 percent more for transportation; 67 percent more for electricity; and 55 percent more for lighting fuels. The price rise has provoked huge public outcries across the Asia and Pacific region and pushed millions of people into heightened poverty. Millions are being forced "to climb down the energy ladder, reverting to traditional fuels that are unhealthy and inefficient", according to the report. The Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI), developed in the report, ranks countries in terms of their economic strength and performance, and the extent to which this growth depends on imported oil. The OPVI, a composite index, brings together 18 indicators which track the level of an economy's dependence to imported oil, and thereby, their vulnerability to fluctuations in global oil prices. The countries ranked most vulnerable are the Maldives, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, whose low overall economic strength, lower ongoing economic performance and high oil dependency make them especially susceptible. Countries that are apparently less vulnerable are not immune to the effects of oil price hikes either. Malaysia and Thailand, for example, with their rapidly growing rates of oil consumption could become more vulnerable in the future. China and India, on the other hand, do not at present seem to be immediately impacted due to their greater reliance on other energy sources such as coal. Their stronger performing economies and larger reserves have also enabled them to ride through this period relatively unscathed. As for countries that are vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, particularly the least developed countries, the report proposes a new mechanism that will enable countries to cope with any sudden downturns -- the Asia-Pacific Compensatory Oil Finance Facility. AP-COIL will help countries cope with their prolonged liquidity problems. At present these vulnerable countries finance their oil costs through debt. This squeezes their capacity to invest in critical economic, social and infrastructural projects. The AP-COIL proposes to enable these countries to tide over their immediate balance of payments, or fiscal deficit crunch, and move towards a less oil intensive future by investing in alternative sources of energy. The UNDP report is titled "Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific". bdnews2
