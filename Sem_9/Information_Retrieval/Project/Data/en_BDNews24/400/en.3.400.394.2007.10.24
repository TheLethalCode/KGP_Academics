 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka stocks traded lower in midday Wednesday after the marke was rattled in the morning session on merchant banks' moves to comply with a regulatory tightening of margin loan rules. The benchmark index lost about 50 points before it regained pace before midday. The market remained in the negative territory at the end of the midday session. "Merchant banks' moves to stop extending loans with more than 100 percent margin may have dampened investors' buying mood," said general manager of IDL Finance Arif Khan.
