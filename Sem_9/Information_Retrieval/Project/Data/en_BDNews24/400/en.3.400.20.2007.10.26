 JAKARTA, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A commission investigating bloodshed during East Timor's 1999 vote for independence from Indonesia will offer United Nations officials another chance to testify, its co-chairman said on Friday. The United Nations, which sponsored the vote, has boycotted hearings held by the Commission of Truth and Friendship (CTF), arguing that the body set up by Indonesia and East Timor could recommend amnesty for those found guilty of gross human rights violations.

Mangkoedilaga said East Timor President Jose Ramos-Horta had told the commission not to be concerned about UN officials' boycotting the hearings and criticism of the body. "He said just ignore the voices of those United Nations bureaucrats, because they are not the United Nations. The United Nations comprise countries including East Timor and Indonesia," he said. "The findings of the CTF will be credible if they are accepted by the peoples of Indonesia and East Timor," he said.
