 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Thursday sent a letter asking the Election Commission (EC) to allow it to send a larger delegation to a meeting on electoral reforms talks. The Election Commission has invited the AL to send a 10-member delegation to talks. Tofail Ahmed, chairman of the AL committee on dialogue with the EC, told journalists after a committee meeting, "We have already written to the EC requesting them to receive a larger AL delegation at the talks." The AL committee on dialogue with the EC met at the party president's Dhanmondi office at noon. Tofail, also a member of the AL's policymaking presidium, said, "We have discussed the agenda of the talks with the Commission. We will sit in dialogue with the Election Commission on the basis of the 14-party guideline for reforms. We will, however, have other things to say besides the guideline for reforms." On Oct 22, a 16-member committee to deal with talks with the EC was formed with Tofail in the chair and party acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam as member secretary, following an AL Central Working Committee decision. The number of committee members was raised to 21 Wednesday. Tofail said, "Our party adviser Abul Maal Abdul Muhit has been given the responsibility to prepare a full draft for the talks and present it to the party's meeting on October 28." He said Muhit had earlier prepared some proposals in consultation with Sheikh Hasina before she was detained on reforms to the EC and the electoral system. "These will be our main talking points at talks with the EC." Tofail chaired the meeting at which Motia Chowdhury, Rahmat Ali, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Abu Sayeed, Mukul Bose, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Abdul Mannan, Md Akhteruzzaman, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin, KM Jahangir, Abdur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Abdul Mannan Khan and Raziuddin Ahmed Raju were present. bdnews24.com
