 LONDON, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All girls aged 12 to 13 in England will be vaccinated against the sexually transmitted virus that causes most cases of cervical cancer, the government said on Friday. From next autumn, girls will receive three injections at school over six months in a move that could save up to 400 lives each year, the Department of Health said.

"It is highly likely it will be one or the other," the department's Director of Immunisation, Professor David Salisbury, told a news conference. Britain is the latest European country to offer the vaccine routinely to girls, following similar moves by Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Norway. Many other countries around the world have also opted for vaccination, on the basis the investment will save lives and healthcare costs in the years ahead.

The injections are given to young girls because the vaccines do not work once a patient is already infect
