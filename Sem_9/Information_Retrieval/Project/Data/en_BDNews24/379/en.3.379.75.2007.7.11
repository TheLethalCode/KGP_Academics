<TEXT>
 MADRID, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona are close to signing Real Zaragoza's Argentine defender Gabriel Milito, president Joan Laporta said on Wednesday. "It is practically done. After yesterday's conversations it could happen this morning," Laporta told Catalunya Radio. Barcelona have been seeking to strengthen their defence after centre-back Carles Puyol picked up a knee ligament injury that will rule him out of the start of next season. The 26-year-old Milito, currently on duty with Argentina at the Copa America, has been a consistent performer at Zaragoza since moving from Independiente in 2003. He has a contract until 2010. Spanish media reported Barca were set to pay up to 20 million euros for Milito. He would become their fourth signing after France striker Thierry Henry, Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure and France left back Eric Abidal sealed moves to the Catalan club
