<TITLE> Defender Metzelder not worried by Real's attacking style </TITLE>

 MADRID, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany centre back Christoph Metzelder said at his Real Madrid unveiling on Wednesday that he was looking forward to the challenge of helping them build on their attacking reputation. The 26-year-old, whose contract with Borussia Dortmund expired at the end of last season, completed his move to the Spanish champions by putting pen to paper on a four-year deal. "Real are a team who like to play on the offensive which can be risky for the defence," Metzelder told a news conference. "But this is their philosophy, to play good football, and it puts extra responsibility on the defenders. It is a big challenge but I feel prepared for it." Metzelder, who is 1.94 metres tall, is the first player to be unveiled by Real since they secured Bernd Schuster as coach on Monday. He will be trying to fill what has become a problem position for Real in recent seasons and will have to fight for a place with Italian World and European Player of the Year Fabio Cannavaro and another new signing, Pepe. "Real are a great team and Cannavaro is one of the greatest players in the world. I look forward to learning from him but also to adding my qualities to the defence," said Metzelder. The fact that he was teaming up with a German compatriot in coach Schuster was not a factor that influenced Metzelder, however. "My contacts with Real started before he was coach so his being here was not a key factor," he added. "My job is simply to earn a place in the side." Metzelder joined Dortmund in 2000, won the Bundesliga two years later and played in the 2002 and 2006 World Cups
