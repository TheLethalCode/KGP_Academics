 BRUSSELS, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union member states must improve cooperation to prevent biological attacks, the executive Commission said on Wednesday. "When we react it's too late, we have to prevent (attacks)," EU Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini said. He was speaking after the Commission launched a public consultation on which measures should be taken to prevent intentional spreading of infectious illnesses or products such as anthrax. Five people died in the United States in 2001 after being exposed to anthrax. While individual EU member states have moved, especially since 2001, to protect themselves against biological attacks, the Commission proposals are meant to lead to the first EU-wide policy on bioterrorism. "It is a low risk but it is a risk that exists," EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou told a news conference. The Commission suggested the EU could help finance limited stocks of vaccines for highly contagious pathogens, noting that this had already been done for animals. "These solidarity stocks would be released in a crisis situation," it said. It also said security surrounding dangerous pathogens in non-military facilities could be improved and proposed to set EU-wide minimum security standards for bio-laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry. The European Commission also suggested a European system to certify reliable and trusted facilities and researchers, and to set up professional codes of conduct. Existing monitoring mechanisms could be improved, including speeding up laboratory testing and strengthening international cooperation. It said EU states lacked sufficient tools to test live and dangerous bio-substances and pathogens. The Commission said that although the risk of bioterrorist attacks had been statistically low, the effects could be devastating. The consultation, with industry and EU member states, is the first step to possible EU action next year.
