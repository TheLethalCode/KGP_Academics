<TITLE> Govt to pass Right to Information Act: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein Wednesday said the emergency government would pass the Right to Information Act. "The government decided in principle to pass the law. We have already a draft on the law in place," he told bdnews24.com. "A final decision will come soon," he said. The adviser's comment came hours after army chief General Moeen U Ahmed said he hoped the interim government would soon introduce the Right to Information Act to stop bureaucrats getting away with corruption and ensure transparency and accountability in government functioning. "I hope that in near future the caretaker government will introduce a Right to Information Act so that corrupt officials cannot hide behind the cloak of secrecy and escape punishment," Moeen said. The past coalition government designed a draft and placed it at a cabinet meeting, but it was not signed into a law. In Bangladesh, the Official Secrets Act (1923), the Evidence Act (1872), Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure (1960), and the Rules of Business (1996) are the laws that restrict people's rights of access to information. Speaking to a seminar Tuesday, Moeen emphasised policy initiatives and reforms adopted by many countries, such as the Freedom of Information Act, which "paves the way for transparency in political and bureaucratic functions". He also referred to the US Whistleblowers Act of 1978 to safeguarded civil servants from legal retribution by government in case they disclosed acts of corruption within their departments. "Similarly, in the UK 'Codes of Best Practice' for public bodies, members of parliament, civil servants and ministers were rewarded more for ensuring appropriate balance between government and the governed." "I personally think that these are particularly useful guidelines for Bangladesh and I would strongly recommend their introduction to ameliorate the system." bdnews2
