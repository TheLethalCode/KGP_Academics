 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) Former communications minister Barrister Nazmul Huda Tuesday threatened to boycott the court proceedings of his case, alleging that public prosecutors are influencing witnesses. He made the threat in court during the taking of witness statements in the case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against him and wife Sigma Huda. Huda told Judge Amar Kumar Roy of Special Judge's Court-3 set up in the Jatiya Sangsad premises: "If the court functions in this way, I won't come here from tomorrow. Just give me my punishment." He also said, "The public prosecutors are not allowing the court reporters to write down what the witnesses are actually saying. Instead the PPs are telling the witnesses how to reply during questioning." In reply to Huda's allegation in court, public prosecutor Shahnewaj Tipu said: "This is neither Paltan Maidan nor any podium for making speeches. One cannot say whatever he wishes in the courtroom." At the time the judge addressed both of them and said, "Instead of getting excited please remain silent while the other is speaking." Assistant director for the Anticorruption Commission Shafiqul Islam filed the case against the Huda couple with Dhanmondi Police Station on March 11 accusing them of taking bribes. Charges were framed in the case on July 5. The case proceedings said that Huda took Tk 2.4 crore in bribes from Mir Zahir Hossain, owner of contracting firm Mir Akhter Hossain Ltd. The bribe money was deposited in the account of the Weekly Khabarer Ontorale of which Huda's wife is the publisher. bdnews
