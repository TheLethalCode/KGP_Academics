 ISLAMABAD, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani forces stormed a mosque compound in the capital on Tuesday, killing up to 50 militants as they fought their way through an Islamic school where women and children were feared to be hiding. While militants mounted a last stand in the basements of the madrasa, commandos had yet to encounter any women and children, with more than two-thirds of the complex cleared. However, military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said rebel cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi was barricaded in a basement, using women and children as human shields. Three soldiers were killed and many more people wounded, while 50 militants were arrested, Arshad said. But he said these were initial casualty reports and the assault to end a week-long standoff at Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, was still in progress eight hours after it began. Women and children were feared to be in areas of the compound security forces had still to clear. "They have yet to be encountered." Arshad said. Nearly 30 loud blasts rocked the heart of Islamabad for an hour beginning at around 9.30 am (0430 GMT). There was no sound of gunfire. "It is now the final push," said a security official, who added that troops had failed to find anyone in one basement and were moving on to others. There were concerns the militants might resort to suicide bombs. Officials said on Monday militants had distributed suicide vests. Heavy loss of life among women and children could have serious repercussions for President Pervez Musharraf, who had been under pressure to confront the militants for some time. It was not known how many people might be left inside, but the religious affairs minister said on Sunday there were between 200 and 500, including women and children. The Lal Masjid has been a centre of militancy for years, known for its support for Afghanistan's Taliban and opposition to Musharraf's backing for the United States. In the first hours, the militants put up strong resistance, with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Soldiers came under fire from the minarets as they overran the mosque at the beginning of the assault, allowing 20 children to escape. After clearing the mosque, commandos, backed by paramilitary troops, swept resistance from the rooftop of the madrasa and worked they way down through the two-storey building. Explosions and sustained gunfire erupted immediately after talks to end a week-long standoff broke down. Thick smoke shrouded the compound that has been surrounded by troops since clashes with armed students broke out on July 3. TOO SCARED TO SURRENDER Beyond the razor wire barriers several hundred metres away, about a dozen anxious parents and relatives waited, most too upset to speak, but some voiced anger with the government. Lali Gul, a father from the northwestern town of Charsadda said he last spoke to his 16-year-old son Abdullah on Friday. "He said they were willing to come out but feared Rangers would fire on them," Gul said, referring to paramilitary forces. Reporters have been kept back from the compound and many residents of the neighbourhood -- under curfew for the past week -- have moved out. Before the assault began, at least 21 people were killed in the week-long standoff that followed months of mounting tension between the mosque's hardline clerics and the government. About 1,200 students left the mosque early on in the siege but the numbers leaving later slowed. Earlier on Tuesday, government negotiators announced that talks to end the standoff had failed. The government has been demanding radical cleric Ghazi and his 50 or 60 hardcore of fighters, who authorities say include wanted militants, surrender unconditionally or die. Ghazi refused, saying he would prefer martyrdom. He said he and the followers of his Taliban-style movement hoped their deaths would spark an Islamic revolution. The action against the mosque has raised fears of a militant backlash. A wanted Pakistani militant vowed revenge on Monday if the mosque were assaulted. For all the uncertainties, the Karachi Stock Exchange breached life highs on Monday, and the index gained another 0.5 percent on Tuesday, while the rupee, which trades under the central bank's managed float, was rock steady.
