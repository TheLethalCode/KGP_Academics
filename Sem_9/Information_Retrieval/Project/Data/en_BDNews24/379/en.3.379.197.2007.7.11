 LOS ANGELES, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Los Angeles Galaxy have complete faith in the long-term fitness of the England midfielder David Beckham despite a recent ankle injury. Beckham, 32, will be officially introduced as a Galaxy player on Friday and his new club president, Alexi Lalas, is confident the former England captain will be able to compete at the top level into his late thirties. "We looked at his injuries and we've been assured that David got the rest that he needed," Lalas told Reuters. "We were very fortunate that he had this time apportioned out so that he was going to get the rest because his injury was something that just required time. "This is a long-term project and we are not going to put him in any situation that puts him at risk and therefore doesn't help the team." Beckham has not played since hobbling off in the second half of Real Madrid's dramatic 3-1 comeback victory over Real Mallorca that sealed the Spanish league title midway through last month. He had previously twisted his ankle while playing for England against Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifying match and then aggravated it in his final appearance for Real 11 days later. Beckham, who joins the Galaxy from Real Madrid on a deal that will earn him an estimated $250 million over five years, subsequently had an ankle scan which revealed no long-term damage. "For every Teddy Sheringham or Paolo Maldini, there are many players who once they hit that 30 mark it starts to go downhill very quickly," Lalas added. "I would put David Beckham in the category of the Sheringhams and the Maldinis in that he takes care of his body, he understands his body. He works well. "He is much more rugged than people give him credit for and so I have no problems seeing him playing, and playing well, well into his mid- and possibly late-thirties." Former England striker Sheringham joined second division Colchester United from West Ham United last week on a free transfer at the age of 41. Italian defender Maldini, aged 38, captained AC Milan to European Cup success in May with a 2-1 win over Liverpool in the final. It was Maldini's record-equalling eighth final and the fifth European Cup success of his career
