 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday accused insurers of taking to unethical means to attract more business and evade tax. The adviser said Bangladesh's insurance market is at the initial stage. "It accounts for a tiny portion of the economy." "Although the number of companies has increased significantly, services have not been upgraded to the same extent." The adviser made the observation in his address to a workshop on "Contribution of insurance to Bangladesh economy" organised by the Insurance Association of Bangladesh at Sonargaon Hotel. "There is hardly any corporate governance in insurance companies in Bangladesh. At times some directors complain against others to serve their own purpose," Azizul said. "This intra-company battle hurts the industry." Acting IAB president Nizamuddin Ahmed chaired the function, joined by Dr Mahfuzul Haque, chief controller of insurance, as special guest. The finance adviser said insurers show a big chunk of money in so-called management costs in their financial statements, which is not truly incurred by the companiesa malpractice done to evade taxes. The adviser said regulators have to put pressure on insures to settle too many unsettled claims due for years. "Why do you need external pressure to do so despite legal bindings?" he said. "You guys are the vanguard of this business. Please make a soul searching," Azizul told businessmen. He asked the insurance companies to go for mergers to reduce costs. "You should think of mergers seriously as they can enlarge the scale of business, reduce costs, increase profits and strengthen the capability to resist risks," he said. On demand for bringing the insurance business under the finance ministry instead of commerce, the adviser said it could be done in near future. "We are reviewing a plan." Mahfuzul Haque rejected the industry's proposal to raise the ceiling for management costs to 60-65 percent. "It can be hardly at 25 percent from existing 18.5 percent." Haque, the chief regulator of insurance, said only two men cannot oversee the whole industry. There are 17 life insurance and 43 general insurance companies operating in Bangladesh. bd
