 WASHINGTON, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's board said on Monday that any country could nominate a candidate to succeed IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato, throwing open a job customarily given to Europeans. "Any executive director may submit a nomination, regardless of nationality, for the position, consistent with past practice," the board of IMF shareholder nations said in a statement, as some European members pushed to maintain a tradition of selecting the head of the institution. The 24-member IMF board, which is made up of the fund's member countries including Europeans, said it would meet later to finalize the selection procedure for one of the most important jobs in international finance. There is no rule that the head of the IMF must be from Europe, but in practice the role has always gone to a Euorpean since the inception of the organisation in 1945. Developing nations are challenging the custom whereby Europeans head the IMF and an American leads the World Bank, arguing that it no longer reflects the true balance of economic power since the rise of China and other giants. The United States indicated last week it would not challenge Europe's grip on the IMF captaincy since it just picked American Robert Zoellick for the top World Bank job. Earlier on Monday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched a drive to nominate former Socialist Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Khan to run the IMF, but Britain said the post does not necessarily have to be filled by a European. Strauss-Khan, 58, a respected advocate of social democratic economics, also won the backing of chairman of the 13-nation euro zone, Jean-Claude Juncker, to succeed Rato, who steps down in October. In 2004, Britain also demanded a transparent selection process for the job amid a Franco-German deal that backed Frenchman Jean Lemierre, who now heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Rato, who had the backing of Britain and the United States, was eventually chosen for the job after former senior IMF official, Mohamed El-Erian, was nominated as a second candidate by IMF Egyptian director, Shakour Shaalan. "The UK will support an open, transparent and meritocratic process for selecting the next managing director," Britain's new Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a letter to the IMF board on Monday, in which he formally resigned, as expected, as chairman of the IMF's policy-setting committee. As chairman of the International Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC), Brown led a grouping of 24 finance ministers or central bank governors in advising on IMF issues and functioning of the global financial system.
