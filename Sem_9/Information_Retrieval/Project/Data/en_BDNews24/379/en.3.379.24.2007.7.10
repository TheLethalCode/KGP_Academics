 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief Moeen U Ahmed Tuesday said the general elections would be held by the end of 2008, in an echo of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. General Moeen, taking a question from a former Awami League lawmaker, said the future government must press ahead with the current anticorruption drive, launched by the emergency government. Moeen referred to a European Union troika's visit to Bangladesh in answering the question and said: "Troika asked me the same question. I assured [them] that the election would take place in December 2008." "Let me give you the same answer. Wait till 2008 and see," he told a seminar at Radisson Water Garden Hotel in Dhaka. In his keynote paper on "Democratic Accountability and Way to Curb Corruption, Moeen said: "As we have seemingly crossed onto the sixth month of emergency period, my understanding is mostly on the feedback and reflection of our people, who followed precepts in the past six months in the absence of a foundation of national leadership." "We are more sanguine today about what lay ahead of us, than what had been in the past--better remembered for its archival lessons. I found the people of Bangladesh supportive, convinced, determined and reform-oriented," he told the seminar organised by Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. Moeen focused his thought on democracy which he said often acts like an elixir. "Right from its inception, Bangladesh sought a democratic way of governance with a mechanism of state institutions rather than through the dynamics of a civil society. "Though democracy has its own fragility to complete a desired cycle, missing ingredients obviously come in absence of a system of transparency and accountability. "The cost might be a generation loss in terms of ethical values, qualities and basic essentials. "What had been messy for Bangladesh that drew high public attention was a vibrant and aspiring democracy challenged on non-governance through corruption that questioned the country's credibility both nationally and internationally." Moeen said the World Bank estimate has shown that GDP growth would have increased by 4 percent if the funds were utilised appropriately. Unfortunately 70 percent of the government grants for village infrastructure developments in 2000-01 amounting to about Tk 331 crore remained unaccounted-for, he said referring to the multilateral lending agency. The army chief said it was claimed that financial irregularity, corruption and plundering of about Tk 900 crore had taken place in 28 projects of the Public Health Engineering Directorate under the local government ministry. "Therefore, funds intended for poverty alleviation have been misappropriated and the poor people most in need of this assistance were deprived," he said. Moeen emphasised policy initiatives and reforms adopted by many countries, such as the Freedom of Information Act, which "paves the way for transparency in political and bureaucratic functions". He also referred to the US Whistleblowers Act of 1978 to safeguarded civil servants from legal retribution by government in case they disclosed acts of corruption within their departments. "Similarly, in the UK 'Codes of Best Practice' for public bodies, members of parliament, civil servants and ministers were rewarded more for ensuring appropriate balance between government and the governed." "I personally think that these are particularly useful guidelines for Bangladesh and I would strongly recommend their introduction to ameliorate the system." bdn
