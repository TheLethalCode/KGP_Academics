 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Wednesday hoped the interim government would soon introduce a Right to Information Act to stop bureaucrats getting away with corruption, and ensure transparency and accountability in government functioning. "I hope that in near future the caretaker government will introduce a Right to Information Act so that corrupt officials cannot hide behind the cloak of secrecy and escape punishment," General Moeen said. He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the workshop co-organised by the Global Organisation of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC) and the US-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. Gone are those days of secrecy when information on top brasses used to be hushed up or blanketed as 'secret' or 'not to be shared'. "Now you can see even vehicles through Google Earth," the army chief said at a question-answer session following his formal deliberation. The army chief said government officials refuse to provide information to media using the Official Secrecy Act, 1962 and the act should be abolished. He alluded to the cases of India and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council where the media and the people can rightfully access all the information they need without an official bar. He recommended appointment of a parliamentary ombudsman, establishment of an independent and neutral judicial system, punishment and social boycott of the corrupt persons. Moeen came down hard on the 'corrupt' activities in the education and NGO sectors and said stressed that the ongoing anticorruption drive should be pushed ahead. He again said the military was not ruling the country. Presided over by GOPAC vice president Naser Al Sane, the workshop was attended by Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar as chief guest. Some 40 participants, mostly lawmakers, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Kuwait, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lank and the US, are taking part in the two-day workshop. He criticised the BNP-Jamaat government and said had the government taken measures against corruption in the education sector, corruption would have been remarkably low by now. "There are some ghost schools and ghost teachers. I am sure the government knew about it, but no actions were taken." "The present government is looking into it in detail to make people accountable. At the moment, one of the tasks of our forces that I've given is that 'please go and look after the education system'," he said. "There are NGOs doing very well. But there are some NGOs making money," he said to a question of a foreign participant. On the donor-funded development projects, General Moeen said, "While foreign donors have played a significant role in development strategies of regional countries, the fight against corruption has generated controversies as well." He said foreign aid or investment had political and strategic considerations attached to them rather than having the economic needs and policy reforms of the recipients as priority issues. bdnews24.
