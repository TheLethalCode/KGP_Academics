<TITLE> Hasina alone cannot decide reforms: Hamid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Senior Awami League leader Abdul Hamid Wednesday said party president Sheikh Hasina cannot take unilateral decision on reforms. The former Jatiya Sangsad speaker told reporters at a briefing in his NAM flat that the council would finalise the reform proposals, if any. "It is not possible to bring about any changes without Sheikh Hasina. Similarly, the chief too cannot do it without us," Hamid said. He said it was wrong to equate Hasina with her political rival BNP chief Khaleda Zia On the so-called reform proposals presented by AL presidium members Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta, Hamid said it would suffice if they placed the proposals before the executive committee. He termed Suranjit's reform proposal as "self contradictory" in that he proposed for reverting to the 1972 constitutional dictates and that the president should be vested with the executive power to dissolve the parliament. On the three presidium members proposing that nobody should hold the seats of the party president and general secretary for more than two terms, Hamid said, "The three leaders only spoke their minds. They'd better thrash out the issues in the working committee meetings." He ruled out the possibilities of the two top leaders sharing some common positions. "It's impossible to expect any union between the two leaders. We are also against it. Sheikh Hasina's stance on such issues should be even stronger." "The two will never unite even if it means they have to quit politics." On army chief General Moeen U Ahmed's expectation that the next government would bring changes to the constitution, he said there was no necessity to change the constitution. It is the people who should change their attitudes and propensities, he said. "The constitution is adequately replete, as it is," he said emphatically. He slammed law adviser Mainul Hosein for his suggestion that both Hasina and Khaleda should now step down. "Awami League doesn't heed to anyone's passing comments. He (Mainul) is a barrister. He might reconsider his comment and decide if what he said was right or erratic." "Corruption was always been practised in the country, more or less. Well, it assumed untenable proportions after 2001," Hamid said. All lawmakers elected since independence should come up with a white paper laying out all their acquisitions and possessions for the people to know, he said. bdnews24.com/su
