<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  The makeshift government has braced for fast-tracking massive administrative reforms, said Aminul Islam, secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office Tuesday. "Directed by the chief adviser, the Cabinet Division is working on the reorganisation of administration," Aminul Islam told bdnews24.com by telephone. "To reach services to the grassroots, the caretaker government will implement the reform related recommendations earnestly." Sources familiar with Cabinet Division deliberations said the reforms include rationalising the number of ministries, specifying responsibilities for each ministry, and publicising ministries' activities. Preparing and publicising a citizen's charter, simplifying longstanding rules and regulations and other essential measures for ensuring grassroots-friendly services are the other reforms the interim administration was pursuing, the sources said. As a first step to effecting administrative reforms, all the committees and commissions formed to date have been reviewed and a preliminary set of recommendations has been drafted in line with the needs of the present times. The draft recommendations have been forwarded to the Cabinet Division and work on fine-tuning them was on, they added. The government has reviewed reports of six committees and commissions formed for administrative reforms, which include Muyeed Committee, Enam Committee, Tanveer Committee, Nurul Haque Committee and ATM Shamsul Haque Commission. The recommendations, if executed, aim to reduce a number of ministries and merge them with the surviving ones, depending on their nature of work and jurisdictions. The two current ministries of expatriates' welfare and of labour and manpower were one entity in the past. The BNP-led government separated the two, raising the number of ministries. The Fakhruddin-led government has overhauled the Anticorruption Commission, Election Commission and Public Service Commission. With political parties also considering reforms within, people now expect the government to complete administrative reforms at the earliest. A top Cabinet Division official told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity that the initiative of undertaking administrative reforms originated at the CA's Office under the chief adviser's directives. The advisory committee on administration is the focal point of all activities towards administrative reforms. The members of the committee are finance, education, industry and health advisers. Six secretaries in charge of the Cabinet Division, CA's Office, establishment, finance, planning, and law, justice and parliamentary affairs have been tasked to assist in the reform deliberations. bdnews24.c
