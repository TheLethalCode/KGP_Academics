 LONDON, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea have completed the signing of 27-year-old French international Florent Malouda from Lyon, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday. The winger, who moved from the French champions for an undisclosed fee, signed a four-year deal and will join the squad later on Tuesday in Los Angeles where they are on tour. On Sunday a Lyon source said the transfer fee would be around 20 million euros ($27.26 million) after Lyon had originally valued the player at 25 million euros. Malouda, a powerful left-footed attacking midfielder, joined Lyon from Guingamp in 2003 and has played 30 times for France, scoring three goals. He is the third major player to leave Lyon since the end of last season after Portugal midfielder Tiago and France defender Eric Abidal, who moved to Juventus and Barcelona. Chelsea, who lost their Premier League title to Manchester United last season, have been relatively quiet during the transfer window so far. Steve Sidwell joined from Reading while Peru striker Claudio Pizarro swapped Bayern Munich for Stamford Bridge on a free transfer. Malouda joins former Lyon team mate Michael Essien at Chelsea, after the Ghana midfielder made the move two years ago for 24 million pounds ($48.36 million)
