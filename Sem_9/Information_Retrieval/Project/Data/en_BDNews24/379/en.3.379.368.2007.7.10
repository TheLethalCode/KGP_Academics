 NEW YORK, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Can't hold it but dread visiting a public restroom? At the push of a few buttons on your cell-phone, you can now get a list of the nearest, cleanest public facilities. Mizpee is a new web service that lets users open a web browser on their phone to Mizpee.com or send a text message to get a list of nearby bathrooms, along with cleanliness ratings ranging from one to five rolls and user-generated comments. Peter Olfe, who set up the advertisement-funded service for fledgling location-based mobile service Yojo Mobile, said he was inspired to create the site after visiting a bathroom "that was so dirty I had a splitting headache within two minutes."

He is also eyeing expansion to London, Paris and Beiji
