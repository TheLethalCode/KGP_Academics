<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) - A penalty strike from Nazrul Islam helped Dhaka Abahani Limited cross a hurdle with a 1-0 win over Brothers Union in the crucial encounter of the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Wednesday. The outcome put the popular sky blues outfit on the top of the 11-team table with 35 points from 16 outings, two points ahead of Muktijoddha Sangsad KS, who have 33 points playing a match more than Abahani. Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club have 32 points from 16 matches to stay in the third position and Brothers Union are in the fifth position with 23 points playing 16 as many matches. After the barren first half, Nazrul converted the spot kick in the 60th minute to give Abahani 10th win in the league as Abahani Ghanaian striker Auwdu Ibrahim was brought down in the danger zone by Brothers defender Shahanur Islam Ronny. Title contenders Abahani comparatively enjoyed the superior ball possession over the All-Orange outfit, whose players mostly were concentrated on their defense zone and hardly produced any fruitful attack. Abahani launched the first attack in the seventh mintue with the combination of Ibrul Siraji and Ibrahim, but the effort went in vain from the goal-mouth mele. One minute later, Ibrahim saw his powerful shot denied by his comrade Jahid Hasan Amili. Brothers Union went to the attack in the 39th minute, but Moroccan medio Hicham Inani missed the target narrowly with a 30-yard shot going outside. Nazrul separated both sides converting a penalty shot in the 60th minute after referee Hannan Miron awarded Abahani to a spot kick after Brothers defender Ronny tackled Ibrahim badly inside the box. In last 10 minutes, Abahani mounted huge pressure on the opponents and created a couple of good scoring chances, but they failed to cash in on the efforts. Ibrahim from the left set Amili at the edge of the Brothers box, but the unmarked striker sent it wide with only Brothers goalie Nizam Majumder to beat in the 82nd minute. In the next minute, Abahani were deprived of a goal as a close range shot by substitute Shahajuddin Tipu was denied by the woodwork and goalie Nizam gripped the ball to save his side.
