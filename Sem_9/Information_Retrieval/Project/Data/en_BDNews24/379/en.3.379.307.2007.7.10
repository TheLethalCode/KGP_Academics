 LONDON, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain condemned Russia's refusal to extradite the main suspect in the murder of emigre Alexander Litvinenko as "unacceptable" on Tuesday and said it was reviewing cooperation with Moscow. A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Russia's response was "extremely disappointing" and Britain was unsure that suspect Andrei Lugovoy, a former state security agent, would get a fair trial if it was held in Russia. "We are reviewing the situation and considering what further steps we can take. We consider this a serious matter," the spokesman said, adding that all options were being considered. "Russia is an important partner on many issues and we continue to seek a constructive relationship with them but given their refusal to co-operate on this matter, we need to carefully consider our range of co-operation on a range of issues."

"The allegation against Mr Lugovoy is that he murdered a British citizen by deliberate poisoning," director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald said in a statement. "The appropriate venue for his trial is therefore London." Brown's spokesman said the government remained convinced Lugovoy should answer the case against him in a British court. "We do not have full confidence that a trial in Moscow would meet the standards of impartiality and fairness that would be necessary," he said. Litvinenko's murder has soured already difficult relations between London and Moscow. In a statement read out by associates after his death, Litvinenko accused Putin of having a hand in his murder. The Kremlin dismissed the charge as nonsense and accused Britain of harbouring emigres bent on blackening Russia's na
