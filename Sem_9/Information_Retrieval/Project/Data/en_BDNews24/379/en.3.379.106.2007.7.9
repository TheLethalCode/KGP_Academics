 BIRMINGHAM, England, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England left-arm spin bowler Ashley Giles, recovering from a third hip operation in 18 months, must decide whether to risk his long-term health with another comeback. Giles, his country's number one spinner from his debut in 1998 until Monty Panesar's emergence last year, believes he is still good enough to play for England but is aware of the danger of further injury. "I'm in constant touch with surgeons and medical people on my condition about what the long-term implications would be if I went back to cricket," Giles, who has taken 143 wickets in 54 tests, told Reuters in an interview. "It's very difficult to talk about at the moment because cricket is what I do and what I have done for 20 years almost. It's great to keep going and say 'I'll be fine' but the chances of a recurrence are very high and I can't keep going through operations. "If it's felt that this will do me (long-term) damage then I will take that advice and use it because I certainly don't want to be looking at hip replacements in the near future." Giles, speaking in Birmingham where he was attending a 'Chance to Shine' initiative aimed at developing more cricket in schools, said he was four weeks off running again and three months from playing again. ASHES SELECTION The Warwickshire player was controversially selected ahead of Panesar for the first two Ashes Tests in November and December after missing a year of cricket due to the original injury. His hip gave way again at the start of the English season in April. "Last year I had a light at the end of the tunnel to aim for which was the Ashes and I don't have that this year so it's become a lot harder to battle on through. "The latest injury was a shock as it was a new injury in the same hip. I tore a cartilage in the centre of the hip and it was an absolute kick in the teeth. I was aware straight away that it was something quite serious because it just didn't go away." He will watch England in the series against India and admire his successor at work, as Panesar has risen to number six in the test rankings. "It's great, he has done really well in test cricket," Giles said. "It's been brilliant for the team because he has helped England win games.
