 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) Bangabandhu Memorial Trust has turned in documents and account details to an anticorruption taskforce, a member of the trustee board said Tuesday. Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and other members of the trust have spent the last few days reviewing the organisation's papers and accounts, which had been sought by graft busters. The trustee board member told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named, that Hasina sat with trustees to make sure the accounts were up-to-date. Trustees said various organisations, including Chittagong Abahani Club, gave Tk 30,000 in grants to Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Tuesday. bdnews24.c
