 STOCKHOLM, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden's migration minister has insisted his government is not dodging its responsibilities after two Iraqis were denied asylum on the basis of a court ruling that said Iraq was not in armed conflict. Sweden, a country of just 9 million people that is not involved in the conflict, takes in more Iraqi refugees than any other European country. But the rejection of the Iraqis outraged the Swedish Red Cross, which said the ruling was absurd. Migration Minister Tobias Billstrom insisted the system was fair. "We do not want to return to the old, bad system where it was politicians who, behind closed doors, made the decision about who is going to stay and who is not," he told Reuters in an interview late on Monday. Sweden's migration board ruled last week that an Iraqi from Baghdad and another from southern Iraq had not shown they were personally in danger if returned to their country. In a third case, the board said a Christian Iraqi had demonstrated he was personally in danger in his home city and he was granted asylum. The decisions were based on a ruling by a Swedish court earlier this year that held that Iraq was not an armed conflict. "There is no automatic mechanism in claiming asylum in Sweden. Every single case has to be judged on its own," said Billstrom. "We look on this from a purely legal point of view." "ABSURD DECISION" But Christer Zettergren, secretary general of the Swedish Red Cross, said: "It's an absurd decision to make from the court ... Of course there is an internal armed conflict. "If these are the consequences, and the court says this is the law, then it's back in the hands of the politicians," he said. "Then we have to change the law." According to Iraqi government figures, 1,227 civilians died violently in June. Last weekend alone, attacks killed at least 250 people. Billstrom said the picture was a mixed one. "We have a very bad situation in some parts of Iraq. However, we have also seen that there are other parts of Iraq which are more stable than others. And one has to consider the internally displaced's alternatives ... "This is not something for me, or the Swedish government, to decide," he said. "We are of course, like all nations, concerned about costs. But I have to say very frankly that that is not a matter for this debate. It's not the cost that concerns us, only the right which is connected with the asylum seeker." Billstrom, at 33 the youngest senior minister in the centre-right government, appealed to other European countries to do more to deal with the rising tide of refugees. According to official figures, 8,951 Iraqis came to Sweden last year, far more than from any other country and 45 percent of the total who came to Europe. Christian Iraqis, fearing persecution in their homeland, make up a large part of that influx. Sweden's appeal to Iraqis lies in its relative openness to refugees and in its established Iraqi community of more than 82,0
