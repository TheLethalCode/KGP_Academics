<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Anticorruption taskforces have piled "evidence" of corruption and tax-dodging against 18 more people, adviser MA Matin said Wednesday. The national coordination committee designed to deal with serious crimes will send files on evidence to the National Board of Revenue and the Anticorruption Commission by Thursday, Matin told reporters in his secretariat office. Of the 18 people, 13 stand accused of having corruption ties and filing flawed wealth statements, and the rest allegedly dodged taxes. Matin, also chairman of the coordination committee, said that 42 taskforces worked on the allegations. He briefed reporters on the July 9 meeting of the committee. The committee members and 10 lawyers reviewed the files, he said. The taskforces earlier helped investigate 80 cases. The adviser stressed making the taskforces permanent to cooperate with the ACC to curb corruption. bdnew
