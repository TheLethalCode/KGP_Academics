 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The government gets more than double the amount of foreign exchange from telecoms if it injects competition in the international voice gateway, according to a GSM Association's latest study. The long-overdue reform "would lead to a major rise in call volumes and a 125 percent increase in government revenues from international gateway services in 2008". The study criticised Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board and said international calls are "hard to complete" through BTTB's monopoly gateway and yet the charges are "excessively expensive". The government should immediately "dismantle" BTTB's "international gateway monopoly", said the report prepared jointly by CRA International and Gilbert & Tobin for the GSM Association. It also said the country's telecoms regulation needs broader reforms "if the world's seventh most populous country is to realise the full social and economic benefits that flow from the widespread use of mobile phones". The study urges the telecoms regulator's immediate strengthening "so that it can more efficiently allocate spectrum and issue licences for 3G mobile services before the third-quarter of 2008". It said Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission should have "adequate funding and budget authority to enable it to act independently and acquire and retain appropriate expertise, particularly in the vital areas of spectrum management and licence enforcement". The study blamed BTRC's process of allocating frequency being "inefficient" and said "the country's mobile operators don't have sufficient spectrum to enable them to provide services to more Bangladeshis". It has asked BTRC for an immediate strategic spectrum review and then allocate spectrum in the internationally harmonised 2100 megahertz band for third generation mobile services before the third quarter of 2008. "This spectrum should be licensed in a way that reflects its economic value and ensures it is efficiently used," the study said. The report also urges the government to remove "taxes that inhibit the growth of the sector, such as taxes on new SIM cards and handset and equipment imports". It said the telecoms capital equipment should have import duty no higher than 5 to 6 percent. "Bangladesh is characterised by an unusual asymmetric interconnection regime, through which the mobile sector subsidises fixed networks." As the subsidies are holding back overall access to telecoms services in Bangladesh, the interconnection arrangements should be revised and suitable fixed-to-mobile wholesale charges introduced, the report said. bdn
