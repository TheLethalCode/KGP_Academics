 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former BRTC chairman Taimur Alam Khondoker Wednesday was remanded in custody for three days and former BNP lawmaker M Naser Rahman for five days. Magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court for Dhaka gave police three days to grill Taimur after sub-inspector Arshed Ali of Paltan Police Station appealed for a seven-day remand. According to case details, Taimur in 2003 listed 200 affected auto-rickshaw owners and allocated CNG-run auto-rickshaws for them at a lower price through Uttara Motors. He allegedly added 50 fake names to the list and pocketed the money. Auto-rickshaw owner Fazlul Haque of Nayatola area of the city on May 5 filed the case with Paltan Police Station. The same court allowed police to question Naser, the son of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, for five days. He was an MP from Moulvibazar-3 constituency. Deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission Golam Shahrier Chowdhury Monday appealed to the court for a seven-day remand. Metropolitan magistrate Jagannath Das Khokon approved a five-day remand after hearing the appeal. bdnew
