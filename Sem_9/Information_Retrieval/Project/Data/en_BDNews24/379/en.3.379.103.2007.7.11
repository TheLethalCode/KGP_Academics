<TITLE> Revealed: Holiday service stations hall of shame </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, JUly 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Italy's motorway service stations are among the worst in Europe, blighted by litter, dirty toilets and dangerous parking, according to a survey released on Wednesday. While nearly all of Britain's services passed the test, inspectors warned drivers heading south this summer to avoid a string of roadside stations near the holiday resorts of northern Italy. The survey of 65 facilities offering fuel, food and parking in 12 countries was carried out by EuroTest, a group of European motoring organizations. Bottom of the pile was Ventimiglia Autoporto north on Italy's A10 motorway near the French border. Visitors are 'in for a nasty surprise', the inspectors said in a report. "Pedestrians have to run the gauntlet of traffic while walking through parked cars, past run-down outdoor facilities," they said. "The toilets and showers are appalling. "People with disabilities and children appeared to be not welcome at all. The toilet for the disabled was in the cellar." Inspectors rated five of the seven Italian service areas they visited as poor or very poor, let down by badly laid-out car parks, dirty facilities and litter. The food and coffee, however, was good and reasonably priced. Despite their reputation as dreary and uninviting, British service stations have improved over the years, the survey said. All but one of the six tested were 'acceptable', although the food was often 'uninspiring' and the price of a basket of basic items varied by 110 percent between venues. Toddington services, north of Luton on the M1, was described as poor, let down by shabby toilets, poor food and unmotivated staff, the report said. Drivers heading for continental Europe this summer will find the most attractive services in Germany, Croatia and Slovenia. The best was Germany's Medenbach, on the A3 motorway west of Frankfurt.
