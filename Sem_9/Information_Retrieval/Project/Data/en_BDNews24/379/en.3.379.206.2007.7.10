 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Rifles fears that the proposed Dhaka-Kolkata direct passenger train service will facilitate the movement of cross-border terrorists and arms if customs and immigration checks are completed in Dhaka. The meeting between Bangladeshi and Indian delegations Tuesday decided that the customs and immigration facilities would be provided at Dhaka Cantonment station before the start of the journey to Kolkata, while India is poised to complete its customs and immigration formalities at Gede station close to the border. A letter received by joint secretary of the ministry of communications Shafique Alam Mehedi on Tuesday termed the decision "suicidal" and "a threat to the national interest". bdnews24.com has obtained a copy of the letter signed by Major Mahmudul Hasan on behalf of the director general of BDR. BDR suggested that customs and immigration formalities should be carried out either at a makeshift station at the border in case of urgency or at Gede in India by upgrading the Indian station to a secure station with international standards. However Tuesday's meeting ruled out the possibility of customs and immigration checks at Gede. "We have decided to complete the customs and immigration facilities in Dhaka (Cantonment station)," Shafique Alam Mehedi told bdnews24.com after the meeting in his Railway Bhaban office. Commenting on BDR's letter, he said if necessary the government would take stock of the objections. "Completion of customs and immigration formalities in Dhaka will be a suicidal decision and a threat to the national interest," the letter said. The reasons behind such a threat, according to the letter, include lack of a boundary wall around the Cantonment station and lack of proper security arrangements. The BDR fears that it will therefore be impossible to restrict the movement of cross-border terrorists and other security threats. The letter also claimed if the train slows down during the journey for technical or other reasons embarking or disembarking of cross-border terrorists will increase and smuggling of arms and ammunition would be impossible to stop In addition, the letter warned: "The decision will increase the smuggling of drugs, especially of Phensidyl." bdnews2
