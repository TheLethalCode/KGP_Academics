 TOKYO, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average slipped 1.11 percent on Wednesday to its lowest finish in nearly two weeks, hurt by a tumble in U.S. stocks and a stronger yen. Investors sold a wide range of stocks including high-tech exporters such as Sony Corp. that had led the market's recent rally. Shares of Aeon Co. Ltd. fell 3.1 percent to 2,195 yen after Japan's second-biggest retail group said on Tuesday that quarterly operating profit fell 16 percent due to poor sales at its US apparel unit Talbots Inc. and some goodwill charges. Millea Holdings Inc. and other insurers also declined on concerns that a fall in bond yields would hurt income from investments in government bonds. Insurers invest much of the money they collect from policy holders in bonds. NEC Electronics Corp. was untraded due to a glut of buy orders at 3,670 yen, up 16 percent from Tuesday's close, following news that U.S. investment fund Perry Capital has joined a growing list of foreign shareholders pressuring weak Japanese firms by offering to buy a further 25 percent stake in the ailing chip maker from parent NEC Corp. for $1.25 billion. Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, said global equities seem to be heading into a short-term correction. "From the perspective of liquidity, there iU.S. stock moves and currencies as investors hold back ahead of an election for the upper house of Japan's parliament later this month. After the closing bell, Tokyo Electron Ltd. said orders for its chip- and display-making equipment in April-June fell 35 percent from the previous quarter's record to about 140 billion yen ($1.15 billion), on slower demand from DRAM makers. SONY, EXPORTERS DOWN Shares of high-tech exporters tumbled, with Sony down 2 percent at 6,330 yen, while Canon Inc. declined 2.3 percent to 6,960 yen and Kyocera Corp. fell 1.2 percent to 12,880 yen. Auto shares were also down. Toyota Motor Corp. lost 1.7 percent to 7,660 yen and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. retreated 1.3 percent to 4,470 yen. A stronger yen weighs on exporters as it cuts the value of their overseas sales when translated back into the Japanese currency. Shares of Millea were down 2.8 percent at 5,150 yen, Sompo Japan Insurance Inc. fell 2.8 percent to 1,480 yen and Nipponkoa Insurance Co. lost 2.9 percent to 1,115 yen. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond plunged 8 basis points to a one-week low of 1.880 percent as of 0612 GMT, reflecting worries about the subprime mortgage market and the deteriorating housing market in the United States, which pushed investors to buy bonds. Shares of NEC advanced 1.4 percent to 639 yen. Elsewhere, there was only a single transaction in shares of Bull-Dog Sauce Co. Ltd., which was otherwise untraded and was quoted at 725 yen, down 12.1 percent. U.S. hedge fund Steel Partners said it has appealed to Japan's Supreme Court over a court ruling in favour of Bull-Dog Sauce's anti-takeover defences.
