 PARIS, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks dropped on Wednesday, retreating for a second consecutive session after signs the crisis affecting the US high-risk mortgages sector was worsening, fuelling worries about the economy. Banking shares were among the worst hit, while a drop in the US dollar to a record low against the euro weighed on shares of exporters. At 1038 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.55 percent, at 1,598.08. Despite the sharp two-day losing streak, Europe's benchmark index is still up 7.7 percent so far this year. "Trouble brewing in the subprime sector is back at the top of investors' worries," said Valerie Plagnol, chief strategist at CM-CIC Securities, in Paris. "Coupled with that, there are yesterday's profit warnings from U.S. companies related to the real estate sector, which give hints about the U.S. macroeconomic picture," she said. "The concern for Europe is to see what will exactly be the impact of all this on U.S. consumer spending." On Tuesday, U.S. shares fell after two credit rating agencies started to slash ratings for more than $17.3 billion of U.S. mortgage-related debt, raising concerns the sector's woes are worse than previously thought. The news sparked selling in non-government bonds, stocks and the dollar, which prompted investors to flock to the safety of government debt. "We're seeing a flight-to-quality in government bonds, but it has not prevented the dollar from dropping," Plagnol said. The euro set a record high of $1.3784, according to Reuters data, before easing back to $1.3741 by 1044 GMT. In the financial sector, UBS lost 1.7 percent, BNP Paribas shed 1.6 percent and Credit Suisse dropped 1.3 percent. The strength of the euro hit exporters and automobile stocks in particular. BMW dropped 2 percent, DaimlerChrysler fell 2.4 percent and Volkswagen shed 1.8 percent. DaimlerChrysler shares got an extra knock from market talk of possible financing difficulties for the sale of the US carmaking division Chrysler to Cerberus, though Daimler said it was not aware of any problems. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 1.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.8 percent. Among the few stocks on the rise, UK satellite broadcaster BSkyB was up 4.5 percent to top the FTSEurofirst 300 gainers after releasing an upbeat trading update. Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc rose 3 percent on market speculation it is interesting for peers Colgate-Palmolive or Procter & Gamble or private equity firms. AstraZeneca climbed 2.7 percent after Morgan Stanley turned positive on the drugmaker for the first time in two years, rating the stock "overweigh
