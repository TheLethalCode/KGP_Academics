<TITLE> Hilsha export ban only to shore up supply: CS Karim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  Fisheries adviser CS Karim Monday said the government clamped the six-month bar on hilsha export to make the fish easily available to the people. He believed the move would make hilsha supply to the market normal in two weeks and its price will remain within the easy reach of the people. Karim was briefing newsmen at his conference room on Monday. "Following the ban on 'Jatka' catch for three months in the current year, the supply of hilsha has gone up with big hilsha available in the market. "But hilsha was beyond the reach of the middle class because of its export to some countries at a cheap price. "To overcome this situation and also to meet nutritional needs, the government decided to stop hilsha export", the adviser explained. "The government may allow re-export of hilsha if there was any surplus." Asked if India had threatened to stop exporting rice to Bangladesh following hilsha export ban, the adviser said export was not halted for any particular country. Rather, this decision was taken to maintain the internal supply of fish. On the high price of hilsha, Karim said," In a free market economy, it is not possible to reduce the price by mounting pressure on businessmen." "But some steps including monitoring of the market and increase in the supply of fish are being taken to bring down the price." The adviser spoke of steps such as improvement of landing stations and retail markets, and setting up new markets. Even with the decision to stop export, the price will not come down overnight, he said. But the fish price is comparatively high in the upmarket, he added. Director general of the fishery department Nazrul Islam said before banning hilsha export, one kg of hilsha sold at Tk 500, but now it sells at Tk 375. The price of a hilsha weighing from half kg to one kg has come down to Tk 300 from Tk 400, he added. bdnews24.com
