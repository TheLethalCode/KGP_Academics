 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)- Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) said the mobile phone market of Bangladesh will have over 35 million customers in 2007 and it could be more than double by 2010 "if there is no regulatory surprise." "The macroeconomic indicators of Bangladesh support an estimated 75 million mobile phone users by 2010," NSN's country head Khalid Khan told bdnews24.com on the sidelines of "Mobile South Asia" being held in Dhaka Sheraton. This is 25 million higher than Grameenphone's latest prediction. Citing Pakistan's example of investing nearly three billion euros in telecoms during next two years, Khan said, "There is no reason why Bangladesh cannot attract similar volume of FDI." "The foreign investors have demonstrated significant confidence in Bangladesh." Egypt's Orascom and UAE's Dhabi Group fully owns Banglalink and Warid Telecom. Telekom Malaysia owns Aktel's 70 percent, Norwegian Telenor has Grameenphone's 62 percent and Singapore Telecom and others own 78 percent stake in CityCell. Which means 82 percent ownership of the mobile phone industry, except TeleTalk, belongs to foreign investors. "Now the government should encourage these companies to inject more cash into their networks." Khan believes direct taxes should be axed to make mobile phone more affordable. Using the "Golden Goose" analogy he said, "The (Bangladesh) government should look beyond next year's budget and measure the overall benefits of mobile phone proliferation instead." Encouraged by the ongoing reforms initiatives, Khan said: "The telecoms regulator should assess the mobile phone industry's productivity impacts and advise the taxation authorities accordingly." "Pakistan Telecom Authority has facilitated tax reduction, which has directly contributed to the sectoral growth and influx of FDI," he said. Acknowledging the progressive move, the GSM Association honoured Pakistan with the best regulator's award in 2006. Earlier in his formal presentation, Khan cited Australian research outfit BIS Shrapnel that said Bangladesh would have 57 million mobile phone users in 2010. He also quoted investment firm Merrill Lynch, which believes it will be 60 million by then. Khan has further lifted the outlook and projected 70 million mobile customers by 2010. "I think NSN's is an optimistic forecast unless the current regulatory environment improves," GP's chief marketing officer Stein Naevdal told bdnews24.com about NSN's prediction. South Asian GSM operators forum chairman Mehboob Chowdhury also thinks NSN's forecast is achievable "only if the government withdraws all direct taxes". The operators in Bangladesh "have been subsidising all direct taxes and yet you expect them to bring investment from overseas!" said Chowdhury, the founding father of Grameenphone's marketing success who later headed Banglalink's growth until resigning last year. Despite the barriers, investors, analysts, vendors and operators are equally sanguine about the Bangladesh mobile market having 70 million subscribers by 2010, unless the government blunders. bdn
