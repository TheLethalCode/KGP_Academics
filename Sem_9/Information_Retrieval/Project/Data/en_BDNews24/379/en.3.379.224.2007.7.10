 LOS ANGELES, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Victoria Beckham, who with British soccer star husband David Beckham makes a much anticipated move to Los Angeles this week, scoffed on Monday at suggestions she wanted to launch a Hollywood movie career. "I must be the only person in Los Angeles who doesn't want to be in films," Beckham joked. "I don't think I am that good at acting actually," the former 'Posh Spice' member of the 1990s band 'The Spice Girls' told reporters in a telephone conference.

"I am excited about the tour but I am certainly not using this as a springboard to launch any form of solo career," she said. David Beckham's arrival in Los Angeles to begin a five year, $250 million contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy team is hotly anticipated both by U.S. sports and celebrity writers, although the Beckhams are much better known in Europe than in the United States. Victoria said she thought the expected interest from Hollywood's paparazzi photographers would soon die down. "They are probably going to realize that we are actually quite boring and that we don't do that much. We stay in a lot as a family and there are so many famous people in Los Angeles who are much more famous than myself and David," she sa
