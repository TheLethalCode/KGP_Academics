 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Two second-half strikes from Nigerian duo powered Dhaka Mohammedan SC led to a 2-1 victory over Chittagong Abahani Limited in the second-leg encounter of the B. League. With their ninth win in 16 matches, Mohammedan joined the second-placed Dhaka Abahani Limited on the point table with 32 points, just one point behind league leaders Muktijoddha Sangsad KS who secured 33 points from 17 matches. Chittagong Abahani remained at the second position from the bottom with 12 points from 17 outings. Both sides played a very ordinary game at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday and there was little sign of a planned show, although all three goals of the game were scored in the space of four minutes at the beginning of the second half. The visitors Abahani, who were beaten 3-1 by the same rivals at home, held the giants for 52 minutes before the league's top scorer Mwach Ukwu Paul Mac broke the deadlock for the black and white strips with a powerful header following a right-side minus from Jahid Hossain. Two minutes later Paul's compatriot Emeka Christina doubled the lead as the attacking midfielder coolly placed a pass by Mithu to the far post, though it briefly appeared as though Emeka was off-side. Mohammedan should have scored a goal in the first half, but their Nigerian duo missed the target thrice by sending the ball outside from close range while Abahani goalie Surendra Kumar Shrestha was also forced to save his side at the cost of corners. Again, Mohammedan could have gained a lead in the 24th minute but defender Monir Hossain rescued Abahani by stopping a goal-bound tap off Paul to frustrate a few hundred fans of the popular black and white outfit. Nepalese striker Santosh Shahukhal, who worked hard from the beginning, reduced the Abahani margin to 2-1 with a low free kick in the 56th minute, but it was not enough for the port city team to avert their ninth defeat. Dhaka Abahani, having played 15 matches, will meet Brothers Union on Wednesday at the same venue. bdn
