<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Communications adviser MA Matin Wednesday said former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina posed no threats to national security. "The two leaders, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, are not threats to the security of the country. I don't think they are under house arrest nor do I believe they need to be confined," he told reporters at his office. He said the Awami League and the BNP chiefs would have to face the law if needed. "If there is any corruption in my ministry, I have to take responsibility as an adviser. "Similarly, they have to take responsibilities for the corruption that happened when they were in power," Matin said. bdnews24
