<TITLE> Japan snap poll possible this year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 11 (bdnews24,.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister would likely call a snap election for parliament's powerful lower house if the ruling camp loses big in a July 29 upper house poll, a leader of the ruling camp's junior partner said on Wednesday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is struggling to soothe voter anger over mismanaged pension records and political corruption, and to allay doubts about his leadership after three ministers exited his cabinet -- two by resignation and one by suicide. "If there is an upset, there will be political confusion and laws that need to be passed will not be able to be enacted," Toshiko Hamayotsu, acting representative of the New Komeito party, told Reuters in an interview. Hamayotsu, an upper house lawmaker and a pivotal figure in mobilising votes for her Buddhist-backed party, said Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would first try to woo independents and like-minded members of the main opposition Democratic Party if the coalition fell short of a majority. "If lawmakers from the Democratic Party or independents join the Liberal Democratic Party and a majority can be maintained, there would not be a lower house election soon," she said. The Democratic Party groups former LDP lawmakers, ex-Socialists and young conservatives, many of whom are said to be dissatisfied with party leader Ichiro Ozawa's reign. "But if a majority cannot be maintained even by such means, a lower house election would occur. It's hard to say, but it could be within the year. It depends on the scale (of the loss)." Hamayotsu said that while a general election would not change the situation in the upper chamber directly, a ruling camp victory in the more powerful lower house would likely spark a reshuffling of party allegiances, helping to break the deadlock. Some analysts said a snap election was indeed an option. "If the ruling parties won in a general election, they could argue that the opposition had no reason to block their policies in the upper house," said Jun Iio, a professor of government at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. Others expressed doubts over whether the ruling camp would risk an early election for the lower house, where it now holds a two-thirds majority. No general election need be held until 2009. "This is a warning for the people: 'If we lose, we'll have confusion or a lower house election'," said Toru Umemoto, a forex strategist who analyses politics at Barclays Capital. "It's a message to the people to vote for the coalition party. The LDP and the New Komeito need to win a total of 64 seats to keep their majority in the upper house, where half of the 242 seats are up for grabs. The New Komeito is aiming for 13 seats. A loss would not immediately require Abe to step down nor would it eject the ruling camp from government, since the lower house picks the prime minister. But a big defeat for the ruling camp would make it difficult to enact laws and would put pressure on Abe to resign. Hamayotsu, 62, admitted that the ruling parties faced a tough election battle, but declined to predict the outcome, noting that upper house elections are often affected by last minute news. "It is true that overall, it's very tough for the LDP. The wind is blowing in favour of the Democratic Party," she said, adding that this trend was natural since the opposition did not have to match its slogans with effective policies. The New Komeito, whose name means "Clean Government Party" and whose supporters in a lay Buddhist group, Soka Gakkai, tend toward pacifism, joined in a coalition with the LDP in 1999, after the long-ruling conservative party suffered took a bashing in an upper house election the previous year. The party has been embarrassed by the political funding scandals that have plagued Abe's cabinet, and was outraged when then-Defence Minister Fumio Kyuma made remarks that appeared to condone the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hamayotsu's advice that Kyuma should "decide his own course" was widely seen as a signal that he should resign, which he did last week, just hours after she spoke to a reporter. Hamayotsu said the New Komeito had a good shot at its goal of 13 seats, but added its candidates were feeling the heat. "We are facing the same sort of criticism we always face in elections, plus we are also feeling the adverse winds that are blowing towards the LDP and the coalition," she sa
