The main Arabic-language daily Al Massa, quoting security sources, said four of the 15 suspects came from al Qaeda's base in Algeria and had sneaked into Morocco to prepare "dangerous and sophisticated" terror attacks.

Asked to comment, an interior ministry official said: "We are only aware of the arrest of 13 Syrians who came from Algeria illegally to try to reach Spain. They are illegal migrants". But a diplomat at the Syrian embassy in Rabat said they were not aware of such arrests. Al Massa said four of those arrested had sought to get explosives from an employee at a Casablanca explosives factory. The Maghreb region has been on alert since al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa, the Al Qaeda Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb which is based in Algeria, threatened to step up its war against "corrupt" governments in the region and their Western allies.
