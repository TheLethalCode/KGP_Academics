 RIO DE JANEIRO, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian footballer Alemao died in a car accident on Sunday, according to police reports cited by the online version of O Globo newspaper. The 23-year-old striker, whose full name was Carlos Adriano de Jesus Soares, was on his way home from his father's birthday party on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro when he lost control of his four-wheel drive vehicle on a bend and catapulted into a tree, the reports said. His brother-in-law was also killed by the impact and two children were among those who suffered injuries. Alemao joined Palmeiras from Japan's Yokohama FC earlier this year but had been sidelined with a knee ligament injury since March. He helped Yokohama win promotion to the J-League first division last year, scoring scored 18 goals in 24 matches before returning to Brazil and Palmeiras but played only three matches for the club before damaging his knee in Palmeiras' 3-0 win over Corinthians on March 4. He was not expected to resume playing before September
