 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com) Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed visited ailing music icon Sabina Yasmin at Labaid Specialised Hospital Monday. Fakhruddin arrived at the hospital at about 5.30pm. The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, had also visited Sabina earlier in the day. Sabina has been undergoing treatment for cancer. However doctors were forced to defer her chemotherapy Saturday as she was running a high temperature. Her temperature returned to normal Monday after receiving immunotherapy Sunday. Cancer specialist Dr Mofazzel Hossain, who is among the four members of the medical board treating Sabina, said her condition was at "Stage IV B". "It's curable. But she must undergo chemotherapy," Dr Mofazzel said. Sabina is now under the watch of a medical board comprising specialists Shirajul Haque, Mofazzal Hossain, Professor Khaja Nazimuddin and surgeon Professor Khademul Islam. Sabina was admitted to Labaid on June 12 with a fever. Doctors had earlier found a cyst in her lymphatic system. The biopsy carried out in Switzerland revealed the cyst to be cancerous. Spokesperson for Labaid Al Imran Chowdhury said it was possible that Sabina could return to a normal life after six sessions of chemotherapy as her cancer was detected at an initial stage. Sabina's family said they would take her to Singapore for treatment as soon as she is able to travel. bdnews
