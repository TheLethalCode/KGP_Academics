 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League leader Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury Monday trashed reports that Sheikh Hasina had not spoken to Khaleda Zia over phone. She also ruled out her party tying up with BNP in the changed political realities in a briefing to reporters after she had met the party chief at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi. The AL presidium member said in no circumstances will the AL team up with the BNP. "We had been tortured for the last five years by the [BNP-led alliance government]," she said. She subscribed to Hasina's latest complaints that the government's intelligence agencies were trying to break up political parties. Sajeda said the government had failed to prepare a voter's list in six long months. She alleged many people could not enroll on the list in pilot project in Gazipur, which se said was incomplete. If this was the case with a pilot project, then she had doubts about a complete electoral roll for the national elections. She said Hasina was at the museum to get income statements of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust that the Anticorruption Commission had asked for. bdnews24.c
