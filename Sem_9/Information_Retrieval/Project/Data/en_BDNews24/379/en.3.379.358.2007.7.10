 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) -- The benchmark DGEN or general index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange topped the 2200 mark Tuesday, triggered by a buying rush for the shares of power, ICT and bank blue-chips. Mohammed Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, chief executive of LankaBangla Securities, linked the rise to the block deals in Dhaka Bank, Prime Bank and Southeast Bank shares. A total of Tk 234 million worth shares was transferred through block deals on the DSE. "I think these block deals have created enthusiasm among investors and allowed the market to touch a record high," he said.
