<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Saima Wazed Putul, the only daughter of Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, gave birth to a baby boy in Miami, US Tuesday, prompting the grandmother to treat her party colleagues to sweets Wednesday morning. The infant has been named Khandaker Zarif Mujib Hossain, according to a press statement released from the AL president's office. Putul delivered the child at around 3:00pm US local time. She already has had two daughters, officials at Hasina's Sudha Sadan home said. Both the mother and the infant are doing well, according to a press statement released from the AL president's office. Putul and her husband Khandaker Mashrur Hossain live in Miami, Florida. An ebullient Hasina went to Bangabandhu Museum in Dhanmondi and distributed sweets among party leaders and workers before going back to Sudha Sadan at around 1pm. After the emergency rule, Hasina went to the US to see her daughter. On June 15, the AL chief wanted to go to the US again to be with her daughter during the delivery. But the government barred her from going to the US this time. She resented the government decision for what she said was curbing her basic rights. bdnews24.com
