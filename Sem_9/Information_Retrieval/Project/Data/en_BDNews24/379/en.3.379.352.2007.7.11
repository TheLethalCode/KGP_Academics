<TITLE> Most Turks want direct vote for president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An overwhelming majority of Turks back the government's call for the president to be elected by a direct popular vote rather than through parliament, a poll published by Vatan newspaper showed on Wednesday. The ESTIMA poll in Vatan showed 74.2 percent of respondents would vote yes in a referendum to change the constitution to have a popular ballot for the top post, while 19.4 percent would oppose it. The Constitutional Court earlier this month rejected appeals from the main opposition party and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer to quash a government-backed reform package that would allow voters to elect future presidents. The court decision paved the way for a referendum on the reform package probably in October, and gave a boost to Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party as they campaign for re-election in a July 22 parliamentary poll, which they are widely expected to win. The survey was conducted in 26 provinces with 2,034 people. But Turkish voters will probably not have a chance to elect their president directly until 2014 as Sezer's successor is due to be chosen by parliament for a seven-year term this autumn. Sezer, a staunch secularist foe of the AK Party government, had been due to retire in May but parliament's failure to choose a new president obliged him to stay on as head of state. Erdogan said on Wednesday Sezer's successor must come from the new parliament, dismissing a call from main opposition leader Deniz Baykal that the parties agree on a presidential candidate "who has been outside politics for a while". "We do not favour choosing a candidate from outside parliament," Erdogan told reporters. Baykal's staunchly secular Republican People's Party (CHP) fears the AK Party will propose somebody with an Islamist background, possibly Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, whose candidacy they successfully blocked in the outgoing parliament. Echoing previous opinion polls ahead of general elections, a survey by GENAR for investment bank AK Investment predicted the AK Party would win a majority of votes and two opposition parties -- CHP and the ultra-nationalist MHP -- would clear a 10 percent national threshold to enter parliament.
