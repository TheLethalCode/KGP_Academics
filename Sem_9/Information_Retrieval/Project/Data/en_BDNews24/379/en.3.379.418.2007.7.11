 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission Wednesday filed another case against former communications minister Barrister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda. Talebur Rahman, an assistant director of the ACC, filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station for including misleading information in their wealth statements to the ACC. Duty officer of Dhanmondi Police Station Nurun Nahar Moni told bdnews24.com that the couple had disclosed assets worth Tk 8.02 crore to the ACC. "Part of this figure does not comply with their legitimate source of income," the officer said. Quoting the case details, Moni said that false income sources had been assigned to assets worth Tk 2.19 crore in the couple's statements. The case also makes allegations against Huda of procuring money by unlawful means from Unilever, British American Tobacco and a number of foreign embassies, as a senior partner of his law firm during the former BNP government. A previous case was filed by the ACC against the couple on March 11 for extortion of Tk 2.4 crore. Charges in this case were framed on July 5. The trial is ongoing. Huda, who had served the immediate past BNP-led government, was arrested by joint forces on Feb 3. Sigma turned herself in to court on July 5 and is now being held in the prison ward of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. bdnews24
