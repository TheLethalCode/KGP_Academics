<TEXT>
 VINOVO, Italy, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus coach Claudio Ranieri said on Wednesday he did not know how well his team would do on their return to Serie A but promised a fight. The Turin club were promoted back to the top flight last season after being demoted to Serie B because of their role in Italy's match-fixing scandal. Didier Deschamps quit following their promotion because of disagreements with the board and former Chelsea manager Ranieri was drafted in after keeping Parma in Serie A. Asked if Juve could challenge at the top again, Ranieri said: "I would like to say yes but I really don't know if we are close or missing something. Only time will tell how far away we are. "Chemistry is needed between the coach and the players," he told a news conference at the club's training ground on the first day of pre-season before the Aug. 26 kickoff. "But Juventus will give problems to everyone. To win, this is the mentality of Juventus." Ranieri said he was 98 percent there with his squad for the new season after several additions but added that they could enter the transfer market again if the right opportunity arose
