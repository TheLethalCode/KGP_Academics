 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Indian officials are at odds over the number of trains to be operated a week between Dhaka and Kolkata. In official talks at Railway Bhaban Monday, the Indian delegation proposed that they could run one train per week. Bangladesh on the other hand said there should be six trains operating every week. At the end of Monday's talks neither side could break the deadlock over the issue. India also insisted that the train originate from Chitpur station instead of Shealdah, while Bangladesh officials said the train should depart from Shealdah station considered the hub of Kolkata. Chitpur is about three kilometres from Shealdah. "The Indian side insisted that they would run only one train per week. But we have said we want to operate six trains every week to make the route economically viable," Bangladesh Railway's additional director general Kazi Asad Ullah told bdnews24.com after the talks. Another member of the Bangladesh delegation told bdnews24.com that operating just one train per week is not viable for Bangladesh. He said Bangladesh would stick to her demands for raising the frequency of the trains. Bangladesh Railway's director general Md Belayet Hossain however was hopeful of a resolution. He told bdnews24.com, "We will reach a consensus on all unresolved issues Tuesday." Shivajit Rakshit of the Indian delegation echoed this optimism. "The meeting will resume Tuesday. We hope to reach a final decision on all unsettled issues," said Rakshit, an executive director of the Indian Railway Board. He told bdnews24.com after the meeting that India hoped the train could be operated between Cantonment station in Dhaka and Chitpur in Kolkata, but the issue was yet to be settled. The discussion also focused on customs and immigration requirements at the Indian border, the timetable for the train service and the trial run of a train from Bangladesh. Additional secretary of the communications ministry ATKM Ismail and Indian additional home secretary AE Ahmed led their delegates in the talks. The 32-member Indian delegation will leave Dhaka Tuesday for Pakshi and return to India on July 11. bdne
