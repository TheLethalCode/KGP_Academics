<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities Tuesday barred BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia from visiting music icon Sabina Yasmin now under treatment at Labaid Specialised Hospital, an aide claimed. AKM Mohiuddin Khan Mohan who had served the former prime minister as assistant press secretary told bdnews24.com that Khaleda could not see the music icon as she was discouraged by authorities for "security reasons". However, Khaleda asked people to pray for the quick recovery of the singer who is suffering from cancer. Mohan, also assistant editor for the Bangla-language newspaper Dainik Dinkal, said: "Madam was scheduled to go to Labaid at 3.30pm." "She also informed her security personnel accordingly. But authorities discouraged Begum Zia for security reasons." Former MP retired major Akhteruzzaman, who was expelled from the BNP, was present at Labaid and criticised the restriction on Khaleda. "A national artiste is ill. We cannot accept the restriction on people from seeing her. Here is no politics. It's not right that a former prime minister will be barred from coming here," he said. bdnew
