<TITLE> President Bush to project lower budget deficit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Tue Jul 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday is expected to project a US budget deficit for this year of just over $200 billion, down from prior estimates because of strong tax receipts, Republican sources said. A deficit for fiscal 2007 in that range would mark a decline from the $248 billion gap recorded last year. The fresh estimate will be unveiled at 1 pm EDT (1700 GMT) in the administration's "midsession review" of the budget. When President George W Bush sent Congress his annual budget in February, he forecast that this year's deficit would decrease only slightly to $244 billion. But robust tax collections this spring, bolstered by bigger paychecks for individuals and capital gains from a strong stock market, has brought down deficits faster than anticipated, even as the Iraq war has contributed to hefty spending increases in recent years. Republican sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had been told the projection would be for a deficit around $40 billion lower than last year's. Although a $200 billion deficit would mark an improvement from last year, it is above the estimates of many private forecasters that are closer to the $150 billion range for 2007. In early June, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the deficit would come in between $150 billion and $200 billion. Struggling with growing criticism -- even from within his own Republic Party over his Iraq policy -- Bush is eager to tout what he views as a success on the domestic side. He contends his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have set the stage for a better fiscal picture by spurring economic growth, though Democrats have labeled Bush's tax-cutting policies fiscally reckless. In a speech in Cleveland on Tuesday, Bush said the deficit would be "substantially lower than it was three years ago." "We kept your taxes low, which caused the economy to grow, which yielded more tax revenues. And because we set priorities, the deficit is shrinking," he said. Jim Horney, an analyst at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said the lower deficit was simply a result of a normal economic expansion, adding that without the tax cuts, the federal government would be enjoying a budget surplus. "This is what happens in an expansion. The deficit goes down some," he said. As Bush prepares to unveil the budget estimate, a big battle is looming between the White House and the Democratic-led Congress over domestic spending. Democrats have sketched out a spending plan for fiscal year 2008 that exceeds by around $22 billion the $933 billion Bush has requested. The president has said he will use his veto to enforce that lim
