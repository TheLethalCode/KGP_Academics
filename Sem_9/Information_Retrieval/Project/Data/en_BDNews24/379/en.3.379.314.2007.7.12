<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)--Antara Huda, one of the two daughters of former BNP minister Nazmul Huda, Wednesday threatened a police officer with dire consequences in the special judge's court at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. Huda's other daughter Srabonti Huda took a picture on her mobile phone of her ailing mother Sigma Huda. Sigma was being taken downstairs from the first floor of the building after she testified to court in a corruption case. Sigma told her daughter to send the picture to the press "so that people can see how her rights as a human being were violated". Court inspector Rezaul Karim stepped in, took away the phone from her and deleted the picture. "It's just taking a picture of somebody. So what?" an angry Antara said. She threatened the officer with dire consequences when the time comes. bdnews
