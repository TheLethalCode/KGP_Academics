 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Music icon Sabina Yasmin left Dhaka on board a Singapore Airlines at 11.55 Wednesday night with her daughter Badhon for medical treatment in the city state. Earlier, she expressed her gratefulness to people for help and empathy during her stay in hospital for cancer treatment. In a letter before she left Labaid Specialised Hospital, Sabina said: "I'm grateful to all those who helped me by donating blood." "I'm grateful to the government, print and electronic media and people for empathy and help. I thank all of you. Copies of the letter signed by Sabina and handwritten apparently by somebody else were distributed among reporters, hours before her flight to Singapore. She said: "I hope people will have good wishes for me in the days to come as well. "Your prayers and love will help me live on, and I hope I'll come back to you." A Labaid official said all administrative formalities of admitting her have been taken care of. Sabina left Labaid at 8.50pm and drove to Zia International Airport. Sabina's well-wishers were seen crowding the ground floor of the hospital since morning to know the latest on her, forcing authorities to clamp restrictions. Sabina sitting in a wheelchair waved to the crowd on her way out of the hospital. Her lips were seen trembling but she did not utter a word. Sabina was under treatment for cancer at Labaid for about a month. A Labaid physician said she was suffering from lymphoma cancer and was at a stage that was curable, but she needed chemotherapy. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed gave Tk 4 lakh in grant for her treatment from the Chief Adviser's Relief and Welfare Fund, a government press statement said. Fakhruddin Monday went to the hospital to see her. "The patient's condition is better today than in the last two days. Her body temperature is normal," Sabina's physician Dr Md Mofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman and Liberal Democratic Party president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury visited Sabina at Labaid Wednesday. bdnews24.com/s
