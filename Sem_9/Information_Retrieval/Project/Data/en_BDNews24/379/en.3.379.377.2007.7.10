 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)The SEC Tuesday approved two initial public offering applications including a Tk 300 crore Mudaraba Perpetual Bond of Islami Bank Bangladesh. The other IPO is Continental Insurance. The regulator also cleared a right share issuance proposal of Standard Bank. According to Islami bank, a total of Tk 150 crore will be issued through the public offering. The remaining Tk 150 crore will be raised through a pre-IPO or private placement. The unit price for each bond share will be Tk 1,000 and the minimum subscription amount is Tk. 5,000, the bank said. "The main purpose of the Mudaraba Perpetual Bond is to raise funds to meet the capital adequacy ratio of the bank," Islami Bank said in its proposal. Mudaraba is a form of business venture under Islamic Shariah in which one party brings capital and the other personal endeavor. The proportionate share in profit is determined by mutual agreement. But the loss, if any, is borne only by the owner of the capitalin which case the entrepreneur gets nothing for his labour. Executive director of SEC Farhad Ahmed said the floatation of the bond would allow investors to own diversified securities. "Our market is presently equity based. Floatation of this bond will allow investors to rebalance their portfolios," he said. MPB will give investors 65 percent of the earnings from the bond. The bank will also sanction 10 percent dividend of the total dividend issued for its shareholders annually. Ahmed said the commission also approved the IPO of Continental Insurance. The Continental will issue a total of Tk 9.0 crore worth of public shares to expand its business. The face value of each share will be Tk 100. At present, Continental's paid up capital is Tk 6.0 crore. Standard Bank, which has decided to issue one share against two existing shares, obtained approval against a face value of Tk 100. Currently it's total share capital is Tk 131.2 crore against 13,115,520 shares. bdn
