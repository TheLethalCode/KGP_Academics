 ISLAMABAD, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani security forces secured a mosque and school complex in Islamabad on Wednesday, snuffing out the last pockets of resistance a day after an assault that killed a rebel cleric and more than 50 militants. Many questions were unanswered including the final death toll and whether any women or children had been killed at the radical Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque. Soldiers finished securing a headquarters and residential complex where hardline cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi lived. No militants, or other followers of Ghazi, were left inside, said military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad. "The first phase is over ... The special services troops given the task of flushing out the militants and taking out the civilians, that is over," Arshad said. He said he had no report of women or children among the dead in Tuesday's assault, carried out by 164 commandos. Ghazi died in a hail of bullets in a last stand on Tuesday night. His body was being taken for burial in his home village in Punjab province, an Interior Ministry official said. Three militants were killed overnight and several militants and soldiers were wounded in a morning clash. A wounded man was found in a basement bathroom in the evening, Arshad said. Occasional explosions rang out from the fortified mosque-school complex as troops destroyed booby-traps and mines. Nine members of the security forces were killed and 29 wounded in "Operation Silence", the codename for the assault. Heavy security was still in place around the compound with reporters kept back. But a curfew in the neighbourhood for more than a week was lifted for a few hours in the afternoon. Heavy casualties, especially among women and children who were religious students based at the compound would be bad for President Pervez Musharraf, going through arguably the worst patch of a roller-coaster eight years in power. Elections are due this year and the general, who came to power in a 1999 coup, is seeking a second five-year term. He is expected to address the nation this week. TOLL TO RISE Tuesday's estimate that more than 50 militants had been killed will increase, Arshad said, adding the final toll could only be determined after a second-phase combing operation. Regarding possible deaths of women or children, he said: "Not to my knowledge ... That was one of the major plans of our strategy, a step-by-step approach to ensure no women and children were killed." No one knew how many people were in the complex when the assault began. More than 1,200 people left during a week-long standoff after clashes erupted on July 3. Estimates from officials on the number remaining had ranged from hundreds to 2,000. Arshad said the military, before the assault, had estimated 200 to 300 people were in the complex. He said 86 people came out after the assault began, including women, children and militants. Young women were among the most fervent supporters of the Taliban-style movement led by Lal Masjid's two cleric brothers, Ghazi and Abdul Aziz. Aziz was caught escaping last week disguised in a woman's burqa. He was due to accompany his brother's body to their village for the funeral. The clerics had sought to impose strict Islamic law in the capital and incited followers, most drawn from restive North West Frontier Province, to run a vigilante anti-vice campaign. Many Pakistanis berated Musharraf for not clamping down sooner on the students who abducted policemen and kidnapped women they accused of being prostitutes. But self-exiled former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who has been linked to a possible power-sharing deal with Musharraf, backed the government action. Newspapers were also supportive, saying the government had no choice but to use force.
