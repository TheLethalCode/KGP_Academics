 DILI, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timor's ruling party, Fretilin, has begun negotiations with other parties for a unity government in the young nation after the recent parliamentary election, the party's secretary general said on Tuesday. Both Fretilin and CNRT, a party set up by former president Xanana Gusmao, had previously ruled out a proposal by President Jose Ramos-Horta to form a unity government. Both had said they sought to form a coalition government instead. Fretilin said on Monday it planned to form a minority government if attempts to link up with coalition partners failed.

Fretilin, which led the 24-year struggle against Indonesian rule, remains popular, especially in the east of the country, but its candidate fared badly in the recent presidential election. Gusmao, who ended his term as president in May, appeared to become increasingly frustrated by the pace of progress under Fretilin rule and by the factional infighting which broke out in East Timor last year and helped cause chaos and bloodshed. The factional fighting was triggered by the Fretilin government's sacking of 600 rebellious soldiers. In the ensuing mayhem 37 people were killed and 150,000 driven from their homes. Foreign troops led by Australia intervened to restore order, but sporadic violence and unrest have continu
