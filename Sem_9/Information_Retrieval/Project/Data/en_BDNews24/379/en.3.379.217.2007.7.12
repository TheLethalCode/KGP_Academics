 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former communications minister Nazmul Huda, a barrister, Wednesday quizzed the witnesses in the trial of a Tk 2.4 crore extortion case against himself and his wife, Sigma. The former BNP minister sought permission of judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Judge's Court-3 to cross-examine the witnesses as there was no attorney in the court to do the job. The witnesses who testified are customer care officer of HSBC bank Christopher Raju Gomes, vice president of Prime Bank Md. Iftekhar Uddin and Saiful Amin. Sigma was beside him during the questioning. On March 11, the Anticorruption Commission filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against the couple for extortion of Tk 2.4 crore. The court framed charges against them on July 5. Allegations are there that the former minister had taken bribe from Mir Zahir Hossain, a contractor and brother of FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain. The money was deposited in the bank account of a weekly magazine ' Khoborer Ontorale' published by Sigma. bdnews
