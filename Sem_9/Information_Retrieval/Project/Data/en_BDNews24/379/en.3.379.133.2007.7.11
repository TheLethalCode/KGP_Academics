<TITLE> Los Angeles Galaxy ready for the Beckham factor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The waiting is almost over for the Los Angeles Galaxy with their biggest signing, England midfielder David Beckham, scheduled to arrive in the world's entertainment capital on Thursday afternoon. The hype and speculation have escalated ever since the January announcement that Beckham would join the Galaxy from Spanish giants Real Madrid on a deal that will earn him a reported $250 million over five years. Beckham is one of the world's most marketable sports figures and his hotly anticipated move to Major League Soccer (MLS) has already given the embryonic American game much-needed credibility and plenty of buzz. Although the former England captain himself has never claimed he can become the saviour of U.S. soccer, he is determined to make a difference. "I am not saying my coming to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America because that is going to be very difficult to achieve," Beckham said earlier this year. "But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't believe I could make a difference and take soccer to a different level. This is something that I believe in." Beckham, whose basic annual salary with the Galaxy is $5.5 million, has a vested interest in any escalation of the game in the United States. His five-year deal effectively makes him a stakeholder in both the Galaxy and MLS and it includes performance-related bonuses, a share of the additional merchandising he generates and any new sponsorship deals. Beckham's across-the-board appeal is unlike any other player in the game and with his pop star wife Victoria preparing for a Spice Girls reunion later this year, the couple should fit right into the Hollywood scene. The 32-year-old Englishman will be officially introduced as a Galaxy player on Friday at the team's home stadium in Carson, California. FIRST APPEARANCE He is scheduled to report for training the following Monday before making his first appearance for his new club in an exhibition match with FA Cup holders Chelsea on July 21. For Galaxy club president Alexi Lalas, the 'Beckham Show' cannot start soon enough. "It's been an incredible build-up and challenging to say the least," Lalas told Reuters. "The excitement still remains but we will just be happy to finally get over with all the hoopla and get down to business. This is a moment of truth and a platform which we want to use to our advantage." Although the Beckham factor has already given great impetus to U.S. soccer, Lalas is more concerned with the longer-term picture. "Yes, we are going to give people the David Beckham fix but more importantly we are going to give them an opportunity to fall in love with the Galaxy," he said. "And hopefully that love and that passion will last well beyond the time that David Beckham is with us." With Beckham already the headline act at the Galaxy, Lalas accepts he and his players will be working under much heavier media scrutiny than ever before. "This is already the premier club here in the United States and therefore it has the most attention, the highest standards and the most pressure for the players," he said. "You add the fact that we have added David Beckham and everything that that entails and that pressure has been ratcheted up.
