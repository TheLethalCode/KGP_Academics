 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) -- The SEC has penalised 14 top officials of three companies and a brokerage house for breaching corporate laws, an official said Tuesday. The regulator fined each of the six senior officials of Chittagong Vegetables Oil Industries Tk 1.0 lakh. They are company chairman Shamsul Alam, managing director AHM Habibullah and directors Md Nazrul Alam, Md Amin, Md Emranul Haque and Md Mohsin Saki. "The company did not comply with the guidelines. We have also observed irregularities in its audited accounts," said Farhad Ahmed, executive director of SEC. According to the SEC, if a company fails to comply with regulator's corporate governance guidelines, it is required to explain why. Chittagong Vegetables neither complied nor reported why it failed to follow the guidelines, Ahmed said. Four senior officials of Saleh Carpet were fined for non-submission of an audited financial statement for 2006. Each of the officials was given a penalty of Tk 1.0 lakh. The SEC penalised Saleh Carpet's chairperson Mrs Dilara Begum, managing director Shamim Ara and directors Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, Badrul Hoque and Ruhul Amin. Each was asked to pay Tk 1.0 lakh in 15 days. The same amount fine was also imposed on three top officials of Raspit Inc. The company failed to submit their half-yearly accounts for June-December of 2005 and 2006 and failed to hold annual general meetings for three years to 2006, Ahmed said. Abdur Razzak, chairman and managing director of Raspit Inc, and its directors Ashraful Islam and Lt Col Serajul Islam were fined. The commission also fined brokerage firm Ibrahim Securities Tk 1.0 lakh for selling shares using a client's account although there was no share in the client's name, the SEC official added. bdn
