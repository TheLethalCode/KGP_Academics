 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The government plans to launch prepaid meters for gas, energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury said Wednesday. A project has been taken up for the purpose, the adviser told reporters. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology will design and supply the meters for Dhaka city in line with a deal with Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority. BUET will also assemble 5,000 meters under the agreement. "I can't rely on imported meters. The government had earlier suffered losses for the prepaid meters imported from China," Tapan said. Dozens of people, women in particular, will be employed for the project if the meters are assembled in Bangladesh, he said. bdnews24.c
