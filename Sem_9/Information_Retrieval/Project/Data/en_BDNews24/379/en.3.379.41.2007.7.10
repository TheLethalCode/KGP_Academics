Rob Lightner, vice president business development at Sega of America, suggested that the games should appeal even to people who haven't seen `Bleach' on the small screen. "A gamer can learn about the characters in the series by playing the game, and if they are already familiar with the 'Bleach' TV series it will make the game-play experience even richer," he added. Sega has been moving aggressively in recent years to leverage content from other entertainment media. The publisher is coming out with games for the holiday season based on the fantasy book `The Golden Compass', which also is a highly anticipated New Line film staring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.
