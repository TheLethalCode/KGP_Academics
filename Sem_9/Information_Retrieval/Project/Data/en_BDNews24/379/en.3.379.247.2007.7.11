 FRANKFURT, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell in early trade on Wednesday after growing concern over the US subprime mortgage market caused US and Asian stocks to tumble, hitting financial stocks and exporters, while the oil price stayed high. Among major movers, BSkyB rose 2.5 percent after releasing an upbeat trading update, bucking the trend in broadly falling European stock markets. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.7 percent to 1,595.47 points at 0810 GMT, its lowest in over a week. "I think there are three elements to look at today. The concern over the subprime mortgage market and what it might cause. Secondly, the oil price and the third point is the profit warning from Home Depot showing how weak the US domestic economy might be," said Justin Urquhart Stewart of 7 Investment Management.

The euro set a record high of $1.3784 on Tuesday, according to Reuters data, and eased back to $1.3742 by 0804 GMT. The strength of the euro hit exporters and automobile stocks in particular. BMW dropped 1.6 percent, DaimlerChrysler fell 1.4 percent and Renault eased 1.5 percent. Germany's DAX fell 1.3 percent, Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.5 percent and France's CAC 40 eased 0.7 percent. The oil price hovered near an 11-month high, buoyed by new Iranian tensions and as traders waited for US oil stock data later in the session. London Brent crude was down 0.2 percent at $76.24 a barrel by 0751 GMT, within sight of the record high of $78.65 from last August. AstraZeneca rose 1.9 percent after Morgan Stanley turned positive on the drugmaker for the first time in two years, rating the stock "overweigh
