 DILI, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fugitive army rebel Alfredo Reinado said on Wednesday he was open to holding talks with a new East Timor government, but called for international forces to be pulled back and said he would not lay down his weapons yet. Last August, Alfredo Reinado escaped along with 50 other inmates from a prison where he was being held on charges of involvement in violence that killed 37 people and drove 150,000 from their homes earlier that year. "I am open for a dialogue once the new government is formed," Reinado told Reuters by telephone from a secret location. No single party won a majority in June 30 parliamentary elections, meaning that a coalition is likely to be formed. "I want the government to pull back international forces to allow us to return to our homes ... I am waiting for the new government to hold talks with them." Reinado said talks should be mediated by the Catholic Church, rights groups and international organisations. The army fugitive visited UN police headquarters in the town of Same earlier this week, bringing along a group of armed supporters, according to a UN security briefing. President Jose Ramos-Horta appealed to Reinado on Tuesday to surrender his weapons and start negotiations, adding that international forces should "watch Reinado's movements" around the small town, but "not to attack him". He said the army rebel would be allowed to "circulate freely" but may not carry any weapons. But Reinado refused to give up his weapons. "I will hand over the weapons once we are satisfied with the outcome (of talks)," Reinado said. In June, Ramos-Horta ordered security forces to stop hunting the army renegade, instructing the prosecutor-general to discuss with Reinado terms for his surrender and weapons handover under the mediation of the Catholic Church. Reinado told Reuters last month he would personally seek out those behind last year's violence if the government refused to negotiate with him immediately. Reinado, East Timor's former military police chief, has been accused of raiding a police post and making off with 25 automatic weapons while on the run. He has said he would only turn himself in once the Fretilin party was no longer in power and foreign troops sent into East Timor after last year's violence were out of the country. Fretilin won last month's parliamentary election, securing 21 seats in the 65-seat chamber, while the CNRT, a party set up by former president Xanana Gusmao, won 18 seats. Both Fretilin and CNRT have previously said they planned to form coalition governments, rejecting a proposal by Ramos-Horta to form a unity government. But Fretilin secretary general Mari Alkatiri said on Tuesday the party had begun talks to form a unity governme
