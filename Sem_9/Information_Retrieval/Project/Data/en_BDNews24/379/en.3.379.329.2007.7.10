<TITLE> Govt to rewrite land acquisition law: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein said Tuesday the government would amend a law to rehabilitate the people affected by land acquisition. The law and land adviser said the existing land acquisition law allows for only financial compensation to the affected individual, but an amended one will ensure complete rehabilitation. Mainul said, "Under current legislation, when land is acquired for government installations or infrastructure, landowners are given only financial compensation. The new legislation will rehabilitate those landowners completely." "In addition to giving them the prices of their land they would be provided with employments." Mainul and Asian Development Bank country director Hua Du spoke at a workshop, "Urban Development, People's Displacement and Rehabilitation Programme" organised by the land ministry in cooperation with the ADB. Hua Du said the ADB would provide assistance for a government-approved rehabilitation programme. Delays in land acquisition and a lack of rehabilitation for those affected slow down the implementation of government projects, she said As a result, project costs soar and displaced people face serious social and economic losses leading to extreme poverty, she said. bdnews24.
