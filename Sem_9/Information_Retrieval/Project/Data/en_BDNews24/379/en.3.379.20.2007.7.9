<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 09 (bdnews24.com)  The so-called pro-reform BNP leaders Monday dismissed party chief Khaleda Zia's allegations that they had been conspiring to break up the party. They said there were striving to make party more organised and democratic and that the all misgivings would be buried in the upcoming council meeting. "We are not up to any conspiracy to split the party. We are working to firm up democratic practice in the party," BNP vice president Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf told reporters after meeting with BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home. Khaleda in a telephone speech to the Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal leaders in New York Sunday said those who joined BNP from other parties h-c wbbn conspiring against the party taking advantage of the changed political situation under the state of emergency. She termed Bhuiyan's reforms proposal his personal opinions and said it had nothing to do with the BNP. Her adviser ZA Khan, however, said Bhuiyan's reform plan was not a personal one, rather it was a party plan based on the opinions of the thousands of leaders and workers. "We are working to keep the BNP united, not to divide it," he said. On why the party secretary general announced the plan without informing the chairperson, Khan said Bhuiyan informed Khaleda of the plan. "I myself had informed madam (Khaleda) too." He said those who smelled rats in the reform plan did not apprently want an united BNP. Former lawmakers Mahmudul Hasan, Nazir Hossain, Shah Md Abu Zafar, Abu Abbas, Dewan Md Salahuddin, Abdul Hye, Mainuddin Bhuiyan, Ganesh Hawlader, Kartik Thakur, Masud Arun, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Abul Kalam and Delwar Hossain Khan Dulu also met Bhuiyan Monday. Leaders from different districts met Bhuiyan earlier in the day and discussed the reform plan and the council meeting. bdnew
