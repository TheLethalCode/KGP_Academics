<TITLE> Barca to combat complacency with disciplinary committee </TITLE>

 MADRID, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona will use a disciplinary committee to monitor their players' conduct and attitude, club president Joan Laporta said on Wednesday. The move comes after Laporta accused some squad members of not having pulled their weight during last season, when they failed to win a major trophy. The committee will comprise himself, coach Frank Rijkaard, sports director Txiki Begiristain and the team captains, Laporta told Catalunya Radio. He said it would meet weekly to ensure the team did not succumb to the "relaxation and over-confidence that led to the team lowering its levels of professionalism last season". Barcelona's players were criticised by the fans and the local press last season for skipping training sessions, making dressing room disputes public, and some half-hearted displays. "It won't be a sudden change to a dictatorship. The players will be able to live their lives as they always have done," Laporta said. "But they will have to look after themselves, train well, do their best on the pitch, and participate more in club events." Laporta's move echoes those Fernando Martin threatened to implement when he took over from Florentino Perez for his short-lived reign as Real Madrid president at the end of the 2005-6 season. Barcelona frittered away their advantage at the top of the Primera Liga to miss out on their third successive league title on the final day of the season last month. Real finished level on points and were crowned champions because of their superior head-to-head record against their arch-rivals
