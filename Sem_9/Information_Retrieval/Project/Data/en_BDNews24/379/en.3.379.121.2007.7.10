 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Music icon Sabina Yasmin will be flown to Singapore Wednesday for treatment at Singapore National Cancer Centre. "The ailing artiste will be taken to Singapore Wednesday. The Bangladesh agent of Singapore National Cancer Centre has completed all preparations for her departure," Al Imran, an official of LabAid Specialised Hospital where Sabina is being treated, told bdnews24.com. Doctors found cyst in her lymphatic system. The biopsy report, carried out in Switzerland, said the cyst is a symptom of cancer. Sabina has long been suffering from diabetes too. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has given Tk 4 lakh in grant for the treatment of the singer from the chief adviser's relief and welfare fund. Fakhruddin Monday went to the hospital to see her. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia was scheduled to go to see Sabina Yasmin but was barred on security grounds. "Her condition is better today than the last two days. Her body temperature is normal today," Dr Md Mofazzal Hossain, who is treating Sabina, told bdnews24.com. Dr Hossain said he knew nothing about her family's move to get her treated in Singapore. Dr Ezharul Haq Kaiser of Labaid said chemotherapy had been stopped as Sabina was no more fit to receive it, which has prompted the cancer to proliferate. The sooner she received the therapy, the better it was for her, he said. Well-wishers gathered on the ground floor of the hospital since Tuesday morning to know the latest on her. "Sabina Yasmin and I took music lessons together at the same school. I came today to see her but the doctors did not allow me for the sake of the patient's health," singer Shabnam Mustari told journalists there. She urged all to pray for the ailing artiste. Veteran singer Ferdousi Rahman exchanged greetings with Sabina standing at front of the door of her room on the fourth floor. "I exchanged greetings with Sabina from a distance far as there are strict restrictions from the doctors to go near her. She appeared to be far better today. I pray for her," Ferodusi told journalists. Sabina has been undergoing treatment at the hospital for last one month. A physician said she was suffering from lymphoma cancer and was at a stage that is curable, but she needed chemotherapy. The four-member medical board formed for treatment of Sabina include medicine specialist Sirajul Haq, surgery specialist Prof Khademul Islam and Prof Khawaja Nazimuddin. Hospital sources said Sabina was admitted to the hospital on June 12 with high fever and was losing weight fast. bdnew
