 MADRID, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid reached an agreement to sign Porto centre-back Pepe for a fee of up to 30 million euros on Tuesday. Both clubs confirmed the deal with the Portuguese champions detailing the amount offered for the 24-year-old Brazilian-born player, which makes him one of the world's most expensive defenders. Pepe, who is set to sign a five-year contract, is the second centre-back Real have signed in the close season with German international Christoph Metzelder due to be presented on Wednesday.
