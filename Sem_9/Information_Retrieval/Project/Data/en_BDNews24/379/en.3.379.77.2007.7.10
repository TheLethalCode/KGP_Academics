<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) - Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique will return home after the third and final Test against Sri Lanka starting Wednesday at Asgiriya International Stadium, Kandy. Rafique had asked Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for leave over his son's illness. The board Tuesday agreed to let Rafique on leave after the end of the Test series on July 15.

That means the Tigers will go into the three-match ODI against Sri Lanka without Rafique. bdn
