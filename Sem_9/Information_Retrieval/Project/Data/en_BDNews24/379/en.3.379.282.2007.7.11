 GALLIPOLI, Turkey, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The monuments and mass graves of Gallipoli record the horrors and heroism of war, but also help explain the nationalism that fires Turks and is shaping a parliamentary election campaign. British, French, Australian and other troops stormed the beaches of this windswept peninsula in 1915 to try to capture Istanbul, knock the Ottoman Turkish Empire out of World War One and open a sea route to their ally Russia. But they reckoned without the bravery of the Turks and their commander Mustafa Kemal, who said: "I am ordering you not to fight but to die". Nearly 400,000 men, more than half of them Turks, were killed or wounded before the Turks prevailed. It was a triumph which prepared Turks psychologically for future battles in which they trounced powerful Western armies and went on to establish the modern Turkish Republic in 1923 under the leadership of Kemal, later known as Ataturk. "My father was just 14 when he fought here with Ataturk and was wounded. Our country was saved here, the republic really began here," said Ahmet Oktay, 78, a retired railway worker. "We owe our present life to the sacrifices they made. If we had no nationalism, we would not have the life we enjoy today," he said at the monument commemorating the Ottoman Turkish casualties, a tranquil site overlooking the Dardanelles Straits. All political parties are pressing their nationalist credentials before the election on July 22. The far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) is expected to be the third party in parliament, after the centre-right AK Party and the main opposition centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also nationalist-minded. The MHP and CHP have criticised the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party for selling off Turkish firms to foreign investors and favour a tough stance on the European Union in membership talks. DISTRUST, FEAR But there is a darker side to Turkish nationalism that one can also encounter at Gallipoli, even though the site commemorates both sides' dead. "Western countries have the same intentions as they had in World War One. They want to weaken and divide Turkey, they fear a strong Turkey will become the leader of the Muslim world," said Cuneyt Musuk, 34, a factory worker now living in Germany. This is not an uncommon view in NATO member Turkey, where fear of outsiders can erupt into violence. Ultra-nationalists were blamed for the recent murders of Turkish Armenian editor Hrant Dink and an Italian Catholic priest. They have thrived in a legal and political climate that makes it a crime to insult "Turkishness". People who question the official, nationalist version of Turkey's history, such as Nobel Literature Laureate Orhan Pamuk, have been prosecuted. The nationalist trend has prompted the AK Party, which is widely expected to be re-elected, to sound more hawkish. It has threatened to send troops into northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels and avoided discussions about the supranational, increasingly unpopular EU. "There is much more nationalism in Turkey today because of the Iraq war and U.S. policy in Iraq," said William Hale, a Turkey scholar at Istanbul's Sabanci University. CONCERNS OF KURDISH STATE Turks fear U.S. policy is leading inexorably to the creation of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq which could fan separatism among Kurds in southeastern Turkey. They are also angry the United States has not tackled some 4,000 Turkish Kurdish separatist rebels based in northern Iraq. Hale also attributed the upsurge in nationalism to Ankara's EU-linked reforms, which are often depicted by Turkish media as one-sided concessions to a Europe they say will never admit Turkey, a large, relatively poor, overwhelmingly Muslim country. The MHP is optimistic, unsurprisingly after a poll found more than half of Turks saw themselves as "very nationalistic". "We are climbing the ladder. People are angry because the AK Party is throwing into question our national identity, the foundations of the republic, our Turkishness," said Vural Oktay, an MHP candidate for the western port city of Izmir. Under electoral rules, if the MHP clears the 10 percent threshold to enter parliament, the AK Party could end up with a smaller majority. This could spell political instability, and some human rights activists fear a rollback of reforms. "The nationalism is often provoked by state officials, including in the army, who often do not grasp the volatility of the situation," said Orhan Kemal Cengiz of the Human Rights Agenda Association in Ankara. He fears clashes between Turks and Kurds in Turkish cities. Some members of Turkey's security forces are also known to sympathise with shadowy ultra-nationalist groups, often made up of disaffected young men looking for a cau
