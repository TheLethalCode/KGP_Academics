 SINGAPORE, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks stalled near record highs and currency markets also paused for breath in subdued trading on Tuesday as markets awaited comments on inflation from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke due later in the day. European shares opened similarly steady with investors studying updates from a number of top retailing firms. Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 were little changed, while Germany's DAX added 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei average edged down 0.1 percent, as a modest rise in the yen spurred investors to take profit on Sony Corp. and other tech plays that helped drive the market to a seven-year high in the previous session. By 0700 GMT, MSCI's broadest index of shares elsewhere in Asia had fallen 0.1 percent to 488.3, after earlier touching a record high of 489.13 points as investors awaited the main quarterly reporting season. "The market is looking a bit tired," said Simon Doyle, head of strategy at Schroder Investment Management in Australia. "A lot of optimism about the future has already been priced in. I think in this environment, earnings will probably need to exceed expectations to get the market up." RATES DECISIONS WEIGH The dollar inched up against the euro on Tuesday but remained under pressure on the view that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates steady for some time, while other central banks are seen raising rates further. The yen rose against higher-yielding currencies as investors locked in profits after pushing the low-yielding yen down to its weakest level against sterling and the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars in as many as 20 years. Financial markets are keenly awaiting further clues on U.S. interest rates, with Bernanke scheduled to talk on inflation at 1700 GMT. "Remarks from Bernanke are unlikely to rekindle expectations for Fed rate tightening even if they are a bit hawkish. Thus, gains in the dollar will be limited," said Tohru Sasaki, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. The market expects Bernanke to stick to the message of the Fed's last policy statement, in which the central bank repeated that inflation remains its main worry but dropped a description of core inflation as "elevated." The dollar stood at 123.35 yen down a touch from 123.40 yen in late U.S. trade. Investors were also cautious about selling the yen aggressively before the Bank of Japan's two-day policy meeting starting on Wednesday. The Japanese central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates on hold at this week's meeting, before raising borrowing costs next month. The euro was at $1.3606, down 0.2 percent from the previous day's late New York trade at $1.3625 It eased to 167.90 yen after striking a record high of 168.55 yen the previous day. In other currencies, the Thai baht hit a new 10-year high of around 33.47 against the dollar, buoyed by a broad rally in most Asian currencies and new central bank rules for offshore investors, but its gains were capped by suspected official intervention. Australian shares dropped 0.5 as Woolworths Ltd. fell after its full-year profit outlook missed some market expectations, while a strong Aussie dollar pressured firms with big offshore earnings. SEOUL, HK, TAIWAN AND INDIAN HIGHS Seoul shares rose to a fifth straight record close as SK Telecom surged on a media report it may bid for U.S. firm Sprint Nextel, while LG.Philips LCD gained ahead of its earnings on a broker's upgrade. The benchmark KOSPI index rose 0.6 percent to end at 1,894.53 points, just back from an intraday high of 1,895.98 points. Hong Kong's Hang Seng hit its sixth straight record, while Taiwan shares rose 0.2 percent to a seven-year closing high. India's benchmark share index rose to a record for a seventh successive session on Tuesday, while Singapore's Straits Times also hit a record high after forecasting-beating GDP data. London Brent crude currently seen as a better indicator of the global market, was down 34 cents at $75.44, after a seven-day rally lifted prices to their highest in 11 months. Losses were limited by fears of further violence in No. 8 exporter Nigeria and looming North Sea maintenance. Gold fell to $658.80, from a more than one-month high around $660.80 late in New York. Japanese government bond futures erased early gains and edged lower, with traders turning cautious as they awaited the outcome of a five-year JGB auction later in the day. September 10-year JGB futures fell 0.04 point to 131.27 The benchmark 10-year yield rose 1 basis point to 1.955 percent.
