 FRANKFURT, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stock markets drifted lower on Tuesday after hitting fresh 6-1/2 year highs as a profit warning from US home improvement retailer Home Depot raised worries about the US economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.35 percent at 1619.76 points by 1105 GMT, after hitting 1,630.96 in early trade, its strongest level since November 2000. Markets turned into negative territory after Home Depot slashed its 2007 earnings outlook, citing weakness in the US housing market and knocking sentiment in the sector. Wolseley the world's largest distributor of plumbing and heating products, fell 2.1 percent to make it one of the main losers in the FTSE 100. Also adding to investor concerns on Tuesday, European credit spreads jumped wider as worries about the strength of the US economy intensified. "The credit market's under pressure, and there's an awful lot of takeover speculation out there, including some fairly substantial transactions," said one trader. Miners topped losers, as base metal prices fell and after UK paper The Times reported BHP Billiton is in talks with private equity firms to team up for a possible $40 billion bid for U.S. aluminium company Alcoa. BHP Billiton shares slipped 1.6 percent while Anglo American fell 1.4 percent. "We've seen a bit of a pull-back in the miners after a very good start to the week," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. "I think the market will be looking for confirmation about merger and acquisition activity in the sector, as there's an awful lot of speculation out there." On the upside, food and beverages stocks gained, led by Dutch food group Numico which surged 21.4 percent after Danone offered $17 billion to buy it. "The premium is relatively high and it shows again that liquidity is abundant in markets and even for companies, there's a need for them to park their excess funds and expand business," said Thierry Lacraz, a European strategist at Pictet & Cie. Anglo-Dutch consumer goods firm Unilever also jumped 3.4 percent as investors judged the group as ripe for takeover in the wake of Danone's bid for Numico. Also among gainers, Britain's biggest clothing retailer M&S rose 2.5 percent after it said sales at UK stores open more than a year rose a better-than-expected 2 percent in the 13 weeks to June 30, the first quarter of its financial year. This included a 2.9 percent rise in general merchandise sales and a 0.7 percent increase in food sales. A Reuters poll of eight analysts had forecast a 1.3 percent rise in general merchandise and a 1.9 percent rise in food, while M&S said forecasts for both were pitched around 1 percent. "We believe that M&S has outperformed the market. Moreover, looking forward, with very little exposure to "big ticket" and with a large food and clothing offer, M&S is well placed in the sector," said Seymour Pierce in a research note. Markets are expected to take cue from the second quarter earnings season which gathers pace in the next few weeks. "We're pretty confident about the earnings season," said Barclays' Potts. "We believe that corporate profitability is going to hold up reasonably well, certainly better than the market's anticipating." Financial markets are awaiting further clues on US interest rates, with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke due to talk on inflation at 1700 G
