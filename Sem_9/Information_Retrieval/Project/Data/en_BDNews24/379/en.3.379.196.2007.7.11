 LONDON, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Marcus Trescothick and uncapped duo Mark Pettini and Luke Wright were named on Wednesday in England's 30-man provisional squad for the first world Twenty20 tournament in South Africa this September. Trescothick, 31, is included subject to proving his fitness following the stress-related illness that cut short his last two England tours and threatened to end his career. Essex batsman Pettini and Sussex all-rounder Wright, neither of whom have played any international cricket, are given their chance while there are surprise recalls for leg-spinner Chris Schofield and pace bowler James Kirtley. The squad will be trimmed to 15 by Aug. 11. "We have chosen this squad specifically for the world Twenty20 and included a number of players who have an excellent record in this form of the game at domestic level," said chairman of selectors David Graveney. On Trescothick, he said: "We have decided to name him in this provisional squad in order to give us more flexibility should it be decided that Marcus is ready to return to international cricket before the tournament takes place. "We are pleased that Marcus has made a successful return to county cricket this summer and he remains a world-class opening batsman but we will not be placing undue pressure on him to make a return to international cricket without first carefully considering all the issues involved." Squad: James Anderson (Lancashire), Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Ravi Bopara (Essex), Tim Bresnan (Yorkshire), Stuart Broad (Leicestershire), Glen Chapple (Lancashire), Paul Collingwood (Durham) (captain), Alastair Cook (Essex), Andrew Flintoff (Lancashire), James Kirtley (Sussex), Jon Lewis (Gloucestershire), Mal Loye (Lancashire), Darren Maddy (Warwickshire), Dimitri Mascarenhas (Hampshire), Paul Nixon (Leicestershire), Monty Panesar (Northamptonshire), Mark Pettini (Essex), Kevin Pietersen (Hampshire), Liam Plunkett (Durham), Matthew Prior (Sussex), Chris Schofield (Surrey), Owais Shah (Middlesex), Ryan Sidebottom (Nottinghamshire), Jeremy Snape (Leicestershire), Vikram Solanki (Worcestershire), Chris Tremlett (Hampshire), Marcus Trescothick (Somerset), Jonathan Trott (Warwickshire), Luke Wright (Sussex), Michael Yardy (Sussex)
