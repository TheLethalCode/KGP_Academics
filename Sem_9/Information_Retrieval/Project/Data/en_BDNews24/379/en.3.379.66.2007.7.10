 Jessore, July 09 (bdnews24.com) - Tanvir Hasan Anjan, son of assassinated editor of daily Runner RM Saiful Alam Mukul, died in unclear circumstances Monday, police said. Anjan was found bullet-wounded in a bathroom at his home in Bejpara at midday. Anjan's mother Hafiza Akter said it was a murder but the police were not sure about it. An unidentified gang killed Anjan's father on August 30, 1998. Anjan's cousin Shwarna said she was watching TV with Anjan and their grandmother at his home. Shwarna said she had heard a loud noise apparently of gunfire moments after Anjan went to the bathroom. Anjan's mother Hafiza was away at the time. Back home, Hafiza saw blood spill out of the bathroom. The family broke the door of the bathroom open and found Anjan wounded inside. Kotwali police chief MA Matin said the police could not confirm whether it was a murder. Anjan's uncle Mazharul Alam Tutul, editor of the daily Runner, described the incident as "mysterious". Hafiza blamed the killing on relatives. Anjan was a second-year student of accounting at Jessore MM College. bdnews2
