 MOSCOW, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Russian interior ministry servicemen died and five were wounded on Tuesday when their armoured vehicle was ambushed in the troubled Chechnya region, Russian news agencies reported. A bomb planted in the road exploded as the vehicle went past and then gunmen opened fire, said the agencies, citing sources in Russian security bodies. The incident occurred near the village of Dyshne-Vedeno in the mountainous part of the volatile North Caucasus republic. In Moscow, police officials declined to comment. Russia's federal troops have battled rebel fighters in Chechnya in two wars since 1994, forcing them back to their mountain hideouts. The Kremlin says the tiny republic is now returning to peaceful life but such incidents are still common.
