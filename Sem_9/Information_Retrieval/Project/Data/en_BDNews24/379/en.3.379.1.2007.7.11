<TEXT>
 Kandy, July 12 (bdnews24.com) - Rains ruined the best part of play on the second day of the third and final Test Thursday but whenever the game was on, it was far worse in terms of batting as Bangladesh folded for just 131 in the first innings against Sri Lanka at Asigariya Stadium. Sri Lanka were 30 for no loss in 8.4 overs at the close of Day 2 after bad light forced umpires to call off the proceedings with more than 25 overs to go in the final session after the match resumed three hours after lunch due to showers. Michael Vandort, dropped in the slip, was unbeaten on 25 and Upal Tharanga, who missed the first two Tests due to a heel injury, was four not out as Sri Lanka were 101 runs behind in the first innings. Earlier, Muttiah Muralitharan grabbed six wickets under the cloudy skies as Bangladesh once again suffered first-innings debacle to get all out below 150 runs in the morning. The off-spin wizard spearheaded the Sri Lankan assault as he wrapped the Tigers' tails up removing four batsmen in quick succession. Paceman Sujeewa de Silva had broken the middle-order dismissing both overnight batsmen shortly after the play resumed. Bangladesh slipped to 131 all out from the overnight total of 72 for four, adding only 59 runs losing six wickets. Without pace duo of Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando, Muralitharan took things on his own to wreak the Bangladesh innings with six for just 28 runs, his 59th five-wicket haul in his 113th test. It was a great day for the local crowd, as their hometown hero 'Murali' crossed 100 wickets at the venue. Thursday's play began half an hour late under overcast conditions and paceman Sujeewa, playing his third Test, struck double blow by sending back Tushar Imran for 17 and then dismissing Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful for 26. He forced Tushar to drive without getting to the pitch of the delivery to edge to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene. Four overs later, he saw Mohammad Ashraful offer a thick outside edge to Jayawardene going for a cover drive to leave the tourists in tatters. Then, Muralitharan removed the remaining Bangladeshi batsmen at the cost of just 20 runs. Both Mashrafee (5) and Rafique (5) gave return catches to Muralitharan, who also had Shahadat caught by Tillakaratne Dilshan at forward short-leg. Syed Rasel was caught by Tillakaratne Dilshan off Muralitharan to end yet another disastrous first innings. However, it was the first time Bangladesh had crossed the 100-run mark in the first innings in the series after being skittled out for 89 and 62 in the first two Tests. On Wednesday, Malinga struck upfront when he trapped Javed Omar (8) lbw to reduce the hosts to 10 for one, but Bangladesh looked unfazed with opener Shahriar Nafees and one-down Habibul Bashar keeping the scoreboard ticking. But then came a controversial decision on former skipper Habibul Bashar in the fourth ball after lunch. Farveez Maharoof had Bashar caught behind by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene for 18, leaving the side at 50 for two. The former captain, who looked impressive with his footwork and stroke, was unlucky to be adjudged out as TV replays showed Maharoof inswinger did not nick the bat. After the resumption of play for a second time, Muralitharan struck double blow in the space of three runs to reduce the Tigers to 64 for four. The off-spinner had a confident-looking Shahriar Nafees caught by Sujeewa de Silva at mid-off after having an out-of-sorts Rajin Saleh caught behind with a doosra for a 29-ball duck. Nafees made a 77-ball 29 studded with four boundaries. bd
