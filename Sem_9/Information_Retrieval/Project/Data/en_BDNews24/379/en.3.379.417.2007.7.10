<TITLE> UMC posts small fall in June sales amid chip recovery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, July 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UMC the world's No 2 contract chip maker, posted a small annual decline in June sales on Monday, but the result marked its fourth straight monthly gain, amid a chip upturn driven by growing tech demand. The Taiwan firm's second-quarter sales also improved from the previous three months, when many clients suffered from high stockpiles, which bodes well for the second half as new PCs, cellphones, game consoles and flat-screen TVs hit the stores. Last month's sales at United Microelectronics Corp were T$8.745 billion ($267 million), down 0.44 percent from T$8.784 billion in the same month last year, the company said on its Web site, without giving an explanation. UMC had sales of T$8.220 billion in May. For the April-June quarter, UMC's sales totalled T$25.097 billion, according to Reuters calculations, representing an increase of 9 percent from the first quarter, beating market expectations and UMC's own estimate of a 6-8 percent sequential rise made in May. Second-quarter sales were down 2.5 percent from a year ago. Before the results, analysts had expected UMC to post sales of T$24.774 billion for the second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. They say its sales would grow to T$28.386 billion and T$31.523 billion in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. Sector leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd is set to post June sales on Tuesday. UMC's sales came minutes after the Taipei stock market closed on Monday. UMC shares rose 0.24 percent to T$21.00, a five-month closing high, and TSMC shares were up 2.13 percent at T$72.00, lifting the main TAIEX 1.98 percent to a 7-year high. But BNP Paribas analyst Eric Chen said in a June report that the current cyclical recovery could be a shorter one compared with previous booms. "We are concerned that the inventory is likely to be rebuilt by the end of third quarter, if demand is lower-than-expected and supply is increased through aggressive manufacturing," said Chen, who gave a `hold' rating on UMC. But he rated TSMC at a `buy'. TSMC has been enjoying higher margins and bigger market share than UMC, where the two firms grab around two-thirds of global market share together by making chips for key clients, including top cellphone chip maker Texas Instruments Inc. In the foundry industry where pricing competition remains intense, UMC has said it will be branching out to central processing unit (CPU) and memory chip manufacturing to boost earnings. (US$1=T$32.
