 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will look for a reverse in the abysmal batting fortunes when they go head to head against Sri Lanka in the third and final Test at Asgiriya International Stadium, Kandy Wednesday. Bangladesh have flown in Tushar Imran in a desperate bid to strengthen the middle order on the bouncy wicket of Asgiriya. The Tigers were skittled out for 89 in the first innings of the first Test and for their lowest-ever total of 62 in the first innings of the second Test. The Sri Lanka pace trio of Lasith Malinga, Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando ran through the Bangladesh top and middle orders in the first two Tests before spin maestro Muttiah Muralitharan wrapped up the tails. The bouncy wicket of Asgiriya is believed to favour the fast bowling and both sides have decided to play three pacers Wednesday as in the second Test at P Saravanamattu Stadium. There is some good news for the visitors as Vaas is not playing the third Test due to his commitment with English club Middlesex. Besides, either Malinga or Fernando might be rested to draft new face Sujeewa de Silva. Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful is hoping the coin would smile on him in Kandy having had tough luck with the toss so far. "Luck has not been my way and I am expecting it to change here," Ashraful was quoted as saying by cricinfo. Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene said, "There would probably be a bit of movement as well as carry. I am not sure whether it has the same pace as the Sara Stadium but it will definitely have a little bit more movement given the fact that the conditions here are usually moist." Bangladesh have made two changes to their side with middle-order batsman Tushar replacing Mehrab Hossain Junior and fast bowler Syed Rasel replacing Mohammad Sharif. "Mehrab has been dropped after just one Test because he is not a middle-order batsman but a specialist opener," the 23-year old Bangladesh skipper explained. "Tushar has been scoring runs for the A team as well as in domestic cricket, that's why we got him down early for the final Test." Jayawardene is aiming for a clean sweep with another resounding win in the final Test. "That's the only way to look at it. We've played some really good cricket the last two weeks or so and we are 2-0 up in the series. We don't want to have any hiccups at this stage," Jayawardene was quoted as saying by cricinfo. "We want to make sure that we concentrate and play the same brand of cricket and have the result going our way so that it will be good for us going into the one-day series as well as for the season which is coming up for us." Sri Lanka are yet to finalise their playing eleven, but there might be three changes to their side. Pacer Farveez Maharoof and opener Upal Tharanga are almost set to play the match in the places of Chaminda Vaas and openers Michael Vandort or Malinda Warnapura. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful, Shahriar Nafees Ahmed, Javed Omer, Rajin Saleh, Habibul Bashar, Tushar Imran, Mushfiqur Rahim (wicketkeeper), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Mohammed Rafique, Shahadat Hossain Rajib and Syed Rasel. Sri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Michael Vandort, Malinda Warnapura, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene (wk), Farveez Maharoof, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Muttiah Muralitharan, Sujeewa de Silva.
