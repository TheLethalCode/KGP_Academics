 COLOMBO, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka are set to make changes in the third and final test against Bangladesh starting on Wednesday, having already secured the series. Sri Lanka won both the first two matches by an innings and now have the chance to give reserve players an outing. Veteran fast bowler Chaminda Vaas has been granted leave to return to England to play county cricket with Middlesex. All rounder Farveez Maharoof is poised to take his place having impressed skipper Mahela Jayawardene in the nets. "Farveez has been bowling really well in the nets and has been unfortunate to play thus far in the series -- he has a good chance of playing here in Kandy," Jayawardene told Reuters. "We have not decided yet whether we will rest either Lasith Malinga or Dilhara Fernando," he added. If Fernando or Malinga are rested then 27-year-old left-armer Sujeewa de Silva, who last played test cricket five years ago against Bangladesh, is expected to play. Opener Upul Tharanga is also now available having recovered from a hairline fracture in his left foot. "Upul is available for selection and will now have a tough decision to make because both Michael (Vandort) and Malinda (Warnapura) have done well as openers in the first two games," Jayawardene added. Muttiah Muralitharan is expected to play in his hometown as he bids to reach the 700-wicket milestone in test cricket. The 35-year-old off spinner, who is chasing Shane Warne's world-record haul of 708 wickets, starts the match with 688 scalps. Bangladesh will be hoping to salvage some pride from a disappointing series in which they have been bowled out for 89 and 62 in the first innings of the first two matches. The tourists have lost all nine of their previous encounters with Sri Lanka and will hope to avert defeat for the first time. Squads: Sri Lanka: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Upul Tharanga, Michael Vandort, Kumar Sangakkara, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Farveez Maharoof, Muttiah Muralitharan, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Malinga Bandara, Malinda Warnapura, Sujeewa de Silva. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafe Mortaza, Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, Mehrab Hossain jnr, Shahriar Nafees, Rajin Saleh, Shakib Al Hasan, Khaled Mashud, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mohammed Rafique, Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Sharif, Mushfiqur Rahim
