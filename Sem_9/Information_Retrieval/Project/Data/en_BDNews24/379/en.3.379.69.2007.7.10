<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Dhaka Abahani Limited take on 'pressure- less' Brothers Union in crucial B. League match Wednesday at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Both skippers take the high-voltage match in the contrasting way with Abahani captain Arif Khan Joy seeing the match as a vital one to get closer to the title and Brothers captain Masud Rana taking it as a battle of prestige. The popular sky-blues are jointly in the second position with Dhaka Mohammedan SC with 32 points playing a match less than Mohammedan's 16 and they are still considered favourite in the way they have been playing in the second round matches. But, Brothers Union have already quit from the race with 23 points from 15 outings, and are looking forward to lifting their position up in the 11-team table, in which Muktijoddha Sangsad are at the top with 33 points from 17 outings. "It is a very important match for us and we want to get closer to the title winning the match against Brothers Wednesday," said Abahani captain Joy. Brothers captain Masud, however, sees nothing important for them and they would play the match without taking any pressure. "It is just a battle of prestige for us. We are free from the pressure as we are no more in the title race," said Mashud. In the first meeting of the first-ever professional football league, both giants shared honour playing a goalless draw at the big bowl. Abahani are in good rhythm with their strikers regularly getting the net in their second round matches but, their vulnerable defence lineup frequently fails to protect their post. "Our defence lineup was more strong in the first leg with presence of Argentine defender Mariano Carlos Caporale, but his return home has made our defence vulnerable and we conceded many worst goals in the second leg matches," said Joy. Playmaker Joy with groin injury might be fielded on Wednesday's match along with midfielders Abul Hossain and Mehdi Hasan Ujjal as his replacement Pranotosh is suffering from fever. Jahid Hasan Amili and Ghanaian Awudu Ibrahim will remain on Abahani attacking area to try breaking the Brothers' defence made by veteran Jewel Rana, Mashud Rana and Amit Rahman Shuvro. Brothers' Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin said that his boys are ready for the match and they would play the game correcting their mistakes that occurred in the last match against Muktijoddha where they lost the match 1-0 despite performing better. "We gave up the hope of clinching the title. So we have nothing to lose against Abahani and we will play against them quite free from pressure," said Masud Rana.
