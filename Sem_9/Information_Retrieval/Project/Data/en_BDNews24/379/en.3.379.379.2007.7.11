 NEW YORK, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US appeals court judges considered on Tuesday whether a $200 billion lawsuit against big tobacco companies by smokers of 'light' cigarettes should be allowed to go ahead as a class action. The hearing before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is the latest development in a closely watched case filed by smokers, who say tobacco companies defrauded them into thinking 'lights' were safer. Last year a federal judge certified the case as a class action, prompting tobacco companies to appeal. During the hearing in Manhattan, a three-judge panel asked lawyers whether it could be presumed that smokers who bought 'light' cigarettes believed they were safer or whether that had to be worked out on a case-by-case basis. The judges questioned lawyers about issues such as whether smokers chose 'lights' for reasons like taste, and when did smokers actually know about how health risks of smoking lights, compared with smoking regular cigarettes. What did the individual consumer know, Circuit Judge John Walker said, adding, "That's the big problem here." The issues could be key in deciding whether the lower court's decision meets the requirements of a class action, experts say. One legal expert who attended the hearing said at least two of the judges appeared "extremely skeptical about the propriety of certification." "A critical question that must be answered is whether common issues predominate," said Benjamin Zipursky, professor at Fordham University School of Law. The lawsuit was filed in May 2004. In September of last year, US Senior District Judge Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn, New York, granted class-action status in the case. The defendants in the case include Altria Group's Philip Morris USA unit; Reynolds American's RJ Reynolds Tobacco; Loews's Lorillard Tobacco unit; Vector Group's Liggett Group; and British American Tobacco's British American Tobacco (Investments). The class includes tens of millions of people who bought cigarettes of any of 65 'lights' brands over a 35-year period and potentially exposes companies to hundreds of billions of dollars of liabilities, according to tobacco firms. Philip Morris USA introduced the first light cigarette, Marlboro Lights, in 1971. "It is very difficult to certify a class because individual issues predominate," Theodore Grossman, lawyer for the tobacco companies, said at the hearing. "What we have here is the roughest kind of justice," he said, referring to the circuit court decision. Michael Hausfeld, lawyer for the smokers, argued that class certification was appropriate. He said smokers bought 'light' cigarettes thinking they were less ri
