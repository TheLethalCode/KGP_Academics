 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com) Family members of Sutapa, a Dhaka University student who died in uncertain circumstances in September 2009, have sought the intervention of the prime minister to bring her former husband to justice. Laila Zahid, the mother of Mafruda Haque Sutapa who was a master's student of mass communication and journalism department, demanded his exemplary punishment. Sutapa's father, brother, sister and students of the department had organised a human chain to bring attention to the case. The Criminal Investigation Department is investigating the death. Sutapa died at her in-law's house on Sep 19 last year, a year after getting married to Imrul Sadat Abeer. Her family filed a case with Mirpur Police Station the same night against Abeer, her former husband, claiming that he tortured her to death. Police arrested him within hours after her death. Abeer told police that he and his wife had "pushed and shoved" each other during a quarrel. He said that Sutapa committed suicide by hanging herself from a grille later that night. On Saturday, Sutapa's sister Ayesha Siddika said, "She was not a girl to commit suicide. She was tortured. "There is much evidence of torture," Ayesha claimed. Laila, addressing the prime minister, said, "You know how it hurts to wait for justice as you had to wait long 36 years. We can't bear the pain. "Please, punish the killers of my daughter immediately," she added. Sutapa's niece Moumita Siddiqui had the day after her death alleged her husband had beaten Sutapa to death. She told bdnews24.com at that time that torture marks were visible when a personal physician examined Sutapa's body, DU vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique said the person responsible must be prosecuted to stop repetition of such incidents. bdne
