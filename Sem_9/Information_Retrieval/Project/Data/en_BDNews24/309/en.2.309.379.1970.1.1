 BUDAPEST, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungarians vote on Sunday in an election centre-right Fidesz is expected to win by a landslide to oust the Socialists after eight years and secure a strong mandate to try to lift the economy out of recession. The latest opinion polls showed Fidesz had 60-63 percent support among decided voters, putting it in a strong position to possibly gain a two-thirds majority in the next parliament to push through structural reforms. Fidesz has campaigned on cutting taxes, creating jobs, and curbing red-tape and corruption, while supporting local firms. "With a two-thirds majority Fidesz can change the constitution and therefore rewrite election rules and reshape the local political/administration system," Eurasia Group said in a note. "A rapid reform push (starting in June/July) is exactly what market participants, the IMF, and the EU want and expect to see." The Socialists and far-right party Jobbik are seen running neck and neck in the vote, with the latest Median poll giving them both 17 percent among decided voters. Nationalist Jobbik, which has capitalised on public anger over economic hardship and antagonism towards the Roma minority, may end up as the second biggest parliamentary force and some analysts said significant gains by Jobbik could cause unease among investors. Deep reforms to downsize Hungary's local government sector and make its health care system and education more efficient are seen as paramount to Hungary's long term growth potential and the economy's competitiveness. The country's economy contracted by 6.3 percent last year, while unemployment is running at 11.4 percent -- the highest since 1994 -- which has further increased public discontent over the past Socialist governments' spending cuts and tax hikes. The last Socialist government led by technocrat Gordon Bajnai since April 2009 had to make painful budget cuts to keep the budget deficit at 4 percent of gross domestic product under a financing deal led by the International Monetary Fund. The cuts helped stabilise Hungary's finances and regain investors' confidence but exacerbated the recession. Many Hungarians now feel disappointed and no better off than 20 years ago, just after the communist regime collapsed. "We need to fix what this (Socialist) government screwed up. The economy has tanked. We will vote for Fidesz, we believe they keep young people and entrepreneurs in mind," said Erika Aufmuth, 35, an entrepreneur. "In the current political structure ... one must chose between bad and worse. I will still vote, not for something but against the last eight years (of Socialist rule)," said Fanni Sarkozy, 29, a pianist. The fourth party seen winning enough support to get into parliament is the green liberal L
