<TITLE> Water protests block major city road </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Traffic came to a halt on the capital's Mohakhali-Gulshan link road on Sunday morning as locals blocked the road demanding uninterrupted water supply. The water crisis has been mounting in the capital due to frequent load-shedding as power demand increases with the approach of hotter weather. The demonstrators took position on the road with pitchers and buckets at around 10:30am, said Md Nurul Alam, assistant commissioner (Gulshan zone) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police. They lifted their blockade an hour later as the representatives of the demonstrators went to the WASA office to hold talks with the water supply authorities, Alam said. But the road block created heavy traffic congestion from Mahakhali to Banani in the meantime. The protesting locals blocked the same road last week to press the same demand and withdrew their protest after they were assured of a quick solution to the water crisis. But the water problem has not been solved yet, the residents said. Residents in other parts of the city, including nearby Badda, have also launched protests in recent weeks. bdnew
