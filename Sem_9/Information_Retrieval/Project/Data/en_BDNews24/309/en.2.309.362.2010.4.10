 ROME, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gianluigi Buffon should return for Juventus against Cagliari on Sunday (1300) to boost their flagging Champions League hopes as the Turin club's poor form and media silence continues. The Turin side stopped speaking to reporters after suffering their 12th defeat in Serie A this term when they were blown away 3-0 at Udinese last weekend, having already been dumped from the Italian Cup and both European competitions.

Roma, who have 65 points in second, just one less than Inter, face relegation-threatened Atalanta Bergamo at home on Sunday (1300).
