 Liakat Ali Badal bdnews24.com correspondent Rangpur, Apr 10(bdnews24.com)- A hapless uncle had to be taken to a hospital after protesting against the harassment of his 13-year old niece. Rozina Begum a seventh grade student of Imamganj High School from Khansama Union in Kaonia Upazila in Rangpur was crying as she sat by her uncle Lablu's bed. She stays with her maternal uncle's family as both her parents work in garment factories in Dhaka. Rozina said that a boy called Mithu used to harass her almost every day on the way to school. "He wanted to marry me and sometimes made indecent proposals." She said that sometimes Mithu threatened to burn her face with acid if she did not respond. Rozina has already attempted to commit suicide unable to cope with the strain Mithu had put on her. Lying in his bed at the Kaonia Upazila Health Complex, Lablu told bdnews24.com that Lablu said that he went to Mithu's father Rafiqul at Khansama bazar at around 10pm on Friday to find a remedy. But after hearing me, "Rafiqul, along with some youths, swooped on me and hit me on the head." They also beat Lablu's brother and others who went to his rescue. Mithu's father, Rafiqul Islam, is union president of the Swechchashebak League, an affiliate body of the ruling Awami League. Lablu also claimed that Rafiqul's men had vandalised his uncle Yousuf's store and looted goods worth Tk 2 lakh. Rozina said, "I seek justice and demand punishment of the wrong-doer. I want to continue my studies." Ekramul Haque, Rozina's grandfather demanded exemplary punishment and filed a case with the Kaonia police. Second officer of Kaonia Police Station, Rezaul Islam, declined to speak but confirmed that a case had been filed and the matter would be dealt with seriously. bdnews24
