 Prodip Chowdhury Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)The War Crimes Fact Finding Committee has been asked by the agency investigating alleged offences committed during the 1971 war to update its list and inform them of those who have died. WCFFC convener MA Hasan acknowledged on Saturday to bdnews24.com that more than half of the 1775 names on the list handed to the agency on Apr 4 have died. "Only about 500 to 600 of them are now alive. The agency is now asking us about those who are still alive and their location," he said. "So we're working to develop an updated list," he added. The investigative agency had on Mar 30 formally asked for information from the Liberation War Museum and the WCFFC. Hassan said that, "15 professional investigation officers had worked for several years to collect the information. "We spoke to the people who were tortured, we visited 945 killing grounds, we took testimonies of witnesses, looked at investigation reports from home and abroad, newspapers and articles," he claimed. The convenor said, "We have covered almost all the villages across the country, which is how we obtained their names, addresses and details of offences. "Professionalism was ensured whilst collecting this information," he added. Hassan also asked the government to take over the documents and evidence that the organisation has collected over the last 11 years. "We've kept this evidence at a house where we're paying rent. The government should secure this information, as otherwise many valuable documents could be destroyed," he added. Hassan also raised concerns about his own personal security, saying that "I'm receiving threats all the time. An incident could occur anywhere if steps are not taken as the war criminals are more dangerous now." "During the tenure of the previous caretaker government, special branch deployed an officer for my security," he added. He alleged that war criminals are observing the organisation's activities, adding that "many documents sent through the private courier services are lost." He also stressed the importance of close monitoring of the alleged war criminals, who might otherwise flee abroad. "Police should be deployed at the village level. Already a good number of war criminals have fled abroad," he said. b
