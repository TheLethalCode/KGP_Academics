 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Dhaka University's law department formed a human chain on Sunday protesting the delay in receiving the results of their final exams. Over 200 students participated in the demonstration in front of their department. Some students also smashed a number of flower pots. The demonstrators alleged that the results of students in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th years had not been published. They said that the results of the 2nd year final exams had not been published 10 months after the exams and the results of 3rd and 4th years have not been published for eight months. Department chairperson Prof Sumaiya Khayer admitted that this was the case. "I am sorry for this situation. The exam copies were submitted late," she said. She assured the students that the results would be out by Apr 20. An emergency meeting of the academic council has been convened on Monday to take quick steps, the chairperson said. Masters students of the philosophy department demonstrated to press for a similar demand on Saturday. bd
