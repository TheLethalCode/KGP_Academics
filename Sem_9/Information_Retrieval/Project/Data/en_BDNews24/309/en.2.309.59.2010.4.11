 BANGKOK, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's capital Bangkok was calm on Sunday, a day after clashes between troops and opposition activists killed 18 people in the city's historic old quarter, but any resolution of the political row seemed distant. The fighting, the worst political violence in the nation in 18 years and some of it in well-known tourist areas of the capital, ended after security forces pulled back late on Saturday and urged the "red shirt" activists to do the same. The city of 15 million was quiet on Sunday and the overground Skytrain, halted as violence intensified on Saturday, reopened with a restricted service, avoiding the central shopping district occupied for over a week by the "red shirt" protesters. The government said it had appointed a senior prime ministerial aide to make contact with "red shirt" leaders to try to find a way to halt the confrontations. "Yesterday's bloodbath is a wake-up call to halt the slide towards anarchy," the Nation daily said in a commentary on its front page under the headline "Our Darkest Hour". The "red shirts" -- mostly rural and working-class supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a coup in 2006 -- have demanded that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve parliament and leave the country. Troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at thousands of demonstrators, who fought back with guns, grenades and petrol bombs near the Phan Fah bridge and Rajdumnoen Road in Bangkok's old quarter, a base for the month-old protest. More than 800 people were injured. Four soldiers were among those killed. Hundreds of protesters also forced their way into government offices in two northern cities, raising the risk of a larger uprising against Abhisit and his 16-month-old, military-backed government. "There is no precedent for something so massive, prolonged and disruptive on the part of the underclasses," said Federico Ferrara, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore. "The people who are leading the protest now are people whose right to participate in government has never been fully recognised, hence the coups that have removed governments elected by the provincial electorate." NO MANDATE The protesters say Abhisit lacks a popular mandate after coming to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote following a court ruling that dissolved a pro-Thaksin ruling party. Thaksin's allies would be well-placed to win fresh elections. The "red shirts" have shown they have support among Bangkok's poor but have angered the middle classes, many of whom regard them as misguided slaves to Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon who fled into exile in 2008 to avoid a jail term for corruption. The government declared a state of emergency in Bangkok on April 7 after red shirts broke into the grounds of parliament, forcing some officials to flee by helicopter. Washington urged both sides to show restraint. "We deplore this outbreak of political violence in Thailand, our long-term friend and ally, and urge good faith negotiations by the parties to resolve outstanding issues through peaceful means," White House spokesman Mike Hammer said. In a televised statement, Abhisit expressed regret to the families of the victims and said the army was only allowed to use live bullets "firing into the air and in self-defence". Among those killed was Reuters TV cameraman Hiro Muramoto, a 43-year-old Japanese national who had worked for Thomson Reuters in Tokyo for more than 15 years and had arrived in Bangkok on Thursday to cover the protests. "Journalism can be a terribly dangerous profession as those who try to tell the world the story thrust themselves in the centre of the action. The entire Reuters family will mourn this tragedy," said David Schlesinger, Reuters Editor-in-Chief. After hours of violence on Saturday, army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said troops would pull back in the old quarter as the riot spread to Khao San Road, popular with back-packing tourists. A Reuters photographer said Khao San Road resembled a war zone. Shop windows were shattered, cars smashed and many people lay wounded on the street. "If this continues, if the army responds to the red shirts, violence will expand," Sansern said after announcing troops were withdrawing from the area. He said soldiers had been pelted with petrol bombs and M79 grenades, and that some of the protesters were armed with guns. A red shirt leader later called on supporters to pull back to the main protest sites. Thousands of protesters also remained in Bangkok's main Rachaprasong shopping district, a stretch of upscale department stores and five-star hotels. The red shirts used taxis and pick-up trucks to barricade themselves in that ar
