 Chittagong, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Tension is running high in Chittagong in the light of the Jamaat-e-Islami meeting which is planned to take place in the city on Sunday afternoon. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed is scheduled to attend the meeting to be held at 3pm in the port city's Safa Arcade Community Centre. Supporters of Awami League under the banner of Muktijoddha-Chhatra-Janata announced that they would hold a meeting at the same venue. Police, however, said that it would not allow any group to hold a meeting there. Second officer of Kotwali Police Station Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com that they feared disruption of the law and order situation since both the groups had called a meeting at the same venue. Police personnel have been deployed in front of the community centre, he said. Jamaat leader Mojaheed, who is already in Chittagong, is currently staying at the party office some 50 yards away from the proposed meeting venue. Jamaat's Chittagong metropolitan chief Shamsul Islam told bdnews24.com that it had taken permission from the authorities to hold the meeting and vowed to hold it as planned. MR Azim, organiser of Muktijoddha-Chhatra-Janata, said that they would not allow Mojaheed, an alleged war criminal, to attend any meeting in Chittagong. As of 2pm, the district administration has not yet imposed a section 144 order in the city banning public meetings. The Jamaat leader has faced obstruction in a number of cities since the government formed war crime tribunals to prosecute those accused of committing crimes in 1971. There are allegations of war crimes against a number of Jamaat leaders.
