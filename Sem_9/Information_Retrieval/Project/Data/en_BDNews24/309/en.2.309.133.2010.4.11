 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Sunday sent to jail Afroza Abbas, wife of the BNP leader Mirza Abbas, in relation to two tax cases for which she had been convicted for 16 years. UPDATED Judge AK Roy of the Special Court-2 issued the order after she surrendered herself to the court, and he rejected her application for bail. The judge ordered authorities to take proper arrangements for her treatment. The same judge had previously sentenced her on Sept 2, 2007 following a trial where she did not appear as she was absconding. In one case, she was jailed for eight years for evading tax of Tk 11.58 lakh and fined Tk 12 lakh and in the second case she was jailed for another eight years and fined Tk 4.70 crore for evading tax amounting to Tk 4.67 crore. The National Board of Revenue had filed the two cases against Afroza, former chairman of Dhaka Bank, on August 5, 2007 during the caretaker government regime. Sanaullah Miah and Jainal Abedin Mesbah represented Afroza in the bail hearing.
