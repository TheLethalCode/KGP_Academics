 Sylhet, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  Implicitly admitting involvement of party cadres, Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam on Saturday warned of dire consequences against extortionists and tender manipulators. The AL spokesperson asked his party men to refrain from such practices and hinted that the only way to truly bring about their pledged politics of change was to come away from such practices. "The country will change only if the Awami League itself changes." Ashraf said that hooliganism in the name of student politics would not be tolerated. The Awami League stalwart said, "Extortionists and tender manipulators will be dealt with an iron hand." Syed Ashraf was speaking as chief guest at the launch of a campaign to recruit new members for district and metropolitan units in Sylhet. Comparing the campaign to electioneering, he said, "Door to door campaign must be launched to make the programme a success and women's participation also needs to be enhanced." He said they would have to ensure overwhelming support of the people for the trial of war criminals. Recently, a Chhatra League leader Faruk Hossain was killed in a clash between factions of the ruling party's student wing over a tender bid in Panchagarh. Almost every national daily published the picture of chase and counter-chase between two groups over tender in Dinajpur the following day. Awami League advisory committee member AMA Muhith inaugurated the campaign. The programme chaired by ANM Shafiqul Haq was also attended among others by Awami League organising secretary Misbah Uddin Siraj and Sylhet city mayor Badrun Uddin Ahmad Kamran. bdnew
