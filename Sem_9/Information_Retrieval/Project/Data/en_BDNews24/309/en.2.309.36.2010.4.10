 Chittagong, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Chittagong district road transport owners' group has announced that it will hold a strike on 70 routes from April 15 unless their demands are met. It declared the strike at a press conference in Chittagong press-club on Saturday in the presence of leaders of both the bus owners and bus workers organisations. Monzurul Alam Monzu, president of the owner's group said that certain decisions made during the caretaker government are now destroying the transport sector with the result that many bus owners are loosing their businesses. The leaders have said that, in February, through the deputy commissioner, they sent a memorandum with their demands to the prime minister and communication minister but there had been no response. The owners have now issued a 10 point demand including reducing the price for spare parts in the coming budget, stopping all vehicles without a route permit, stopping extortion in the transport sector, building a permanent bus terminal in Chittagong, and a lower toll for proposed Third Karnaphuli Bridge. In the press conference leaders of the owners' group has urged the government to agree to these demands by April 14 as otherwise they will go on strike. b
