 BANGKOK,April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at thousands of demonstrators, who fought back with grenades, guns and petrol bombs in a riot which killed eight people on Saturday in Bangkok. At least 242 people, including 64 soldiers and police, have been wounded in skirmishes near the Phan Fah bridge and Rajdumnoen Road in Bangkok's old quarter, a protest base near government buildings and the regional U.N. headquarters. Four civilians and four soldiers were killed, deputy governor of Bangkok Malinee Sukavrejworakit said. She did not give details. Hundreds of "red shirt" protesters also forced their way into government offices in two northern cities, raising the risk of a larger uprising against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and his 16-month-old, military-backed government. After hours of violence, army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said troops would pull back in the old quarter as the riot spread into Khao San Road, an area popular with back-packing tourists. "If this continues, if the army responds to the red shirts, violence will expand," Sansern said. He urged the protesters to do the same as they pelted soldiers with petrol bombs and M79 grenades. He said some protesters were armed with guns. A red shirt leader later called on supporters to pull back to the main protest sites. Khao San Road resembled a war zone, a Reuters photographer said. Shop windows were shattered. Cars were smashed. Many people lay wounded on the street. Police told reporters some protesters ignited cooking gas cylinders and rolled them into troops. "We are changing our demand from dissolving parliament in 15 days to dissolving parliament immediately," protest leader Veera Musikapong told the "red shirt" demonstrators. "And we call for Abhisit to leave the country immediately." Troops mounted two major offensives on protesters in the Phan Fah bridge and Rajdumnoen Road area. Both times they fired rubber bullets and tear gas but failed to clear the protesters. An afternoon offensive ended in a tense standoff with many wounded. After dark, troops opened fire again with rubber bullets about 500 metres (1,600 ft) away at an intersection leading to Bangkok's famous Khao San Road tourist area. Some fired live rounds into sky. Thai media said helicopters dropped tear gas. BARRICADED SHOPPING DISTRICT Tens of thousands also remained in Bangkok's main shopping district, a stretch of upscale department stores and five-star hotels held for a week by the mostly rural and working-class red shirts who say they have been marginalised in a country with one of Asia's widest disparities between rich and poor. The red shirts used taxis and pickup-trucks to barricade themselves in that area, and expanded their control to include several more blocks. Hundreds of riot police who massed at one end retreated after being surrounding by red shirts. Into evening, many people lined the main street cheering as protesters waving red flags packed pickup trucks which streamed into the area. Some climbed up electricity poles to cover closed-circuit cameras with flags to stop police surveillance. The violence comes exactly a year after about 10,000 of the supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra brought traffic in Bangkok to a standstill for several days, occupying major intersections and sparking Thailand's worst political violence in 18 years. In those protests, red shirts hijacked petrol tankers, torched dozens of public buses and hurled petrol bombs at troops until the army imposed order. Two people were killed and 123 wounded. The latest protests, however, involve more than five times as many protesters spread across several areas of the city. The protesters say Abhisit lacks a popular mandate after coming to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote following a court ruling that dissolved a pro-Thaksin ruling party. They want immediate elections that Thaksin's allies would be well placed to win. The red shirts have won new support from Bangkok's urban poor but have angered middle classes, many of whom regard them as misguided slaves to Thaksin, a wily telecoms tycoon who fled into exile to avoid a jail term for graft. Hundreds also forced their way into the governor's office compound in the northern city of Chiang Mai and hundreds more broke into a town hall in Udon Thani in the northeast. The government declared a state of emergency in Bangkok on Wednesday to control the protests after red shirts broke into the grounds of parliament, forcing some officials including the deputy prime minister to flee by helicopter. The humiliating failure of security forces to stop protesters from besieging parliament and a satellite station two days later has raised questions over the competence and loyalty of Thailand's armed forces in a month of increasingly bold protes
