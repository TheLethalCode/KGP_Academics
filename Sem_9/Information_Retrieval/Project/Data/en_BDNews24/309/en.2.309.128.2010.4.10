<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)- The police are failing to investigate incidents where police are alleged to be acquiescing in tender manipulation. The police are simply alerting the relevant officer, and asking him to respond to the allegation. This become evident when police chief Nur Muhammad was talking to the journalists in a press conference on Saturday. When asked how many police officials have been charged and punished in relation to tender related violence, the police chief said, "We have asked many for an explanation on the incidents and have alerted others." "Some of the units have been ordered to take action against the responsible officer," he added. He admitted that he did not know how many officers faced action, and that he would have to find out. He however said that the police could not alone control tender-related criminal activities themselves. He said that previously, decisions had been made only allowing people to hand in their tender applications at the district administration office, the police superintendent's office or at the local police station. However, nothing could be done if the person or organisation who sets up the tender does not organise this, he said. The police chief also said that it is the tenderer's duty to observe the tender issue locally and any negligence on their part can result in serious consequences. He added that there is a strict government directive to curb any illegal activities regarding tender. SECURITY AT NEW YEARS CELEBRATION The police chief said that they had taken stringent precautions to avoid any disruption during the Bengali New Year celebration on April 10. He also added that police, RAB and the intelligence agencies will work together to prevent any sabotage during that time. The main celebration point at 'Ramna Batamul' will be guarded by nearly 6,500 members of the law enforcing agencies. Police estimate that the new year celebration will take place at 117 venues. Police chief said, "It is not possible for the police to be every where - local influential people and public representatives have to come forward to help with security." Though there is no information from the intelligence agencies that there might be any threat like the one that took place during the celebration in 2001 where a number of people died, the police will remain vigilant, he added. He said, "Those who do not support a liberal celebration like 'Pohela Boishak' have attacked the event earlier. There could be war criminals and militants among them." ORDER TO STOP HARASSMENT OF FEMALE STUDENTS The police chief has said that the deputy commissioners have been ordered to take necessary measures to stop harassment of female students. "Police can not alone stop harassment of female students. Teachers, peoples' representatives and parents also have to come forward," he said There has recently been some suicide incidents allegedly for harassment. WAR CRIMINAL MIR KASHEM ALI LEAVING THE COUNTRY Police are investigating if there was any negligence on the part of the force in failing to stop central Jammat leader and alleged war criminal Mir Kashem Ali from leaving the country, said the police chief. He said, "We are investigating the matter. Trying to find out if there was any negligence by anyone." "Moreover the there are some weakness in the systems in airport," he added. Alleged war criminal Mir Kashem Ali left the country one day before the formation of the war crime tribunal. PROMOTION In response to a question on newspaper reports that the government is recommending an officer for the promotion defying seniority, Nur Muhammad said, "Promotion is a matter for the ministry and the government.
