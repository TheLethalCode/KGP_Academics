 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has asserted full sovereignty over South Talpatti, an island in the Bay of Bengal. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said on Saturday that Bangladesh claimed full sovereignty over the disputed land. Quayes reiterated Bangladesh's claim over this small island in the Bay of Bengal, which only emerges above the sea level during the low tide, as some Indian media reported that South Talpatti had entirely submerged due to climate change. Bangladesh and India have both laid claim to this island which is located south of Satkhira district in the south-western corner of the country. "The Radcliff Award states that the border (between India and Pakistan, now Bangladesh) is between Chabbishpargana in India and Khulna in Bangladesh. Quayes told reporters at a press conference at the foreign ministry. "As South Talpatti lies east of the line set out in the Radcliff Award, Bangladesh has sovereignty over it." Additional foreign secretary Khurshed Alam, who heads the government's maritime boundary cell, told journalists that Bangladesh does not formally describe South Talpatti as an island. "Since 1980s we consider South Talpatti as a low tide strip which goes under water during the high tide and emerges in the low tide," he said. "India claims it is an island," said Khurshed. He said the government had no new information on South Talpatti which remains one of the most thorny issues between Bangladesh and India. It is one of the issues that stand in the way of demarcating the maritime boundary between the two neighbours. The maritime boundary delimitation talks between Bangladesh and India could not progress due to both country's bid towards securing their right over South Talpatti.
