 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Tirumalsetti Suman slammed a half-century as Deccan Chargers comfortably beat Chennai Super Kings by six wickets in the Indian Premier League encounter on Saturday. Times of India reported Suman was dismissed in the middle just after completing his half-century when he was caught by Suresh Raina off Shadab Jakati. Suman's (55 off 44) innings was studded with four boundaries and two sixes. However, Andrew Symonds held nerves to help his side chase the target successfully in the 19.1 overs. Suresh Raina got rid of Rohit Sharma when Sudeep Tyagi took a brilliant catch to dent the Deccan Chargers. R Ashwin got rid of both the openers Adam Gilchrist and Monish Mishra in one over to rock the Deccan Chargers in the fourth over. Ashwin first scalped Gilchrist (7 off 8) in the fourth over when the Deccan skipper played an away delivery and edged to the wicketkeeper. In the same over, Ashwin scalped Monish Mishra (21 off 18) in the fourth ball. Chennai had a chance to get rid of Gilchrist earlier when the explosive opener tried to cut but gets a thick outside edge that flies past Matthew Hayden at first slip and ran into the third man boundary. Deccan Chargers bowlers displayed brilliant skills to restrict Chennai Super Kings to 138/8 at the VCA Stadium. RP Singh gave Chennai Super Kings a blow when he scalped Subramaniam Badrinath as the visitors lost wickets at regular interval.

Raina (52 off 42) made a calculative half-century before going down to Ryan Harris. Subramaniam Badrinath was trying to move across and clip the ball to leg, the ball flied behind the keeper where Monish Mishra took a simple catch off RP Singh. Symonds scalped his countryman Michael Hussey to dent the Super Kings run-charge. Hussey pulled straight to Bodapati Sumanth at deep mid. Pragyan Ojha gave Chennai a big blow when he clean bowled skipper MS Dhoni. Just after Harmeet Singh scalped Hayden, Chennai Super Kings lost Murali Vijay in the encounter. The wicket of Vijay was a blow to Chennai as the dangerous opener Matthew Hayden was also dismissed just the previous over of Harmeet. Hayden (19 off 18) was going well with his opening partner Murali Vijay and meanwhile, he gave an outside edge to Gilchrist off Harmeet Singh. Chennai openers Hayden and Vijay made a steady start to their innings after Chennai skipper MS Dhoni won the toss and opted to bat in the encounter at VCA Stadium, Jamtha. The Super Kings have left out Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. The last time the two teams clashed, Symonds had blown away Chennai by blasting a 43-ball 50 run and picking up two crucial wic
