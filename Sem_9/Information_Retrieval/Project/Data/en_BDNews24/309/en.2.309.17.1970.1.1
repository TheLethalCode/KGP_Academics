 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien met BNP chairperson Kheleda Zia on Saturday night to bid her farewell. Khaleda and Dessallien had an hour long meeting at the BNP's party office in Gulshan, Dhaka. After the meeting, the top UN official in Bangladesh told journalists that people of Bangladesh loved democracy and the UN respected that popular belief. But it is widely perceived that this UN official and her office was instrumental in stewarding the take-over of a military-controlled interim regime on January 11, 2007 in Bangladesh. "The UN likes elected governments," said the outgoing Dessallien to journalists after her farewell meeting. But a media release from her office of Jan 11, 2007, stated that while the United Nations appreciated Bangladesh Army's role in previous elections, its deployment in support of the upcoming elections (which was 11 days away) 'raised questions' if the Jan 22 elections went ahead without the participation of all major parties. The release went on to say, "This may have implications for Bangladesh's future role in UN Peacekeeping Operations." It is generally speculated that the few lines went a long way to spur the army top brass into action. Renata Lok Dessallien said on Saturday she also hoped that democracy will become stronger in Bangladesh. The take-over the military-controlled regime on Jan 11 in 2007 led to an almost 2-year state of emergency when people's fundamental rights were suspended. b
