 Sunamganj, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  The state minister for health Mujibur Rahman Fakir has said that 32,000 doctors and nurses will be recruited within the next two months. Whilst inaugurating a private hospital on Saturday, he claimed that this recruitment would greatly reduce the medical crisis in the country. He also declared that the number of beds in Sunamganj Sadar Hospital will be increased to 250 beds from 100 at present. There are at present 2,213 public and private hospitals with a total capacity of 51,684 beds. There is only one bed for 2,665 people, one doctor for 3012 patients and one nurse for 6342 patients in the country according to government estimates. He said, that here is a particularly big difference in the ratio of doctors and nurses in the country and the government is trying to reduce this. He added that establishing private hospitals with good standards will help reduce the number of people who feel they have to go to other countries for treatment. The minster said that present government has now resumed the operation of 800 community hospitals which were closed during the previous government. Recently the government has said on the eve of World Health Day, that 12 district cities will be selected as "healthy cities". bdnews
