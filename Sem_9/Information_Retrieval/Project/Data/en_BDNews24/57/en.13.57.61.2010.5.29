 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bangladesh fast bowler Shahadat Hossain took five wickets against England at Lord's on Friday and then revealed he feared he might never play Test cricket after a desperate debut here five years ago. As an 18-year-old, Shahadat had figures of no wickets for 101 runs in just 12 overs as England won by a crushing innings and 261 run margin inside three days at Lord's in 2005. But it was a different story on Friday with Shahadat becoming the first Bangladesh bowler to take five wickets in a Test innings against England, with a return of five for 98 in 28 overs. By stumps on the second day Bangladesh  who have lost all six of their previous Tests against England -- were 172 for two. Junaid Siddique was 53 not out after openers Tamim Iqbal (55) and Imrul Kayes (43) made a fine start. Bangladesh were still 333 behind an England first innings 505 featuring Jonathan Trott's Test-best 226 and they needed a further 134 runs to avoid the follow-on. But their improvement was undeniable. "My debut here in 2005, I was very nervous," Shahadat told reporters. "This time I try my best, just bowl line length. It's the first time Bangladesh has got a name in the book (on the Lord's honours board) that's very important. "I just tried to be accurate, bowl quick with swing, line and length and nothing else." Thinking back to his first Test at Lord's, Shahadat added: "I had a nightmare debut. I never felt I would get a second chance to come to Lord's. "I played for the A team and came to England where I became the highest wicket-taker. I thought if I get another chance at Lord's I must make amends." He certainly did, with a burst of three wickets for 12 runs in 21 balls, Trott, wrapping up the England innings shortly after lunch.. Bangladesh's batsmen then backed up Shahadat's good work although, as the paceman pointed out, they were facing a far less threatening pace attack than the 2005 class of Stephen Harmison, Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff who went on that season to help England regain the Ashes from Australia. "It was the best bowling attack with Harmison, Jones and Flintoff. The bowling was very fast," Shahadat said. Turning back to Friday's play, he continued: "The batting was very good, Tamim and Imrul gave us a good start and Junaid carried it on." England's bowlers struggled for both penetration and accuracy on a good batting pitch, the exception being 21-year-old Steven Finn who, making his home Test debut on his Middlesex home ground having first featured at this level during a 2-0 series win in Bangladesh in March. Finn removed Kayes with a well-directed short ball the batsman could only glove to England captain Andrew Strauss, a county colleague of the bowler, at first slip. "It was a fantastic feeling to get my first (Test) wicket at Lord's in front of that crowd, and the atmosphere," Finn said. Looking ahead, the 6ft 7in paceman added: "At the moment it looks like a battle of attrition, us again trying to limit their boundary options and being clever with field-setting and able to attack at the right time. "We're still 300 odd runs ahead, so if we can get a couple of quick wickets that's going to be in the back of their minds they could potentially be following on within a session. "They have players who are dangerous, and it's important we don't take them lightly," Finn insisted. "We're not just going to be able to blast them away; we have to build pressure, which will in turn get us wickets
