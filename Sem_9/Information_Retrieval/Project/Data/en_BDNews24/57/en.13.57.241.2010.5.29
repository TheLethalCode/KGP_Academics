 Narayanganj, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Nearly 25,000kgs of melamine was recovered at a number of spots from various organisations. Business leaders recovered the toxic additive that they apprehend was destined for adulterating cattle food. The 500 sacks of melamine, each weighing 50kgs, were handed over to the police. However no arrests have been made thus far. Leaders of Nitaiganj's Wholesale Business Centre's businessmen association said that on Saturday noon, they caught Abu Miah, owner of Abu traders adulterating poultry and fish feed with melamine and questioned him. According to his confession, they conducted drives in Johnny Traders, Milan Flour Mill and a spice mill owned by one Abbasuddin Bhulu recovering 500 sacks of melamine, which they handed over to the police. Narayanganj Sadar Police chief Akhter Hossain told bdnews24.com: "No arrests have been made. We will take legal measures later on." The association's convenor and head of Atta-Maida Mill Owners Association, Matiur Rahman, told bdnews24.com that they had warned businessmen a few months back to not adulterate feeds and food products, including flour and poultry feed, with melamine. He said, "Price of a sack of cow feed is Tk 900, whereas a sack of melamine costs Tk 400." However, he could not reveal who is responsible for importing melamine. Naryanganj's civil surgeon Matiar Rahman said that melamine is toxic and very harmful for the human body. There was a huge uproar in the country around November last year when melamine was found in imported powdered milk products. bdnews
