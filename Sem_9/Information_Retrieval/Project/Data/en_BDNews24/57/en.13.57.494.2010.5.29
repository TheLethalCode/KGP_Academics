 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  The presence of representatives from the Jamaat-e-Islami at an election commission programme aroused resentment among the high-profile leaders of the other invited political parties. Law minister Shafique Ahmed, chief guest of the occasion, told bdnews24.com that despite being reluctant to attend because of the presence of the Jamaat, he felt he had to attend the programme as he was requested to come by the chief election commissioner. Top leaders of the Bangladesh Workers' Party and the Communist Party of Bangladesh also said they would not have attended the programme if they had known about Jamaat's presence. No representatives from the ruling Awami League and the main opposition BNP were present at the programme organised by the EC and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the capital's Hotel Radisson. All the political parties that were registered with the EC were invited to attend the programme. Jamaat, also a registered party, is accused of its having a controversial role with some of its leaders accused of having committed war crimes during the liberation war in 1971. On condition of anonymity, a law ministry official told bdnews24.com that the minister wanted to turn his car back on hearing about Jamaat's presence at the programme. Regarding the issue, the law minister told bdnews24.com, "At first, I decided not to attend the programme, but as the CEC requested and many foreign guests were also invited there, I had to go." CEC ATM Shamsul Huda, two other commissioners Sohul Hossain and M Shakhawat Hossain, and UNDP resident representative Stephen Pritzner were sitting on the main platform along with the minister. Jammat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami and his deputy Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed sat on right side of the first row while the others including Workers' Party chief Rashed Khan Menon, CPB president Manjurul Ahsan Khan, professor Mozaffar Ahmed and writer Abul Maksud took their seats at the left side. The invited election commissioners of different countries and their secretaries sat behind them. Menon told bdnews24.com, "I did not sit beside them (Jamaat leaders)." "We would not have attended if we were informed of Jamaat's presence," added CPB chief Khan. He told bdnews24.com, "Nizami and Mojaheed are alleged to be war criminals. If the fifth amendment (of the constitution) is cancelled, its registration also will be cancelled." Maksud said, "I personally do not interact with them. Therefore, I have taken a separate seat." He, however, added that the election commission can invite Jamaat as a registered political party. bd
