 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun has warned that no instigators of campus violence will be exempt from punishment. "News of violence on the campuses hurts us. Occupying seats, extortion and clashes have become regular news. We have to get out of this trend." Sahara was speaking as the chief guest at the freshers' reception programme at Eden Women's University College on Saturday. She said the government does not want to earn any more of a bad reputation. The minister asked students to amend past mistakes and ensure a stable atmosphere in the educational institutes. "The main task of students is to prepare themselves for the future and fulfil the dreams of parents." College principal Prof Mahfuza Begum presided over the programme.
