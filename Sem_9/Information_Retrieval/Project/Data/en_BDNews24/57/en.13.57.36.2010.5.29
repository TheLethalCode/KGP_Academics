 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  A two-day regional climate conference will be held in Dhaka on Sunday at which a joint declaration will be signed. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the programme at Sheraton Hotel at around 10am. Bangladesh government and the European Union have jointly organised the conference, state minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud said at a press conference ahead of the conference on Saturday. The conference is expected to discuss the next steps following the Copenhagen summit and issues that will be dealt with in the climate change meeting to be held in Mexico at the year's end. A joint declaration will be signed between Bangladesh, Cambodia, Maldives and the European Union. The state minister said the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, formed to deal with climate change impact, has been renamed the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund. Bangladesh has been assigned to manage the Tk 120 billion fund. The state minister for forest and environment will be the head of the trustee board and the secretary will head the management committee. Hasan Mahmud said the UK will provide $7 million, the European Union $10 million and Denmark $8.5 million to the fund. Sweden will also provide fund assistance but the amount is not confirmed yet. The donors wanted the World Bank to take the responsibility for the fund but the Bangladesh government did not agree with that, he said. The World Bank will provide technical assistance, Mahmud said. Ministers and high officials of Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Maldives, Nepal and the republic of Yemen are participating in the conference. Apart from that, a delegation from the European Union, Connie Hedegaard, commissioner for climate action of the European Union, will also be present.
