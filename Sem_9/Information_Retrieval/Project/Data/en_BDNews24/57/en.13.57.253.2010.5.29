 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  BUET teachers and students have observed a human chain programme, demanding safe roads. The programme was held at the central Shaheed Minar of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology on Saturday noon. "We do not want to lose any more lives like Khondaker Khan Jahan Samrat in road accidents. Safe roads have to be ensured throughout the country by raising public awareness," said the vice-chancellor, AMM Shafiullah. He also mentioned that legal action would be taken against those responsible for Samrat's death. Teachers and more than a thousand students formed the human chain bearing black badges in a show mourning the unfortunate death of two days ago. Earlier, the students submitted a charter of 9-point demands to the vice-chancellor. No classes were held in BUET on Saturday. The students said that they would carry on the black badge programme till next week. The BUET mosque is expected to have a special prayer for Samrat on Monday afternoon. Another human chain programme is scheduled on Jun 03, in front of the National Press Club. Samrat, a first-year student of BUET, was run over by a bus at the Azimpur bus stand on Thursday. He was on his way to his sister's house. In protest, the students went on a rampage around the BUET area. bd
