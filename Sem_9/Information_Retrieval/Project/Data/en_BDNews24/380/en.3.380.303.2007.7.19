<TITLE> Strauss seeking to punish India for lapse </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's Andrew Strauss neared his 11th test century and first in almost a year as he reached 84 at tea on day one of the first test against India and helped his team to 197 for one at Lord's. England did not lose a single wicket in the afternoon session as Strauss and his captain Michael Vaughan, who is 57 not out, looked untroubled for the most part. Strauss did top-edge a sweep shot against leg-spinner Anil Kumble to go to 78 ten minutes before tea, but the ball landed well short of the fine leg fielder. His more obvious lifeline came five minutes before lunch when he squirted a square drive off the outside edge from a Shanthakumaran Sreesanth delivery to Dinesh Karthik at cover point on 43 but the fielder, converted into an opening batsman from a wicketkeeper, floored the simple chance. The left-handed opener now has his highest test score since making 116 against Pakistan at Headingley last August. He has hit 14 boundaries in his 163-ball stay so far. SWINGING BALL Vaughan failed to score a run in the 25 minutes directly after lunch as he struggled with the swinging ball, especially from left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh, but as time went on he began to gain composure. Vaughan, playing his first Lord's test since 2005, has scored nine fours and reached his half-century from 118 deliveries. The Indian bowlers dragged back the run rate after lunch, as the 50 partnership between Strauss and Vaughan was registered in 121 deliveries, whereas the opening 50 of the innings came up in just 52 balls. Alastair Cook is the only batsman to fall so far after he scored a breezy 36 off 39 balls. His wicket was a vital breakthrough for India as their bowlers began erratically and allowed England a pressure-free start. It took the bowling of occasional medium-pacer Sourav Ganguly to trap Cook lbw, although replays suggested the ball had moved so much down the famous Lord's slope that it would have missed his off stump. India have not won a test series in England for 21 years
