<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Protests to condemn the arrest of Sheikh Hasina raged through parts of the country Tuesday amid heightened security, police and witnesses said. Small-scale explosions and attacks on vehicles were reported while a strike call by the Awami League's student front disrupted studies in many educational institutions across the country. Tuesday's violence, feared to be a puzzled start of a street struggle in a new context under the state of emergency, however, put a limited effect on public life, bdnews24.com correspondents reported. Security forces arrested the former prime minister at her Dhanmondi home, and later a Dhaka court sent her to a special jail awaiting formal police charge in an extortion case. The arrest and a subsequent order to send her to a special jail immediately sparked small-scale but emotional protests in the capital. The protesters also clashed with police in parts of Dhaka, prompting the security officials to fire teargas and rubber bullets. The emergency government said the arrest was made on specific charges but the Awami League said it was part of a deep-rooted conspiracy to isolate the leader from people. Manyespecially adherents of the AL chiefviewed the arrest as a clear move by the army-backed government to remove her from the political scene. In Dhaka's Jagannath University, dozens of activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League Tuesday brought out a procession that briefly marched through the campus before the mob smashed two buses. The presence of students on the campus was thin and classes were disrupted but departmental examinations were held. The security on the campus was heightened after the university proctor Kazi Asad received a death threat from an anonymous caller. Asad told reporters that the caller asked him not to take any examination Tuesday. Later, police held a meeting with the university authorities and built up the security. Separately, three explosions rocked the Dhaka University campus, sparking panic around at 11:32am. The campus authorities or the security officials had no clue who could have charged the small, homemade bombs, one at the concrete wall of the office of vice chancellor SMA Faiz and two others on the road in front of the office. Shahbag police sub inspector Morshed told bdnews24.com that it was meant to create panic. "It's a stray incident. It should not be labeled as a big incident," Faiz told reporters. "Students and teachers want a peaceful environment on the campus." Still, he asked all to stay careful. If the security on the campus will be heightened, Faiz said, "Cautiousness of all is more important than more security. But if we see the situation turns complex, we'll heighten the security." He said the classes and examinations were held Tuesday without any disruption. Kabi Nazrul Government College and Suhrawardi Government College also came to a halt due to the strike. In Hasina's home district Gopalganj, Awami League supporters smashed three buses on Dhaka-Khulna highway while students of many schools boycotted classes in protest of the arrest. Students of Gopalganj Polytechnic Institute also boycotted classes and brought out a procession in town while many local people joined them. In the district's Kashiani upazila, shop owners at Tilchhara, Gopalpur and Aruakind bazaars shut their businesses for one hour to protest the arrest. The district authorities upgraded the security in the district town fearing unrest. The students of Paikkandi, Shuktail and Chandradighalia high schools brought out processions and demanded release of the Awami League chief. In Kushtia, police foiled a procession in Islamic University after the supporters of Bangladesh Chhatra League defied the emergency rules. The strikers took away the keys of the buses at Sylhet Shahjalal Science and Technology University, disrupting transportation of students and teachers. The presence of students in many schools and other educational institutions in the country's second largest city of Chittagong was also thin. In Kishoreganj district, police Tuesday filed a case against local Awami League leaders and activists for holding a rally Monday to protest the arrest. Pakundia police chief Sakhawat Alam told bdnews24.com that the case was filed against up to 50 people under emergency rules. In Dhaka, a Dhaka magistrate sent four women activists of the Awami Jubo Mohila League who were arrested in Monday's clashes in the city's Saheb Bazar to jail. Metropolitan magistrate Abdur Rouf Khan sent them to jail after police produced them before his court. bdnews24.com/
