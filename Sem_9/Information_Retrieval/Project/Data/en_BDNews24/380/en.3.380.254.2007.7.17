 LOS ANGELES, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fog turns the streets of Disneyland spooky after midnight with even the merry music wafting from hidden speakers sounding sinister as the 'Third Shift' arrives to restore order to the Magic Kingdom. Walt Disney referred to Disneyland, the only park he saw during his lifetime, as 'a show' and its workers as 'cast members' who are on always stage when they are in the park. To that end, Disneyland draws the curtain on maintenance, with about 1,000 workers known as custodians clocking in after midnight, well after the last guest has left, to inspect each ride, scrub each sidewalk, attraction, eatery and storefront. "They are somewhat invisible to our day guests ... but this is the best time to do this work," said Disneyland Resort President Ed Grier. In the dark, workers on the so-called Third Shift prettify flower beds, grass and topiaries at the 500-acre resort's two parks and three hotels and entertainment district, planting more than 1 million flowers each year. Every year they collect more than 17.5 million pounds of trash a year and go through 3,000 mops, 1,000 brooms, 500 dust pans, and change at least 100,000 light bulbs. Third Shifters don't really want guests to see them because peeking beneath the Sorcerer's robe would be 'bad show.' "Our job is to set the stage for the guests," said one custodian, Lori Kimbrell. 'GRAVEYARD' AT DISNEYLAND The first week that horticulturist Chris Smith, 19, punched in at midnight, tasked with keeping Frontierland looking groomed yet untouched by human hands was 'really tough.' "When you're up at 2 (am) you're still a little tired. The food schedule changes a lot. You gain weight or lose weight," he said. Ten months later, he loves his upside-down day, including the race to perfect his territory before daylight. "You go home and you have the rest of the day. Sometimes you sleep, other times you go to the beach or a movie -- as long as you get to bed by 6 (pm)," said Smith Actors Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush -- their animatronic doppelgangers anyway -- look on in frozen wonder as machinists Dave Werelius and Rick Moody wade down the mile-long flume at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, inspecting parts for wear. Their chest-high rubber waders keep them mostly dry and insulated from the 65-degree Fahrenheit water, but cannon fire from the shipwrecked Black Pearl is always a hazard, Moody, formerly a retired aerospace mechanic, said. "If the animation is on, the cannon is on," Moody said. "You get wet," added Werelius, a 20-year Disney veteran who traded his day shift to have more time with his two children. Rumors of ghosts in the spooky, chlorine-scented cave abound, spawned by nightly tests of animatronic figures. "If you're walking around alone and it's dark ... you have all the figures moving and there's no lighting and no sound," said attractions maintenance manager Dave Hulke. "It's a little bit odd sometimes." Gum, soda, cotton candy. Cleaning up after an estimated 20 million people a year requires 450 custodians to scrub down everything guests touch -- even steam cleaning the sidewalks. It's a timed performance with some members preparing and positioning carts of cleaning supplies while others climb aboard rides to remove trash and rub out fingerprints. When the rides are shining, by 3 am if the team is on schedule, they break for lunch then turn to back offices, restrooms and break areas. The cardinal rule: everything must be dry by opening time. "The work is meticulous, but it's not that hard," said Gibson, who spent 29 of his 38 years at Disneyland on the night shift. "Waking up to get here is half the battl
