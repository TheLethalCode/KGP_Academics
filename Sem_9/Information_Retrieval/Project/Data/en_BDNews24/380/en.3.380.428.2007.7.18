 MUMBAI Wed Jul 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Muslim men were sentenced to death by an Indian anti-terrorism court on Wednesday for their involvement in the country's worst bombings, the first cases of capital punishment in one of the world's longest trials. The three -- Pervez Nasir Sheikh, Abdul Gani Ismail Turq and Mushtaq Tarani -- were convicted of planting several bombs, part of the 13 explosions that killed 257 people in 1993 in India's financial hub of Mumbai. Turq planted a high explosives bomb in a vehicle in a crowded market in the heart of the city. The blast killed 113 people, making the attack the deadliest of the 13 blasts. Police say the bombings of Mumbai landmarks, including the main stock exchange, were ordered by India's most-wanted man, Muslim gangster Dawood Ibrahim, to avenge the demolition of the historic Babri mosque by Hindu hardliners in 1992. Sheikh planted two bombs -- including high explosives in a scooter in a market -- and a second bomb in a hotel. Four people were killed when the bomb in the scooter exploded. "His excuse that the acts were revenge for the Babri masjid is not convincing," judge P.D. Kode told a crowded and heavily guarded courtroom. "This act was a disgrace to the Muslim religion." The three convicts listened to their punishment with their heads down. Sheikh was seen holding prayer beads and praying softly. He stopped once the sentences were announced. Turq tried to speak to some of the reporters, but was not allowed by police. The three, wearing white flowing shirts and skull caps, were led away by police. Out of the 100 people convicted in the nearly 14-year trial, 81 people have been punished so far with varying jail terms and fines for planning and abetting the attacks or for illegal possession of arms. Those sentenced so far include smugglers, petty criminals and a Bollywood producer, as well as policemen and customs officials who took bribes to let the explosives through. An 83-year-old man is among those jailed for life for planning the blasts. Wednesday's death sentences still have to be rat
