 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Stray protests to demand the release of Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina continued for a third day amid a clear vow that the struggling party will fight a legal battle in court. The latest protests included shutdown of schools and shops, brief processions and condemnation despite a call by the party to stay calm and not to be misled in the wake of an uncertain future. Hasina, who was arrested Monday at her Dhanmondi home, passed her third day in solitary confines in a special jail inside the national parliament building complex. The government said the arrest was made on specific charges but Hasina adherents called it "politically motivated and shameful". The party's acting president Zillur Rahman Tuesday asked the party supporters not to resort to any violent means to protest the arrest. In Patuakhali town, Juba League activists and leaders brought out a procession Wednesday to demand the leader's freedom. The protesters marched through the streets of the small town while they chanted anti-government slogans, ignoring emergency rules that banned all political activity. They immediately scattered after the mob reached the court area after hearing that police were rushing toward the scene. Sub-inspector Sushen of Sadar Police Station told bdnews24.com that a contingent of security men rushed to the scene only to find that the protesters had left. In Hasina's home district of Gopalganj, the students of Manikhar High School boycotted classes and brought out a procession in the district town. In a market of the district's Kashiani upazila, shop owners shut businesses to demand an unconditional release of Hasina. Meanwhile, many other schools in the district's Kotalipara, Kashiani, Tungipara and Sadar upzilas stopped taking classes and exams to condemn the arrest. In Dhaka, scores of Hasina's relatives waited for hours near the temporary jail to see Hasina, but authorities did not let them in. They waited outside the security ring of the special jail from 1:45pm. Some of them carried dry food and clothes that the jail authorities reached to Hasina, a senior jail official said. Major Shamsul Haider Chowdhury, deputy inspector general (prisons), told bdnews24.com that they could not allow the relatives in for security reasons. "It's not possible to allow any of her relatives in without taking necessary security measures," Siddiqui said. Tapas, son of Hasina's cousin late Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, said he came to see Hasina to talk about the wealth statement. The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday asked Hasina to submit her statement to the watchdog in seven days from notification. Tapas, a barrister, said the case against his aunt was fabricated and false. Separately, Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury said that they were consulting with lawyers to challenge the case in court. Motia made the comment after she met Zillur Rahman at his Gulshan home. "We'll seek bail. All detailed aspects of the legal battle are being examined," she told reporters. Replying to a query, Motia said they would bring reforms to the party once the ban on indoor politics is gone. Zillur met the party leaders at his home Wednesday to privately discuss the next course of their political strategies. bdnews24
