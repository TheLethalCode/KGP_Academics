<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's envoy to Britain said on Wednesday that Moscow may respond in the next 48 hours to the expulsion by London of four Russian diplomats in a row over the extradition of a murder suspect. Moscow's ambassador to London, Yury Viktorovich Fedotov, said retaliation could come "today or tomorrow" and insisted it would be "adequate" and would not affect ordinary Britons such as students, businessmen or journalists. "I don't think we have long to wait. It may take place today or tomorrow," he told BBC radio. Britain said on Monday it was throwing out four Russian diplomats in retaliation for Moscow's refusal to extradite the man suspected of murdering former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a British citizen, with a radioactive poison. Moscow insists the country's constitution prevents the extradition of Russian citizens and has offered to try the suspect, Andrei Lugovoy. Britain has rejected that offer, saying it fears the trial would not be fair. Fedotov said London was trying to "punish Russia just because Russia wants to observe its own constitutional law." "For British people it is hard to understand because here you don't have a written constitution," he said. He also said London's decision to review cooperation with Russian security services on counter-terrorism would harm Britain as much as anyone else. "We are interested in maintaining the channels of communication with everybody, including with the British government -- and especially here in London because London is unfortunately a refuge for many suspicious persons."
