<TEXT>
 Chittagong, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The authorities of Chittagong Mother and Child General Hospital sacked 50 medical officers on strike Thursday after they failed to rejoin work by 2:30pm deadline, an official said. Anjuman Ara, the hospital management committee general secretary, said the authorities would begin a process of filling vacancies in a week. To deal with the temporary crisis, they would hire some doctors on an ad hoc basis in a day or two, she said. The strikers vowed not to bow down to any pressure by the authorities. Dr Parijat Palit, a striker, said none of the strikers joined office and they would stick to their stance. He claimed none of the doctors on strike had received the notice served by the authorities that asked them to rejoin the work within 24 hours. Parijat complained that gatekeepers did not let them in, when they wanted to enter the hospital compound Thursday morning. He quoted guards as saying that they were not meant to allow anybody in, except those who would return to work in line with the management's order. "We'll quit together, if necessary. No-one will have to move to sack us. Our movement will continue until our demands are met," Parijat said. As the strike entered its third day, patients' sufferings mounted in hospital in the city's Agrabad area. No new patients were admitted Thursday. The hospital's management committee chairperson, Fazlul Karim, said about 150 patients received treatment at the hospital until Thursday noon. Karim had earlier warned that they would take tougher action against the doctors if they failed to rejoin work by 2:30pm. He described the striking doctors' demands as 'irrational'. The 'medical officers' in the hospital went on strike Tuesday to demand an annulment of the earlier dismissal of 50 doctors by the management. bdnews24.com
