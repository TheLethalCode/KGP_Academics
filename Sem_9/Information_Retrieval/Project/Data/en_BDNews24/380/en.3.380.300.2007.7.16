 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  "I did no wrong, neither did my family," Sheikh Hasina told bdnews24.com early Monday as security forces moved apparently to arrest the Awami League president in her Sudha Sadan home. As Hasina was speaking to bdnews24.com, there was a sound of knocking on the door and somebody was heard saying "They've come and want to get in." Hasina told him: "Tell them I'm coming after saying prayer." RAB and police forces sealed off all the enrty points to the Dhanmondi while the policewomen went in. Some 50 vehicles including a prison van and an ambulance waited outside the home on in the wee hours amid driving rain. "The country witnessed good governance in the five years of AL rule. Price of essentials was under control," the former prime minister told bdnews24.com Senior Political Correspondent Suman Mahbub at 4:53am. Hasina said she ruled the country with honesty. "I can personally say that no-one of my family members nor I was involved in extortion. In the last five years, the BNP-led government looked for our mistakes, but couldn't find any." "Why should we be harassed? This government is the outcome of our movement. Why would the rights of the people be revoked?" bdnews24.
