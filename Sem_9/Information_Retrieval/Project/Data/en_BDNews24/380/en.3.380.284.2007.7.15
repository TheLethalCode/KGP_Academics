<TITLE> Plan to hike utility charge essential, not suicidal: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday defended a government plan to hike the prices of utilities. "I don't think the move to raise the prices of power, gas, fuel oils and fertiliser is a suicidal one, rather it is essential for the economy." Azizul talked with reporters at his finance ministry office following the Centre for Policy Dialogue's comments on the plan. CPD executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya remarked on the proposed price hike in utilities and International Monetary Fund (IMF) links to the government and their monetary policy Saturday. "How will we finance the budget deficit if the price of utilities are not adjusted," Azizul said. The government, however, has yet to decide when and by how much the prices of utilities are to rise. The adviser denied that the government had succumbed to IMF pressure regarding their economic policy decisions. Suggestions of such an influence have been made regarding the latest monetary policy, announced by the Bangladesh Bank Thursday. He also accused the CPD of making their comments without any proper analysis. The finance adviser added that the government had not yet taken any final decisions on the issue of utility price hikes. However he defended the necessity of some price adjustment saying the cost of fertiliser and oil had increased significantly in the international market. "How will the government reduce the financing deficit between the import and export price of these items?" "Either we have to cut the subsidies or the salaries of employees to fund the deficit," he said. According to Azizul, Bangladesh still needs external financing to make up their domestic deficit financing. "I have not met any IMF officials for the last two months. There are, of course, areas and attitudes that we have in common with the IMF, like losses in state-owned enterprises," Azizul said. "This does not mean that the government has succumbed to the IMF. The CPD's comment is totally baseless." The adviser said the BB has been following a contractionary monetary policy for the last few years in order to contain inflation. He cited India as another country to adopt the same policy recently. "Whether the policy is bad or good depends on how it is implemented," Azizul added. The adviser believes that bank interest rates will not rise, as there is a huge surplus of liquidity in the banks currently. The adviser also said that there is no direct link between the budget and the monetary policy. The government determined the deficit financing for the budget in consultation with the central bank. bd
