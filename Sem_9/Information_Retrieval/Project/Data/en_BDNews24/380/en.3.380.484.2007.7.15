 KHARTOUM, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan said on Sunday it had reservations about the mandate given to a 26,000-strong UN-African Union Darfur force under a draft UN Security Council resolution. After months of talks, threats and negotiations, Khartoum finally agreed to the force to bolster 7,000 struggling AU troops and police who have failed to stem the violence which international experts estimate has killed 200,000.
