 LOS ANGELES, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Despite its critical drubbing, Victoria Beckham's NBC special pulled in OK numbers Monday night. 'Victoria Beckham: Coming to America,' which originally was supposed to be a six-episode series but was whittled down to a one-hour special, averaged 5.1 million total viewers and a 2.2 rating/7 share in the adults 18-49 demo, according to data released Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research. That was good enough to give the special the demographic win in its 8 pm slot. A repeat of ABC's 'Wife Swap' (5.3 million, 2.0/7) took the hour in total viewers. At 9 pm, a new episode of Fox's 'Hell's Kitchen' (8.3 million, 4.1/12) posted its second-highest demo and viewers numbers so far this season. The show easily won the hour -- and the night -- in both metrics. A new episode of NBC's 'Age of Love' (4.5 million, 1.8/5) posted its lowest demo rating in its five weeks on the air, though it did grow in its second half-hour. ABC aired a special episode of 'Extreme Makeover: Home Edition' (5 million, 1.9/5), while CBS' 9-10 pm comedies 'Two and a Half Men' (8.1 million, 2.5/7) and 'How I Met Your Mother' (6.3 million, 2.1/6) were in repeats. At 10 pm, a repeat of CBS' 'CSI: Miami' (8.1 million, 2.5/7) won the hour in total viewers, while NBC's 'Dateline' (7.4 million, 2.6/7) took the demo. ABC was third with a repeat of 'Supernanny' (4.5 million, 1.8/5). Overall, CBS and Fox split the night, with CBS (6.7 million, 2.1/6) leading in total viewers and Fox (6.1 million, 3.0/9) taking the demo. Other nightly averages: NBC (5.7 million, 2.2/7), ABC (5 million, 1.9/6) and the CW (1.6 million, 0.6/
