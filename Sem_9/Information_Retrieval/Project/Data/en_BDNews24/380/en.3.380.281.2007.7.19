 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Thursday approved a proposal to buy 3,500 tonnes of paper to print books for free distribution among the students of government primary schools, an adviser said. The cabinet committee on purchase made the approval in a meeting at the Cabinet Division, finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam said. "The paper will be bought with the fund from the World Bank," Islam said. He said the proposal for purchasing 50,000 tonnes of phosphoric acid as raw materials for Diammonium Phosphate fertiliser also got the green light. It will take two instalments to procure the materials. The adviser said the finance ministry had placed a proposal to buy 200 million pieces of metal coins of Tk 2, but the committee turned it down as the prices of metal increased on the international market. He said a review showed that if Tk 2 metal coins were bought now, the prices would be higher. The proposal will be considered if the metal prices fall, Islam said. bdnews24.com/
