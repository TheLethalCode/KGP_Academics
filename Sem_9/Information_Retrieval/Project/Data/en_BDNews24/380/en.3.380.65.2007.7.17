<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) Enayetur Rahim, former general secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Tuesday accused the law adviser of giving "politically motivated and confusing" statement over the arrest of Sheikh Hasina. "Mainul Hosein has said that Sheikh Hasina's case was brought under the emergency power rules. But as per article 35 of the Constitution, it has to be tried under the law existing during the alleged crime was committed," Rahim told reporters. His comment came after an informal meeting of pro-Awami League lawyers at the bar association to devise a legal strategy for the former prime minister. "The crime alleged in the case is eight years old. If this case is brought under the emergency power rules it will be a violation of the constitution and the emergency power rules," he said. On Mainul's comment that Hasina was arrested in order that charges would be pressed, Rahim said: "It is the investigation officer of a case who can say whether a charge sheet will be pressed or not. Because of this comment a question arises as to whether this case is being specially supervised by higher powers." Rahim separately told bdnews24.com that the one-hour meeting of the lawyers discussed how legal assistance could be provided to the Awami League chief. "An appeal will be placed before the judge's court for her bail. If the appeal is not granted we will go to the High Court," he said. "Sheikh Hasina is a former prime minister and Awami League president. She would not have fled if she was given bail. What does denying her bail indicate?" The extortion case is being investigated under emergency power rules for its quick disposal, say authorities, which does not allow provision for the accused to seek bail. The law adviser said Monday that Hasina had been arrested in order to press charges in an extortion case. Other accused in the case have already been arrested. Mainul had said: "If a charge sheet is to be pressed under emergency power rules (without arrest) Sheikh Hasina would have to be shown as absconding which is not the case." "Besides, in the primary investigation of the case the allegation against Hasina has been proved," the law adviser claimed. Former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association advocate Mahbubey Alam, former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru, former lawmaker Rahmat Ali, Subrata Chowdhury, Momtazuddin Mehedi and Rabiul Alam Budu also attended the meeting. bdnews24.com
