 KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States expects to complete free-trade talks with Malaysia by end-June 2008, a US trade official said on Monday. Discussions between the two countries were progressing very well, Washington's lead trade negotiator for Southeast Asia, Barbara Weisel, told reporters in the Malaysian capital. "Both sides were satisfied with the progress. Both sides are enthusiastic about trying to move the process forward and bringing to conclusion as quickly as we can," she said. "We are making good progress in many areas." Washington and Kuala Lumpur agreed in April on a plan for continuing free-trade talks after missing a March deadline to finish the pact. They have not set a date for the next round of talks. The United States launched trade talks with its tenth largest trading partner more than a year ago.

That legislation allows the White House to negotiate trade deals that Congress must approve or reject without making changes. A senior Democratic lawmaker had said he believed Congress would approve a limited extension of trade promotion authority for Congress to conclude the Doha round of world trade talks. The Bush administration would like a broader extension to cover Malaysia and other trade pacts. US trade negotiators could still conclude a trade deal with Malaysia without trade promotion authority, but there is no guarantee Congress would approve the pact unchang
