<TITLE> Lohan out of rehab </TITLE>

 LOS ANGELES, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lindsay Lohan has left a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility wearing an alcohol monitoring bracelet after completing a 45-day program, People magazine reported. The actress, who celebrated her 21st birthday in the rehab facility in the posh seaside community of Malibu, is now attending an outpatient program that includes Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, counseling and daily testing, Lohan's publicist Leslie Sloane said in a statement on the magazine's Web site on Sunday. "In part, she is wearing the bracelet so there are no questions about her sobriety if she chooses to go dancing or dining in a place where alcohol is served," Sloane said. "She's doing great. Lindsay is working hard on her sobriety and we are all supporting her," she added. Sloane told People that wearing the ankle bracelet was a 'voluntary' decision by Lohan. The spokeswoman was not immediately available for further comment. Lohan checked into the Promises Residential Treatment Center in Malibu in late May after crashing her Mercedes-Benz convertible and being arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence over the US Memorial Day holiday. Her stay at Promises was the actress's second stay in rehab this year. In January, she checked herself into the exclusive Wonderland Center in Los Angeles. Lohan shot to stardom in Disney films such as 'The Parent Trap' and 'Freaky Friday,' and she has moved on to more adult roles including playing the victim of a brutal kidnapper in the upcoming movie, 'I Know Who Killed Me.' But her hard-partying ways have often overshadowed the young star's talent. Last summer, the producer of her movie, 'Georgia Rule,' publicly took her to task for staying out late and not appearing at the movie's set on time. Late last year, the tabloid New York Post ran a picture of Lohan and friends Paris Hilton and Britney Spears out partying at night under the headline 'Bimbo Summit.
