<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Porsche will begin shipping its fastest-ever 911 sports coupe, the revamped GT2, to dealerships in November with a price tag of 159,000 euros ($219,300) excluding tax, the carmaker said on Monday. The sports coupe can sprint from 0-100 km per hour in 3.7 seconds and its 530 horsepower allows the car to reach a top speed of 329 kph (204 miles per hour) -- faster than the base 911 Turbo or the normally aspirated GT3. Equipped with weight-saving titanium tailpipes and carbon-ceramic brake disks as well as a more efficient intake manifold, Porsche said the rear-engined GT2 consumes on average 12.5 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers. Brushing up on its green credentials amid criticism its powerful sports cars are heavy polluters, Porsche said the new GT2 "offers a level of fuel economy regarded as quite impossible in this performance class just a few years ago". "With the new GT2, the (current generation) 911 model line is now complete," a spokesman said, referring to the present incarnation of the long-running 911 series, dubbed the 997. The 911 GT2 is equipped with a six cylinder, 3.6 liter petrol Boxer engine based on the one used in the 911 Turbo, aspirated with two turbochargers employing its variable turbine geometry that can operate at exhaust temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsi
