 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil Sunday said he had sent the letter for retirement from politics to the chief adviser on his own, not under pressure. In a rare move, jail authorities allowed Jalil to talk to a group of reporters at 11:07pm for some time in his Labaid Cardiac Hospital cabin where he was taken from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. Private TV station Channel 1 showed a frail Jalil, surrounded by a horde of reporters in his cabin. "I want to live," he said answering a question from a reporter. Facing a barrage of questions from the press on the retirement letter, he said: "I said I wrote the letter myself. That's all. If you keep asking questions I won't talk anymore." In the signed, typed letter, released on July 5, Jalil said: "I have decided to retire from politics because of my physical condition and looking at the faces of my children and family." The letter had created disbelief among the inner circles of the Awami League, including party chief Sheikh Hasina. Jalil had been critical of Hasina's "single leadership" in running the party. On reforms to the Awami League and other parties, Jalil said Sunday: "I want reform. The matter of political reform was part of the 31-point proposal by the 14-party alliance." The AL leader had earlier not said anything about his so-called letter that detailed his plan to retire from politics. An ailing Jalil did not specify anything when he responded to a bdnews24.com query at 8.20pm on what he thought about the comments of his party chief that he had made the retirement statement under pressure from an intelligence agency. "I won't say anything," Jalil said in a quick reply when his attention was brought to the issue. "I'm very sick. Please pray for me," the close aide to Hasina added quickly. On appeal from his family Jalil was brought to Labaid for better treatment. "It's for human reason," deputy inspector general (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters. He was wearing a white punjabi and a pajama when he was brought to LabAid. Jalil was arrested on May 28 at his Mercantile Bank in Motijheel. bdnews24.com
