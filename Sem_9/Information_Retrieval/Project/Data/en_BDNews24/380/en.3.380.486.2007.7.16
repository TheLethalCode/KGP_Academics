 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) - The arrest of Awami League President Sheikh Hasina a day after the Election Commission's announcing the election roadmap would raise questions about government motives, leaders of left parties said Monday. "Her arrest will raise questions. It will make the situation more complex. We expect that the caretaker government will explain the reasons for her arrest," Rashed Khan Menon, president of Workers Party of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com. Menon along with leaders of other two main left parties made the remarks after security forces led Hasina away from her residence early Monday. Menon said that the way she was arrested was 'regretful' and 'shameful'. "It's unfortunate. The caretaker government had earlier said that no one would be arrested even if there were cases. She is a former prime minister of the country. The court could have summoned her." "Law should follow its course. The legal procedures must be transparent if she is arrested on charges of corruption. All the information must be made known to the nation," said Mujahidul Islam Selim, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh. Selim also said that it would be undemocratic if she was arrested to materialise politically motivated goals. "It will put into question all the government's anticorruption drives," he said. Hasanul Haque Inu, president of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, said that Sheikh Hasina is a former prime minister and was not running away. "It's a sad. Arrest of Hasina was not needed.. trail could be continued without arresting her," Inu said. bdnew
