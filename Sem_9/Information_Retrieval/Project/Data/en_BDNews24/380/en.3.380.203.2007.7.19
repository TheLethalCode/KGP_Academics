 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The government will amend women's development policy to ensure equal rights and work opportunities for women, an adviser said Thursday. Women and children affairs adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury told bdnews24.com by telephone: "We are reviewing the policies introduced in 1997 and 2004 for modification." Officials with the women and children affairs ministry said the Awami League government introduced the national women's development policy in 1997, but the coalition government amended it and made a new policy in 2004. Recently leaders of rights organisations had discussed with the adviser and proposed that the 1997 policy should be restored, replacing 2004 policy. After the meeting, the adviser said the policy would be modified. The 1997 policy speaks of ensuring women's equal rights by promulgating economic policies (trade, currency and tax) as well as their application, while the 2004 policy speaks of economic policies (trade, currency, tax) to ensure women's constitutional rights. The 1997 policy says women must be provided with equal scope and partnership in wealth, employment, market and trade, but the 2004 policy highlights only employment, market and trade. In the 1997 policy, there is a subsection that says in places where many women are working, they should be provided with transportation, accommodation, restrooms, bathrooms and daycare centres and other special arrangements. But transportation, restrooms, separate bathrooms and daycare centres are necessary arrangements for women in the 2004 amended law. Accommodation is omitted from the law. bdnews
