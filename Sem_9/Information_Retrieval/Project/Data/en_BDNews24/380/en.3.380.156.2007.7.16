<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina Monday told court her arrest was a mere political harassment and that her conviction in an extortion case might have been decided beforehand to shut her out of elections. "I have been arrested to kill democracy. I might be punished in this false, fabricated case so that I cannot participate in elections," she told the Chief Metroplitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. She pleaded innocent as she spoke before the court from 9:30am to 10:17am during a more than two-hour long hearing. "I don't know what verdict you will give. Maybe the verdict has been fixed beforehand. Where there is no democracy, no right to speech there cannot be rule of law." "There is a difference between party subscription and extortion. A false case has been filed to deprive the people of this country of their rights. I am innocent. I want justice in this false case filed to harass me politically." The court ordered her to be sent to jail for an unspecified period rejecting a bail appeal. "The extortion case has been filed to harass me politically. I might be given punishment in this case so that I cannot run for elections. But none of the country will believe that I did extortion," the former prime minister said. Hasina said, "If elections were held the Awami League would win getting 80 percent of votes," She told the court of magistrate Kamrunnahar when security forces went to arrest her overnight, she had asked them to show arrest warrant but they did not have one. "Democracy is now threatened. People do not have the right to vote. People are unable to meet their family expenses. They do not have earnings, unemployment is on the rise. "I think attempts are now being made to destroy political forces one after another and bring some other force to power. "Games are being played with the fate of the people of this country. But the people of this country always make the right decision, they never make a mistake," the AL chief said. "A false extortion case has been filed against me, because I speak of establishing people's rights and waged movements for their economic emancipation." "I spoke demanding fertiliser a few days back but in this case it has been said that I talked of extortion. "I have lived all my life with honesty. My daughter-in-law was sick, my daughter gave birth to a baby, but I was not allowed to go to the US to see them." She said the common people benefited only twiceonce after independence and again when the Awami League was in power in 1996-2000. "During the Awami League rule from 1996 to 2000 some 80 lakh metric tons of surplus food was produced. We successfully faced the serious flood. "After my leaving office five years and 6/7 months elapsed but now corruption cases were filed. No-one in this country can say that I engaged in extortion." On the allegation of smuggling arms abroad against her, Hasina said, "The alliance government engaged detectives abroad but did not find any evidence." Addressing the court, she said, "Cases will be filed one after another against me. I know you (magistrate) will not be able to give any orders beyond those from the higher authorities." "I have been involved in politics since student days. I was a VP (vice-president) of Badrunnessa College. I have always spoken for the people." "In Chittagong Hill Tracts a lot of people used to die in clashes between army, police, BDR, hills people and Bangalees. I have signed a peace agreement to solve the problem," she told the court. "Ten universities from around the world have conferred on me doctorate degrees and other awards. Those are not mine, rather those are the prestige of the country. Had I committed corruption they would not have given me awards and doctorate degrees." Hasina went on: "When the Awami League was in power we modernised the army, BDR, police and worked for independence of the judiciary. We gave the High court financial independence. "The first women judge was appointed to the High Court during my tenure. We implemented the constitutional provision of the appointment and transfer of judges as per the recommendations of the Supreme Court." bdnews24
