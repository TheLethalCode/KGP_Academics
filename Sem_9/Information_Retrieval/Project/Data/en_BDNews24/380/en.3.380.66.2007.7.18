 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)--The government should invest more in the railways for a sustainable transportation system and to address vehicular pollution in the coming days, speakers told a roundtable Wednesday. The speakers urged the authorities to curb corruption in the railways while criticising the railway reforms prescribed by the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. "The government will have to develop railways for a sustainable transportation system," Jobayer Bin Alam, a teacher of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, told the roundtable. He said that fuel cost per barrel could be around $100 by 2015 and the soaring prices of fuel would increase the road transport costs manifold, putting a huge burden on ordinary people. "Therefore, railway is the only viable option for the common people." The roundtable on the role of railways for an environment-friendly, safe and economic transportation system at the Jatiya Press Club was jointly organised by Save the Environment Movement, Unnayan Dhara and the WBB Trust. "There would be no pressure on Dhaka's road transports if commuter trains were introduced in and around the city," said Moazzem Hossain, a professor of economics at Rajshahi University. Keynote presenter Nazmul Karim in his paper said passengers needed to reach Narayanganj from Dhaka in one and a half hours by spending a minimum of Tk 16. But they could travel between the two stations in 45 minutes spending only Tk 5. Another speaker, Shamsuddoha, said road transports cause 30 times higher pollution than trains. "The losses incurred by the railway are the result of inefficient management and corruption. The railway department has purchased spare parts and equipment of outdated trains which would never be used in future," Dewan Mohammad Ali, a retired staff member of Bangladesh Railway and trade union leader, told the roundtable. bdn
