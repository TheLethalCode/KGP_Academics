 NEW YORK, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. said on Tuesday that its board was prepared to recommend shareholders accept a $5 billion buyout offer from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. , leaving the fate of the company in the hands of its controlling family. Under the terms of the agreement, News Corp. would buy all outstanding shares of Dow Jones's common and Class B stock for $60 per share in cash, Dow Jones said in a statement. Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal, the Barron's investor newspaper, the MarketWatch.com financial news Web site, and owns Dow Jones Newswires. The decision came after the Dow Jones board met for several hours on Tuesday evening to consider the offer. The board did not reach a unanimous decision, but a "strong majority" voted to recommend approving the deal, said one source familiar with the matter. The deal would allow a limited number of Dow Jones stockholders the choice of receiving shares in a News Corp. subsidiary that would hold Dow Jones. The shares would be exchangeable for shares of News Corp.'s Class A common stock. Bancroft family members, who control 64 percent of Dow Jones's voting shares, are evaluating the offer, Dow Jones said. Two of the Dow Jones board's 16 directors abstained from the vote, according to The Wall Street Journal. Board members Leslie Hill and Dieter von Holtzbrinck chose not to vote, while Christopher Bancroft left the meeting early, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources. Hill and Bancroft are members of the extended Bancroft family. Von Holtzbrinck is chairman of the supervisory board of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH. Board member Christopher Bancroft, who has been seeking to buy up Dow Jones Class B "super-voting" shares in a bid to block Murdoch's offer, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. News Corp. and Dow Jones officials declined to say how board members voted. Internet entrepreneur Brad Greenspan, who offered to buy a 25 percent stake in Dow Jones at $60 per share, said on Tuesday before Dow Jones released its statement that he remained "engaged in the process." He was not immediately reachable for further comment. Reuters Group Plc competes with some Dow Jones news operations, including Dow Jones Newswires, in providing financial news.
