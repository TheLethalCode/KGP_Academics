<TITLE> Assistance for small and medium entrepreneurs 'rhetoric' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) - Small and medium enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs are getting no meaningful support from the authorities. This is despite apparently encouraging official 'rhetoric' on access to bank credit and flexible interest rates. Some government ministers and Bangladesh Bank officials say that SME entrepreneurs have been facing a lack of access to bank credit as well as crippling interest rates for years. Contrary to this the official government line maintains that banks are directed to give credit on favourable terms to SME entrepreneurs. However no tangible progress has been made according to entrepreneurs who have dubbed the governments' efforts, 'mere rhetoric'. Nilufar Siddika, owner of an export-oriented dyeing and washing plant, said: "I am desperately seeking a loan to buy a pick-up truck so that I can expand my business. However, the banks seem to have no interest in giving me a loan." Nilufar was among those who attended the launching ceremony of the SME Foundation at Sonargaon Hotel Tuesday. "I would say around 80 percent of the banks have no interest in giving loans to SME entrepreneurs, particularly women. Interest rates are far too high, at 15 or 16 percent," she said. Shanaj Alam, who operates three factories that supply her own fashion house, said: "Only Brac Bank offers a 13 percent interest rate although they demand their first repayment after only one month." "I started my business with only Tk 5,000, now I have a Tk 15 to 16 lakh turnover a month. I desperately need money to achieve my dreams of becoming a successful entrepreneur. A lack of funding is a real barrier to me." This failure to deliver meaningful financial assistance to the country's SME entrepreneurs has persisted through successive governments up to the present reformist caretaker administration. SME entrepreneurs are still not seeing collateral-free loans or low interest rate credit. "I've been listening to the same old story for the last 12 years," said another entrepreneur to a senior industry ministry official at the SME Foundation launching ceremony. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, the programme's chief guest, admitted a lack of credit facilities for SME entrepreneurs. "The SME sector is labour-intensive but less capital intensive. Growth in the SME sector is needed to stimulate the overall economy." "Women face the most problems getting bank credit because they usually can't provide any security." "Banks should provide collateral-free credit to quality SME projects." "The BB has provided guidelines for the status of SME's, enterprises worth Tk 10 to Tk 50 lakh fall in to the category," the governor said. Mohammad Ayub Miah, additional secretary and managing director of the newly formed SME Foundation told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "I am trying to bring 10 percent of the money allocated to the endowment fund and BB's entrepreneurs' equity fund to the SME Foundation." "This will help women especially get financial assistance more easily." The finance adviser requested the central bank's governor, Salehuddin Ahmed, to look into increasing assistance to small and medium sized entrepreneurs. bd
