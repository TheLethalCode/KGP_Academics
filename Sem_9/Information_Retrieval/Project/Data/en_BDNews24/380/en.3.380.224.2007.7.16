 LONDON, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 index of Britain's leading shares edged higher in choppy trade on Monday after late profit-taking in the US on Friday restricted higher gains, as the takeover battle for ABN AMRO heated up. Royal Bank of Scotland added 0.5 percent after the consortium it is leading boosted the cash element of its 71.1 billion euro ($97.9 billion) bid for Dutch bank ABN. The bid is above a rival offer from Britain's Barclays. The consortium kept its offer for ABN at 38.4 euros per share, but raised the cash component to 93 percent from about 79 percent before. It said the remaining 5 billion euros of the offer will comprise new RBS shares. Barclays tacked on 2 percent. At 0746 GMT the index up 10.9 points or 0.2 percent, at 6,727.6. In other global markets, Asian shares mostly eased, although Japanese financial markets were closed for a public holiday. With little on the economic diary this session, traders said UK CPI data on Tuesday followed by the Bank of England's meeting minutes on Wednesday will be closely watched. Economists expect consumer price inflation to have eased for a third month running in June due to further falls in utility bills. "I would describe my stance to the market as extremely vigilant," said David Buik of Cantor Index. "We've come a long way. There is still huge concern about the banking sector and to whether we're white-washing this sub-prime market problem - not so much over here but in the U.S." Oil stocks were mixed, as London Brent crude climbed to about $78 a barrel - edging closer to its all-time high after a rush of speculative investment on signs of increasingly tight North Sea crude markets. BP was down 0.2 percent, while rival Royal Dutch Shell gained 0.8 percent. Miners were also mixed after consolidation talk and broker downgrades hit shares. BHP Billiton lost 1.4 percent on continued speculation that it may bid for Alcoa after the latter withdrew its offer for Alcan last week. The Financial Times said BHP had asked Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan to weigh up the merits of it making a bid for Alcoa. Rio Tinto lost 1 percent after Citigroup downgraded the company to "hold" from "buy". But Lonmin, the world's third-biggest platinum producer, topped the FTSE 100 losers to shed 8.3 percent after it said its full-year production of platinum concentrate would be between 920,000 and 940,000 saleable ounces and it was experiencing poor recoveries at its concentrators. Also on the downside, Wolseley, the world's largest distributor of plumbing and heating products and building materials, fell 2.6 percent after it said group profit before tax and exceptional items fell about 5 percent for the 11 months to end-June. The firm also warned that the tough U.S. housing market showed no signs of recovery. "Lonmin is obviously a disappointing trading statement - when you've made the kind of progress they've made in the last year, you will find the treatment when you are short of the market as visceral," said Cantor's Buik. "Wolseley is all about the U.S. housing market - they've been acquisitive, their income is up but its not up proportionally to what it should be." Land Securities, Britain's largest real estate trust, tacked on 1.6 percent after it said it had seen an extremely high levels of activity across the group, boosted by a buoyant London office rental market. Vodafone added 1.2 percent after Efficient Capital Structures, the activist investor seeking restructuring at the mobile phone giant, was backed by U.S. corporate governance group Glass Lewis, the Independent reported. GlaxoSmithKline tacked on 2.1 percent to top the FTSE 100 leaderboard after JP Morgan increased its rating to "neutral" from "underweight" and upped its price target to 1,1350 pence from 1,225 pence. BT Group added 2 percent after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to "buy" from "sell", market sources said. In retailers, Tesco gained 0.5 percent after fourteen of its supermarkets across Britain returned to normal trading on Sunday after they were closed by police on Saturday following a series of threats. Among midcaps, Sports Direct lost 2.8 percent after the Independent reported that the company may have to warn investors that trading has been difficult during the first half and profits are expected to fall below market expectations for next ye
