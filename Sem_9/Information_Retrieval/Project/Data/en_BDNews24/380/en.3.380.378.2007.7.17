 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Another VIP detainee will be housed in the special jail where Sheikh Hasina has been detained, inspector general of prisons Brigadier General Md Zakir Hasan said Tuesday. (Recast) A second special jail for VIP detainees is also under preparation, jail authorities said. "The prisons are currently holding more detainees than capacity. It's the same situation in the case of VIP detainees. That's why another VIP will be kept in the same special jail where Sheikh Hasina has been detained," Zakir said. Jail authorities said a newly built house in the same area of the Jatiya Sangsad premises will be turned into a second special jail that will also house more than one VIP detainee. Senior prison officials visited the new house Tuesday, which had originally been built for the deputy speaker. The house where Hasina has been detained is a duplex. The ground floor holds one bedroom, a drawing room and a dining room while the first floor has three bedrooms. The kitchen and a servants' room are on the ground floor. Hasina was given the southeast bedroom complete with a bathroom on the first floor of the house. The IG (prisons) told bdnews24.com: "All food for Sheikh Hasina is being supplied from Dhaka Central Jail. For convenience, food will be cooked for her in the house in a day or two." bdnews
