 ANKARA Tue Jul 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turks elect a new parliament on Sunday in what has been billed as one of the most important polls of their recent history following a clash between the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party and the nation's secular elite. The pro-business, centre-right AK Party is widely predicted to win the election but with a reduced majority and well short of the two thirds of seats required to change the constitution. This scenario has helped propel Turkish financial markets to record highs this month. Investors applaud the AK Party's free market policies, but fear a large majority could reignite tensions with the secularists, including Turkey's powerful army. The European Union, which began membership talks with Turkey in 2005, is also closely watching the election, hoping a new government can revive the country's stalled reform process. Some analysts say investors are complacent about the risks. "These elections cannot solve the institutional deadlock ... Turkey's problems have just been postponed," said Wolfango Piccoli of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was forced to call the polls months early after the secular elite -- the army, top judges and opposition parties -- derailed his bid to have parliament elect Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as the country's next president. The new parliament must now elect Turkey's next president. Secularists fear ex-Islamists Erdogan and Gul want to erode Turkey's separation of state and religion, a claim the men deny. A majority of two thirds or more would enable the AK Party to tweak Turkey's secular constitution and also to push through its presidential candidate without heeding opposition concerns. In an attempt to assuage secularist fears and reach out to Turkey's urban middle class, Erdogan has discarded many of the more Islamist-minded members of his parliamentary party and has fielded more women and centrist candidates in this election. Erdogan has also signaled he may be ready to compromise over the presidency, a traditional bastion of the secularists. Opinion polls show the AK Party could win about 40 percent of the vote, up from 34 percent in the 2002 election. But it is likely to end up with fewer seats because more parties are now expected to clear the 10 percent threshold to enter parliament. POLARISATION The main opposition, centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and a sizeable number of independents, mostly pro-Kurdish candidates, are also tipped to win seats in the 550-member parliament. "It will be a parliament of polarities," said Ayse Ayata, a professor at Ankara's Middle East Technical University. "It would be better in some ways to have a coalition government as that could help reduce the polarization." Some 42.5 million Turks will be able to vote, out of a total population of 74 million. Four million young people will cast their ballots in a national election for the first time. As well as clashes between the AK Party ex-Islamists and the arch-secularists of the CHP, analysts expect fiery exchanges between Kurdish deputies seeking more rights for their community and the MHP ultra-nationalists who view such demands as a direct threat to Turkish national security and identity. "The new parliament will be a real test of whether Turks and Kurds can reach a consensus (on how to resolve the Kurdish issue)," said Mehmet Ali Birand, a veteran TV commentator. Turkish security forces have been battling Kurdish separatist rebels in the impoverished southeast region since 1984 in a conflict that has cost more than 30,000 lives. Tellingly, in the present nationalist climate, the terrorism issue has dominated election rallies. But politicians have barely alluded to Turkey's bid to join the EU, reflecting a growing public disenchantment here with the EU proje
