 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) - An activist of the troubled Liberal Democratic Party Sunday sued 11 party leaders, including Abdul Mannan and Mahi B Chowdhury, accusing them of attempting murder, beating and theft. Amrul Haque Tony, known as a follower of Oli Ahmed who leads a faction of LDP members, filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Magistrate Mizanur Rahman directed the Ramna police chief to investigate the allegations. The other accused are Saju Kamal, Shahidullah, Jahangir Alam Biplob, Nazmul Karim Bacchu, Wajed Ali Chowdhury, Obaed Mridha, Sohag, Jahangir and Noman. According to case details, the accused rented a house on Shahid Captain Monsur Ali Road in Moghbazar to use it as the party office on Dec 21 last year. But after the state of emergency was declared in mid-January, the accused developed a difference of opinion with Oli Ahmed and tried to take away goods from the office, the case said. On July 12 when the accused were removing the goods, the complainant and witnesses challenged them. At one point, the accused allegedly beat them and attempted to kill them, the complainant said in the case. They also stole cash from pocket, wristwatches and mobile phones, Tony said. The party virtually split into two factions, one led by Badruddoza Chowdhury and the other by Oli. All the accused are known as followers of Badruddoza Chowdhury. bdnews24
