 MADRID, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona are hoping Argentina centre-back Gabriel Milito will be a role model for the squad after he completed his move from Real Zaragoza on Thursday. The 26-year-old passed a medical and put pen to paper on a four-year contract in a deal that could rise to 20.5 million euros ($28.29 million). "We hope he continues to demonstrate the commitment and leadership that he has shown in his career until now. Barca need players with his type of character," Barcelona's sports director Txiki Begiristain told a news conference. "We want players that are leaders on the pitch but also in the dressing room, that can act as an example to the rest of the squad." Barca's squad was criticised after last season's trophyless campaign with fans, local media and the club's management accusing some players of being complacent and lacking commitment. Club president Joan Laporta has said there will be a disciplinary committee operating to monitor the players' conduct and attitude next season, and to resolve any dressing room problems. PUYOL ABSENCE Barcelona had been seeking to strengthen their defence after centre-back Carles Puyol picked up a knee ligament injury that will rule him out of the start of next season. Milito will compete with France defender Lilian Thuram and Mexico's Rafael Marquez for a place in the centre of defence. The Argentine joined Zaragoza from Independiente in 2003 for $3.5 million after a move to Barca's arch-rivals Real Madrid fell through at the last minute. Real pulled out of the $4 million deal citing concerns over a knee ligament injury the player suffered in 2001. Asked if he considered the move a form of revenge against Real, Milito replied: "No. We have to forget about the past. "I have always wanted to come here and I hope I can repay the club on the pitch for the confidence they have shown in me." He is Barcelona's fourth close-season signing after France striker Thierry Henry, Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure and France left back Eric Abidal
