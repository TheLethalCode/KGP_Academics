 LOS ANGELES, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Smile Brad and Angelina, you're on not-so-candid camera, with a photo of the Hollywood star couple with baby Shiloh topping a list of the most expensive celebrity photos. Financial Web site Forbes.com on Wednesday posted a list of top 10 most pricey celebrity photos led by a June 2006 shot of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hovering over baby Shiloh at No 1 with a pricetag of $4.1 million paid by People magazine. The picture of the two proud parents was followed by wedding photos taken of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore at No 2 that fetched $3 million in October 2005 from OK! magazine. Brad and Angie landed in four of the top 10 positions while deceased Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith and people in her life captured another three. Forbes.com said all the photos were published by one of four celebrity magazines -- People, OK!, In Touch Weekly and US Weekly -- and it quotes one magazine editor as saying the qualities that make the pictures costly are surprise, news and emotion.
