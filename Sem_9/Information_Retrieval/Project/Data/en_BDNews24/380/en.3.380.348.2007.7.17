 NEW YORK, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US families will shell out almost $564 for back-to-school merchandise this year as student demand for hot electronics and trendy footwear drives up the cost of returning to school, according to a survey released on Tuesday. Families with school-age children are expected to spend $563.49 this year for school-related gear, up almost 7 percent from the average a year ago, according to the National Retail Federation's 2007 back-to-school survey. Electronics should capture the biggest sales increase, with families spending $129.24 on electronics -- up 13 percent from a year ago. "Electronics have evolved from luxuries to necessities, not only for college students but also for their younger siblings," said NRF President and CEO Tracy Mullin in a statement. Mullin said that while students may clamor for an iPod or a cell phone, parents are also spending money on computers, educational software and printers. Families, on average, are expected to spend $108.42 on footwear this year, up 10.3 percent from a year ago, as students use shoes as accessories to spice up their outfits. But spending on clothing and accessories is forecast to be flat, with consumers spending an average of $231.80 on those purchases -- close to last year's average of $228.14. Though discount stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp are the most popular destination for back-to-school shopping, the survey found fewer parents plan to shop at discounters this year -- 67.6 percent versus 72.2 percent last year. That means other stores will see a boost in traffic. For example, 41.4 percent of survey respondents said they expect to shop at office supplies stores, up from 35.8 percent last year, while almost 55 percent expect to head to department stores, up from 53.3 percent a year ago. Most consumers, 45.2 percent, said they will start back-to-school shopping three weeks to one month before school starts, while 32 percent said they will begin one to two weeks before. Just 2.7 percent said they will wait to do their shopping until after school starts, while almost 15 percent want to get a jump-start and intend to begin shopping at least two months before the first school bell rings. The survey, conducted for NRF by BIGresearch, polled 8,290 consumers from July 3 through July 10. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percen
