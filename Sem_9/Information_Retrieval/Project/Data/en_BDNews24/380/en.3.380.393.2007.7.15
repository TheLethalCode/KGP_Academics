 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) - There has been no advance in the handover of state-run Rupali Bank Ltd (RBL) to its would-be buyer Prince Bandar Bin Mohammad Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud, the finance adviser said Sunday. "The handover of RBL to Prince Bandar is still undetermined," AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters in his finance ministry office. Azizul made his comments after the Privatisation Commission's (PC) deadline for a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) between the buyer and the bank had passed. The PC set a mid-July deadline for signing the SPA. Failure to do so would result in the cancellation of the agreement and the confiscation of security money worth $100,000. Prince Bandar won the purchase bid for the government held a 67.26 percent stake in the bank for $330 million last year. He also agreed to buy the remaining 26 percent owned by the government for $128 million in February. The handover was progressively delayed and has now become uncertain due to ongoing setbacks in the negotiations. PC officials, seeking anonymity, said the prospective owners of RBL has been tagging one condition after the next onto the purchase deal. "Initially, their conditions focused on financial matters relating to the bank only. Gradually, however the list of conditions increased, becoming critical at the last moment." "Block loans, voluntary retirement schemes and the non-performing loans of the state owned enterprise are the major issues needing addressed before the handover can be completed," the PC official said. The prince has sought permission to appoint 300 foreign management personnel, including advisers and trainers on an income-tax exempt basis. He also demanded permission to remit up to 90 percent of their wages. Further to these demands he asked the government to relax their restrictions on the appointment of expatriate directors as well as rules on foreign individual ownership. "We were negotiating on several unresolved issues when the prince and his representatives suddenly stopped the talks. The deadline was set for July 15, we may now have to look for alternative options," a PC official told bdnews24.com Sunday. bd
