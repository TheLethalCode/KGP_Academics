<TITLE> Taskforce had no hand in Hasina case: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Communications adviser MA Matin Tuesday said anticorruption taskforces had nothing to do with the extortion case filed against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. The adviser, also chairman of the national coordination committee on serious crimes, faced reporters Tuesday, a day after Hasina was arrested. "It's up to the home ministry to issue a legal interpretation for detaining Sheikh Hasina," Matin told the assembled reporters after attending a workshop on 'Improving Port Efficiency' at Hotel Purbani. Asked whether the legal process in issuing an arrest warrant was followed by the court in Hasina's case, the adviser said he personally had no knowledge of the legal procedures involved in such a case. "The legal issues should be clarified by the home ministry," he reiterated. Security forces arrested the former prime minister at her Sudha Sadan home in a predawn raid Monday in an extortion case. Within hours, a Dhaka court rejected a prayer for bail and sent her to jail. bdnews24.com/krc/a
