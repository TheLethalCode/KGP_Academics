 July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Peace talks scheduled to start in Somalia on Sunday are seen as the interim government's best hope of securing peace and strengthening its legitimacy. The conference, already postponed twice over security fears, caps a period that has been tumultuous even by Somali standards. Here are some details: A NEW GOVERNMENT: -- The first meeting of the country's parliament on home soil took place in Baidoa in February 2006, nearly two years after it was formed in the safety of neighbouring Kenya. -- Lawmakers elected Ethiopian-backed warlord Abdullahi Yusuf as president and Ali Mohamed Gedi as prime minister to run the 14th attempt at government in Somalia since warlords ousted the last president, dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, in 1991. A NEW ORDER: -- In June 2006, after winning a bloody three-month battle against U.S.-backed warlords, Islamist militia calling themselves the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) seized Mogadishu. Washington accused the SICC of al Qaeda links. -- Taming the capital has been the holy grail for every attempt at government since 1991 and only the Islamists succeeded in stabilising it, by imposing what critics called a harsh version of Islamic law. -- They further spread their control to most of south Somalia and advanced on the government's base in Baidoa. A QUICK RETURN: -- With tacit U.S. approval, Somalia's neighbour Ethiopia sent in troops to prop up the government and defend against an impending Islamist attack on Baidoa, which came in December. -- The better-armed Ethiopian and Somali force advanced rapidly and ran the Islamists all the way to Somalia's southern tip. Mogadishu fell to the government in the last days of December, without a shot being fired after the Islamists fled. DEATH ON THE STREETS: -- Two rounds of fighting between Ethiopian-Somali troops and Islamist insurgents sent residents fleeing the city in droves in early 2007 and killed at least 1,300 people, mainly civilians. -- The United Nations said more than 390,000 Somalis had abandoned the capital since February, though the government disputes that figure. In recent weeks, about 90,000 had returned to their homes. -- The African Union called for a peacekeeping force of 8,000 to be dispatched to Somalia. But only Uganda responded immediately with 1,600 troops. -- Full-scale conflict has given way to almost daily guerrilla-style attacks on Ethiopian military and Somali government targets.
