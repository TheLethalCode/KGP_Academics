<TITLE> Lack of accurate data hampers policymaking: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) - Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday said that the country lacked accurate data essential for planning and policymaking. "Precise and timely estimates of crop yield, area, production and other farm data will help correct policy decisions and monitoring of the progress of various programmes and schemes," Azizul told the inaugural of a master trainers' training for the Agricultural Census 2007 at the BBS auditorium. He said that the use of modern technology and know-how with appropriate grounding would be of great help in capturing and validating field data. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) organised the programme prior to the launch of the Agricultural Census 2007 across the country in December. The BBS plans to conduct the census, the fourth of its kind in Bangladesh, and will in the meantime, complete all arrangements including training of its staff members and researchers to carry out the gigantic task. Planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury and BBS director general AWM Ekramul Haque also spoke. The finance adviser asked the BBS of the planning ministry to equip its staff members with modern technological know-how to collect credible, updated data. "Restructuring of the manpower organogram of the BBS is indispensable to bringing dynamism to its activities," Azizul said. "The planning division and the BBS will get my full support if they come up with anything to turn the bureau into a credible institution," he said. The adviser, however, said that though agriculture played a key role in ensuring food security and employment generation, its contribution to the economy was declining. "Currently, agriculture's contribution to the GDP has come down to 21 percent from 60 percent two decades ago," Azizul said. "But still the sector employs 52 percent of the workforce." "Revenue collection from the sector has also been abridged." The previous agricultural censuses were conducted in 1960, 1977, and 1983-84. The 1977 census was to have taken place in 1970 and all preparations were completed, but due to the liberation war the fieldwork took place in 1977. bd
