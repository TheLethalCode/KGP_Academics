 LONDON, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion struck outside the British embassy in the Chilean capital of Santiago, causing minor damage to the building, a Foreign Office spokesman said on Monday. The spokesman said there were no reports of any casualties and that a police investigation was under way. A local journalist, Jorge Garreton, told Britain's Sky Television the explosion took place at around 10:15 pm on Sunday (0215 GMT). He described the cause of the explosion as "a small cylinder with exploding powder and a timer" and said there were no injuries reported. "This is a posh area of town," Garreton added. "It not only houses the British embassy but also the Israeli embassy (is) nearby." Around 50,000 British tourists visit Chile each year, according to the Foreign Office Web site and Britain's official travel information says the threat from terrorism is low.
