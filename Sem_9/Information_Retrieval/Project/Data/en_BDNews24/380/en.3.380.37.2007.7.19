 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The Centre for Policy Dialogue defended its opinion Thursday that the government's move to raise the prices of oil, gas, fertiliser and power is 'ill-timed'. In a press briefing last Saturday, CPD's executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya had said the plan to raise the prices of necessities 'as suggested by the IMF' would be 'suicidal.' Debapriya's remarks sparked anger among the interim government, prompting two advisers to rubbish CPD's comment the following day. "We reiterate, the decision will not be wise at the present moment," Debapriya said, replying to reporters' questions during the launch of UNCTAD's Least Developed Countries Report 2007. "They (the advisers) have given their opinions and we have given ours," Debapriya said. "You will see the facts when CPD will assess the economy after six months," he added. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam and energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury had denied and denigrated CPD's assertion that the government was going to raise prices of oil, gas and power as per prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund. Azizul Islam defended the government plan, saying it is not 'suicidal,' but essential for the economy. The adviser also denied that the government had succumbed to the IMF. "Nobody gave in to the donors. It is the nation's interest which is always taken care of first," Tapan Chowdhury told reporters in his reaction last Sunday. bdn
