 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks rallied for a fifth day Thursday, spurred by price spirals in some bank shares over rumours of increases in their capital bases. Half-yearly disclosures from some companies also boosted the market. Most multinationals rose sharply while mutual funds and cement heavyweights dropped due to profit-taking. Non-bank financial institutions, insurance and power shares closed mixed. "It's a normal day. Both buy and sell pressure ruled the market," said Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh. The DGEN or general index gained 29.06 points or 1.25 percent to 2339.37. The DSI or all-share price index finished at 1913.81, up 17.38 points or 0.91 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip index rallied 47.51 points or 2.32 percent to 2088. Of the issues traded, 99 advanced, 84 lost and 20 ended unchanged. Turnover on the DSE slipped to Tk 2.33 billion from Wednesday's Tk 2.39 billion. Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of Imtiyaz Husain Securities, expressed worries on the steady rise which the market has witnessed since early May. "It's irrational," he said. "Prices of some issues remain overvalued compared to their earnings and potentials. But I think the market will take its own course," said Zaiul Haque Khondker, chief executive of ICB. The Chittagong Stock Exchange also closed upbeat amid an increase in turnover at Tk 450.30 million from Tk 380.53 million. A total of 51 issues gained, 44 lost and 10 scrips held steady on the CSE. On the DSE, BRAC Bank surged 7.93 percent to Tk 897.5 inspired by transactions of Tk 182.54 million worth of shares on the block market. BRAC Bank recorded Tk 215.85 million in turnover. Southeast Bank, which secured Tk 186.40 million in turnover, rallied 6.31 percent to Tk 564.31 on rumours it would increase its capital. Profit-taking led Square Pharma to lose 0.56 percent to Tk 4556.75. The company early this week posted 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock dividends. Summit Power that won a government contract to establish small power plants earlier added 5.29 percent to Tk 1,099.25. National Bank moved up 6.91 percent to Tk 896.5 on buying pressure. BATBC and Aramit Cement topped gainers reporting rises in their half yearly earning. Pragati Life Insurance and Beximco Fisheries ruled the losers. bd
