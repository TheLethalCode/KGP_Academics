<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Monday alleged the arrest of Sheikh Hasina was part of the government's conspiracy to keep her away from people and demanded her immediate release. "The Minus Two formula is a brainchild of the government. As part of it attempts are going on to alienate the two leaders from the people," acting president of the party Zillur Rahman said. "Sheikh Hasina is no common person. If there was any allegation against her she could be summoned to the court. But instead of doing that she has been arrested with a purpose to alienate her from people," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home Monday noon, "She was under undeclared house arrest. But none could even imagine that she might be arrested. The people of the country are agitated at the incident. People will not take it easily." The AL acting president urged people to not be baffled by the arrest and remain united. Zillur said the party's policymaking presidium will decide the next course of action. He said until noon no no presidium members except Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury and Motia Chowdhury got in touch with him. "We are surprised, sad and hurt at the incident. We will seek redress from the High Court," Sajeda told reporters on the ground floor of the house. Another presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, who is now in Singapore, told bdnews24.com by telephone: , "Let me have an understanding of everything. I will give my reaction then." Abdur Razzak was said to be out of home when his residence was rang at 8:15am. Tofail Ahmed, another presidium stalwart, did not agree to give any reaction over telephone. Earlier, Motia had termed the arrest unwanted. In an instant reaction to bdnews24.com Monday morning she said, "Nobody will accept it. She has been arrested to be harassed politically." "The Awami League president has been arrested at a time when there was a buzz of reform. Because, if Sheikh Hasina moves freely the reformists would not hold water. There is a relation between the arrest and the reform," Motia also said. bdnews
