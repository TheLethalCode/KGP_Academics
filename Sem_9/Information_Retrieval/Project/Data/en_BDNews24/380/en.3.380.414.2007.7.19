<TITLE> Intellectual property rights hurting local industry: UNCTAD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Strict intellectual property rights, being further ratified worldwide, are hurting key industries in Bangladesh, says the UNCTAD Least Developed Countries Report 2007 released globally Thursday. "A detailed investigation on the impact of IPRs as an innovation incentive in the pharmaceuticals, agro-processing and textiles and garments sectors found that strong IPRs tend to discourage learning and innovation in local firms in Bangladesh," the UNCTAD report said. UNCTAD also said stronger IPRs are likely to increase payments from developing to developed countries without a significant impact on domestic technological capacity. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) works as a permanent forum for the discussion of developing countries' concerns about international trade and investments. This year's report has focused on technological learning and innovative capacity in the LDCs. UNCTAD came to the conclusion on the impact of IPRs in Bangladesh following a study carried out in its domestic processing sector. The study covered 155 firms in Bangladesh50 agro-processing, 45 pharmaceuticals and 60 textile and garmentson the impact of IPRs on learning and innovation. The term 'intellectual property rights' denotes the specific legal rights, which authors, inventors, patent holders and other IP holders may hold and exercise. Bangladesh is at present exempted from implementing the general provisions of the global TRIPS (trade related intellectual property rights) agreement until 2013 (2016 for pharmaceuticals). After the deadline, as per WTO obligation, Bangladesh will have to buy the patent rights for producing goods for which it has no rights. In the textile and RMG sector, most of the firms interviewed were of the view that IPRs did not play any role in technological innovation, because they simply assembled the final product according to precisely defined, buyer-determined specifications without any indigenous design-related innovation. The firms in the pharmaceutical sector however were very concerned that once foreign firms begin to strictly enforce their patents it would adversely affect local efforts to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients. Although the study found that IPRs do not significantly affect the development of new products or processes in Bangladesh, domestic entrepreneurs had serious concerns regarding the impact of IPRs on their inputs, such as seed availability and seed price. "IPRs do not play an important role as far as new product or process development is concerned (in Bangladesh)," Centre for Policy Dialogue's executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya told a briefing marking the launch of the report in Bangladesh on behalf of UNCTAD. Debapriya said the report shows that foreign companies working in Bangladesh have hardly done anything significant to transfer technology, skill development and research. He said Bangladesh's knowledge infrastructure is also very weak. He asked the government to allocate more money for relevant research work. Currently IPRs are mostly benefiting trans-national and multi-national corporations operating in the developing markets, which are not sufficiently specialised to protect their innovations under the global IPR regime. In terms of submission of application for patents, the UNCTAD report 2007 said, Bangladesh ranks 2nd among the LDCs with 316, of which 260 applications were submitted by non-resident Bangladeshis. The UNCTAD report suggested Bangladesh should go for producing more value added products, shifting from its current trend of producing low value added items. A recent CPD report said that Bangladesh's global share in garments export increased from 2 percent in 2000 to 2.3 percent in 2005, far behind China, Vietnam and India. bdn
