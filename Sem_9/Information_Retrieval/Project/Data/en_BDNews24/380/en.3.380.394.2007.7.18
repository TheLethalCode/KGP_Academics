 WASHINGTON, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lent support on Tuesday to President George W Bush on Iraq, saying violence there was a problem for all countries. As Bush hosted Ban at the White House, the UN chief also welcomed the president's plan to hold a high-level meeting on the Middle East peace process in the autumn. "As for the Iraqi situation, this is the problem of the whole world," Ban said, promising UN help with rebuilding Iraq politically, economically and socially. On Monday, Ban warned against an "abrupt withdrawal" by US forces from Iraq and said the international community should not abandon the Iraqi people, shocking some UN officials for inserting himself into the US debate on the war. At least six people were killed on Wednesday when a pair of roadside bombs exploded in south-eastern Baghdad, Iraqi police said. Five people were wounded in the attacks in the Al-Amin district, which police said occurred in an area used as a stopping point by people travelling by bus to the capital from the Shi'ite south. U.S. and Iraqi forces have launched a major security clampdown in and around Baghdad to thwart sectarian violence between majority Shi'ites and minority Sunni Arabs, but violence has continued to flare. Bus terminals mainly used by Shia have been attacked on numerous occasions in the past. The show of Ban's support comes as Bush faces the American public's growing frustration with the Iraq war and rising pressure even from within his own Republican Party for a US pullout. The two discussed climate change, said Ban, who invited Bush to participate in a conference on the environment that he has called for September, on the sidelines of the annual UN General Assembly. Bush looks forward to attending the Sept. 24 event, a White House spokesman said later. Climate change is a contentious issue in the Bush administration, which has fought mandatory caps on the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. Ban said he was encouraged by Bush's initiatives on climate change at last month's G8 summit, where world leaders agreed to pursue substantial cuts in greenhouse gas
