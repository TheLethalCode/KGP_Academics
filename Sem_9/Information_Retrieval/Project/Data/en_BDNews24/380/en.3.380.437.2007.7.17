 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Jagannath University in Old Dhaka came to a halt due to a strike called by Bangladesh Chhatra League protesting the arrest of Sheikh Hasina. Following a death threat to the proctor by a unanimous gang, additional police have been deployed on the campus. BCL brought out a procession at 11.30am despite a ban on protest rallies and processions during the state of emergency. The protesters ransacked two buses. The presence of students on the campus was thin. No regular classes were held. However, examinations were held as scheduled. Prof Kazi Asad told reporters that an unnamed gang threatened him with death by telephone and demanded suspension of departmental examinations. After the death threat, several hundred uniformed and plainclothes police have been deployed on the campus. Government Kabi Nazrul College and Suhrawardi Government College have also came to a halt due to the strike. bdnews24.c
