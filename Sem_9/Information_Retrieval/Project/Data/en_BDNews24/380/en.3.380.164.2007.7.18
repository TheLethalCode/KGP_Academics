 LOS ANGELES, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Victoria Beckham's bid to woo Americans has backfired with damning reviews of a reality TV show that she hoped would overturn her image here as a sour-faced diva. The New York Post called Monday night's show 'an orgy of self-indulgence' and described Beckham as 'vapid and condescending'. Beckham, 33, wife of British soccer legend David Beckham, arrived in Los Angeles last week in a media blitz promoting the couple as style icons and mega-celebrities both on and off the soccer field.

"Beckham, who is bizarrely constantly posing even in her own home, offers insights about how major a certain purse is or how her new phone has changed her life," Linda Stasi wrote in The New York Post. Gail Pennington of the St Louis Post-Dispatch wrote: "To the Brits, they are Posh and Becks. To most Americans they're- who?" Beckham, who plans to push her jeans, sunglasses and perfume lines in the United States, said last week she hoped Americans would appreciate her dry, British sense of humor.
