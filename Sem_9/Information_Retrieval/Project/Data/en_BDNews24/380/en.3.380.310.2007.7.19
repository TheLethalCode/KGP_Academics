 ACCRA, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States is building a partnership with Africa to pull the continent out of poverty, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Thursday as she lent her support to moves to boost U.S.-African trade. Rice, speaking by video link to a forum in Ghana, said Washington's decision to extend until 2015 an initiative for more open commerce with Africa signalled "America's enduring and bipartisan support for Africa's trade and development efforts". The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) introduced in 2000 allows nearly 40 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to export some goods free of duties and quotas into the United States. "We are building a partnership to support poverty reduction and good governance," Rice told the Accra conference, which looked at ways to broaden and improve the AGOA initiative. She spoke by video link after cancelling a planned trip to Ghana in favour of discussions in Washington on the Middle East. Last year, AGOA imports from Africa to the United States climbed to $44.2 billion from $38.1 billion in 2005. But oil products, which generate less jobs than other manufacturing activities, accounted for more than 90 percent of this total. Washington says it is working to increase the non-oil component. "This partnership is growing," Rice said, pointing to $2 billion of U.S. aid committed to African countries under the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which gives development assistance to countries that practise good governance. U.S. officials say AGOA is helping African states climb out of poverty by offering trade, not handouts -- a key demand of anti-poverty activists. The officials say $1 billion has been spent under the AGOA initiative since 2000 on boosting the exporting capacity of African countries. Liberia and Mauritania have recently joined the list of countries eligible to export to America under AGOA. In a new move to promote African farm exports, seven African agricultural experts will study in American universities in the coming year, with more to follow, Rice said in her address. Some analysts say the African continent's exporters have a long way to go before they can hope to compete successfully in the world's largest consumer market. Poor infrastructure, unreliable power supply, fierce competition with China and a lack of experience in Western export markets are among the obstacles. Ghanaian President John Kufuor says African nations need more time to benefit from the opportunities offered by AGOA. "I will therefore appeal first to the US government to extend the time span of AGOA to 20 years," he said on Wednesday. Development activists say subsidies paid to US agricultural producers -- especially in the cotton sector -- will keep African farmers poor even if AGOA is extended. US. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said on Wednesday that although Washington was committed to eliminating farm export subsidies and to cutting trade distorting domestic subsidies, she believed market access was also key to achieving success in faltering global trade talks. "It is absolutely fundamentally important for African countries to gain market access ... not just to markets of developed countries but also to the markets of rapidly emerging developing countries, Brazil, India, China," she told reporte
