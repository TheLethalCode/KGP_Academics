 KABUL,Thu Jul 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan rebel leader and Taliban and al Qaeda ally Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has declared a ceasefire in his battle against Afghanistan's government, he said in a statement. Hekmatyar is wanted by the Afghan government and US authorities, but the veteran fighter who once led the biggest mujahideen faction against the 1979-89 Soviet occupation has a history of changing sides and shifting alliances. Aired by two private television channels and circulated in Kabul, the statement said: "Members of Hezb-i-Islami have stopped and refrained from brother killing and from the destruction of the country and assumed political activity because it believes the Americans, like the British and Russians, will pull out (of Afghanistan)," said the statement obtained by Reuters on Thursday. "Hence, now we have to unite for creating an Islamic system and start our political efforts so that we can provide a tranquil life and everlasting peace for our Muslim countrymen," it said. It was not immediately clear when and where the statement was issued and Hekmatyar's sympathizers could not be contacted for verification. An Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the statement and other government officials were not immediately available for comment. A Kabul-based Western diplomat said any peace move would be welcome, but reconciliation would be hard for Hekmatyar. "It would be very hard for him to reconcile personally because of his links with terrorism," the diplomat said. "If Hekmatyar was announcing a major change in strategy, you would think he would project this message a bit more robustly." Hekmatyar's ceasefire declaration was not unexpected, a Western security analyst said, given the steady sapping of strength his group has suffered from military losses to the surrender of 10 of its leaders in 2004 and another of the rebel party's commanders with 30 fighters just last week. Hekmatyar's forces are greatly outnumbered by Taliban insurgents and have not launched many attacks in recent months citing supply problems along the Pakistan border. Hekmatyar, a radical, anti-Western Islamist once led the biggest mujahideen faction fighting Soviet forces and received the bulk of U.S. and Pakistani military aid. After the end of the Soviet occupation and the fall of the Afghan communist government, Hekmatyar was briefly prime minister in a mujahideen administration that disintegrated into civil war in the early 1990s. During the fighting, Hekmatyar's militia, more than any other, was responsible for the destruction of Kabul by sending thousands of rockets into the capital which had previously remained largely unscathed from years of war. After losing to the Taliban when they captured Kabul in 1996, Hekmatyar went into exile in Iran, but the Iranian government forced him to leave in early 2002 after becoming increasingly embarrassed by Hekmatyar's support for Osama bin Laden. He then returned to Afghanistan and allied his fighters with the Taliban and launched attacks on Western and government targets from mountain strongholds in the southeast. He has previously claimed it was his fighters that helped bin Laden escape a US operation in the mountains of Tora Bora, then last year pledged allegiance to the al Qaeda lead
