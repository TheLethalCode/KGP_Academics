<TITLE> Faizee stepped down on neglect of duty charges: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) A second reference of the Supreme Judicial Council forced Faisal Mahmud Faizee to resign, an official with the apex court said Sunday. The second reference centred around the controversial High Court judge's neglect of duty: he did not sign verdicts on 180 cases, Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed told reporters in his office. He said Faizee's resignation letter had been sent to the Bangabhaban. On June 26, the council sent the second reference on Faizee to President Iajuddin Ahmed, who ordered an investigation into the matter. Faizee was asked to appear before the council on July 15, but his resignation came on July 12. The first reference handled by the council addressed certificate forgery allegations against Faizee, but the move fell apart as the High Court on March 19 stayed Chittagong University's decision to void his LLB certificate. The Supreme Judicial Council led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin will decide on the issue of the 180 pending cases. Faizee stepped down Thursday, blaming an unnamed quarter for spreading political propaganda against him. In his resignation letter, he said he had resigned to uphold the dignity of the Supreme Court. bdnews
