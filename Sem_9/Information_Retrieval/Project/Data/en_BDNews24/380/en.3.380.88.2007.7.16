 Munshiganj, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday said his makeshift administration will spare no corruption suspects, however big they are, if there was evidence against them. He made the remarks at a meeting with the district administration officials and members of the civil society at Munshiganj Shilpakala Academy, hours after the arrest of Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. Fakhruddin said the interim administration has taken a tough stand to curb corruption. "If somebody commits corruption, he must face the law. Those facing corruption charges will be tried under the existing laws of the country." The emergency government chief renewed his pledge to hold general elections by December 2008. He promised Padma bridge will be built, a cross-dam erected and Muktarpur bridge renovated soon as possible. The chief adviser also pledged steps to increase beds in Munshiganj General Hospital, provide internet facilities and preserve potato seeds in the agriculture-dominated area. Munshiganj deputy commissioner Md Monir Uddin moderated the meeting designed to exchange views. Earlier, the chief adviser released fish fry in the pond of Munshiganj Government Haraganga College as part of a countrywide programme to protect local species of fish. Agriculture adviser CS Karim, cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder and home secretary Abdul Karim also accompanied him. bdnews
