 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of Awami League, has defied the current ban on political activity by calling a strike in all educational institutions throughout the country from July 17. BCL called the strike to protest AL president Sheikh Hasina's arrest, the outfit said in a statement Monday. The former prime minister was arrested by security forces at her home Monday and taken to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka to face a Tk 2.95 crore extortion case that was filed against her on June 13. She was escorted from the court following the rejection of her bail plea and is currently being detained in a special jail in the Jatiya Sangsad complex. BCL president Mahmud Hasan Ripon and acting general secretary Shahinur Rahman Tutul demanded the immediate release of Hasina. bdnews2
