 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) - The Tigers take on a Sri Lankan Cricket Board selection comprising mainly of Academy players in a practice one-dayer Wednesday. The Tigers have named a 12-man squad for the match leaving out Javed Omar, Shahadat Hossain and Mehrab Hossain (Jr.) as both sides have agreed on allowing the 12th player to bat or bowl, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). There is some uncertainty about the venue of the match after it was shifted to the Colombo Colts Ground from the nondescript venue. However, when the Bangladesh team reached there after their net session at the Max Cricket Academy Tuesday afternoon to have a look, it was found that the pitch had been watered and not prepared. The first ODI of the Laqshya series is at the P Sara Stadium July 20. The second and third matches will be held at the R Premadasa Stadium July 23 and 25 respectively. Bangladesh 12: Mohammad Ashraful (Captain), Shahariar Nafees, Tamim Iqbal, Tushar Imran, Saqib Al Hasan, Aftab Ahmed, Mushfiqur Rahim (Wicketkeeper), Farhad Reza, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (Vice Captain), Abdur Razzak and Syed Rasel.
