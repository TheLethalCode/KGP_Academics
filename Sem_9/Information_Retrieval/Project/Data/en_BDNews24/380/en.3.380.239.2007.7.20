 New York, July 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is among prominent world leaders who have formed a group called Elders under a personal initiative of legendary South African leader Nelson Mandela. The alliance will launch diplomatic assaults on the globe's seemingly insurmountable problems like climate change, HIV/AIDS and poverty. Former US president Jimmy Carter, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and former president of Ireland Mary Robinson are also among the prominent leaders, who formed the group. The alliance was announced Wednesday marking the 89th birthday of Mandela, reports bdnews24.com's New York correspondent. The group's members and supporters said they were guided neither by ideology nor by geopolitical bent. The group will speak freely and boldly working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken for the common good of the people. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki have welcomed the move. British tycoon Richard Branson who will be providing the necessary funds to the group hoped most individuals in the world would welcome a group of people who are above ego and are above partisan politics. "We are not out to defend the positions of any institution or government. We are ordinary global citizens who want to help with the problems of the world," New York Times quoted Annan as saying. Jimmy Carter said, "The Elders won't get involved in delivering bed nets for malaria prevention and added the issue is to fill vacuums, to address major issues that are aren't being adequately addressed." Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright is supportive of the move. "It is worth having people with experience see what they can do," she told NYT. Elders would not try to solve all the world's problems but would work stone by stone on those issues where they can do some good. Elders has been described as diplomatic league of super heroes. bdne
