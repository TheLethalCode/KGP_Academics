 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)- The verdict in the case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against former Awami League state minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir will be delivered on July 26. After hearing the arguments presented by the defense and prosecution over the past four days, Judge Shahed Nuruddin of Special Judge's Court-3 Thursday announced the date for delivery of the verdict. If the allegations against Mohiuddin are proved, he may face a jail term of between three and 13 years, substantial fine and the confiscation of illegally held assets. Defence lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman, in his concluding remarks to the court, said: "The state side has completely failed to prove the allegations it has brought against the accused. I appeal to the court to acquit the accused with full honour." In reply, state counsel Syed Mizanur Rahman said, "From the information and evidence presented in the court and the testimony given by the witnesses the crime of the accused has been proved beyond doubt. I appeal to the court for his exemplary and highest punishment." On March 6, ACC deputy director Jibon Krishna Roy filed a case against Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir for suppressing information in his wealth statement submitted to the ACC and of owning illegally earned assets. According to the chargesheet, drawn up on April 29, the accused had suppressed information about Tk 1.17 crore held in six FDR (fixed deposit receipt) accounts. Following a further investigation, ACC deputy director Syed Iqbal Hossain submitted a supplementary charge sheet in court on May 27, alleging that illegally earned property worth Tk 2.1 crore had been detected belonging to Mohiuddin. The depositions of the 37 witnesses mentioned in the chargesheet began on May 29. Seven people including former adviser of the caretaker government Dr Akbar Ali Khan, economist Dr Abul Barakat and former president of the US-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce Forrest Cookson gave depositions in favour of Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. The examining of witnesses ended on July 12. The accused gave his statement to court on July 8. "I am innocent. I have been a victim of circumstances, falling prey to conspiracy. I was a government official. I did important work for the party. I have all through my life discharged those responsibilities with honesty," said Mohiuddin in his defence. bdnews
