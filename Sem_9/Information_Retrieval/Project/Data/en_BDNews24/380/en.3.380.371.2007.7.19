<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Leaders of the Jute Mill Workers Welfare Association demanded effective measures to end 'investor corruption' in the privatised Mymensingh Jute Mill Thursday. The founder of the association, Mohammad Shamsuddin, told a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity that an investor had exerted undue pressure on workers by appointing his own people and attempting to split the organisation Shamsuddin said the jute mill was formerly owned by Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation but was closed in 1993. Three tenders were subsequently floated for its privatisation, he said. In 2004, the then prime minister Sheikh Hasina waived a Tk 70 crore debt and handed the ownership and operations of the mill to workers. At that time, Abbasullah, an investor, became involved, Shamsuddin said. Shamsuddin alleged that Abbasullah had undue influence on the workers by selecting his own appointees. He also failed to reemploy former workers, a condition of the takeover, he said. The association has made an official complaint to the Anticorruption Commission against unwarranted pressure by Abbasullah. bdnews24.co
