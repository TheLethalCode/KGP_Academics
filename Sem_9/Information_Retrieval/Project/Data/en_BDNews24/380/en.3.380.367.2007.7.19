 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's Matthew Hoggard faces a fitness battle to play in the second test against India after back trouble ruled him out of the opening match at Lord's on Thursday. The right-arm seamer suffered a back spasm in practice on Tuesday, ruling him out of the first test along with fast bowler Steve Harmison, who has undergone surgery on a hernia. All-rounder Andrew Flintoff is also missing because of injury. "Matthew Hoggard underwent an MRI scan on Wednesday which revealed irritation in a disc in his back and he has been ruled out of the current test match against India," a statement on the England and Wales Cricket Board website said. "His rehabilitation will be closely monitored over the next five days and he will be re-assessed by ECB medical staff on Monday." Hampshire seamer Chris Tremlett was handed his test debut at Lord's. The second test starts next Friday at Trent Bridge
