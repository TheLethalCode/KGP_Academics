<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM Sun Jul 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel has agreed to stop hunting up to 180 wanted Fatah militants who pledge to end attacks against the Jewish state, in an effort to bolster Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, officials said on Sunday. Israeli officials said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will meet Abbas on Monday, most likely in Jerusalem, as part of a US-led effort to try to revive long-stalled peace talks after Hamas's violent takeover of the Gaza Strip last month. Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said a meeting was possible on Monday but has yet to be confirmed. In addition to the reprieve for Fatah militants, Israel said it agreed to Abbas's request to allow Nayef Hawatmeh, the Damascus-based leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), to visit the occupied West Bank. Hawatmeh's group carried out dramatic attacks against Israel in the 1970s but has scaled back its activities in recent years. Olmert will also give Abbas a finalised list of some 250 prisoners who will be released from Israeli jails. An official in Olmert's office said about 85 percent of the Palestinians to be released will be from Fatah. The rest will come from non-Islamist groups, including Hawatmeh's DFLP, in a move aimed at broadening support for Abbas and the government he appointed to replace a Hamas-led cabinet. Israeli cabinet minister Isaac Herzog described the steps as "difficult," telling Reuters: "But nonetheless we will do it." Israeli officials said their goal was to strengthen Abbas, who dismissed a Hamas-led government after the Islamist group seized control of Gaza by force on June 14. Abbas formed a new government in the occupied West Bank, where his secular Fatah faction remains dominant, over Hamas's opposition. "The security forces have reached an agreement that the terrorists who will openly renounce terrorism will be taken off the Israeli wanted list and will not be pursued if they do not take part in any way in terrorism," an Israeli official said. SIGN COMMITMENTS Leaders of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of Fatah, said militants granted the reprieve would sign commitments not to attack Israeli forces or civilians. Israel would review the reprieves after three months. Olmert's office said the list included the well-known militant Zakaria Zbeideh, head of al-Aqsa in the West Bank city of Jenin. It did not explain how militants were selected from Israel's wanted lists. "I don't trust the Israelis that they will stop" their manhunt, Zbeideh told Reuters after the announcement. "But I am committed to the Palestinian political decision and I want to give the Palestinian government a chance." Salam Fayyad, whom Abbas named prime minister last month, has pledged to crack down on militants in the West Bank but said success hinged on Israel agreeing to stop hunting the gunmen. An Israeli government official said the reprieve for Fatah militants was "an important aspect of the developing security ties" between Israel and Fayyad's government. The official said the gestures would not have been possible "in the past because of the structure and ideology of the former (Hamas-led) government". Abbas asked Israel to let Hawatmeh into the West Bank so he could attend a meeting on Wednesday of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Legislative Council, which functions as an internal parliament. Olmert has yet to remove major West Bank checkpoints as demanded by the Palestinians, but Israel has started to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen tax fun
