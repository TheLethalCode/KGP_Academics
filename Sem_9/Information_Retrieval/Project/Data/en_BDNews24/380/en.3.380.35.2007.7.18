 NEW DELHI, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heavy monsoon rains have triggered landslides in southern India, killing at least 22 people and leaving at least 4,500 homeless in the past two days, officials said on Wednesday. In all, at least 143 people have been killed by rains since the monsoon broke over Kerala state in June, said a spokesman at the government's disaster management control room. More than 27,000 people are living in hundreds of relief camps. One of the worst-hit districts has been submerged beneath more than four times the usual amount of rain for this time of year, damaging crops and infrastructure. More rain is expected over the next three days and the government said it had helicopters and food and medical supplies on standby for rescue and relief.
