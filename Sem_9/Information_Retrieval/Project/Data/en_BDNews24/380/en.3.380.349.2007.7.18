 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)Stocks ended higher Wednesday although panic selling ruled the bourses toward closing, on speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to rein in a soaring market. "We have not taken any decision. But we are considering various options to discipline the market. If necessary, we may act," SEC chairman Faruq Ahmed Siddiqi told bdnews24.com. The market surged up to midday due to rush buying, but sell-offs in the last spell pushed the market down again. Cement and pharmaceuticals stocks finished lower while insurance and mutual funds closed mixed. A senior employee of a mutual fund managing company said: "After midday rumors spread throughout the floors that the SEC is going to impose restrictions on lending by the merchant banks." A consistent surge in fund inflows in the market is due mainly to extension of credit by merchant banks, which are currently permitted to extend credit to their clients on the basis of their own judgment without regulation in this regard. These loans, in some cases, are as high as five times the client's deposit. "We all should play a responsible role to keep the market stable," said Yawer Sayeed, chief of AIMS of Bangladesh. The DGEN or general index which went over 2340 in the midday session, came down to 2310.30 due to last hour profit taking. It added 11.44 points or 0.49 percent over the previous day and over 100 points since Thursday . The DSI or all-share price index advanced 12.56 points or 0.66 percent to 1896.42. The DSE-20 blue chip index however slipped 3.13 points or 0.15 percent to 2041.08. Of the issues traded, 97 added, 87 lost and 24 held steady. Turnover remained unchanged from Tuesday's Tk 2.39 billion. All the main indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange ended higher amid an increase in turnover to Tk 380.53 million from Tk 310.06 million. Gainers ruled losers 62 to 34. A total of 14 issued closed unchanged. On the DSE Southeast Bank, top issue in turnover at Tk 154 million, grew 2.66 percent to Tk 530.5 encouraged by a block deal of Tk 122.80 million. Each share of the bank was traded at between Tk 535-Tk 540 in the block market. BRAC Bank moved up 1.55 percent to Tk 831.5 due to a rush in buying. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, third top scrip in turnover, fell 0.16 percent to Tk 588. Square Pharma slumped 2.32 percent to Tk 4582.75 and Pubali Bank climbed 4.57 percent to Tk 863.5. bdn
