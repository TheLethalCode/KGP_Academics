<TITLE> No reforms in AL until Hasina is free: Zillur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  AAwami League acting president Zillur Rahman Thursday said there would be no reform in the party before Sheikh Hasina was free. "Why reform keeping the leader in jail? All misunderstandings among us have been removed. The leaders and workers of the party at all levels are now united to free the leader," he told reporters at his Gulshan home. Zillur, also a former general secretary, said if indoor politics was reintroduced and if reforms were to take place, only in presence of Hasina would they be carried out. "At the moment there will be no reform in the Awami League. First, the party president will have to be freed," the veteran politician said. He welcomed Hasina's archrival BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's statement demanding release of the AL chief. "She (Khaleda) acted like a political leader," Zillur said. On his meeting with presidium members Abdur Razzak and Tofail Ahmed, he said the two leaders have no grudges. Razzak and Tofail in their reform proposals had criticised Hasina for her "single leadership". "Now the Awami League will take all decisions in consultation with all." He said Hasina's name was not in the first information report (FIR) in the extortion case. "There is no proof either that she demanded toll. In an incident dating eight years back a case cannot be filed under the Emergency Power Rules. We will press on with legal battle." The party formed a committee with eight lawyers for freeing Hasina, Zillur said. The makeshift president said cases were filed against those who had wailed after Hasina's arrest but nothing was done to those who had brought out jubilant processions. He demanded withdrawal of the case. bdnews
