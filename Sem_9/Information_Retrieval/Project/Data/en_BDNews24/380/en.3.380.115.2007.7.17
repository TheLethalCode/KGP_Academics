 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks defied the Securities and Exchange Commission's warning by surging Tuesday. Pharmaceutical heavyweight Square Pharma rallied along with bank, insurance and cement shares amid rush buying. "I am worried. The market is heating up although there is no relationship with the earning potential of companies," Imtiyaz Husain, chairman of Imtiyaz Husain Securities, told bdnews24.com. "This surge could be absorbed if the supply of shares is increased," he said. His remarks came a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission warned small investors of potential losses due to the price of some issues being overvalued. The DGEN or general index rallied 49.44 points, equivalent to 2.19 percent, to a record high of 2298.85. The DSI or all-share price gained 39.93 points, equivalent to 2.16 percent, to end 1883.86. The DSE-20 blue chip index crossed the 2000 mark touching 2044.22 points, up 58.19 points, or 2.92 percent. Gainers outnumbered losers 123 to 63, with 22 issues finishing unchanged. Paced by Tk 235.40 million in block deals, turnover on the bourse reached a new high of Tk 2.39 billion, breaking the June 26 high of Tk 2.34 billion. "Certain shares are overvalued, creating an imbalance in the market. If investors switch from those shares some balance will be created," said DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan. Khan said the market is seeing a rise in demand for shares currently. "There is surplus liquidity in the economy now. The government should immediately take steps to increase the supply of shares to cool down that demand," he said. All major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied, inspired by price hikes in pharmaceutical and bank stocks. Turnover rose to Tk 310.06 million from Tk 286.60 million the previous day. Of the issues traded, 60 gained, 39 slumped and 10 held steady. Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS Bangladesh said: "It's ok. If we deduct the gain in Square Pharma shares, the price level appears normal." On the DSE, Square Pharma, the leader in turnover at Tk 245.29 million rallied 12.70 percent to Tk 4692, posting a 50 percent cash dividend and 50 percent stock divided from the previous day. The second top issue in turnover, BRAC Bank, climbed 4.16 percent to 818.75. It secured Tk 217.81 million in turnover. Southeast Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and Pubali Bank followed BRAC Bank. A buying spree pulled all the issues up. Southeast gained 0.09 percent to end Tk 156.75. Power Grid advanced 1.20 percent to Tk 589. Pubali Bank added 4.95 percent to end on Tk 825.75. bdn
