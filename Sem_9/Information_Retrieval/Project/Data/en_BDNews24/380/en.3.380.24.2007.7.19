 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Bank has announced a Tk 300 crore house loan refinance fund for banks to provide credit to low and middle income people seeking to purchase apartments in the country's six major cities and four municipal towns near Dhaka. From Thursday, those with a monthly income less than Tk 30,000 will be eligible for housing loans from banks and financial institutions to buy an apartment up to a maximum of 1,250 square feet, according to a circular issued by the central bank. The borrower will have to repay the money on a monthly basis at 10 percent interest, and is required to repay the total loan in 20 years. "It's a basic need for all. We have taken the initiative to meet growing demand for housing," BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters Wednesday. According to the circular, effective from Thursday, those seeking to buy or construct apartments in the six city corporation areas, Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, and the municipal areas of Tongi, Gazipur, Savar and Narayanganj, will be eligible to apply for the loans. "Economic activities should not be Dhaka centered. We have to decentralise to ensure a balanced economic growth," said Ahmed. According to the provisions of the facility, however, those who have already taken housing loans and own apartments or houses in these areas will be not be eligible under the present scheme. If their family members such as husband, wife or children own houses, they will not be eligible. Those working for companies that have housing loan schemes for their employees will also be ineligible for the loans, said the circular. The central bank will release the funds over a three-year period by distributing Tk 100 crore each year. Banks and financial institutions will receive the money from Bangladesh Bank under a refinance scheme with 5.0 percent interest. Banks with less than 10 percent classified loans will be eligible for the refinance scheme. Under the scheme, the refinance fund will cover 75 percent of the amount of the housing loan, while the remaining 25 percent will be borne by the lending bank or financial institution. bdn
