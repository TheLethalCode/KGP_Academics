<TITLE> Strauss gets lifeline as England make solid start </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Strauss survived one of the simplest catching chances he has ever offered against India on day one of the first test as he reached 43 at lunch and helped England to 115 for one at Lord's. Left-handed opener Strauss, without a test hundred for almost a year, mostly blunted the bowlers on the first morning in the three-match series as England took advantage of winning the toss in warm and sunny conditions perfect for batting. However, five minutes before lunch when on 43 he squirted a lofted drive to cover point fielder Dinesh Karthik -- a wicketkeeper converted into an opening batsman and outfielder. Karthik dropped the head height chance off the thick edge. Strauss's head drooped immediately after the shot and he gave the resigned look befitting a batsman who had thrown away a promising innings. But he was reprieved. Captain Michael Vaughan is unbeaten on 23. Alastair Cook was the only wicket to fall before the interval after he scored a breezy 36 off 39 balls. His wicket was a vital breakthrough for India as their bowlers began erratically and allowed England a pressure-free start. IMPORTANT WICKET It took the bowling of occasional medium-pacer Sourav Ganguly to trap Cook lbw, although replays suggested the ball had moved so much down the famous Lord's slope that it would have missed his off stump. It was an important wicket after the openers rattled along at a speedy rate that saw them put on 76 for the first wicket off just 88 deliveries. They registered the half-century in 52 balls. Left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan, the most experienced pace bowler in India's three-man attack and used to English conditions after his season with county team Worcestershire last year, struggled initially and was expensive. Zaheer was ruthlessly taken out of the attack by skipper Rahul Dravid after his third over had cost 14 runs, including two Cook boundaries to the leg side and four byes, wide down the leg side. Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, who opened the bowling from the Nursery End, was equally ineffective and was swapped to the Pavilion End after his first two overs. He struggled to control his natural outswing and allowed 35 runs off his first six overs. India have not won a test series in England for 21 years
