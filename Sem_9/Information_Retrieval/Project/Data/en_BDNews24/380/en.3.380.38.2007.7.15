<TITLE> Polls roadmap fails people's aspirations: Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury Sunday said the so-called election roadmap declared by the Election Commission failed to reflect people's aspirations. Terming the plan incomplete, Motia said they were not used to witness elections in a state of emergency. She made the statement after reporters sought her reaction to the roadmap. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Sunday declared the roadmap, spelling out that it would complete the planned electoral roll with photographs by October next year and hold the elections by December. Huda, however, said the elections could be held before the December-deadline if they were able to prepare the voter list earlier. He said the elections could be held under the emergency rule. Motia, known as a close aide to Hasina, said an election under the emergency rules would invite suffocation. "Why should the elections be held in a suffocating environment," she asked. The former agriculture minister was also not happy with the pace of the work in making the electoral roll. "One can rightfully be sceptic that the voter list will be complete within the declared timeframe," she said. Asked if she is refusing the roadmap, she said: "We are just giving our reactions to it, it is not a matter of refusing something." bdnews24.com
