 KUALA LUMPUR, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran fought back from two goals down secure a 2-2 draw with China in a pulsating Asian Cup Group C clash on Sunday. The battle of the group favourites lived up to its billing with China looking impressive in the first half before Iran's big-name players responded in style to outclass their opponents in the final 45 minutes. Shao Jiayi and Mao Jianqing gave China a 2-0 lead inside the first 33 minutes before Ferydoon Zandi pulled one back for Iran on the stroke of halftime and Javad Nekounam equalised midway through the second period. The result leaves China and Iran level on four points at the top of the group with the Chinese ahead on goal difference. Uzbekistan are third on three points with co-hosts Malaysia bottom of the standings following two losses. China deservedly took the lead after seven minutes when Shao converted a free-kick from 30 yards. The midfielder floated his shot over the wall and past Iran goalkeeper Hassan Roudbarian, who got a hand to the ball but was unable to keep it out. The goal stirred a lacklustre Iran into action with captain Mehdi Mahdavikia deciding to abandon his right back position in an attempt to strengthen the attack. FIRST ATTEMPT Just when it looked like Iran had China's measure, the 2004 Asian Cup runners-up doubled their lead. Zheng Zhi crossed from the right and found Mao free in the place where Mahdavikia would normally patrol. The striker had plenty of time to bring the ball down and crash his 12-yard shot past a diving Roudbarian. Iran refused to buckle and three minutes later had their first serious attempt on goal when Vahid Hashemian's sharp header from Mahdavikia's cross was saved by Li Leilei. In the 43rd minute, Mahdavikia had a sizzling 12-yard shot parried by Li as the west Asian side continued to press. However, Iran finally broke through as half-time approached when Mahdavikia touched a free kick to Zandi, who sent a curling 25-yard shot from the right beyond Li's grasp. China stunned their fans by coming out with a defensive formation for the second half with goal-scorer Mao and winger Wang Dong substituted. With their attacking options limited, China allowed Iran a lot of space in midfield as Reza Enayati and Rahman Rezaei both came close before Iran punished their opponents for their negativity with an equaliser in the 72nd minute. From a corner move, Mahdavikia floated the ball into the box and Nekounam sparked wild celebrations on the Iran bench by rising high to head the ball past Li into the right-hand corner. The group concludes on Wednesday when Iran take on Malaysia and China face Uzbekistan. The top-two will advance to the quarter-fina
