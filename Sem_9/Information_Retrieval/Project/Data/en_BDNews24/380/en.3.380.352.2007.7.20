 CHICAGO, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US judge on Thursday allowed former media baron Conrad Black to remain free on bond pending his sentencing later this year on last week's fraud and obstruction convictions. Judge Amy St. Eve of US District Court rejected arguments from prosecutors who said Black no longer had the assets to cover his $21 million bond and that an extradition agreement he made in a US court might not be enforceable in Canada, should Black, a 62-year-old member of Britain's House of Lords, return to his native country.
