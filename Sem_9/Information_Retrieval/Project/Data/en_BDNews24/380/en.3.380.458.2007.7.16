 TEHRAN, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's state television will broadcast a programme this week showing American-Iranians detained in the Islamic state for acting against national security and spying, the television station reported on Monday. It said comments by Haleh Esfandiari, a Middle East expert at the US-based Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, and Ali Tajbakhsh, urban planning consultant with George Soros' Open Society Institute, would be shown. Two other Iranian-Americans are accused of the same charges. One of them is free on bail but is banned from leaving the country. The other is in jail. The television station, run by hardline conservatives, repeatedly ran brief clips of the programme called "In the Name of Democracy".

Iran, which does not recognise dual nationalities, accuses Washington of using intellectuals to carry out what it calls a "soft or velvet revolution" using intellectuals and others to topple the Islamic state. The Society for Defending Prisoners' rights, a Non-Governmental Organisation, on Monday criticised "the illegal arrest of dissidents" in past months. "Hardline courts have jailed dozens of students, journalists and labour activists in the past months," it said in a statement faxed to Reuters. "These arrests are violation of human rights and should be stopped immediately." The arrests of the dual nationals have heightened tension between Iran and the United States which are already at odds over the Islamic state's disputed atomic work, which the West fears is aimed at building atom bombs.
