<TEXT>
 TORONTO, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Monday that it would buy Canada's DataMirror Corp for about $163.5 million, continuing its push to expand software revenue through acquisitions. IBM said it would buy all outstanding DataMirror common shares for C$27.00 cash each, or a total of C$170 million. The news sent DataMirror's shares soaring 18.7 percent, or C$4.20, to C$26.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in morning trade. The price marked a year high for DataMirror. DataMirror's technology helps companies capture and analyze data in real-time, identifying changes to databases and immediately alerting other computer programs of those changes. This gives those programs more current data. The Markham, Ontario, company's 2,200 customers include FedEx Ground, Priority Health, Tiffany & Co and Union Pacific Railroad. IBM said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter. ($1=$1.04 Canadia
