 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) - This is the first time Sheikh Hasina is behind bars. The authorities may call it a special jail. Yet she is a prisoner under the jail code. It has never occurred to the wife of a nuclear scientist and mother of two that politics would confine her. Born to the country's most high-profile political family, Hasina first experienced captivity in 1971 when the Pakistan army arrested her father and detained the rest of the family in a house in Dhaka. Bidding tearful goodbyes was a regular phenomenon in Hasina's life when law enforcers arrested her father in the 1950s and 1960s. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was in jail when his first child sobbed under the bridal costume in 1968. Brushing aside the sadness of imprisonment, Mujib's friends and comrades from Chittagong hosted Hasina's wedding reception and presented a Mazda 1500 Deluxe to the groom. Crowned as "Bangabandhu" thereafter, Sheikh Mujib became the father of the nation after independence in 1971. Hasina along with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana being abroad survived a military putsch in which much of the family was massacred in 1975. In their desperate move to save a collapsing Awami League, top leaders made Hasina the party chief in 1981 in her absence. The daughter of the slain independence leader returned home after six years to fortify the fort turning to house of cards. And she succeeded. Hasina first experienced confinement in 1984 when General HM Ershad put her under house arrest in February and in November. In March 1985, she was again put under house arrest for three months at a stretch. Critics did not forgive Hasina's participation in the farcical parliamentary election under the 0corrupt military dictator. Ershad was deposed by a mass upsurge in 1990 where Hasina's party also participated widely. Hasina lost the first election in 1991 but she made it in 1996 and lost again in 2001. She boycotted parliament while in opposition twice. The rival reciprocated when she was the prime minister. Hasina and her allies in opposition forced the rival BNP to amend the constitution and provision elections being held under caretaker government in 1996. Her party again took to the streets demanding further reforms to the caretaker government system in late 2006. Hasina and colleagues dominated the audience when advisors took oath to form an extended version of caretaker government in January. The Awami League and partners claim credit of this formation. Six months on, she was arrested on charges of extortion and fast ended up in jail. It has happened exactly two months before Hasina will celebrate her 60th birthday. She would bid tearful farewells to her father before he used to go with police. But the loved ones were not around when Hasina was taken away. Her daughter is not fit to travel. Perhaps her ailing husband wished her luck. Neither her son nor her sister cared or dared to be around. The former prime minister walked alone through the crowd of police and RAB officers and boarded a police car. This is the first time in her life she was going to jail. Her "cell" is few hundred metres away from the magnificent structure that Louis Kahn had designed passionately. It is not just a landmark but the nucleus of people power. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said, "Nobody is above the law." Let the law be above all prejudice. bdnews
