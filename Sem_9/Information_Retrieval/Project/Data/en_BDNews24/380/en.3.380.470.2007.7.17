<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Steve Harmison will miss the whole of the Test series against India because of surgery on a hernia. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Tuesday that Harmison was likely to be out for four to six weeks. The first Test begins on Thursday at Lord's. His place in the 13-man squad for the opener goes to Hampshire seamer Chris Tremlett. "He's going to have the operation later today," England coach Peter Moores said on the ECB Web site (www.ecb.co.uk). "Unfortunately for him the hernia has come back and now it's all about getting it done as quickly as possible." Harmison, who sustained the injury during the final Test against West Indies last month, had hoped to get through the India series before having surgery at the end of the season. The 28-year-old is now almost certain to miss Durham's first domestic final against Hampshire at Lord's on Aug. 18
