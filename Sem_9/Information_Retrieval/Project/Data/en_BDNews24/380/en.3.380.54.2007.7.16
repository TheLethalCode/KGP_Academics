 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese troops pushed deeper into a Palestinian refugee camp on Monday, seeking to finish an eight-week confrontation with al Qaeda-inspired militants during which at least 225 people have been killed. Troops battling Fatah al-Islam militants moved into Nahr al-Bared camp in north Lebanon on Sunday for the first time since fighting there erupted on May 20. The military lost its 100th soldier while doing so, and another four were killed overnight and on Monday, security sources said. At least 81 militants and 40 civilians have also been killed in the worst violence since Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. The toll included those killed in limited clashes in other parts of the country. The advance marked a major step for the army in the battle to crush the militants and a rare venture by troops into a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. A 1969 Arab agreement banned Lebanese security forces from entering Palestinian camps. The agreement was annulled by the Lebanese parliament in the mid-1980s but effectively remained in place. Commandos exchanged automatic rifle fire and grenades with militants in buildings and alleyways leading to the centre of Nahr al-Bared, while army artillery and tanks pounded other areas. Fearing booby-traps, troops blew up several buildings as they advanced towards the centre of the camp. Militants responded to the bombardment by firing about half a dozen Katyusha rockets at surrounding areas. The military has stepped up pressure on the besieged camp since Thursday, anxious not to get sucked into a war of attrition with the well-trained and well-armed militants. Fatah al-Islam is made up of a few hundred mainly Arab fighters who admit admiration for al Qaeda but claim no organisational links. Some of the fighters have fought in, or were on their way to, fight in Iraq. At least 10 of the dead militants were Saudis, security sources said. The majority of Nahr al-Bared's 40,000 refugees had fled in the early days of the fighting which has left the camp in ruins. The violence has further undermined stability in Lebanon, where an eight-month-old political crisis has been compounded by bombings in and around Beirut, the assassination of an anti-Syrian legislator and a fatal attack on UN peacekeepers. Lebanese politicians are meeting in France to discuss how to resume dialogue after months of political stalema
