 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  A string of small protests erupted in parts of Old Dhaka Monday after the arrest of Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina early in the morning, police and witnesses said. Protesters chanted slogans before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka in the city's old part after security officials tried to take Hasina away from the court. The first protest was reported at the court premises when the party supporters stopped the convoy carrying Hasina to a special jail. A group of protesters demonstrated and threw stones at security forces in Tantibazar area, who fired tear gas canisted and rubber bullets. At least 10 people were injured in the clashes as a trail of protests spread between Laxmibazar and Tantibazar. Three of the injured people were taken to the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. Police also detained some protesters but the exact number of the detainees could not be known immediately. Khandakar Muhituddin, deputy commissioner of police of Lalbagh zone, said they had to use force to douse the protests. Earlier, baffled supporters from the city's old part started converging at the court premises after Hasina was taken to the CMM's Court. Party activists from other nearby parts also streamed into the court but police prevented them from entering the court premises. Security was also tightened as people and onlookers were increasing in numbers by the minute. Many of the supporters chanted, "Joy Bangla" and "Joy Bangabandhu". At 7:45am a convoy driving Hasina reached the court. Police stopped a group of lawyers trying to enter the court area, sparking heated arguments. Former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru arrived at the scene but was barred from entering the court premises. "Why don't you open the points towards the court? Remember, nothing can bar people's entry to the court of law," Khasru shouted at the security officials. Advocate Sahara Khatun, an AL leader, then joined the protesting lawyers and the security forces at one point were compelled to open the gate and let them in. Many supporters begged permission of the officials to see their leader. Sabina Aktar Tuhin, a Jubo Mahila League leader, grabbed a police officer's feet and begged permission to go inside. Again, many tried to tear through the tight security net. At around 10:15am when Hasina was being taken to the jail with the court refusing her bail, supporters tried to put barricade on her way. RAB, police and other security personnel fought the surrounding crowd to ease their way out. The security convoy sped through towards Tantibazaar, when AL activists at Roy Sahib's Bazaar barricaded the road and tried to stop the motorcade. The officials used batons to clear their way. The convoy reached the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban area at 10:33am to leave the former prime minister at the makeshift jail. bdnews24.com/lh/ans/pc
