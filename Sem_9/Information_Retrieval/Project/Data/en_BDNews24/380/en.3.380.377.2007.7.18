<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)The police will 'soon' submit the chargesheet in an extortion case against Sheikh Hasina, as the investigation into the case is nearly complete, the Gulshan police chief said Wednesday. "About 80 percent of the investigation is complete," Obaidul Haq, officer in charge of Gulshan Police Station, told bdnews24.com. The remainder of the work, he said, would be finished after quizzing the former premier. "We will seek permission to interrogate Sheikh Hasina in a day or two," Haq said. The managing director of East Coast Limited, Azam J Chowdhury, filed the extortion case against Hasina on June 13. Security forces arrested the former prime minister at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16. A Dhaka court rejected her bail prayer and sent her to jail the same day. Hasina's cousin and former health minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim was made the prime accused in the case. It was alleged in the case that Selim in 2000 and 2001 extorted Tk 2.99 crore from the plaintiff in installments for government permission to set up a power plant in Siddhirganj, Narayanganj, when Hasina was in power. The plaintiff further said he had made the payments by cheque of Standard Chartered and Southeast banks. bdnews
