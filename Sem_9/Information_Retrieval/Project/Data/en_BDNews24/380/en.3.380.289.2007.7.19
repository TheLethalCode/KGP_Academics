<TEXT>
 ROME, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan have given up in their bid to sign strikers Samuel Eto'o and Ronaldinho from Barcelona, the Serie A club's vice-president said on Thursday. "Eto'o isn't moving from Barcelona and neither is Ronaldinho because they are not for sale," Adriano Galliani was quoted as saying on La Gazzetta dello Sport's Web site (www.gazzetta.it). Earlier on Thursday, newspapers in Italy said Milan had made an offer of 50 million euros ($69.01 million) for Eto'o but Galliani has denied the reports. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was thought to keen on signing the 26-year-old Cameroon striker, whose position at Barcelona looked less secure after Thierry Henry's arrival from Arsenal. "We've never made an offer of 50 million euros for Eto'o," said Galliani. "Milan's competitive as it is. We've got Ronaldo, (Filippo) Inzaghi, (Alberto) Gilardino and we've got Kaka. "For me, Kaka is a striker. He was top scorer in the Champions League"
