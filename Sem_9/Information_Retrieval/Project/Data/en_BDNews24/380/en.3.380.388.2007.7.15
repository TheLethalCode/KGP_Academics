 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) -- The IMF Sunday defended Bangladesh Bank's cautious monetary policy saying it will help control inflation by cutting demand. But it has agreed with local economists that cost factors are also pushing commodity prices up. "It's appropriate. We support it. We have earlier recommended taking a cautious monetary policy position. They (BB) felt the need as inflation is increasing," Jonathan C Dunn, resident representative of the International Monetary Fund, told a press briefing. His comment came a day after the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a local research group, accused the central bank of executing IMF's prescriptions on the tightening of monetary policy. The CPD said the move would be 'counterproductive' to inflation and claimed that it was soaringnot because of an increase in demand but because of a hike in the costs of commodities, a supply-side phenomenon that needs to be addressed by improving supply chain management. Bangladesh, like other neighbouring countries, has been weighing inflation. Monthly inflation declined to 8.02 percent in May from a nine-year high of 8.28 percent in April. "Obviously, there are cost-push factors. There is inflation in food commodities, particularly due to the rise in prices on the international market," Dunn said. "But there are also demand-side factors. The components of demand are not affected by food items, rather by non-food items and indicates that demand is increasing," he said, citing that inflation in Bangladesh has increased recently due to an increase in some non-foods. The IMF admitted that the increase in energy prices would put a negative impact on inflation. The multilateral lending agency earlier prescribed that the government should peg the prices of oil, gas and power with the international prices. The government also recently planned to raise energy prices. The CPD Saturday criticised the plan for implementing "donor prescriptions" and said it would be 'suicidal' if the government gave in to donors' pressure in a situation when inflation is soaring. On Sunday energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury dismissed the CPD observation as 'baseless'. "Nobody gave in to donors. It is the nation's interest which is always taken care of first. Prices will not be increased under pressure from any quarter," Chowdhury said. Defending its position, the IMF representative said: "Top 40 percent of consumers are the main beneficiaries of the subsidy. Bangladesh cannot afford to provide generalised subsidy." Dunn admitted that there would be an impact on inflation due to an increase in energy prices. "A special assistance will be needed to mitigate the impact on the poor people," he said. The IMF representative brushed aside the concerns of affecting the economy due to curbs on the credit outflows to the private sector, arguing that it still remains higher considering economic growth and inflation. Private-sector credit has grown about 16 percent last fiscal year. "It's still very high." IMF currently supports Bangladesh's economic reform programmes under a $490 million credit under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The fund has yet to release the last instalment under the PRGF due to the government's failure to restructure state-run banks and implement uniform taxpayer identification numbers by December last year, according to Dunn. bd
