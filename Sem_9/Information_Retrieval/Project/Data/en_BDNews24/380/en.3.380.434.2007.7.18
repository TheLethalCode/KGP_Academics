 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnew24.com) -- British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury Tuesday asked the caretaker government not to maltreat the detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The envoy told reporters that the UK wants Bangladesh government to behave with the Awami League chief. He said this when he was leaving the education ministry after meeting adviser Ayub Quadri. He also called upon the government to follow a proper legal procedure in handling the case against Hasina. On the polls roadmap delivered by the Election Commission, Choudhury said he hoped the elections would be held by December 2008 in line with the roadmap. bdnews
