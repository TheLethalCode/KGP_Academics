 PARIS, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Monday, climbing for a third consecutive session, with banks among biggest gainers after a group led by Royal Bank of Scotland revised its offer for Dutch bank ABN AMRO. ABN gained 3.4 percent, while Barclays, which has also made an offer for the Dutch financial group, rose 2.1 percent. The consortium kept its offer for ABN at 38.4 euros per share, but raised the cash component of the offer to 93 percent from about 79 percent before. "M&A activity is far from over, and it's buoyant in every sector," said Jean-Francois Virolle, chief strategist at Global Equities, in Paris. "So far, rising interest rates have had a limited impact, and it could take a while before we see the recent frenzy slowing down." At 0724 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent, at 1,629.
