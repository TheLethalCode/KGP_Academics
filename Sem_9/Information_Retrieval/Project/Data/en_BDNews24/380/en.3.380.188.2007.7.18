<TITLE> Tour about giving and taking, insists United's Ferguson </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson defended his club's Asian tour, insisting the Premier League champions were not simply about filling their own pockets. "It's not just about us taking. We also give," Ferguson said after United conceded a late goal for a 2-2 draw against J-League champions Urawa Reds in Saitama on Tuesday. United have faced fierce criticism from Asian Football Confederation (AFC) President Mohamed Bin Hammam for scheduling their tour during the Asian Cup, a view supported by FIFA boss Sepp Blatter. None of United's games coincide with match days during the AFC's showpiece tournament, which ends on July 29, but United had to cancel a game in Kuala Lumpur after the AFC refused to sanction it. "It's unfortunate that the Asian Cup is on when we were free to come to the Far East," Ferguson said. "Of course, every second year you have the European Championship or World Cup, so we have to take the opportunity when it's there, which is this year. Unfortunately, the Asian Cup was at the same time." "This is an opportunity for fans to see their favourite players play in the flesh," Ferguson said. MONEY-SPINNING Ferguson said players did more than turn out for money-spinning friendlies, committing great time to charitable causes. "Of course, there are other contributions we try to make when we come to the Far East," he said. "Some of the players yesterday visited a school for the blind and others went to a hospital. We also bring our soccer school here to contribute to young players in the region. "It's very important for Manchester United to give our knowledge and time to particular causes." While such tours make millions of dollars for clubs like United, the friendly games are also valuable sources of revenue for the clubs they visit. Over 58,000 fans turned up in cold wet conditions to watch United play the J-League champions on Tuesday. United also launched three new websites for its fans in east Asia. The websites are in Japanese (www.manutd.jp), Korean (www.manutd.kr) and Simplified Chinese (www.manunited.com.cn). United will play FC Seoul in the South Korean capital on Friday before heading to China for games against Shenzhen FC on July 23 and Guangzhou Pharmaceutical FC on July 27
