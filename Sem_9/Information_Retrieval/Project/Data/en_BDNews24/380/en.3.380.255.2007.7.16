<TITLE> Libya to decide fate of foreign medics in HIV case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TRIPOLI, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libya's top judiciary body has postponed until Monday evening its meeting to decide the fate of six foreign medics sentenced to death for infecting Libyan children with the AIDS virus, officials and lawyers said. "The High Judicial Council has put off its meeting from 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) to 6 p.m. (1600 GMT)," said Othman Bizanti, a leading lawyer, adding "We submitted demands for a full pardon of the six medics." Government officials also confirmed the postponement but neither they nor the lawyers gave an explanation. Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor were imprisoned in Libya eight years ago and sentenced to die for infecting 426 Libyan children with the virus that causes AIDS while working at a children's hospital in the city of Benghazi. The six say they are innocent and were tortured into confessing. Some Western scientists say negligence and poor hygiene were the real culprits and that the infections started before the foreign medics arrived at the hospital. Relatives of the children have said the infections were part of a Western attempt to undermine Muslims and Libya. Libya's Supreme Court last week upheld the death sentences, placing the medics' fate in the hands of the High Judicial Council, which is controlled by the government and has the power to commute sentences or issue pardons. European Union governments are hopeful the six will be set free after successful negotiations with an association of families to reach a financial settlement. Both sides have suggested agreement is close, and Libya has hinted it could free the nurses if an accord is reached. The families have asked for compensation of 10 million euros ($13.3 million) for each infected child's family -- "blood money" under which Islamic law lets victims' relatives withdraw death sentences in return for reparations. The EU refuses to accept the idea of compensation, which would imply the medics were guilty, but has offered a fund to pay for the children's future care. Libyan officials say the Council could take several sessions to reach a final decision and will only agree to the release of the nurses if a settlement had been reached in the private talks between the families and the EU. "The Council will take into consideration several factors like compensation, the age and the time spent by the prisoners in jail," Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdel-Rahman Shalgam told reporters last week. Libya returned to international mainstream politics in 2003 after decades of isolation when it scrapped its programme of prohibited weapons. Washington said last week it was sending the first U.S. ambassador to Tripoli in nearly 35 years, but failure to free the medics could carry a heavy diplomatic cost for Libyan leader Muammar Gadda
