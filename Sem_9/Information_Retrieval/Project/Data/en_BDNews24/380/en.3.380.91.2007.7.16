 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) The new chairman of the National Sports Council, army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, has emphasised the need to create a bridge between sports and education to create an environment in which sports can flourish. "We have to encourage the new generation to sports, which is a part of education, and education remains incomplete without sports," Moeen told reporters Monday after a meeting with NSC officials on his first day as chairman. To create a congenial atmosphere for developing sporting talent among the new generation, the NSC boss asked officials to open all stadiums across the country to utilise them to their maximum potential. The army chief believes such talent would come from the grass-roots level if sport is encouraged at that level. Speaking of success in sports at international level, he said: "We should not only be confined to the country level, we have to establish ourselves at international level as the players are ambassadors of a country." "However, we have to work in those areas that hold a bright prospect for us," he said, adding that the most of the current sports budget would be spent on athletes to improve their standards. After a three-hour meeting with NSC officials, the new chairman said he realised that the sports arena is affected by politics, corruption and nepotism but he sought cooperation to resurrect the sporting arena. Referring to the nation's recent defeat in cricket in Sri Lanka, he said: "It is disgraceful to concede innings defeats in all three tests (against Sri Lanka) and I am sure that like me you are all as Bangladeshis dismayed and sad at the loss." bdnews
