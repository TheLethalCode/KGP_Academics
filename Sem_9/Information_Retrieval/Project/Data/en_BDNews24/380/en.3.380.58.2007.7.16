<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - MP Boris Johnson threw his hat into the ring to become London mayor on Monday, promising to put the smile back on Londoners' faces and giving his Conservative Party a real shot at unseating Ken Livingstone in May 2008. Johnson, the flamboyant MP for Henley who has become a household name thanks to frequent television appearances and verbal blunders, must first win an internal ballot but he is expected to be the likely frontrunner of Tory hopefuls. "London is an outstandingly varied and beautiful place and it deserves a proper debate. I want to bring fresh ideas to the capital and offer a new direction for Londoners," said Johnson, 43, confirming his candidacy for one of the most high-profile jobs in British politics. "Even the greatest cities have further greatness in them. I will stand for a greater London and for putting the smile back on London's face," he added in a statement. In an interview with London's Evening Standard, keen cyclist Johnson criticised Livingstone over the extended "bendy" buses that threatened to "scrape to a paste" cyclists and for failing to tackle the sweltering conditions on the capital's underground. The Eton and Oxford-educated MP promised to champion the arts and tackle crime. The Conservatives will shortlist between two and five candidates next week from a selection of hopefuls. Ballot papers will be sent out in early September and the name of the winner will be announced at the end of that month. The London mayoral election will take place on May 1, 2008. Critics deride Johnson as a buffoon but his decision to stand bolsters the Conservatives' chances of defeating Livingstone, who has held the office since its creation in 2000, and promises a lively, colourful race. The party had attempted to woo former BBC Director General Greg Dyke and former Conservative prime minister John Major but both declined to stand. Johnson could benefit from name and face recognition thanks to his trademark tousled fair hair, his comical appearances on TV quiz panels including "Have I Got News For You" and a series of gaffes that have put him in the media spotlight. He was forced to apologise to the people of Liverpool in 2004 after accusing them of wallowing "in a sense of vicarious victimhood" following the murder in Iraq of hostage Ken Bigley. He caused similar outrage when he called the people of Papua New Guinea "cannibals". Livingstone himself is no stranger to gaffes but he has been praised for improving London's bus services, helping to bring the 2012 Olympics to the capital and introducing the traffic congestion charge. Livingstone was elected London mayor in 2000, having been expelled from the Labour Party for running as an independent candidate. He was readmitted to Labour in 2004, shortly before re-election as mayor. Johnson has now resigned his post as Conservative education spokesman but will remain MP for Henley. He will give up his parliamentary seat if he is elected may
