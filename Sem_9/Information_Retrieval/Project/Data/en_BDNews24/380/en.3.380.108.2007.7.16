 SYDNEY, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When it comes to their mobile phones, Australians have some serious hang ups, according to a new study.

"Rather than fragmenting time, our study suggests that mobile phone practices are strengthening and deepening relationships and building durable social bonds," she added. The study is part of an ongoing three-year project and has so far analyzed responses from an online survey, which required participants to keep a phone log of their most recent calls and text messag
