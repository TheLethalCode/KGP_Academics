 UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Europeans on the UN Security Council intend to announce their plans on the future status of Kosovo on Friday, giving Russia another day to clarify its position, the US ambassador said. At issue, is a draft resolution, sponsored by European members of the council and the United States, that Russia says paves the way to Kosovo's independence from Serbia through the back door. Asked when a decision would be taken on a vote, US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad told reporters on Thursday, "The clarifying moment will be tomorrow where Russia stands, whether Russia will allow the Security Council to move forward on this or not." Moscow, an ally of Belgrade which opposes independence for Kosovo, has said clearly the resolution is unacceptable. But its UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, has not officially told council members he would cast a veto. "There's a firm intention to veto but they're not prepared to say that yet," one European council member said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No resolution means that Western nations would go outside of the Security Council in their quest to move the breakaway Serbian province toward supervised independence under the European Union rather than the United Nations. Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million people are ethnic Albanians, has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombs forced out Serbian troops that were killing and expelling Albanians in a two-year war with guerrillas. One probable scenario is that the Contact Group of advisers on the Balkans, which includes Europeans, the United States and Russia, would facilitate 120 days of renewed negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, as called for in the draft resolution. No resolution is needed for holding such talks but the Security Council would have to approve any withdrawal of the United Nations from Kosovo, which would need Russia's consent, thereby pushing the issue into the future. Another way to remove the United Nations from Kosovo, European diplomats said, was for Pristina to eventually declare independence, ask the United Nations to leave and invite the Europeans into the province. Independence would depend on how many countries would recognize Kosovo as a nation. Under the draft resolution, the two sides would resume negotiations for 120 days. But the main point is that after the talks the United Nations would hand over the administration of the province to the European Union, removing the issue from Russia's influence. NATO troops would stay on. Churkin said on Monday the United Nations should stay in place, negotiations should continue until a solution was found and the new institutional arrangements in the draft paved the way for independence of Kosovo through the back door. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Lisbon, said on Thursday Kosovo would get its independence from Serbia "one way or another." "The United States is absolutely committed to that," Rice told reporters traveling with her to Lisbon for a meeting of the quartet of Middle East mediato
