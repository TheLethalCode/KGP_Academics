<TITLE> Dunga shows he has the coach's knack </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dunga's appointment as Brazil coach after last year's World Cup was greeted with scepticism by many because he had no previous experience. Less than one year later, however, the captain of Brazil's 1994 World Cup winning side has already bagged his first title as coach -- the Copa America -- and shown he has the knack of making the right decisions. Brazil muscled their way to a 3-0 win over Argentina in Sunday's final despite having captain Gilberto Silva suspended and losing his replacement Elano to injury after half an hour. Although Elano had been playing a midfield role, Dunga chose Daniel Alves, nominally a right back, to replace him and it worked a treat. Within 10 minutes of coming on, Daniel Alves provided a teasing inswinging cross from the right which pressured Argentina captain Roberto Ayala to put through his own goal for Brazil's second. Midway through the second half, Daniel Alves himself converted the third goal as he coolly scored from Vagner Love's pass. "Daniel Alves has played in that position for his club, he has speed, he is strong and he can shoot from outside the area," explained Dunga afterwards. "I thought he could exploit the left side of the Argentina defence, where they were having problems." GARISH SHIRTS Dunga has already experienced the trials of coaching the five-times world champions. Initially, he made more of an impression for wearing garish shirts -- designed by his daughter who is a fashion student -- on the touchline as Brazil played a series of friendlies. But when Brazil went into the tournament on the back of a dreary 0-0 draw with Turkey and began by losing 2-0 to Mexico, Dunga quickly found himself under fire. Despite winning their next two group games against Chile and Ecuador, the criticism continued because Dunga fielded three players considered as defensive in midfield -- Gilberto Silva, Josue and Mineiro. Typically, Dunga stuck by the trio and was rewarded with a 6-1 win over Chile in the quarter-final. He also insisted that his team was not defensive, a point which appeared to be proved as they drew 2-2 with Uruguay -- before winning on penalties -- and beat Argentina 3-0. "In each of our games, we have created six or seven clear scoring chances," he said after Sunday's win. Their style, however, is far from the artistry for which Brazil were once known. Instead, Brazil have powered their way through the Copa America, combining physical strength and Germanic efficiency in attack. They are not ashamed to use strong-arm tactics either and on Sunday committed 37 fouls on their way to demolishing Argentina
