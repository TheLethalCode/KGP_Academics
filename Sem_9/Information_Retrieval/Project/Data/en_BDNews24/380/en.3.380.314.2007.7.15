 LONDON, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncapped Leicestershire fast bowler Stuart Broad was on Sunday named in England's 13-man squad to face India in the first test with Steve Harmison a doubtful starter. The 21-year-old Broad, son of former England opening batsman Chris, is likely to make his debut at Lord's on Thursday with Harmison struggling to overcome a hernia problem. "At this stage his chances of playing are slim and the choice for the final pace bowling position will be between James Anderson and Stuart Broad," chairman of selectors David Graveney said. "They are different types of bowlers and the final decision will depend on our assessment of the pitch and the weather conditions at Lord's. "It may mean that we have to go into this series with a relatively inexperienced attack, but I am sure all of the bowlers concerned will relish the opportunity to test themselves against a side which has one of the strongest batting line-ups in world cricket." The selectors have kept faith with opener Andrew Strauss, who struggled in the 3-0 series victory over West Indies. Michael Vaughan will again captain the side. England squad: Michael Vaughan (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Stephen Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Matthew Prior, Ryan Sidebottom, Andrew Strauss
