<TEXT>
 Natore, July 18 (bdnews24.com) A 70-year-old widow in Natore has been fasting since Wednesday morning to protest Sheikh Hasina's arrest. Jira Bibi told bdnews24.com Wednesday that she considers each member of Bangabandhu's family as her own. She said she would continue her hunger strike until Hasina is freed. "I have supported the family of Bangabandhu all my life, I'll support them until my death. I don't understand why police arrested the girl (Hasina)," Jira Bibi said. It would have never happened if her father had been alive today, she added. "Ever since I heard of her arrest, I cannot sleep at night. I won't take any food until she is free," the widow said. Her neighbour Asaduzzaman said: "Jira Bibi is a diehard supporter of Awami League." Both of her sons, Kala and Manik, are also supporters of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, he added. "The family has suffered for their unquestioning support of Awami League. Islamic extremists hung her grandson from a banyan tree and mercilessly beat him for this reason. Even so, they have never weakened in their support," the neighbour said. Since Wednesday morning, Jira Bibi had kept her protest a secret to anyone outside her family. However, the news had spread to the district town by afternoon. People have been visiting her village since Wednesday evening to persuade her to take some food. bdnews24.
