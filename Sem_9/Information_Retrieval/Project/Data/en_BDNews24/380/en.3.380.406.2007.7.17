<TITLE> Cambodia clamps down on Christian missionaries </TITLE>

 PHNOM PENH, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Predominantly Buddhist Cambodia has barred Christian missionaries from door-to-door proselytizing and handing out leaflets, saying it disturbs people's lives and could create "insecurity in society". A Ministry of Cults and Religions edict obtained by Reuters on Tuesday also prohibited the use of cash or other incentives to get people to convert to Christianity. "All activities disseminating Christianity in public are banned," said the order, which could place unprecedented restrictions on the many Christian groups operating in the war-scarred southeast Asian nation. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose young white-shirted Mormon volunteers are seen regularly cycling around the capital, admitted some missionary groups many employ underhand tactics but denied any wrongdoing on its behalf. "I think there are some breaches of those rules happening in the country, but not by us," Cambodian mission head Robert Winegar said, without giving details. "I don't see the action of our missionaries disturbing anyone. Our missionaries do not force any one and we do not pay people to come to our church," he said. Deputy Cults and Religions Minister Sun Kim Hun said some missionaries working in the provinces had tricked children into converting to Christianity by offering them sugar and money. "This is against Buddhism, which is unacceptable," he said. Most of Cambodia's 13 million people are Theravada Buddhist. Its Muslim and Christian minorities are largely tolerated, although a house church near the Vietnam border was ransacked in 2003 by villagers blaming Christians for a drought
