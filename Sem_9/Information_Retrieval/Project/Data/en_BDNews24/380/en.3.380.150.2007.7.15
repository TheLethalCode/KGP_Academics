 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar Sunday said he was not "officially" aware that President Iajuddin Ahmed is away from Bangladesh. In an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com, the Speaker said: "I have read the news in newspapers. As newspapers are not legal documents, I assume that he is present (in the country)." Iajuddin arrived in Singapore early Sunday for a routine medical check-up. During the five-day visit, he would also see Singapore President SR Nathan. In case of President's absence, Sircar said, the government should publish a gazette to perpetuate article 54 of the constitution. He referred to the constitutional provision that says the Speaker will act as President during his absence. "If a vacancy occurs in the office of the President or if the President is unable to discharge the functions of his office on account of absence, illness or any other cause, the Speaker shall discharge those functions until a President is elected or until the President resumes the functions of his office, as the case may be," according to the constitution. He said, "Publishing a gazette is an act of practice to perpetuate the article 54." "The gazette is not a necessity if there is a will by the government to follow the article 54," Sircar further said. Earlier on May 24, 2006, Iajuddin was taken to Singapore and he underwent a successful bypass heart operation at Mount Elizabeth Hospital there. He had stayed in the city state for 44 days to July 6, 2006. Sircar told bdnews24.com that he had acted as President during Iajuddin's absence at the time. "A gazette had been published as well," he said. bdnews24.
