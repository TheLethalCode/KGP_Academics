 JERUSALEM, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert faced fresh criticism on Wednesday of his handling of a war in Lebanon, as a state audit accused him of failing to adequately protect Israeli civilians from rocket attacks. In a scathing report Israel's comptroller Micha Lindenstraus said Olmert and his deputies had "failed gravely in decision making" by not considering how Hezbollah's rockets could paralyse northern Israel when it launched a war last July 12. Close to a million Israelis living near the border with Lebanon were "not substantively protected against missile strikes" rained by the guerrillas, though Israeli officials had foreseen the risk of such attacks, the report says. Bomb shelters were lacking or inadequate and emergency measures were not organised in advance of the fighting Israel launched in response to Hezbollah's capture of two soldiers in a cross-border raid, it adds. Those Israeli towns populated mostly by Arab citizens, where rockets fired from Lebanon also struck, had virtually no shelters at all at their disposal, the report says. "The serious failings unfortunately amounted to abject failure in the handling of the civilian home front during the war." Some 1,200 Lebanese and 157 Israelis, most of them soldiers, were killed in the 34 day of fighting that ended in mid-August with a United Nations-brokered truce. Olmert's office responded to the comptroller by detailing the government's efforts made since the war to improve Israel's emergency readiness. Olmert also accused the comptroller of shooting "poison arrows" by singling him out for failures for which previous Israeli governments also were to blame. Olmert's popularity has already plummeted over public criticism of the war's failure to crush Hezbollah or halt its rocket attacks. A state commission accused him of "a serious failure" in decision-making during the war in a report last April, triggering calls for his resignation that Olmert has so far rebuffed. The panel's final report is due out by Octob
