 NEW YORK, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sony Pictures Entertainment said on Monday it is relaunching its online video site as a space for up-and-coming actors, directors and producers to post clips that could eventually be turned into films or TV shows. Sony Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp, bought the Grouper online video site last August for $65 million and is now renaming it Crackle in an effort to reposition the site as a streaming entertainment network with channels on animation, horror and other genres.

Last October, Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company, sued Grouper for copyright infringement, saying it had allowed users to swap pirated versions of its artists' videos. Sony Pictures -- which also owns movie and animation studios, as well as television assets -- responded in November with a legal filing saying its video site was fully compliant with the Digital Millennium Copyright Ac
