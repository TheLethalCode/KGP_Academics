<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  The pro-reform leaders in the BNP Wednesday urged Khaleda Zia not to say anything that could break up the party. They said they wanted reform to practise more democracy, not to divide the party. Those who speak of division are pushing the BNP towards a split, joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain told reporters after meeting secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home in the noon. "We have trust and respect for chairperson Khaleda Zia. She is terming the reformists conspirators, which is not right. "We want welfare of the party, she also wants unity in the party. So she should not say anything that may could create rift in the party. We also will not do so either," Ashraf said. Replying to a question suggesting the BNP chairperson's possible arrest, he said, "Why should she be arrested?" He said the groundwork for the council meeting was on and it might be held after August. BNP chairperson's adviser retired major general ZA Khan told journalists those who do not want reform do not want welfare of the party. He said Khaleda's observation that a conspiracy was on in the party was personal. The leaders and workers do not expect such remarks, which equated reform moves in the party to conspiracy, he said. "All of us in the party are for reform. The chairperson herself also wants reform. So why she is saying this she knows better." On the possibility of the former prime minister's arrest, he said, "There is no case against the chairperson. Why should she be arrested?" Former party lawmakers and district leaders from Bogra, Sylhet, Sirajganj, Madaripur, Faridpur, Noakhali and Sunamganj met the secretary general in the morning. bdnews24
