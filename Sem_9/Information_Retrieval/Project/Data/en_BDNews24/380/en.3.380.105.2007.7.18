 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman Wednesday said that there was no division anymore in the party since the so-called reformists have joined hands with him in an imminent struggle to save the party. He said they reached a consensus in a meeting with presidium members Abdur Razzak and Tofail Ahmed at his Gulshan home. Razzak, a former water resources minister during Sheikh Hasina's term in 1996-2001 as prime minister, also told bdnews24.com that there had never been misunderstandings. "The two leaders came to see me after I invited them. There was a misunderstanding among us. Now everything is solved. From now on we'll work together, we'll take the party ahead with common decisions," Zillur told bdnews24.com. Razzak echoed Zillur. "He (Zillur) is right. Tofail Ahmed and I went to see him and discussed the whole thing," he told bdnews24.com by phone after the news spread fast across the political spectrum. "There's no misunderstanding among us." There was some confusion because of some misquoted media reports, Razzak said without elaboration. The new development came three days after Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was arrested and sent to jail on extortion charges after months of tumultuous infighting in the 58-year-old political camp. Razzak and Tofail separately placed a set of reform proposals, accusing Hasina of authoritarian leadership in running the party. Another presidium member, Amir Hossain Amu, was also critical of the leader but later said everything will be done under the leadership of Hasina. The arrest of Hasina sparked a wave of shock among the party leaders and activists, prompting the leaders to term the arrest "politically motivated and shameful". The government denied the allegations and said she was arrested on a specific charge, and the law would take its own course. Small-scale protests continued for a third day Wednesday to demand release of the former prime minister. bdnews24.com/
