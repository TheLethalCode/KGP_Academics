<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said former prime minister Sheikh Hasina would be tried in open court in line with the law. She would be released if she was proved innocent, the adviser told reporters at his secretariat office at noon. "We hold no grudge against anybody. Neither do we have any political ambition. But it can't be that those who plundered people's wealth would not be tried." He said Hasina was arrested after charges were pressed against her in an extortiton case filed with Gulshan Police Station. Other accused in the case have already been arrested. Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim also confessed to the charges, the adviser said. The case has been investigated under Emergency Powers Rules for quick disposal. Mainul said if the charges were pressed under Emergency Powers Rules Hasina would then have to be shown as absconding, which was not possible. He said allegations agsinst the former prime minister were proved in the primary investigation. On whether most recent prime minister Khaleda Zia would also be arrested in any such case, the adviser said, "We are not filing any case. Individuals and Anti-corruption Commission are filing cases. "If there is any allegation against her, a case may be filed and she may be arrested." On protests after Hasina's arrest, "Law must be allowed to take its own course. The government is working to establish the rule of law. Besides, the country is now under the state of emergency." He ducked questions on how Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid, also sued for corruption, could sneak out of the country. Earlier in the morning, Mainul said the government had arrested Hasina on specific charges. "I've come to know that Sheikh Hasina was arrested on as number of charges. Awami League leaders and activists also extended their support to the government in its efforts to prosecute Hasina on various charges," Mainul told bdnews24.com over phone. His remarks came after security forces took Hasina away from her home. "All these matters including her arrest are related to the home ministry. I'll let you know the details after obtaining more information," he said. When contacted over phone, home secretary Abdul Karim did not want to make any comment on the arrest. "I will not make any comment related to Sheikh Hasina." bdnews24.com/ehb/ahd/gn
