<TEXT>
 TORONTO, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chef Susur Lee is a Hong Kong-born Canadian chef who has won international acclaim with his modern Asian-influenced food but detests the now widely-used term 'fusion' to describe Asian food Lee began his career as an apprentice at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong and came to Toronto in 1978. Lee operates two restaurants, Susur and Lee, which are located next to each other King Street West in Toronto. He spoke to Reuters after cooking: Q: Who or what sparked your interest in food?

I think he understands Asian culture, Asian food, it's something that is communicated through that culture that I respect. So I would say he's the man that I really respect his cooking and his philosophy." Q: Do you have one piece of essential equipment? A: "I like really sharp knives. Like, really sharp knives. Without really sharp knives you can't cut things properly, you can't cook things properly, or know what is right, what is wrong. The steel and the sides of the blade...the act of cutting, it plays such a big role in food." Q: Any tips for home chefs? A: "Get some really good pots and pans.
