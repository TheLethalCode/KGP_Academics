<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) - A sparkling unbeaten 93 from Aftab Ahmed powered Bangladesh to an exciting three-wicket win over the Sri Lanka Invitation XI in the lone practice match Wednesday before the three-match ODI series that begins Friday. The tigers raced to 242 for seven in 49.3 overs in reply to the hosts' 241 for five in 50 overs at the Police Park ground, Colombo. Aftab blunted the opponent bowlers to take the side home with three balls to spare after they were reduced to 177 for five in 40 overs, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). Opener Tamim Iqbal laid a solid foundation scoring 45 runs before Bangladesh faced a recognised hiccup with being reduced to 118 for five at one stage. Mushfiqur Rahim (27), Farhad Reza (26) and Saqib Al Hasan (16) supported Aftab in the middle before opener Shahriar Nafees, skipper Mohammad Ashraful and Tushar Imran fell with only a few runs. Nafees, who got back to his ODI place after scoring 64 in the second innings of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka in Kandy, struck a duck while Ashraful and Tushar hit nine runs each. The Sri Lankan side decided to bat first and went beyond the 200-mark riding on fifties from Upal Tharanga and Daniel before Syed Rasel and Saqib each took two wickets. Upal Tharanga remained unbeaten on 64 while Daniel scored 58 runs. Lasith Fernando chipped in with 23 runs. Bangladesh had a good warm-up match before the one-dayer series after they were whitewashed in the three-match Test series against Sri Lanka. The visitors left opener Javed Omar, Shahadat Hossain and Mehrab Hossain Jr out from the playing- 12 of the practice match. The first ODI of the Laqshya series is at the P Sara Stadium July 20. The second and third matches will be held at the R Premadasa Stadium July 23 and 25 respectively.
