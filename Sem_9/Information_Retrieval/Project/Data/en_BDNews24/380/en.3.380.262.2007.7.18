 KABUL, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber hit a Turkish diplomatic convoy near the Afghan capital on Wednesday, wounding at least one Afghan civilian , police said, and shots were fired at one of the vehicles, wounding a Turkish guard. Hours after the attack, another suicide bomber, blew himself up inside the main police station in the southeastern town of Khost, police and residents said. There was no immediate report of any casualties from the second attack, but ambulances were seen entering the compound. A second suicide bomber, disguised in an army uniform and armed with a gun, shot dead two police at the gate of the compound before being killed by police, residents said. Afghanistan is going through its bloodiest phase of violence in the past 18 months, the worst since Taliban's removal from power in 2001. Also on Wednesday, six Afghan police in the southern province of Zabul and a Filipino road engineer and Afghan guard were killed in two separate ambushes in the southeastern province of Paktia, provincial police officials said. After the blast in Kabul, shots were fired at a damaged armoured vehicle in the convoy, wounding one Turkish guard, a Turkish embassy official said. NATO troops blocked off the site of the blast, on a main road leading out to the west of Kabul, soon after the attack. Afghanistan's ousted Taliban claimed responsibility for all of the attacks. Kabul has been the scene of a series of roadside blasts and suicide raids in recent months against Afghan and foreign troops. But Wednesday's shooting after the attack on the convoy was the first of its kind in the capital. It also came hours after three rockets exploded in a field inside the city, police said. There were no casualties or damage from the rockets. Inspired by insurgents in Iraq, the Taliban and their allies largely rely on roadside bombs and suicide attacks as part of their campaign to overthrow the government and drive out foreign troops from the count
