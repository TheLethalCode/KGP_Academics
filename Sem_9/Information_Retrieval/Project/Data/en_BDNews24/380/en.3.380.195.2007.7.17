 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) Sheikh Russel KC thrashed Muktijoddha Sangsad 3-0 in the second-leg match of the B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium Tuesday. Moroccan striker Touati Youness, substitute Masud Parvez Kaiser and Lutfar Rahman Nayan scored one goal apiece in the second half after a barren first half. Sheikh Russel, who are out of the title race, raised their point tally to 32 from 18 matches, six points behind league leaders Dhaka Abahani Limited, who have played 17 matches. Muktijoddha Sangsad, who are also out of the running after losing 2-1 to Arambagh KS in their previous match, remained on 33 points from 19 matches and they have only one match left against Dhaka Abahani. Sheikh Russel, who defeated the same rivals 2-1 in a first-leg match, controlled the midfield over the 'internally feuding' Muktijoddha Sangsad and came close to scoring twice in the first 20 minutes, but their efforts narrowly went in vain. After the breather, Sheikh Russel launched the attack again, but Muktijoddha goalie Titumir Chowdhury foiled a powerful shot from Maksudul Islam Bulbul taken at the edge of the box five minutes into the second half. Muktijoddha came close to breaking the deadlock in the 59th minute, but striker Rokonuzzaman Khanchan's ball floated over the open net as Sheikh Russel goalie SM Shakil lay on the field after failing to stop a long-range shot from Brahim Bozziber. Touati finally broke the deadlock in the 74th minute for Sheikh Russel with a fierce shot inside the box after capitalizing on a back pass from Bulbul, and Kaiser doubled the margin ten minutes later as Muktijoddha goalkeeper slipped trying to stop a through pass by Saad Abdelfetah. Nayan, set up by Saad, sealed the victory with a left-footer in stoppage time. bdn
