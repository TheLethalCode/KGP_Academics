 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina now detained in a special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex spent half of the day reading newspapers and books, a senior prisons official said Tuesday. Five newspapers were supplied to Hasina Tuesday morning: Dainik Amar Desh, Manavjamin, Dainik Ittefaq, Kara Barta and an English daily. She was given bread, cheese, vegetables and tea for breakfast and rice, meat, vegetables and fish curry for lunch. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "Sheikh Hasina is doing well. A jail doctor has examined her health." Siddiqui said Hasina had been provided with food in line with her entitlement as a first class division holder detainee. Meanwhile, Hasina was given physiotherapy, administered by physiotherapist Lutfa Ali. Awami League's forest and environment secretary and Sheikh Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud said: "Physiotherapy was administered after her appeal." He said he had spoken to the DIG (prisons), who said Hasina was keeping well. Earlier, IG (prisons) Brigadier General Md Zakir Hasan who met Hasina told reporters, "Sheikh Hasina is well. I asked her if she was enjoying all facilities. Sheikh Hasina was given all facilities that are entitled to a first-class division holder detainee." She has a TV set in her quarters. She will be able to watch only BTV broadcasts. There are a bed, a table and chairs in her room. A mosquito net has also been supplied. Zakir ducked a question on whether there was an air cooler in her room. After Hasina was taken to the special-jail, a radio set and her clothes were reached to jail authorities from Sudha Sadan Monday evening. Police arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home Monday morning in an extortion case filed with Gulshan Police Station. A Dhaka court rejected a bail prayer and sent her to jail. bdnews24.com/
