<TEXT>
 HAVANA, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Moore's new documentary film 'SiCKO' has given Cuba's free health system its best publicity since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, a Cuban doctor who hosted the filmmaker's visit said on Monday. Moore took eight Americans sickened after volunteering for the September 11, 2001, rescue efforts for free treatment in Cuba in March in order to extol the Communist state's universal care in his film, which attacks the US health system for being driven by profits and leaving millions uninsured.

Stopping at a pharmacy, one member of the group bought a refill for his inhaler at the highly subsidized price of one Cuban peso, equivalent to 5 US cents. "Give me a thousand," Moore joked to the attendant, saying the same medication cost $50 in the United States, Davis said. Davis, a surgeon now working for the Health Ministry's international affairs office, said Moore's group left with 'improved health,' but gave no details. Free and universal health care and education are considered the major achievements of the socialist system built by Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Cuban hospitals are often crumbling and badly lit, and lack equipment and medicines. But the health system, using the resources of a developing country. has produced results on par with rich nations'. The number of children dying before their fifth birthday is seven per 1,000 live births in Cuba, versus eight per 1,000 in the United States, according to the World Health Organization.
