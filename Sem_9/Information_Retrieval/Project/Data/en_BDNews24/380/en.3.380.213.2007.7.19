<TITLE> Qatar mulls $21 bln Sainsbury bid, big investment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Qatar's bid approach for J Sainsbury Plc is pitched at 10.4 billion pounds ($21.3 billion), and the Gulf Arab state plans to invest 3 billion pounds in the British grocer, industry sources said on Thursday. Qatar's Delta Two investment fund, which already holds a 25 percent stake in Britain's third-biggest supermarket chain, has proposed paying 600 pence per share, excluding a 7.35p dividend, the sources said. Delta Two and Sainsbury confirmed on Wednesday they were in takeover talks, but did not disclose the price. "Talks are continuing," a spokesman for Delta Two said. "We'd like the board's backing." Sainsbury's stock was up 0.2 percent at 592 pence by 0930 GMT, valuing the company's equity at around 10.3 billion pounds. It also has debt of 1.5 billion. The DJ Stoxx index of European retailers was up 0.5 percent. Newspapers said on Wednesday the proposal was around 610 pence a share, or about 12 billion pounds including debt. "We believe that this is probably the end game as far as the publicly owned Sainsbury is concerned," Societe Generale said in a note. "We believe that Sainsbury will now accept the bid." SG said Delta Two, unlike traditional private equity bidders, does not need a quick exit strategy. "Delta Two's statement says that it supports the company's operational strategy, and implies that this would be a strategic, long-term investment," SG added in the note. Industry sources said Delta Two would put in 4.6 billion pounds of equity and raise 6 billion in debt to fund the deal. It was also likely to raise a further 3.8 billion of financing to cover Sainsbury's debt and the investment programme. Delta Two's approach comes just three months after the Sainsbury family blocked a 10.1 billion pound or 582p a share approach from a private equity consortium led by CVC Capital Partners Ltd. Sainsbury was not immediately available for comment. However, industry sources said the family members -- who hold around 18 percent of the business -- would be concerned about what Delta Two intends for Sainsbury, especially given their support for Chief Executive Justin King's growth strategy. King has led the retailer in a turnaround in the three years since taking the top job. In May Sainsbury reported a 42 percent jump in annual profits and unveiled plans to create 3.5 billion pounds of new sales by 2010 as it expands into clothing. "The family members think there is a lot of potential to come from the growth strategy and they would have considerable concerns about any plans that involved excessive gearing," one industry source said. The Financial Times said on Thursday, without citing sources, that Delta Two planned to create thousands of jobs and take Sainsbury into international markets. The Daily Telegraph newspaper said Delta Two wanted to open stores in the Middle East, Korea and China. Sainsbury has nearly 800 stores across Britain with a market share of about 16 percent, employing around 153,000 people.
