<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Dr M Wazed Miah, husband of detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was admitted to LabAid Cardiac Hospital Monday at noon. The retired nuclear scientist, who is suffering from cardiac and rheumatic ailments, is now under the supervision of Dr APM Sohrabuzzaman at the hospital. "He's been suffering these ailments for a long time and I've treated him in the past also," Dr Zaman said to bdnews24.com in the afternoon. "After his wife was detained in the morning, he was feeling lonely and somewhat unwell. Hence this hospitalisation," said the doctor. To suggestions as to whether the hospitalisation had anything to do with the morning arrest, Dr Zaman replied, "I don't think so. I told you he has been ill for quite sometime." The hospital authorities have notified that that Dr Wazed is in cabin 602. AL general secretary Abdul Jalil, under treatment in the same hospital, is in the neighbouring cabin 601. bdnews24.com/mhs/br/
