<TEXT>
 MADRID, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina centre-back Gabriel Milito completed his move to Barcelona from Real Zaragoza on Thursday. The 26-year-old passed a medical and put pen to paper on a four-year contract in a deal that could rise to 20.5 million euros ($28.29 million). "It's a dream for me. Barca are widely considered the best team in the world," Milito told a news conference. Barcelona had been seeking to strengthen their defence after centre-back Carles Puyol picked up a knee ligament injury that will rule him out of the start of next season. Milito will compete with France defender Lilian Thuram and Mexico's Rafael Marquez for a place in the centre of defence. The Argentine joined Zaragoza from Independiente in 2003 for $3.5 million after a move to Barca's arch-rivals Real Madrid fell through at the last minute. Real pulled out of the $4 million deal citing concerns over a knee ligament injury the player suffered in 2001. Asked if he considered the move a form of revenge against Real, Milito replied: "No. We have to forget about the past. "I have always wanted to come here and I hope I can repay the club on the pitch for the confidence they have shown in me." He is Barcelona's fourth close-season signing after France striker Thierry Henry, Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure and France left back Eric Abidal
