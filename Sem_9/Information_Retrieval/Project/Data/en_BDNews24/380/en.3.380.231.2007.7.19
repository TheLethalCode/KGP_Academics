 BEIJING, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks to end North Korea's nuclear arms ambitions will not set a timetable on the next steps towards disabling the North's atomic facilities but this could come by the end of the year, the chief US delegate said. A Japanese diplomat said the six-party talks would now spill over into Friday due to differences of opinion. The International Atomic Energy Agency announced on Wednesday that North Korea had now shut five main nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. They include a reactor and an atomic fuel reprocessing plant that can extract the plutonium Pyongyang used for its first nuclear test blast last October. Six-party talks in Beijing were aiming to set a date for completing the second phase of the disarmament deal -- permanently disabling the Yongbyon complex and receiving a full declaration of North Korea's nuclear arms activities. Instead, US envoy Christopher Hill said working groups would meet first to sort out the technical details. "When we get an idea of how this is going to work, then we'll put a timeframe to it," he told reporters, adding he found the atmosphere of the talks good and business like. "I feel it's quite feasible by the end of the year," he added. Japan's chief negotiator, Kenichiro Sasae, told reporters after Thursday's session, "There are points that can be agreed on, but there are also points that cannot be agreed on". "North Korea presented its views on how to proceed in a more frank fashion ... From our standpoint, of course, not all of them are acceptable," he said. South Korean envoy Chun Yung-woo told reporters no one had expected a full settlement at the current round of talks. "It may be hard to agree on deadline for a complete North Korean nuclear shutdown at the current round," Kyodo news agency quoted him as saying. Some negotiators earlier were hopeful of a deal, possibly setting the end of 2007 as a deadline. WARNING North Korea's official KCNA news agency warned Japan not to use the issue of the abduction by Pyongyang of Japanese citizens -- 13 of whom the North has admitted kidnapping -- as an obstacle to the talks. "If Japan is allowed to pursue such design, the nuclear issue on the peninsula will remain unsettled for an indefinite period like the abduction issue, an issue of bringing the dead to life," it quoted a foreign ministry memorandum as saying. The talks have brought together North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China since 2003, but concrete progress had eluded them. However, in February, North Korea agreed to close Yongbyon in return for an initial 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. Shipments of the fuel oil began last week from South Korea. The South would send a third shipment of heavy fuel oil on Friday, an official in Seoul told reporters. Under phase two of the February agreement, the North is to receive an additional 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil in return for disabling its atomic facilities and coming clean on its nuclear secre
