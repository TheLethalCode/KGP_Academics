 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) The interim government has decided to force over 6,373 workers of four state-owned jute mills into retirement at a cost of Tk 1,367 crore. The mills are to be privatised as they are no longer commercially viable, according to the government. The four mills, currently reeling under perennial losses, are: People's Jute Mill, Karnaphuli Jute Mill and Horat Karnaphuli Carpet Factory in Chittagong and Kowmi Jute Mill in Sirajganj. "The government has decided to shut these four jute mills. They will be privatised as it is not possible to turn the mills into commercially viable ones," textiles and jute adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury told reporters at the jute ministry Wednesday. The adviser said 7,627 more workers from the remaining 18 state-owned jute mills would also be sent into retirement soon, but the mills will continue to be operational during the current jute season. There currently remain 22 public-sector jute mills under the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation with over 43,000 jute workers and employees on its payroll, according to jute ministry figures. On the continued losses of these 22 state-owned jute mills, the adviser said: "The mills incur a loss of Tk 421 crore annually, of which the inability to purchase jute on time is the main cause." Cumulative losses of these jute mills now stand at Tk 4,770 crore, said Geeteara who is also the industry adviser. She said the government has decided to sell some 130 acres of land at these mills to cut the liabilities and to create funds for operating costs and the transition to privatisation of the industry. Replying to a question, the adviser said that the government will take action to recover the outstanding payment for those mills which were sold earlier, including former jute giant Adamjee Jute Mills. Jute was once called the 'golden fibre' and a major cash crop of Bangladesh. The previous government shut down the country's largest mill, Adamjee Jute Mills, following its financial collapse due to mismanagement and corruption. The caretaker government also appears to be following the policy of closing down the state-owned mills. Initially four out of 22 mills in the public sector are being closed, with a view to privatisation, in a bid to reduce public sector losses. However, the jute adviser asserted more than one time that the jute industry, which has long been ignored, would return to golden days again. bdnews
