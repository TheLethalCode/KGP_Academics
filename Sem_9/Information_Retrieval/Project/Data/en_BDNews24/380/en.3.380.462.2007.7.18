 Chittagong, July 18 (bdnews24.com)The doctors' strike at Chittagong Ma o Shishu General Hospital continued for a second day with issues still unresolved. Health care in the hospital has been seriously disrupted and more than 100 patients left the facility Wednesday. The medical officers began the strike Tuesday, demanding cancellation of dismissal orders of 50 doctors. They also demanded that their appointments be made permanent. No decision on the striking doctors' demands could be taken at the hospital management committee emergency meeting held Wednesday. "At the moment, we are not in a position to meet the striking doctors' demands. It will take time to resolve the issues," Dr Anjuman Ara Islam, general secretary of the hospital management committee, told bdnews24.com. "But we have notified them in writing to rejoin their duty," she said. Anjuman said that 105 patients had left the hospital during the strike while 136 were still there. Dr Enamul Haque, the striking doctors' spokesperson said that their strike would continue till the demands were met. "Or, we'll resign and leave the hospital," he added. Patients arriving from far and near for treatment were returning untreated from the hospital. Only a few emergency cases were being attended by a fewer hospital staff members. Usually, this general hospital in Agrabad is visited by hundreds of mothers and children coming not only from the metropolitan areas but also from far away rural places in the district. bdnews24.com
