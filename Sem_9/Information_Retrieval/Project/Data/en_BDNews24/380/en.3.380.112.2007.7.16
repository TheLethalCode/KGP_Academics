<TITLE> Security Council to begin consultation on Kosovo's future </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (bdnews24.com/AFP )- - - The UN Security Council on Monday was expected to begins consultations on the future of Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo amid Russia's threat to veto any resolution that does not meet Belgrade's approval. On Friday, the United States and its European allies circulated their compromise Kosovo draft resolution and said it was now up to Russia to decide whether to join in. US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad said the 15-member Security Council would begin consultations on the text Monday and stressed that "the votes are there" for passage unless Russia slaps its veto. The draft, co-sponsored by Washington, Britain and France, called for more talks over a 120-day period between Belgrade and Albanian separatists to determine the Serbian province's future status. But in a spirit of compromise, the sponsors dropped an earlier reference to an automatic move to supervised independence, advocated by UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari, if the parties fail to find common ground at the end of the 120-day period. The text has been amended several times as Russia threatened to veto any solution that is not acceptable to its ally Serbia, which adamantly opposes independence for a province it views as the cradle of its culture and religion. "The core of what we are proposing is not subject to further changes," the US envoy said, but added that the sponsors were "open to reasonably Russian suggestions". "The timeline is the next few days ... The sponsors are determined to move forward one way or the other either inside the council or otherwise," Khalilzad said. "We need to hear the final word from Russia and we have not heard that yet". The draft affirms the Security Council's "readiness to review the situation further" after the 120-day period of negotiations. But the Serbian government remained firm in its opposition to the Western-backed solution for Kosovo, drafting a fresh parliamentary resolution calling for an "energetic response" to any unilateral recognition of the province. Serbia has insisted fresh negotiations should be launched between Belgrade and Pristina, without a timeframe, that would lead to "compromise solution" for Kosovo, the draft said. Meanwhile in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a new envoy should be found to replace Ahtisaari. In Pristina, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urged Kosovo's Albanian majority to work with the international community to settle the province's future status. "We have to work together for some weeks or some months. Unity is very important," Kouchner, who was the first UN administrator in Kosovo, told reporters. But he also sought to assure Kosovo Albanians of European Union and Western support for the Ahtisaari plan to grant the Albanian-majority province internationally-supervised independence. "Don't believe that the European Union has changed. Don't believe that any of your friends has changed," the French minister said, adding that Paris was opposed to a partition of Kosovo. Kosovo has under UN and NATO tutelage since mid-1999 after a NATO-led air war helped to drive out Serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on the majority ethnic Albania
