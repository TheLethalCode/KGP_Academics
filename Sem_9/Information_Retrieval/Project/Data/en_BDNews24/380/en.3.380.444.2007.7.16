 MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga said his team had rescued the self-esteem of their supporters by winning the Copa America. He also warned that Ronaldinho and Kaka, who asked to be rested from the tournament, would have to fight to get their places back in the team. Dunga took over with Brazil at a low ebb after their lacklustre performances at the World Cup last year, when they lost to France in the quarter-finals. After only 11 months in charge, he won his first title on Sunday when his team beat arch-rivals and favourites Argentina 3-0 in the Copa America final. "We came here to rescue the self-esteem of the Brazilian supporter, the worker leaves home early in the morning and comes back at late night and whose only satisfaction is when Brazil wins," said Dunga. He then paid tribute to his players, who he said had come from adversity to triumph. "They are winners, they come from families who financially are not so well off, nobody has given them anything, they've worked hard for this and so they deserve it," he said. Of future team selections, he said: "Obviously, the player who comes is ahead of the player who doesn't. Players are picked on merit and their capabilities. "If a player comes and he does well, how can I take him out of the team?" Although he was criticised in the earlier stages of the tournament, especially after a 2-0 defeat to Mexico, Dunga said he had nothing to say to his detractors. "If my team wins, then I have nothing to explain," he said
