 TOKYO, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by J-League champions Urawa Reds in a friendly match at Saitama Stadium on Tuesday. United found themselves 1-0 down in the 25th minute when Hideki Uchidate fired off a speculative shot from 25 metres that wrong-footed Edwin van der Saar in the United goal. United drew level in the second minute of the second half when Michael Carrick set up Darren Fletcher for a low drive from 10 metres. After a Wayne Rooney cracker that just cleared the bar, United took the lead in the 52nd minute through Cristiano Ronaldo but the home side kept attacking and were rewarded for some enterprising play with an equaliser by Shinji Ono in the 78th minute
