<TITLE> Khaleda wants Hasina free, statement claims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  A statement purported to be from Khaleda Zia Wednesday demanded freedom for her archrival Sheikh Hasina from detention in jail. "If there's any legal scope to conduct the case setting her free, I urge the government to release her immediately. It will minimise the risks of mutual mistrust and suspicion, and social and political tension," the statement quoted Khaleda as saying. The statement written on the BNP letterhead and signed by the former prime minister's deputy press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan was sent to news media, two days after Hasina was arrested in an extortion case. But it could not be confirmed if Khaleda owned the statement or she approved its content. Different media, including BBC Radio, broadcast the story based on the statement. The statement titled "Statement of Khaleda Zia" however did not mention Khaleda's designation as party chairperson. It claimed Khaleda was saddened by the arrest of Hasina and administrative failure to maintain her "dignity" when she was taken to court. "I am deeply disheartened by the kind of dishonourable and indecent situation through which the chief of a party, daughter of a national leader, a former prime minister, an elderly woman, above all an honourable citizen of the country, had to go through in court." "It hurt the feelings of conscientious citizens. The government's image has been tarnished at home and abroad," Khaleda was quoted as saying. She said this situation could have been averted if the government had been cautious and alert. "It would be better if the process of the trial could be complete without arresting Sheikh Hasina or not opposing her bail petition from the government side," the statement said. "Being accused doesn't mean being a criminal. An accused person should get justice beyond doubt and her human rights must fully be upheld," it asserted. The former prime minister also admitted a mistake in running the country. "In a problem-ridden country whoever holds a bigger responsibility has a greater possibility of making mistakes. None of us is above law. However, the success of politicians should not be belittled despite failures in different sectors," it said. bdnews24
