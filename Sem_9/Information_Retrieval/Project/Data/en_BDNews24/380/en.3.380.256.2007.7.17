 LONDON, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bid to slow global warming by reducing the tonnes of food air freighted around the world ran up on Tuesday against the worries of poor African growers who fear it will hurt their business. The Soil Association, the largest organic group in Britain where sales for organic produce, much of it imported from Africa, are rising rapidly, met to debate withdrawing its seal of approval for goods shipped in by air freight. "As climate scientists warn us that we have just 10 years to stabilise global emissions it seems ridiculous to be flying food half-way round the world," said Emily Armisted, a campaigner for Greenpeace, who attended the meeting. The association certifies more than 70 percent of organic produce sold in Britain and its summit drew representatives of environmental groups and development agencies. A final decision is not expected until next year, but already African growers are worried. "The repercussions will certainly be bad. This ban will only serve as an incentive to kill all environmentally friendly agriculture in Kenya," Stephen Mbithi, Chief Executive of Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya, told Reuters. Air freighted produce currently accounts for less than one percent of the organic food sold in Britain but the total is rising, according to the Soil Association. The group is also considering other options including a selective ban which would allow for exemptions, labelling for air freighted produce and carbon offsetting. "I hope the Soil Association air freight standard will provide a permanent exemption for the least developed countries," said Bill Vorley, senior researcher at the International Institute for the Environment and Development. African farmers also dispute claims their air freighted exports do more damage to the environment than European production, citing university studies. TROPICAL EFFICIENCY "All these studies prove that African organic produce is four-to-six times lower in greenhouse gas emissions in reaching the European market, than European produce," Mbithi said. "Producing crops in tropical lands is more energy efficient than in European lands. That's basic science. There is more sunshine and the temperature is more conducive to growing crops, than temperate climates," he added. Some African producers worry that a ban starting in the UK may spread across the European Union. "Right now we fear the ban will be implemented by other EU countries, causing a severe economic and social impact on the livelihood of our farmers, and risking the survival of our own organic market," said Eustace Kiarii, National Coordinator for The Kenya Organic Agriculture Network. Even a total ban may not, however, prove fatal to African organic exports as they could turn to other British certification groups. The Soil Association certifies much of the organic produce sold in Britain but in some sectors, such as poultry and eggs, other groups dominate. "We would not support a blanket ban," Richard Jacobs, chief executive of separate certification group Organic Farmers and Growers said, noting some air freight used empty space on passenger planes. "If the Soil Association were to ban air freight we would certainly consider taking on the certification," he added. The debate, however, is further evidence of significant public concern in Britain which has prompted retailers Tesco and Marks and Spencer to start labelling air freighted produce. "The public concern most frequently raised with us is the perceived inappropriateness of air freighting organic food. This is a concern shared by many organic businesses," said Anna Bradley, chair of the Soil Association standards boa
