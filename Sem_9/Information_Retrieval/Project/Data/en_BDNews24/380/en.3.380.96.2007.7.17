 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) -- No party leaders have visited BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia since Sunday, according to a house staff member Tuesday. The former prime minister now spends time with family members at her cantonment home hemmed in by security personnel. The main gate of her home at Shahid Mainul Road stays locked and cannot be unlocked without a green light from the intelligence agencies. Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, daughter-in-law Syeda Shamila Tabassum, granddaughters Zahia Rahman and Zafia Rahman, and three house staff members remain in the house. The former premier's chauffeur comes once a day, but does not stay for long. Meanwhile, Tarique Rahman's wife, Dr Zobaida Rahman along with her daughter Zaima Rahman, lives in her late father's Dhanmondi home. Khaleda could not visit ailing music icon Sabina Yasmin due to unavailability of a security detail. House staff member Yunus told bdnews24.com: "Madam reads newspapers, says her prayers and recites from the holy Quran." bdnew
