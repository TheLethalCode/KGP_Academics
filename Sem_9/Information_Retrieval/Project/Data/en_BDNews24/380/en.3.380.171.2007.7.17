<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) - The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advised small investors to be cautious in taking loans from merchant banks Monday. "We ask them to be cautious in taking loans from merchant banks as the prices of some issues have become overvalued," executive director of the SEC Farhad Ahmed told a press briefing. The SEC has not as yet released any details regarding which stocks are currently overpriced. Ahmed said: "Small investors who have invested in shares by borrowing from merchant banks will be in trouble if the institutional investors start cashing in on their profits." The regulator's warnings come at a time when the bourses have witnessed a steady rise in the price of issues due to a surge in demand for blue-chips. A significant rise in fund inflows, due mainly to credit extension facilities by merchant banks fuelled demand, the SEC said. The DGEN or general index rallied 49.44 points, equivalent to 2.19 percent, to a record high of 2298.85 Tuesday. The DSI or all-share price gained 39.93 points, equivalent to 2.16 percent, to end 1883.86. The DSE-20 blue chip index crossed the 2000 mark touching 2044.22 points, up 58.19 points, or 2.92 percent. "Past experience shows that small investors will suffer the most under such circumstances," said SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan. Another executive director of the SEC, Shuvra Kanti Chowdhury, explained the higher turnover experienced in the last couple of months: "Loans from merchant banks, especially those operated by banks and non-bank financial institutions, constitute a major portion of the liquidity in the market." "An increase in fund inflows amid a limited supply of scrips has been pushing prices up." bd
