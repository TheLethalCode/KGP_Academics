 NEW YORK, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A South Korean man was arrested and charged with spying for South Korea and obtaining information from North Korea in return for payments, US officials said on Thursday. Park Il Woo, 58, a US resident who has lived in Manhattan for 20 years and who also used the name Steve Park, was arrested on Wednesday. He was charged with lying to FBI agents about meetings with South Korean diplomats in New York between 2005 and 2007, the US Attorney's Office in New York said. Park repeatedly told agents falsely that he had no contact with several South Korean officials, according to a complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. It is illegal under US law to act on behalf of a foreign government without registering. A court affidavit said that in April, 2005, Park told an unnamed South Korean government official in a phone call taped by the FBI that North Korean officials had asked him to bring them insecticides, anesthetics and veterinary products on an upcoming trip to North Korea. It was not revealed why North Korea sought the items or how much Park was paid by South Korea for passing on information. During an FBI interview in August 2005, Park asked his questioners why they were not asking about his relationship with North Korean officials. He also offered to act as a "go-between" between the United States and high-ranking North Korean officials, according to an affidavit. He told the FBI he did not have a good relationship with South Korea, as they had executed his father as a suspected communist and again emphasized his relationship with North Korea, the affidavit said. He later said he did not know a particular South Korean official, but left that interview to immediately meet the same official, the affidavit said. Park was due to appear in federal court in Manhattan later Thursday.
