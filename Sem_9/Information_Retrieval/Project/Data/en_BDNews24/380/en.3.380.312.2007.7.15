 MANILA, Sun Jul 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The largest of four Muslim separatist groups in the southern Philippines warned on Sunday against military retaliation for the beheading of 10 marines in a battle last week.

The military says the Marines were ambushed by hundreds of armed men and 10 of those killed were beheaded.
