 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Awami League leaders, members and supporters have been demonstrating across the country since Sheikh Hasina's arrest, defying a ban on political activity, demonstrations and strikes during the ongoing emergency rule. Strikes were held in some of the capitals' educational institutions Tuesday while three small explosions occurred at Dhaka University. A case was filed the same day in Kishoregonj against 50 or so AL leaders and workers for holding demonstrations. Jagannath University in Old Dhaka came to a standstill as a strike was called by the AL student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League, to protest Hasina's arrest the previous day. The attendance of students was scarce and no regular classes were held, though scheduled examinations went ahead. Around 11.30am BCL began a procession, which surprised many observers as the Emergency Power Ordinance forbids any kind of political demonstration during the present state of emergency. The campus was also attended by plainclothes and uniformed policemen due to an anonymous death threat received by the proctor. Prof Kazi Asad told reporters that the threat was issued over the telephone with the caller demanding suspension of all examinations. Kabi Nazrul Government College and Suhrawardi Government College also came to a halt due to the strike. Meanwhile, small bombs went off at Dhaka University. The bombs exploded at about 11.30am near the vice-chancellor's office. Police could not say who was responsible but affirmed that objective was to create panic. Vice-chancellor Prof SMA Faiz described the explosions as a stray incident and said regular educational activities were going on as usual. In Kishoreganj, police filed a case against local Awami League leaders and workers for holding a rally protesting the arrest of Sheikh Hasina. The case was filed with Pakundia Police Station Tuesday under the Emergency Powers Ordinance. Pakundia police chief Sakhawat Alam told bdnews24.com that up to 50 people were named in the case for defying the ban on political activity during the ongoing state of emergency. bd
