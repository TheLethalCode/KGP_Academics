<TITLE> Bangladesh weighs hydroelectricity in Myanmar: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will start a feasibility study into building hydroelectric plants in Myanmar in November after the two countries sign a memorandum of understanding, a senior government official said Sunday. After a three-day visit to Myanmar, power secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan reported that electricity could be generated at 200 points of 100 rivers in Myanmar. The plants could be set up in Rakhine province where demand for power is relatively low. The proposed plants would be able to meet the demand of people in the province and Bangladesh can get enough supply of power from the same area, the secretary said. Myanmar proposed that it should be supplied with a third of the total output. Khan said Bangladesh would take a final decision on the matter after the study was complete. The secretary-level talks were held on July 11-13. bdnews24.co
