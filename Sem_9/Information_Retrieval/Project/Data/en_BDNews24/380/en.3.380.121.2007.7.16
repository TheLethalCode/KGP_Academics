 BAGHDAD, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five Iraqi soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in northeast Baghdad on Monday, police said. One soldier was also wounded in the pre-dawn attack on their vehicle convoy in the Boubal-Shama neighbourhood, an old commercial and industrial district. The area is near a highway linking the capital with Diyala province, where thousands of US and Iraqi forces have launched a major operation to drive out Islamist al Qaeda militants. Two people were also killed and six wounded by two mortar rounds that struck a residential neighbourhood in southern Baghdad called Abudsheer. The area is a Shia enclave in Dora, a mainly Sunni district and al Qaeda stronghold in the city.
