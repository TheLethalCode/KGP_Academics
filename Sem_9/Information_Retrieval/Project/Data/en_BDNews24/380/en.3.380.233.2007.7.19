 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)--Controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun Thursday appealed to the High Court against a verdict that sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years in an arms case. Mamun's lawyer Abdul Mannan Fakir filed the appeal. Court sources said a regular HC Division Bench would hear the appeal after July 22, when the SC reopens. On July 3, Dhaka Metropolitan Special Tribunal Judge Md Abul Bashar sentenced Mamun to 10 years rigorous imprisonment on charges of keeping illegal arms. A sub-inspector of the Cantonment Police Station filed the case against Mamun under the Arms Act. Police submitted the chargesheet on May 18 and the court framed charges against Mamun on May 20. Earlier on July 1, Mamun filed another appeal against another verdict of a Dhaka Special Court delivered on June 7, in an anticorruption case that sentenced him to three years in jail for not submitting his wealth statement in time. According to police, Mamun was arrested on March 26, though he testified to court that he was arrested on Jan 31 at a friend's house in Paltan area. bd
