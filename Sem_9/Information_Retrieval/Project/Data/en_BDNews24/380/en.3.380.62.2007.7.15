 Mokarram Hossain Shuvo bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) -- The University Grants Commission has moved to regulate public universities by drafting a uniform law that envisages selection of senate and syndicate members. The law named "Umbrella Act 2007" has also proposed a ban on politics by teachers while it has advocated appointment of vice chancellor, pro-vice chancellor and treasurer through search committees. The UGC Sunday submitted a copy of the law to the education ministry for vetting, and bdnews24.com obtained a copy of the draft law. UGC chairman Prof Nazrul Islam and other commission members met education adviser Ayub Quadri in his Secretariat office to discuss the draft law. The meeting decided to take feedback from teachers before making the law final. UGC member Prof Tareq Shamsur Rahman said another meeting would be held on July 31 to discuss the proposed law. "We have decided to take opinion from teachers because it's difficult to implement any Act without their cooperation," Rehman told bdnews24.com. "The method of seeking teachers' opinion has not been decided yet. We'll make our decision later." According to the draft law, there will be no elected council in place to run a university. Rather, a council would be formed with nominated people and it would play the same role as the elected council plays now. Although it has talked against any teachers' politics tied to any political party, it did not say anything about student politics. Seniority and posts are among the criteria for teachers to be nominated for the Syndicate and Senate. The executive powers of the syndicate would remain unchanged. At present, six of the 17-member syndicate are teachers who are all elected. Currently teachers, officials and employees of a university have the right to hold any political ideals and scope for becoming a member of any legally recognised organisation outside the university. The existing law allows a teacher to become a member of a political party. Once the new law is finalised, the right of a teacher to be a member of a political party will go. The election system for the appointment of vice chancellor, pro-vice chancellor and treasurer will also be cancelled and a five-member national search committee will appoint them, according to the draft law. The chancellor will form the committee with an acceptable person from former vice-chancellors as its head. The members of the committee will be the chairman of the UGC, a senior educationist or one former vice-chancellor and two retired judges of the Supreme Court. The search committee will nominate three names and give specific comments about each of them to help make a final decision. The pro-vice chancellor and the treasurer will also be appointed in a similar way. The vice chancellor will enjoy the status of a secretary and he cannot be removed for any cause other than the causes for which a High Court judge can be removed, the draft law says. The members of a syndicate are the vice chancellor, pro-vice chancellor, treasurer, two representatives nominated by the academic council, two deans of the faculties, two senior professors and a senior associate professor, a provost, a member nominated by the senate, an educationist nominated by the chancellor, a government official of a minimum additional secretary status nominated by the government, an educationist nominated by the UGC, a lawyer nominated by the chancellor and a member of Bangladesh Chartered Accountants Association. The size of the senate will be smaller than the present one. The number of members will be one third of the present number, the draft says. The senate members will be nominated by the chancellor, speaker, vice chancellor, UGC and syndicate on the basis of some specified conditions and qualifications. At present the senate accommodates 25 registered graduate representatives and 35 elected teachers' representatives while others are nominated. In the existing system five elected student representatives become senate members but in the new law no such provision exists. bdnews24.
