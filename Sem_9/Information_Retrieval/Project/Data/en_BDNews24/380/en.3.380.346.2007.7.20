<TITLE> Dow Jones director von Holtzbrinck resigns </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co Inc director Dieter von Holtzbrinck said he would resign from the board because he could not support its endorsement of a $5 billion takeover offer by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Von Holtzbrinck said on Thursday Murdoch's $60 per share offer was "very generous in financial terms," but that he was concerned that Dow Jones's journalistic values would "strongly suffer" if the sale goes through. "I cannot prove my worries are right," he wrote in a letter to the board that Dow Jones filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. "I can only refer to News Corp practices in the past." Von Holtzbrinck's move puts him in the camp of some members of the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones through its voting shares. An undetermined number of Bancroft family members oppose Murdoch's offer because they fear he would interfere in Dow Jones's news operations to further his business interests. He is the first non-family director to publicly oppose Murdoch's bid for Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, the Barron's investor's newspaper, the MarketWatch.com financial news site and Dow Jones Newswires. Dow Jones Chairman Peter McPherson said, "Dieter von Holtzbrinck has served Dow Jones with distinction as a director since 2001. The board has accepted his resignation and we wish him well." The company said it would not offer additional comment. A News Corp spokesman declined to comment. Von Holtzbrinck is chairman of the supervisory board of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH, according to the Dow Jones Web site.
