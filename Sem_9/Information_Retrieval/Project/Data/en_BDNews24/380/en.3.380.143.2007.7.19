<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be described as the "Father of the Nation" and Ziaur Rahman the "proclaimer of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu" in textbooks for next year, an official said Thursday. The education ministry has approved the text of the corrected history for the primary level. Secondary school books have also been submitted for approval of the ministry, Prof Mohammad Yusuf Farooq, chairman of the National Curriculum and Text Book Board told bdnews24.com. NCTTB has inserted the name of Ziaur Rahman in the textbooks as the March 27, 1971 declarer of independence on behalf of Bangabandhu. In preparing the new scripts for school textbooks, the word "Bangabandhu" was prefixed to the name of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The history of the liberation war has already been inserted in the textbooks as described in the "Documents of the Bangladesh War of Independence" edited by Hasan Hafizur Rahman and published in 1982,' the Board chairman said. ''All the history, social sciences and Bangla textbooks for Class III to Class IX will be changed. The students will get the corrected textbooks in January 2008," Farooq said. The textbook board, which is under the education ministry, looks after the renewal or modification and development of curricula, and the production and distribution of primary, secondary and higher secondary textbooks. Successive governments, especially after the early 1990s, started distorting the history of the War of Liberation in the textbooks meant for Class III to Class X. The BNP-Jamaat alliance government started effecting major changes in 19 textbooks after Nov 2001. bdnews
