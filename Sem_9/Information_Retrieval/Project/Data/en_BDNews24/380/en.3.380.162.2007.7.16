 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday said that the arrest of one or two people would not hurt the economy. Azizul made the observation when reporters asked him about Sheikh Hasina's arrest. "We've to see whether the economic indicators are on track. So far, the indicators tell us everything is on the right track," he told reporters at the National Board of Revenue (NBR). He said that export-import, remittance and macro-economic stability were all right. The adviser visited the NBR office to discuss budgetary target and revenue collection issues. Azizul said that revenue officials would have to play a vital role so that allegations of Bangladesh being corrupt and not much of a taxpayer country were removed. Badiur Rahman, chairman of the NBR, other members of the NBR and senior revenue officials were also present. "Bangladesh is one of the most corrupt countries and the revenue collection is relatively poor compared with the GDP. It is not proper for the economic growth of any country," he said. Islam asked officials to fulfill the target of revenue collection by being efficient, and not by harassing taxpayers. He emphasized monitoring the activities of NBR and said that he would call on the NBR officials every three months. The revenue -GDP ratio was only 10.4 percent in the just concluded FY 2006-07 and the collected revenue fell short of the target by Tk 337 crore. The target is set at 10.8 percent, which is Tk 43,850 crore for the FY 2007-08. About Tk 2000 crore in revenue could not be collected due to litigations, according to NBR officials. bdnews24
