 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  The United Nations has said Sigma Huda's status as its special rapporteur does not guarantee immunity from arrest and detention since the matter does not involve the particular UN assignment. On July 15, a special court ordered Sigma into jail after her arrest in a case that brands her as abettor for her husband Nazmul Huda in bribe-taking. The trial court's move came after the High Court on July 14 rejected Sigma's appeal seeking immunity from arrest and detention as special UN rapporteur. The New York-datelined statement by the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general Tuesday said the special rapporteurs enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent exercise of their functions as experts on mission under the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. Sigma was appointed as special rapporteur on trafficking in persons on April 19, 2004 by the then Commission on Human Rights for three years, the statement said. "Ms Huda is now facing a criminal trial in Bangladesh for charges of corruption," it said. It said the UN had sought information about the matter from the government, and after the information reached the Secretary-General he has determined that the charges against Sigma appear not to be related to, or otherwise fall within, her functions as special rapporteur. "This information allows him to conclude that no immunity under the Convention is applicable in the present case. The Government of Bangladesh has been notified accordingly," the statement said. It, however, said that the states wishing to initiate legal proceedings against special rapporteurs are expected to bring the matter promptly to the attention of the secretary-general under the convention. But the government did not do so in this particular case, it said. Sigma's arrest and the subsequent detention involve a Tk 2.4 crore bribery case. Roads contractor Mir Zahir Hossain filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station against Sigma, secretary general of Bangladesh Society for Enforcement of Human Rights, and Nazmul Huda for taking the amount in bribe from him after the emergency government came to power in mid-January. Sigma allegedly abetted her husband in bribe-taking as the money was deposited into the account of Khoborer Antorale, operated by Sigma, the Bangla-language weekly's publisher, according to the case details. On June 4, the Anticorruption Commission investigated the case and submitted the chargesheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. bd
