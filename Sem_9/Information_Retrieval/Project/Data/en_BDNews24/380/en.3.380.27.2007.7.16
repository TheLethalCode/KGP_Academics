<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was arrested on charges of extortion at her home in a predawn raid and taken away to a special jail Monday after a Dhaka court had rejected her appeal for bail. Hasina, who in the court dismissed the charges as part of a "conspiracy", was detained at a house in the Jatiya Sangsad complex, which authorities declared as a special jail. In a handwritten letter, Hasina accused the government of framing false charges against her. She urged people "not to give up and continue the movement to restore people's right". Security forces led Hasina away at 7:31am to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. She is accused of extorting about Tk 3 crore from a company in return for allowing it to build a power station while she was in office. They laid siege around the Sudha Sadan home of the beleaguered Awami League president for three hours from 4:30am. Many viewed Hasina's arrest as more political than legal, and at least political leaders looked at it that way. The pre-dawn arrest came a day after the chief election commissioner unveiled an election timeline. Her adherents linked the arrest to her open criticism of the military-backed government that she quite often said was the result of the 14-party coalition's street struggle against the four-party coalition government. A commentator on BBC World, referring to observers in Dhaka, said Hasina's arrest was meant to take the former prime minister out of the political scene. At the court, Hasina appeared before magistrate Kamrunnahar in an extortion case involving approximately Tk 3 crore that was filed by managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited Azam J Chowdhury on June 13. bdnews24.com managed to speak to Sheikh Hasina at 4:53am, as her arrest was imminent. She told bdnews24.com by phone, "I did no wrong, neither did my family." As Hasina was speaking, there was a sound of knocking on the door and somebody was heard saying, "They've come and want to get in." Hasina replied: "Tell them I'm coming after saying my prayers." Several hundred RAB and police officers arrived at the Dhanmondi road No. 5 home at 4:45am, cordoning and sealing off all the entry points. Some 50 vehicles including 15 buses, two prison vans and three ambulances waited outside the home in the small hours amid driving rain. Law adviser Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com that Hasina was arrested on clear charges. "I heard about her arrest. She has been facing a number of cases. Awami League leaders and activists also backed the cases against her." However, Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "Nobody will accept it. It's political harassment." Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told bdnews24.com by telephone from Washington: "It's not an attack on my mother, it's an attack on Bangladesh's independence." "Enemies are raising their heads once again as they did in 1971, but this time from within the country," he claimed. "Not only Bangladesh, but the whole world is with us," said the former prime minister's son. Before her arrest, the 59-year-old leader told bdnews24.com Senior Political Correspondent Suman Mahbub that she had ruled the country with honesty. "I can personally say that no-one in my family nor I was involved in extortion. In the last five years, the BNP-led government looked for our mistakes, but couldn't find any," said the AL chief, who also faces charges of political killing. She was charged with murder on April 11 while she was in the United States. On April 22, a Dhaka court issued an order to arrest Hasina in a murder case filed by a Jamaat-e-Islami leader. The murder case involves the deaths of four protesters who belonged to BNP ally Jamaat-e-Islami in an October 28 political riot in Dhaka. On April 9, Tajul Islam Faruk from Habiganj had filed a Tk 3 crore extortion case against her, while on June 13, businessman Noor Ali filed a Tk 5 crore case with Tejgaon police station and Azam J Chowdhury filed another case of Tk 2.95 crore against Hasina and AL leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim with Gulshan police station. Due to ongoing investigations into the extortion cases against her, on June 14 the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka had asked police and immigration to stop Hasina going abroad. She had been scheduled to fly to the US on June 15 to see her daughter. Earlier in April restrictions were placed on Hasina's returning to Bangladesh after authorities had accused her of making ``inflammatory statements'' about the interim government while abroad. But she vowed to come back to "her own country". Following Hasina's defiant announcement, an interim adviser warned that legal actions would be taken against the AL president if she came back. She arrived in Dhaka on May 7, ending a 51-day stay overseas after the interim government softened its position. Hasina's husband Dr M Wazed Miah was at home at the time of her arrest, though he was admitted to Labaid Cardiac Hospital later in the day. Dr Wazed has long been suffering cardiac and rheumatic ailments. Hasina's private security officials retired major general Tareque Ahmed Siddique, retired brigadier general Ziauddin, retired majors Kibria and Iqbal, the driver and maids were also inside Sudha Sadan. Plot to isolate Hasina: AL The Awami League's reaction on the day was to allege that Hasina's arrest was part of the government's conspiracy to isolate her from people. They demanded her immediate release. "The Minus Two formula is the brainchild of this government. As part of it attempts are going on to alienate the two leaders from the people," acting president of the party Zillur Rahman said. "Sheikh Hasina is no common person. If there was any allegation against her she could be summoned to the court," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home Monday noon. The AL acting president urged people not to be undone by the arrest and to remain united. Zillur said the party's policymaking presidium would decide the next course of action. "We are surprised, sad and hurt at the incident. We will seek redress from the High Court," presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury told reporters. Presidium member Motia Chowdhury, who had earlier termed the arrest unwarranted, told bdnews24.com Monday morning: "Nobody will accept it. She has been arrested to be harassed politically." Leftists not happy The country's left-leaning political parties criticised Hasina's arrest Monday, saying it would raise questions about the government's motive. "It's unfortunate. The caretaker government had earlier said that no-one would be arrested even if there were cases. She is a former prime minister of the country. The court could have summoned her," Rashed Khan Menon, president of Workers Party of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com. Mujahidul Islam Selim, general secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, said the legal process must be transparent in dealing with the issue and that it would be undemocratic if she were arrested to realise politically motivated goals. Hasanul Haque Inu, president of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, said Hasina is a former prime minister and was not going to run away. "It's sad. The arrest was not necessary," he said. Protests erupt in Dhaka A string of small protests erupted in parts of the capital following the Awami League president's arrest, police and witnesses said. Protesters chanted slogans such as "Joy Bangla" and "Joy Bangabandhu" before the CMM Court in the old city where Hasina was appearing. Party activists from nearby also streamed to the court but police prevented them from entering the court premises. Security was also tightened as onlookers increased in numbers. Many tried to tear through the tight security net At around 10:15am when Hasina was being led away from the court, which refused her bail, supporters tried to barricade her path to stop the convoy carrying Hasina to special jail. RAB, police and other security personnel had to fight the surrounding crowd to ease their way out. The security convoy sped towards Tantibazar, where AL activists again barricaded the road and tried to stop the motorcade. Officials used batons to clear their way, while groups of protesters demonstrated and threw stones at security forces. At least 10 people were injured in the clashes as a trail of protests spread between Laxmibazar and Tantibazar and police had to fire tear gas canisters and rubber bullets. The convoy reached the Jatiya Sangsad premises at 10:33am to deliver the former prime minister to the provisional jail. bdnews24.com/lh/ans/pc/mhs/wz/eh
