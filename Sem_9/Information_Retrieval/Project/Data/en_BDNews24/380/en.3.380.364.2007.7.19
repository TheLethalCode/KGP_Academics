<TITLE> Islamists warn Musharraf of civil war, bombs kill 32 </TITLE>

 KARACHI, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sitting cross-legged on a carpet in Karachi's largest Islamic school, cleric Mufti Muhammad Naeem voiced fears of civil war if President Pervez Musharraf escalates his fight against militancy in Pakistan's northwest. On Thursday, again two bombs exploded in Pakistan -- one in the south and the other in the northwest, killing at least 32 people. Most of victims were police. A wave of bomb attacks since a siege and assault on a militant mosque stronghold in Islamabad this month has swept northwestern Pakistan, killing close to 150 people. "Musharraf has chosen a dangerous path," said Naeem, speaking as days of spiralling violence followed the July 10 commando assault to crush a Taliban-style movement at Islamabad's Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque. The government said 102 people were killed in the siege and storming of the mosque complex -- though many people suspect the casualty figures were far greater -- intensifying Islamist anger with US ally Musharraf. As of Thursday, close to 150 people, mostly soldiers and police, have been killed in suicide bombings and ambushes in the wake of the bloody assault in the capital. "I think this situation could blow up in an all out civil war," said the cleric who heads the sprawling mosque-and-school complex of Jamia Banoria in Karachi's main industrial estate. The enemy would be guerrillas and suicide bombers, drawn largely from the ethnic Pashtun belt, where support for the Taliban is rife and conservative religious attitudes and tribal loyalties run deep. Most attacks this month have been in tribal areas of North West Frontier Province, but a suicide bomber killed 17 people in Islamabad on Tuesday night. The Islamabad attack was the odd one out in that it targeted supporters of a judge whom Musharraf is trying to remove, but whatever the motive the sense of growing insecurity is palpable. "Things are not going the way Musharraf had anticipated," Hafiz Hussain Ahmed, a member of parliament and a senior leader of a relatively moderate religious party Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam, told Reuters. "I will not be surprised if similar attacks follow in big cities like Karachi and Lahore." Ideologically, even so-called "moderate" clerics agreed with the agenda of Lal Masjid's clerics, they just balked at the militant means of propagating Islam and the primacy of Islamic law, known as the sharia. "We may disagree on the strategy and tactics but we cannot oppose their principled and ideological stand on the enforcement of sharia," Naeem said. A moderate by the standards of his hardline peers among the Deobandi school of Islamic thought, Naeem believes people like him are losing influence, and more young Muslims from northwestern Pakistan will gravitate towards militancy. "Why would my students listen to me if their families are being bombed in their homes," said Naeem, whose religious school or madrasa provides board and lodging for about 10,000 students, many of whom hail from tribes in the troubled northwest. Pakistan hosts about 13,000 seminaries that run Islamic schools, providing board and lodging to more than a million students, mostly the children of poor families. More than half of these schools are run by clerics who follow the Deobandi school of thought, and while most fulfil a social function some are regarded as little more than armed camps, recruiting students for jihadi causes. If the operation against the Lal Masjid proves to be the opening shot in a protracted campaign against Islamist militants, clerics fear simmering impatience with the government will snap. "There is a limit to everything. We will tolerate what the government is up to, but only to a certain extent," warned Qari Muhammad Iqbal, the main spokesman and in charge of Jamiat-ul-Uloom-il-Islamiyyah, a seminary led by hardline Deobandi clerics in Karachi. The increasing hostility between Pakistan's military establishment and the Islamists is in sharp contrast to days of late military ruler General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Back then the madrasas run by hardliners were encouraged to provide fighters for the mujahideen, holy warriors, fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. "Now the government expects us to use our influence against militancy," Ahmed said. On Thursday, a bomb blast killed at least 25 in a market place in the southern town of Hub, on the border between Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, near the city of Karachi. Seven of the dead were policemen. More than 20 people were wounded, some of them seriously. It was the first such attack in southern Pakistan during this recent wave. It was unclear whether it was related to the Islamist militant backlash against the storming of Islamabad's Red Mosque, or was linked to a long-running separatist movement in Baluchistan. Chinese workers have been targeted by both. "I saw flames all around me after a big bang. It appeared as if cars were flying in the air," Mohammad Raheem, a 17-year-old labourer, who was injured in the blast, told Reuters in a hospital in Karachi. "There were cries and screams all around. After that I don't known what happened. I just fainted." President Pervez Musharraf said on Wednesday he had no intention of declaring a state of emergency to counter the growing insecurity, and gave assurances that elections due later this year would go ahead as planned. Abdullah Jan Afridi, the most senior officer at Hub Chowki police station, said the policemen had been escorting a team of Chinese engineers travelling to Karachi when the blast occurred, although the vehicle carrying the Chinese had just passed by. "The blast took place shortly after Chinese passed the area. All seven policemen in the vehicle have been killed," he said. Police were still investigating whether it was a remote-controlled bomb or a suicide attack. In the far northwest, a car bomber blew himself up at a police training centre in the city of Hangu early on Thursday, killing at least seven people. The government said 102 people had been killed in the storming of the mosque. Many of the victims came from the volatile northwest, most of them followers of cleric brothers advocating a militant brand of Islam reminiscent of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The bomber in Hangu tried to enter the police training centre just as young recruits were going in for training. "The attacker tried to crash through the gate. He blew himself up as security guards at the gate tried to stop him," said Fakhr-e-Alam, top administration official of the city. "Six policemen and a passerby were killed." A police official said 13 people had been wounded. Hangu, which itself has a history of sectarian violence, is close to Pakistan's lawless tribal regions on the Afghan border, known as hotbeds of support for al Qaeda and Taliban militants. A large number of al Qaeda fighters and their allies fled to Pakistan's tribal areas after U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001. At the same time as militants are believed to be taking revenge for the government's mosque complex assault in the capital, pro-Taliban fighters have abandoned a 10-month-old peace pact in North Waziristan, raising fears of a resurgence in violence, mainly in the conservative northwe
