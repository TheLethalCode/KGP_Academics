<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party Monday remained silent over the arrest of Sheikh Hasina. While the reaction was sought from BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossasin, he said the government could say better why she had been arrested. "We don't know the matter completely," he told reporters Monday when he was coming out of the Gulshan home of his party secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. "I don't know anything. No comment," he said when reporters pressed him with follow-up questions about the new development. Bhuiyan did not want to comment on the issue either. bdnew
