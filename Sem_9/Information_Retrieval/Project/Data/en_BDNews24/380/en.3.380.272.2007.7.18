 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Leading research firm IDC has blamed current political "uncertainty" for sluggish investment in the information technology sector in Bangladesh. Industry insiders however differ with the Massachusetts-based global market intelligence outfit. "The uncertainty brought about by the current political situation has led to the postponement of several multinational projects, which in turn has affected the country's overall IT spending," the IDC remarked Wednesday. It said projects that have been put on hold most likely until the second half of the year and pending resolution of the political crisis. These include "World Bank-funded projects aimed at strengthening the country's local government system and government plans to invest in Smart IDs to keep voters list clean". "The postponement of the general elections in January 2007 has contributed to the slowdown of PC shipments in the commercial segment," said its director Linus Lai. "Although a caretaker government has been appointed, businesses are currently adopting a wait-and-see approach towards their IT spending plans." Lai however admitted the consumer market has seen some activities driven by increased end-user awareness and falling PC prices. "Moreover, the presence of the dry season in the first quarter has provided buyers with added impetus to purchase PCs at this time." The IDC said an improvement in consumer desktop shipments spurred Bangladesh PC shipments (desktops and notebooks) to reach 49,454 units in the first quarter of 2007, marking a 2.6 percent quarter-on-quarter growth. Desktops currently account for 90.7 percent of the market while notebook adoption remains considerably lower mainly due to its high prices. The IDC said notebooks would register a stronger 46 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2006-2011 as opposed to desktops which are expected to post a CAGR of 25.7 percent. But the industry largely differs with IDC. "None of our corporate customers has postponed their IT projects due to change in the structure of governance," Thakral Information Systems' chief executive officer Shahzaman Mozumder told bdnews24.com. "Our numbers show robust sales in the first-half of 2007 compared with 2006 figures," said the Bangladesh partner of IBM and Lenovo. Mozumder said desktops and notebook computers targeted for the consumer market continue to sell in good numbers. "In fact, the branded market is doing much better because of the stern measures adopted by the caretaker government to discourage under-invoicing and evasion of duty." The IDC also sees the upside. "Although initiatives to combat corruption could deter some government agencies from making PC purchases, it would, on the other hand, signify to the world the country's commitment towards creating a favourable destination for viable and stable investments." "As such, unless the elections push through and a more stable political environment is established, IDC's outlook for the Bangladesh PC market will be lowered," the American consulting house has warned. bdn
