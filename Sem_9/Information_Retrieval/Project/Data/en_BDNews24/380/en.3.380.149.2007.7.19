 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nuclear power firm British Energy said on Thursdayit was unlikely to get its Hunterston and Hinkley Point stations back to full power after shutting them down last autumn to repair boiler cracks. "We have encountered some teething problems during the process of raising load," said British Energy, whose eight nuclear plants and one coal-fired station are capable of producing about a fifth of the country's electricity needs. "Delivering increased power levels will not be straightforward," Chairman Adrian Montague told the group's annual general meeting. "I have to say that returning to 100 percent power is unlikely." Shares in the group fell 1.1 percent to 523.5 pence by 1047 GMT, valuing the group at around 5.4 billion pounds. British Energy is at the forefront of Britain's plans for a nuclear renaissance to help it meet European goals to cut emissions of climate-damaging CO2 to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. The group is hoping to form partnerships to build new stations. "We are in active dialogue with a number of interested parties," it said. British Energy's nuclear output in the first quarter of this financial year was 13 terawatt hours after unplanned losses of 3.1 terawatt hours, mostly from Hinkley Point in southwest England and Hunterston in Scotland. The group's Eggborough coal-fired power station in northeast England generated 0.8 terawatt hours. The government sold a 25 percent stake in the group in May for 2.1 billion pounds, cutting its stake to around 39 percent. It gained a 64 percent interest in British Energy in 2002, when it led a rescue of the company driven to the brink of collapse by tumbling power prices and a big nuclear clean-up bill. The group has since bounced back, helped by a sharp recovery in energy prices, but its ageing power stations have suffered a string of faul
