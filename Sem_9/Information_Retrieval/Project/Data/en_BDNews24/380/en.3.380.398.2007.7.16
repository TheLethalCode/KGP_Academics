 JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Health officials in Malawi were preparing on Monday to launch a massive HIV testing programme to identify tens of thousands of people unknowingly infected with the virus in the southern African nation. Many of the estimated 14 percent of Malawian adults who are HIV-positive do not know they are infected, jeopardising efforts to stop the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among sexually active teenagers and adults, the government has said.

The impoverished nation continues to struggle to find enough money to put in place grassroots HIV-prevention efforts, especially in rural areas where HIV infection rates are still rising, in contrast to the declines seen in cities. Close to 30,000 newborns are infected every year because of the government's failure to prevent mother-to-child transmission, and only a fraction of those living with HIV have access to life-saving anti-retroviral drugs, according to officials.

The current testing programme costs about $1.5 milli
