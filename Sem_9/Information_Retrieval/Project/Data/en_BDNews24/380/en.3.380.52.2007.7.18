<TITLE> Kosovo draft formally introduced in UN Council </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europeans and the United States formally introduced late on Tuesday a draft UN resolution on the future of Kosovo but have not decided yet whether or when to call a vote because of Russia's objections. Moscow, which has veto power in the UN Security Council, opposes any action that would lead to Kosovo's independence from Serbia, an ally of Russia, and has said the draft resolution had "zero" chance of being adopted. The introduction of the draft, revised slightly, means a vote can be called after 24 hours but does not have to be. Sponsors of the text said no vote had been called but noted the text could be withdrawn or altered. Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombed to drive out Serb forces and halt the killing and expulsion of Albanians in a two-year war with guerrillas. Under the resolution, Serbs and Kosovars would resume negotiations for 120 days after which the United Nations would hand over the administration of the province to the European Union. NATO troops would stay on. Russia's UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, said on Monday that the United Nations should stay in place, negotiations should continue until a solution was found and that the new institutional arrangements in the draft appeared to pave the way for independence of Kosovo through the back door. The latest draft resolution, obtained by Reuters, also "welcomes" help in the 120 days of negotiations from the European Union and the Contact Group, an informal advisory body created in the mid-1990s to oversee Balkan diplomacy. It includes the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia but no one country has a veto. In an effort to raise pressure on Russia, Europeans and the United States have threatened to withdraw the issue of Kosovo's final status from the UN Security Council if Moscow does not accept a resolution soon. In Brussels, Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, said the resolution could be withdrawn if Moscow does not accept it soon. But Britain's deputy UN Ambassador, Karen Pierce said, "Solana doesn't speak for us on the Security Council or in terms of what the Security Council does, so I think you should wait to hear from the co-sponsors." From Pristina, ethnic Albanian leaders in the breakaway Serbian province said the council had failed on Kosovo and urged the West to offer an alternative route to independence. Two earlier drafts of the resolution had included an automatic trigger of a plan by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari that would lead to Kosovo's independence. Council members are worried that Kosovo leaders will declare independence unilaterally, although that might jeopardize ties with and aid from the EU.
