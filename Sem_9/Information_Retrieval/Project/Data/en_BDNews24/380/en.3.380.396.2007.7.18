<TEXT>
 Chittagong, July 18 (bdnews24.com)A golden vase containing a lock of Lord Gautam Buddha's hair was presented to visiting Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohita Bogollagama by the government Wednesday. Foreign affairs adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury handed over the golden vase in a simple ceremony at the Nandan Kanan Bouddha Vihar in Chittagong. In return, the visiting Sri Lankan delegation presented a rare footprint of the Buddha preserved in clay and a Buddha statue to the Bouddha Vihar as a mark of friendship. Alongside the Bangladesh and Sri Lanka delegations, the supreme leader of the Buddhist faith in Bangladesh Dharmasen Mohathero was also present at the function which was held at 2.30 pm amid torrential rains. The lock of Lord Buddha's hair had been preserved at the Nandan Kanan Bouddha Vihar in Chittagong since 1930. Buddhists throughout the world revere this lock of hair as sacred. However, Buddhists, including those in Bangladesh, were scarcely aware of the existence of the sacred relic for many years. It came to public notice when a Sri Lankan religious institution in 1958 appealed for a part of the lock of hair. The institution made another appeal in 2003 for a further piece of the lock. On this appeal the presentation was made to the Sri Lankan delegation Wednesday. Bangladesh Buddhist Association chairman Ajit Ranjan Barua told bdnews24.com: "Parts of the lock of hair have previously been given to the same Sri Lankan institution in 1958, to the Japanese in 1964 and to Thailand in 1970, on the basis of agreement between governments." bdnews2
