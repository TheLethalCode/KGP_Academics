 CARSON, California, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Although David Beckham was unable to play a full part in his first training session with the Los Angeles Galaxy on Monday, he has quickly earned the respect of his new team mates. Forward Landon Donovan, the Galaxy's biggest name until Beckham was signed from Spanish giants Real Madrid on a lucrative five-year deal, has already warmed to the Englishman. "He's been really great with us," U.S. international striker Donovan told a news conference at the team's home stadium. "I think he was a little shy the first day coming in but anybody joining a new team would be a little shy and not sure what to expect at first. "He's warmed up a lot and got more lively the last couple days. At first, you don't want to make him feel uncomfortable and you don't want to say too much. "I think he's done great and we want to get him on the field and training with us. He's a really great guy. I've heard that from people and now I can confirm it." TEAM PLAYER England midfielder Beckham, who has joined the Galaxy on a contract that will earn him a reported $250 million, has long held a reputation for being an ideal team player. "I think once I am in with the lads and we have been training for two or three days, they will see what I'm like as a person," he said after being introduced as a Galaxy player on Friday. "I just want to be part of the team. The other stuff that surrounds me and that comes with me as a player, I believe I have always handled in the right way. I've always been in football to play football." Beckham's basic annual salary of $5.5 million is more than 50 times the average in Major League Soccer, and dwarfs Donovan's salary of $900,000. Although the 32-year-old Englishman and his pop star wife Victoria inhabit a very different world from his new team mates, he has been hugely impressed by the relaxed and friendly welcome he has received at the Galaxy. "The players were all really pleasant, thankfully," said Beckham, whose role in training on Monday was restricted because of his swollen left ankle. "One of them came up to me -- I can't remember who it was now -- and said: 'Nice to meet you. What's your name?' That really broke the ice.
