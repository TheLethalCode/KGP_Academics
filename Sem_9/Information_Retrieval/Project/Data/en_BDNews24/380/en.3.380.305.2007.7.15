<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil Sunday refrained from saying anything about his so-called letter that detailed his plan to retire from politics. An ailing Jalil did not specify anything when he responded to a bdnews24.com query on what he thought about the comments of his party chief that he had made the retirement statement under pressure from an intelligence agency. "I won't say anything," Jalil said in a quick reply when his attention was brought to the whole thing. "I'm very sick. Please pray for me," the close aide to Hasina added quickly, drawing attention of a group of reporters at the hospital. The leader was approached by a bdnews24.com correspondent when he was brought to Labaid Cardiac Hospital from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital at 8.20pm Sunday. On appeal from his family he was brought to Labaid for better treatment. He was wearing a white punjabi and a white pajama while being brought to LabAid. Jalil was arrested on May 28 at his Mercantile Bank in Motijheel. bdnews24.
