 NEW YORK, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New York was on Wednesday named as the world's top fashion city for the fourth consecutive year, according to a survey by a US -based language use group. The Global Language Monitor, a non-profit group that tracks words and phrases in the media, on the Internet and throughout the blogosphere, compiles an annual list of the top fashion cities.
