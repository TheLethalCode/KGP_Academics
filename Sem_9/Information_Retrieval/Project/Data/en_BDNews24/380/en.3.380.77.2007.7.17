 LONDON, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newcastle United were one of three clubs raided by police on Monday in connection with investigations into corruption in football. "We can confirm that search warrants were served on three football clubs and the homes of two individuals, between 0730 and 0900 today, in connection with corruption in football and its impact on owners and shareholders," a City of London police spokesman said. "These searches are part of the force's ongoing investigation into football corruption." The spokesman declined to give any further details although Northumbria Police said later on Monday that they were aware of an operation at St James' Park, home of Premier League club Newcastle United. City of London Police said the investigation was independent of the Stevens inquiry into transfer irregularities that concluded last month. Former London police chief Lord Stevens and his Quest team examined 362 transfer deals, clearing all but 17 of them. Of those outstanding, Stevens stopped short of saying there had been clear breaches of regulations -- merely that questions to agents about their deals and records had remained unanswered. Clubs and players were all cleared of any suspicion. The Premier League said earlier this year that breaches of the rules being considered included payments by clubs directly to third parties and failure to disclose payments being made by agents to other agents or third parties
