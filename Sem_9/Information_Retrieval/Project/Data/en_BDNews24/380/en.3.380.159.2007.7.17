 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Three small bombs exploded close to the conference room of the Dhaka University vice-chancellor Tuesday in the apparent fallout of the arrest of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Shahbagh police could not say who exploded the bombs. But Shahbag police sub-inspector Morshed told bdnews24.com: "The crackers were blasted to create panic on the campus." Some students of the university saw a blue-colour car speed away from the Registrar's Building immediately after the expositions at 11.32am. The explosions came when students went on strike in many educational institutions across the country, including Dhaka University, to protest the arrest of Hasina. Vice-chancellor Prof SMA Faiz described the explosions as a stray incident. "It should not be given importance. All the students and teachers want a beautiful environment in the university," he said. He sought cooperation of all including teachers and students to maintain a congenial atmosphere for education on the campus. He said the educational activities were going on normally in the university. "There is nothing to panic. I hope all will remain alert," Faiz said. Senior police officer Anisur Rahman who visited the spot told bdnews24.com: "We have collected evidencebroken pieces of a tin pot and red tapesfrom the spot." bdnews24.com/
