 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  Constitution experts say the President's visit to Singapore does not mean that he is unable to carry out his responsibilities. They also ruled out any reason to hand over the presidential power to the Speaker. President Iajuddin Ahmed went to Singapore for a routine medical check-up, but Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar said he was not "officially" aware that the President was away from Bangladesh. In case of President's absence, Sircar said, the government should publish a gazette to perpetuate article 54 of the constitution. Constitution expert Dr M Zahir said no situation had emerged with the President's visit that the presidential power had to be handed over to the Speaker. "The President's visit to a not-so-distant country like Singapore does not mean he is absent in office. So Iajuddin Ahmed is the President now," Zahir said. Barrister Amir-ul Islam, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said: "We don't think that the President is unable to do his job. The matter is incidental. There is no question of constitutional controversy." In an interview with bdnews24.com, Sircar said he read the news in newspapers. "As newspapers are not legal documents, I assume that he is present (in the country)," he said. He referred to the constitutional provision that says the Speaker will act as President during his absence. "If a vacancy occurs in the office of the President or if the President is unable to discharge the functions of his office on account of absence, illness or any other cause, the Speaker shall discharge those functions until a President is elected or until the President resumes the functions of his office, as the case may be," according to the constitution. bdnew
