<TITLE> Germany's Beck eyes other coalitions in 2009 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Germany's Social Democrats said on Sunday he was open to new coalition partners under the right conditions in 2009 with any of the three opposition parties -- Free Democrats, Greens or Left party. Kurt Beck told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung that there was scope for his party, in a loveless grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats for the last two years, to form other alliances after the next election. Beck said there were hurdles to alliances with all three small parties, currently the opposition in parliament. But Beck, whose SPD badly trails Merkel's CDU in opinion polls, sketched out what it would take for a new three-party coalition. "If the FDP views their liberal policies as a free way of living and views us as a social conscience, there are a whole lot of areas where our interests overlap," said Beck, 58. "There would be more connecting us than just wanting to take power." Beck, state premier of Rhineland-Palatinate since 1994 and the SPD's likely chancellor candidate in 2009, ruled in such an SPD-FDP coalition in the southwestern state for 12 years until winning an absolute majority in 2006. The SPD ruled at the federal level with the FDP between 1969 and 1982. But the rise of the Left party has made it difficult for the SPD -- or CDU -- to form a majority government without a third partner. That is why they are now in a grand coalition. Beck, under pressure in his party over slumping support in opinion polls, added there were nevertheless "differences between the SPD and FDP that would still have to be overcome". The same was true for the Greens and Left party, he said. "The Greens have become a very different party at the federal level than they were a few years ago," Beck said of the SPD's junior coalition partners from 1998 to 2005. "You can work together well with them." The grand coalition has grown increasingly fragile in recent months as the two long-time rivals have squabbled over a number of issues after fairly smooth sailing for the first 18 months. Beck on Sunday blasted Left leader Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD chairman who defected, as "dishonest and cynical" for costly promises to low-income workers, pensioners and unemployed. The Left's gains have hit the SPD hard. Beck has so far ruled out a federal alliance with the Left -- even though the SPD, Greens and Left would have a majority in parliament even now. But he appeared to open the door on Sunday by saying "realistic policies" from the Left could change that. When asked if the SPD could form a coalition at the federal level with the Left if Lafontaine were kept out, Beck said that was only part of the problem. "The decisive question is whether the Left party is ready to pursue realistic policies or whether they want to stick to their unrealistic demand
