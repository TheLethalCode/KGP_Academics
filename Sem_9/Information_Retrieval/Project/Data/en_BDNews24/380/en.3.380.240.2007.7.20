<TITLE> Middle East Quartet backs Bush peace drive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LISBON, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Quartet of Middle East mediators threw its weight on Thursday behind a US plan to reinvigorate stagnant Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking and pledged support for all Palestinians, including in Gaza. The Quartet met for the first time since Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip from US-backed President Mahmoud Abbas's forces last month, effectively dividing Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank. The meeting of top diplomats from the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations was also the first with Tony Blair as its envoy. Delegates hope he will help kick-start Middle East peace moves with passion and commitment. "I hope I can offer something in bringing about a solution to this issue that is of such fundamental importance to the world," Blair told reporters after the meeting. "I hope I can create the conditions under which this two-state solution can become a reality," said Blair, referring to Israel and a Palestinian state existing side-by-side. "This is an issue I have been passionate about for many years," he said before travelling to the Middle East next week. US President George W. Bush announced this week he intends to hold a Middle East peace conference in the autumn, probably in the United States. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice soon will visit the Middle East to try to boost support for the conference. BUSH STATEMENT WELCOME "The quartet welcomed President Bush's July 16 statement," United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, reading from a statement issued by the Quartet. "What you have heard today is a recommitment of the international community to rapidly pursue policies that can lead to that outcome (a two-state solution)," Rice said. It is years since Israel and the Palestinians last discussed issues at the root of the conflict -- final borders of a Palestinian state, the return of refugees and the status of Jerusalem. Building peace in the Middle East will not be made easier by a Hamas takeover of Gaza which has changed the Palestinian political landscape. The Quartet pledged to go on supporting Gaza Palestinians. Aid agencies have urged an easing of an effective trade embargo on Gaza, where poverty is increasing. "We are going to continue helping the Palestinian people that are in Gaza," said European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana. On Monday, Blair will visit Israel and the West Bank, where Abbas's Fatah is in control. It will be his first visit since he became the Quartet's envoy on the day he stepped down as prime minister after 10 years in power. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met Abbas this week but Israel again ruled out negotiations for now on the borders of a future Palestinian state. To help Abbas, Israel decided to release 256 Palestinian prisoners.
