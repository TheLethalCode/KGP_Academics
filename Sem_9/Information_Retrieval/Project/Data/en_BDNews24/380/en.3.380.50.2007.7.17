<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman demanded Tuesday that the government free Sheikh Hasina as soon as possible. Addressing a press conference at his Gulshan home, he said: "The government might have considered that Hasina's image would be tarnished if arrested, but in reality her image has grown in stature instead." Zillur told reporters that some media reports about a meeting of the AL presidium members to be held at his home had created some misunderstanding. After it was announced that he would run the president's office in Hasina's absence, a number of AL leaders and workers visited his house. "As a result, we notified everyone that I'd see visitors Tuesday from 11am to 1pm. It's not exactly a presidium meeting, you see." The AL leader also said that Sheikh Hasina had endorsed the caretaker government from its inception in January. "She had told all that the AL would ratify all the caretaker government's decisions once they were in government." In the circumstances he wondered how the government could 'malevolently' detain the AL chief, "When no charge-sheet had been submitted to the court based on which a warrant of arrest should be issued." Only then could she be held lawfully, according to Zillur. Replying to reporters' questions, Zillur said: "We'll appeal to the High Court for Sheikh Hasina's bail as soon as we get a copy of the court order in this case." On AL presidium member Abdur Razzak's alleged comments on his assuming the party president's responsibilities, Zillur said: "Razzak told me last night that he would always support me and that he had never said anything derogatory about me to any TV channel." The AL leaders who met the acting party president in the morning included Motia Chowdhury, Subid Ali Bhuiyan, Dr Dipu Moni, BM Mozammel Haque, Latif Siddiqui, Shawkat Ali, Dr Hasan Mahmud and Khairuzzaman Liton. bdnews24
