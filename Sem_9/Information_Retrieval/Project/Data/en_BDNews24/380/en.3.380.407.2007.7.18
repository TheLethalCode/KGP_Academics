The magazine's `Powergeek 25' list was compiled to show the behind-scenes-players reshaping the way people listen to, buy and watch music. "Music fans spend much of their day, if not their life, sitting in front of their computer, discovering and downloading music," Blender's editor-in-chief Craig Marks said in a statement. "Today's power brokers no longer work in the steel-and-glass towers of the traditional record business; instead, they're tech geeks, bedroom bloggers and Silicon Valley visionaries." He said Jobs, who co-founded Apple Inc and is chief executive of the company, had proved to be a technology trendsetter. "The iTunes Store and the iPod have done more to change the way people listen to music than anything since the CD, and maybe since the sound recording," Marks said. The magazine put Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe, co-founders of the the popular social networking site MySpace as second in `The Powergeek 25'.

At No 4 was 68-year-old Universal Music Group chairman/CEO Doug Morris, whom the industry sees as a main influencer of digital music policy moves, including royalties and licensing. Ryan Schreiber, who set up the Web magazine Pitchfork, was named fifth with his online music publication having "the power to create instant audiences for tiny bands like Art Brut and the Go!
