 KARACHI, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan captains Javed Miandad, Intikhab Alam and Zaheer Abbas criticised the national board on Monday for choosing another foreign coach in Geoff Lawson. "How can you expect a foreigner to have the same feeling of patriotism or nationalism that a Pakistani does? Instead of bringing in foreigners the board should first try to improve the grass-root cricket level," Miandad told Reuters. Australian Lawson was confirmed as the new coach by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier on Monday, succeeding former England international Bob Woolmer who died of suspected heart failure during the World Cup in the West Indies in March. "If these foreign coaches can give a guarantee that the team will achieve a certain level of performance, fine. Otherwise it is a waste of money for me," added Miandad, who appeared in 124 tests and was coach of the senior team for three terms. Under Woolmer, Pakistan went out in the first round of the World Cup after losing to Ireland. Intikhab, who was manager-cum-coach when Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup in Australia, said Lawson was in for a tough time. "I have nothing against him but he should be prepared for a lot of criticism and a hard time," said Intikhab. "The board should first try to find out if we really need a foreign coach and than take a decision. I believe some of our players are equally good and capable of delivering results as they have done in the past." Lawson's appointment was announced by the PCB after a meeting of its ad-hoc committee on Monday but the news had already been given to Australian media by the new coach himself. "What was the purpose of having the meeting if the board had already taken a decision?" Zaheer asked. "I worked as manager with Woolmer and I can say our own players are equally good.
