<TEXT>
 KABUL, Monday, July 16- (bdnews24.com/AFP)--- Afghan President Hamid Karzai criticised some madrassas in Pakistan for teaching violent extremism Sunday, as he forgave a teenager who said he was sent across the border to carry out a suicide attack. "Today we're facing a very regretful, painful fact," Karzai told a media conference, joined by 14-year-old Rafiq-Ullah and his father Mati-Ullah, from Pakistan's troubled Taliban-dominated South Waziristan tribal region. "A child of Islam that his father had sent to a madrassa for education was tempted by the enemies of Islam to carry out a suicide attack," he said. "I forgive you," Karzai told the boy -- who was detained in May in eastern Khost province, where the boy said he was sent to carry out a suicide attack on the governor -- giving him 100,000 Afghani (2,000 dollars) to travel back home. Asked whether he had a message for Pakistan, the Afghan president said Kabul wanted good ties with Islamabad, a key US ally in its 'war on terror.' "The message of the Afghan people is one of kindness, the message of mercy," he said. "It's the message of having good relations, brotherly relations. "It's the message for trade and exchange," he added, "not to deceive the children of people and encourage them to carry out suicide attacks, destroying themselves, their families and other Muslims." Rebel attacks including Iraq-style suicide bombings -- once unheard in this Central Asian nation -- have over the past two years increased in Afghanistan, where US-led and NATO forces are fighting an Islamic insurgency. Some Pakistani madrassas have been accused of sponsoring religious violence, a legacy of Afghanistan's 1979-89 Soviet occupation when some seminaries, with US and Saudi funding, became training camps for Islamic holy warriors.
