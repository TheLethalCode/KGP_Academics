"The update is always scheduled to take place on Aug. 1 each year but as no series are set to finish ahead of that date, it can be carried out now." World champions Australia stretched their lead to 26 rating points with England placed second on the list, which is now down to nine teams. Sri Lanka and South Africa have jumped two spots to third and fourth respectively, ahead of India and Pakistan.
