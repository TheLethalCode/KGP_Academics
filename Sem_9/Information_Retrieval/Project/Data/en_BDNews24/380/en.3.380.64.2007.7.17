 MADRID, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New signing Diego Forlan is unconcerned about the pressure of stepping into the shoes of Fernando Torres at Atletico Madrid following the departure of the talismanic striker for Liverpool. "It's understandable that people are trying to compare us, but I'm very relaxed about it because we are different players at different moments in our careers," the Uruguay international said after signing a four-year contract on Tuesday. "Ever since I started playing football I've had the responsibility of playing well and you always work hard to ensure you can do the best you can. "There are times when things are better or worse, but you train hard to ensure they work out well." The 28-year-old, who played for Uruguay in the recent Copa America, has joined Atletico from Villarreal for a fee of between 21 million and 23 million euros ($28.97 million - $31.73 million). Torres, who was Atletico's leading scorer in each of the past five seasons, moved to Liverpool for 36 million euros earlier this month. "This is a club with a lot of history and it is a great challenge for me," said Forlan. "I want to keep things as simple as possible and help the team with plenty of assists as well as goals." The Uruguayan had a successful three seasons at Villarreal, ending his first campaign as the top scorer in the Primera Liga with 25 goals and adding a further 29 in the next two seasons. Prior to his $3.8 million move to Villarreal, he had a frustrating spell at Manchester United. Arriving at Old Trafford from Argentine side Independiente for $13.7 million in January 2002, it took him eight months and 27 games before he scored his first goal for the club. He never managed to win a regular place in the United first team and had to content himself with a bit-part role as a substitute. Atletico finished in seventh place in the Primera Liga last season to qualify for the Intertoto Cup
