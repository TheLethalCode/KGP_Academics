 MUMBAI, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian batsman Vangipurappu Laxman has been signed up by English county Lancashire for the second half of the season as a replacement for Australia's Brad Hodge. The 32-year-old will play in the three-test series against hosts England starting on Thursday and then stay back to make his debut in county cricket. "I'm so thrilled to be signing for a great club like Lancashire for my first taste of county cricket," Laxman told the club's web site on Wednesday. Laxman was discarded from the Indian one-day side in 2005. India next play a test series against Pakistan at home in November
