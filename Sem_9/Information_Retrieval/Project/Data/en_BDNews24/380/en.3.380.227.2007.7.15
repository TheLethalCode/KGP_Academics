 CARACAS, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uruguay defender Diego Lugano, whose missed penalty led to the semi-final defeat against Brazil, was sent off and gave away a penalty as his side lost 3-1 to Mexico in the Copa America third-place match on Saturday. Sebastian Abreu put Uruguay ahead in the 21st minute when he headed in Maximiliano Pereira's header at the far post but the game turned in the 37th minute when Lugano elbowed Gerardo Torrado in the penalty area. Lugano, who missed Uruguay's last kick in the penalty shootout against Brazil on Tuesday, was sent off and a penalty was awarded which was converted by Cuauhtemoc Blanco. Long-range goals from Omar Bravo in the 68th minute and substitute Andres Guardado seven minutes later completed Mexico's win.
