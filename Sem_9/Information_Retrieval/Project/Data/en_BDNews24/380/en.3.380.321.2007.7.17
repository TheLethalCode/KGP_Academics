<TITLE> Business costs at Chittagong seaport decline 40%: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  The cost of doing business in the country's prime Chittagong seaport is now 40 percent less compared with January, an adviser said Tuesday. Shipping and communications adviser MA Matin said the new development occurred because of the stringent measures by the emergency government that increased the trouble-ridden port's efficiency by 30 percent since mid-January. Matin made the comment as he inaugurated a workshop, styled, "Improving port Efficiency: Sharing International Experience of Private Container Terminal Operations" at Purbani Hotel. The Chittagong Port Authority and the World Bank jointly organised the workshop. The port handles more than 85 percent of the country's overseas trade but shippers and businessmen alleged that pervasive corruption and inefficiency often cost them higher than normal. But the situation has improved since mid-January when the emergency government came to poweran observation the World Bank agreed on. The bank said a number of issuescancellation of terminal handling charges, appointment of private sector operator for the port's container terminal, a stronger regulatory role and crackdown on corruptionshave raised the port's efficiency. But the lending agency said the port needs more attention. It said the port's potentiality was still being hurt because of slow vessel turnaround times, low labour productivity, high number of trade-unions counterparts, restrictive and corrupt practices and poor onward connection. The bank's acting country director, Mohamed A Toure, said that the cost of doing business through the port was higher than several ports in the region. "Still the turnaround time in the port is four days while it is in only 16 hours at Karachi port," he told the workshop. Toure said the country's inland transport distribution system for containers also needs to improve significantly for better operations of the port. Adviser Matin promised further improvement. "The government is fully focused on removing all administrative bottlenecks to turn the country's premier port into a world-class one," Matin said. bdnews
