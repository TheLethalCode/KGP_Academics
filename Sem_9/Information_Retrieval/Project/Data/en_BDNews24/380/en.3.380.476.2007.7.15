 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pro-Taliban militants in Pakistan's restive North Waziristan tribal region announced on Sunday they were pulling out of a peace deal with the government, accusing authorities of violating the pact. North Waziristan is a hotbed of support for al Qaeda and Taliban militants and authorities signed a peace deal with the local fighters in September in a bid to marginalise their foreign allies.

The shura of the Taliban militants warned tribal police to stay away from the army soldiers deployed in the region or face consequences. Twenty-four paramilitary soldiers were killed and 29 wounded in a suicide bomb attack in North Waziristan on Saturday. The attack appeared to be linked to an army assault on a radical mosque in the capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday in which 75 supporters of hardline clerics, were killed.
