 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Tevez's agent Kia Joorabchian has criticised Premier League club West Ham United for their conduct over the transfer of the Argentina forward. Joorabchian issued a statement late on Wednesday accusing West Ham of "inconsistencies" in their private and public statements over the player's proposed move to Manchester United. FIFA is expected to become involved in the matter after talks between West Ham and Manchester United reached an impasse. "Press statements both today and over the last few weeks are wholly inconsistent with the real circumstances and the situation presented to us by West Ham concerning Carlos Tevez," Joorabchian said in his statement. "West Ham have consistently provided private assurances while at the same time making contrary statements to the public at large. We can no longer allow these inconsistencies to continue unaddressed." Although West Ham insist they hold the player's registration, Joorabchian said Tevez had been "given permission via his representatives to talk to other clubs". "Over the last six months West Ham have made repeated promises and assurances which they have not acted upon or performed," he said. "It is now time for these inconsistencies to be brought to an end." After talks with the Premier League on Tuesday failed to lead the parties to an agreement, Joorabchian added that there was no alternative but to seek the assistance of a "higher authority". Manchester United chief executive David Gill said earlier on Wednesday that FIFA would "probably" handle the case. Tevez joined West Ham last August with fellow Argentine Javier Mascherano who subsequently moved to Liverpool. However, the complex transfers breached Premier League rules and subsequently cost West Ham 5.5 million pounds ($11.30 million). They were allowed to continue playing Tevez at the end of last season, however, assuring the Premier League that they had torn up a third-party agreement with Joorabchian
