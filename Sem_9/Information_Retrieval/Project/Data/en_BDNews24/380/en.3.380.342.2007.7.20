 Colombo, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  Failing to make an improvement over their Test performance, Bangladesh suffered a 70-run defeat to Sri Lanka in the opener of the three-match ODI series at P Saravanamattu Stadium Friday. It was a tale of premature death of a bright prospect started by Bangladesh, who suddenly collapsed to 56 for five from 45 for no loss and were finally bundled out for 164 in 40.3 overs. Despite some wobbly fielding, Bangladeshi bowlers, exploiting the damaged condition on the pitch, provided their batsmen enough food to chase a modest total after restricting the hosts to 234 for six in 50 0vers. It seemed Bangladesh were advancing to their direction with both openers refraining from playing any rash shots, but they suddenly faced a horrible collapse to lose five wickets inside 11 runs and never returned to the game. Shahriar Nafees and Tamim Iqbal put on 45 runs for the opening stand before first-change pacer Dilhara Fernando ripped through the hosts' top orders sending back Tamim (11), Tushar Imran (0), Mohammad Ashraful (4), and Nafees (33). Spinner Malinga Bandara wrapped the tails up, but not before some entertaining strokes from Farhad Reza and Abdur Razzak. Farhad sent Sanath Jayasuriya over the rope twice, and Bandara once to crack a 29-ball 28 before the all-rounder, attempting another big hit, was caught by Upul Tharanga at long on off Jayasuriya. Razzak also smashed Bandara over the rope twice and Jayasuriya once for a 27-ball 28 before he was run out as the 10th Bangladesh batsman. Tamim played an uncharacteristic 11 off 39 balls before edging to Mahela Jayawardene off Fernando, who also saw Tushar give an easy catch to Chamara Silva in the last delivery of the same over. Then, Farveez Maharoof, who penetrated the batsmen with his accurate line and length, had Saqib Al Hasan caught by keeper Kumar Sangakkara for a first-ball duck with the scoreboard reading 47 for three in 12.3 overs. Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashrul (4) played a reckless shot to be caught by Maharoof off Fernando, who continued his misery spell to dismiss top scorer Shahriar Nafees (33 0ff 38 balls) in the next over. Fernando returned with four for 24. Lasith Malinga, who troubled the batsmen most, trapped Aftab Ahmed (16) lbw to finish his 7-over spell at one for 17. Earlier, Bangladesh's poor fielding led Sri Lanka to make 234 for six in 50 overs despite some tight bowling. Bangladesh pace duo -- Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel -- exploited the slightly damp condition to put the hosts on the back-foot after skipper Mohammad Ashraful decided to field first after winning the toss in the series for the first time. But the fielders dropped catches and mis-fielded a number of times. Though to start with, it looked like Bangladesh would be able to restrict the hosts to below 200, their wobbly fielding and loose bowling from Saqib Al Hasan and Aftab Ahmed resulted in Sri Lanka reaching the current score. Bangladesh had to pay the cost of dropping opener Upul Tharanga, who built up a significant fourth-wicket partnership of 83 after the hosts were reduced to 67 for three in 17.3 overs. The left-handed opener, dropped twice on naught, finally reached his eighth ODI fifty to score 57 off 104 bedecked with seven boundaries before getting caught by Mushfiqur Rahim off Farhad Reza. Chamara Silva, who along with Tharanga recovered their top order damage, was in fine rhythm to score a 76-ball 65, his seventh ODI fifty, before being trapped lbw by Abdur Razzak, who returned with one for 48 in 10 overs. However, two quick innings from Jehan Mubarak (22 off 20 balls) and Farveez Maharoof (16 off 12 balls) helped Sri Lanka to make 36 runs in the last five overs. Rasel sent back Sanath Jayasuirya (21) and Mahela Jayawardene (2) while Mashrafee dismissed Kumar Sangakkara (16) in the beginning of the game. Mashrafee, who had a bad time in the Test series, returned with two for 31 in 10 overs while Rasel finished his 10-over spell with two for 48. bdn
