 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) Tarique Rahman, son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, has denied any ownership in the Dinkal daily newspaper. He also claimed that he does not own any land in Gazipur and Bashundhara. He made the claims in a recent clarification on some points in his wealth statement, which was submitted to the Anticorruption Commission in June. Tarique does however hold a directorship in Dinkal Publications Ltd, part-owned by his mother. Following some misleading reports in the media, Tarique's lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told bdnews24.com Wednesday that his client was not asked to give a 'supplementary' wealth statement to ACC, but an 'explanatory' statement. ACC deputy director Zahurul Huda confirmed to bdnews24.com that Tarique had submitted an explanatory report to his wealth statement through jail authorities on July 16. On July 3, members of the national coordinating committee on serious crime had questioned Tarique about his wealth statement in Dhaka Central Jail in the presence of his lawyer. Tarique's lawyer subsequently handed the report of his client's explanations to the jail authorities for submission to the ACC. bdnews24.
