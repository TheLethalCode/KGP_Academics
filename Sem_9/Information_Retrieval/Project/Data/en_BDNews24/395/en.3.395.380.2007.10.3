<TITLE> Govt moves to set up Truth Commission </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 03 (bdnews24.com)The government has taken initiatives to form a 'Truth Commission' to restore confidence among the business community, law and information adviser Mainul Hosein said Wednesday. The commission would allow small businessmen to plead guilty to "lesser infractions" of the law without fear of lawsuits or jail term. "The government's anti-graft drive has instilled a sense of fear among businessmen, which is bad for the economy. This cannot go on," the adviser said. Speaking at the information ministry, Mainul said: "The move for the Truth Commission comes so that the businessmen can plead guilty and avoid lawsuits." The commission will fine businessmen and/or confiscate illegal assets after examining their testimonies. This would also avoid the expensive litigation processes on both sides. The adviser added that many small businessmen may have no choice but to infringe the law because the system is corrupted. "We want to make the system transparent, so that businessmen will not get a chance to be dishonest," he said. Replying to a question about sparing the businessmen but trying the politicians, Mainul said it was being done for the economic benefit and interest of the country. "On the other hand, politicians are being tried for the sake of the country, to make the system better. There's no discrimination here." Asked what moves the government was considering with respect to businessmen involved in politics, the adviser said that they were not thinking about that issue right now. "But we will see in future who is more of a businessman than politician," he added. Mainul did not give details about the process of forming the commission, though he said that input from representatives of the trade bodies would be taken into account. bdnews24
