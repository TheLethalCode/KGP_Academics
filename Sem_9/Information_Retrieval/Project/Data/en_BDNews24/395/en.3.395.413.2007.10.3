 Cox's Bazar, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Eleven Bangladeshi Buddhist monks who were studying in Myanmar have returned home after authorities recently closed down a monastery and the country's military launched a harsh crackdown on a pro-democracy movement spearheaded by native monks, officials said Wednesday. The Bangladesh Rifles initially detained them late Tuesday after they crossed the Naf river at Teknaf in Cox's Bazar but later freed them, said Major Azharul Islam of the 23rd battalion of the BDR. The monks, aged between 18 and 24, are the inhabitants of the hilly districts of Bandarban and Rangamati, Islam said. The Bangladeshi monks were briefly detained and then ordered to leave Myanmar when authorities shut down the monastery at the border town of Sitwe, said Teknaf police official Ranajit Barua. They did not report any ill treatment in detention, Barua said. The officials handed over the monks to their relatives, Barua said. bdnews2
