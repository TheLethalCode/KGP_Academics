 LONDON, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities traded near intra-day highs on Thursday, boosted by the fourth day of gains in banking stocks as credit market worries eased, while the European Central Bank kept rates on hold as expected. The DJ Stoxx banking sector index jumped 1.3 percent to 488.8, stretching gains to nearly 6 percent so far this week. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 2.5 percent as it neared the finishing line in the takeover race for ABN AMRO against an improving equity- and credit-market backdrop, easing concerns it is taking on a risky deal at a bad time. By 1155 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was 0.2 percent stronger at 1,574.6, near the day's high of 1,576.6 and wiping out earlier losses. Boosted by banking stocks, the index rose 1.3 percent in the previous three sessions. "Most of the bad news has been discounted," said one trader. "People seem somewhat relaxed about the subprime issue as companies have held up their hands and admitted to losses." The pan-European index has risen 10 percent, having fallen 13 percent in one month from a 6-1/2-year high hit in mid-July as the U.S. housing downturn spread to credit markets and battered global stocks. The European Central Bank kept its main interest rate at 4 percent on Thursday, in line with economists' expectations that rates would stay on hold due to financial market turmoil and the strong euro. Investors will mainly focus on the ECB news conference due at 1230 GMT, seeking clues on the outlook for rates. As expected, the Bank of England earlier left rates on hold at 5.75 percent for the third month running. The FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent, while the CAC 40 and DAX were flat. U.S. stock futures indicated a firm start on Wall Street. The key monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Friday TAKEOVER SAGA In Europe, shares in Fortis were up 6 percent and Santander added 1 percent. ABN shares climbed 0.6 percent to 37.7 euros, near the 38 euro level of the RBS-led consortium's offer. Barclays -- set to miss out on ABN when its offer closes later on Thursday -- rose 2.0 percent, also supported by persistent bid talk. RBS and its partners Santander and Fortis are expected to succeed with a 71 billion-euro offer for ABN when its offer period closes on Friday. "Coming to the end of the ABN uncertainty won't hurt, but it's mainly a mood that the whole sector may be through the worst," one analyst says. Among losers, SAP fell 1.0 percent, while Infineon fell 1.9 percent and STMicroelectronics 0.9 percent on negative sector comments from a brokerage. Miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton tracked weakness in commodity prices after recent hefty gains. Among standout winners, Abbot Group surged 21 percent. The oil rig operator said it has received proposals that could lead to a takeover off
