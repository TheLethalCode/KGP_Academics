 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks closed on a record high Thursday as investors rushed to take positions in bank shares to cash in yearly profit results. The rally was guided by Trust Bank, AB Bank, BRAC Bank and UCBL. "Investors are taking positions in banking shares to exploit benefits from banks' profit results," said Ahmad Rashid Lali, vice-president of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. "There is speculation that banks will increase their capital to meet new capital requirements," Lali said. The government earlier approved the Banking Companies Act which set a new limit for total capital (paid up capital plus reserve capital) for banks at Tk 2.0 billion. The main DGEN or general index rallied 30.44 points or 1.15 percent to 2672.16. This constitutes a new high, topping the previous record of 2647.51 on Oct 2. The DSI or all-share price index crossed the 2200 mark for the first time, adding 31.35 points or 1.43 percent to end on 2219.75. The DSE-20 blue chip index rose 35.54 points or 1.75 percent to end at 2056.77. Gainers outnumbered losers 143 to 42 with 13 issues finishing unchanged. A total of 16,744,183 shares were traded, worth Tk 1.83 billion. With the exception of Dutch-Bangla Bank, all banks moved up. Other financial institutions, mainly ones with merchant banking wings, also rallied. Trust Bank, the most active share, regained pace after a day of losses. It advanced 3.46 percent to end Tk 851. AB continued its rally on the expectation of good profit earnings in the current year. AB Bank increased 3.52 percent to a record high of Tk 2916. "There is speculation that AB Bank will make huge profits as it is now realising profits from its shares investments," said a market analyst, who preferred not to be named. BRAC Bank regained pace, adding 2.54 percent to Tk 1331.75 on the prospect of good growth. UCBL grew 2.76 percent to close on a new high of Tk 4725.75. Power stocks, except for Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, dropped following profit taking. Summit Power, the most active share in the power sector, fell 1.72 percent to Tk 1421.25. Mutual funds heavyweight, AIMS 1st Mutual Fund, slipped on spot market trading. It had earlier posted 10 percent cash and 20 percent stock dividends for fiscal 2006-07. Other active issues were Prime Bank, National Bank, NCC Bank and Phoenix Finance, which all ended higher. All major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also rose to record highs, spurred by banking stocks. A total of 87 scrips added, 23 declined and five held steady. Some 2,321,086 shares worth Tk 302.53 million were traded on the CSE. bd
