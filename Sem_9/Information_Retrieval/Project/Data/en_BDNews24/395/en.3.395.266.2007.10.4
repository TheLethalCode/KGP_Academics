 PRISTINA, Serbia, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo public television has broadcast footage of masked and armed members of a self-proclaimed guerrilla army who said they were ready to fight for Kosovo's independence from Serbia. The report, filmed by an independent journalist, was broadcast on Wednesday evening on Radio Television Kosovo.

Its size and potential threat has never been determined, and some diplomats have dismissed it as an 'internet army'. Serbia has called for the return of some Serb police to protect Kosovo's 120,000 Serbs. It says it does not want to send its army back eight years after it capitulated and withdrew.
