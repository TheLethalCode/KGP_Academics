<TITLE> Spain to gain most in EU parliament seat shake-up </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain is set to be the biggest beneficiary of a new carve-up of European Parliament seats agreed by the assembly's key panel on Tuesday. The redistribution of seats to reflect more closely the size of populations in the 27-nation European Union is one of the last hurdles to clear before leaders approve a reform treaty this month to replace the failed EU constitution. The EU assembly plays an increasingly powerful role as co-legislator with member governments on a swathe of internal market regulation, environmental and transport policy. Its scope will grow further under the draft treaty. The number of lawmakers is to be cut to 750 from the current temporary level of 785 but increased from the maximum of 736 envisaged by the EU's last Nice Treaty. The current number of seats is high because Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in the middle of parliament's term, which ends in 2009. Governments did not want to oust deputies from existing member states in mid-term to make room for newcomers. Of the 14 seats to be allocated, Spain will receive an extra four to take its total to 54, reflecting a 4.5 million increase in its population to 43.7 million since 2000 when the Nice Treaty was agreed. "There will no longer be categories of countries in the EU, the number of seats will reflect populations," Alain Lamassoure, French centre-right lawmaker and co-author of the scheme, said after parliament's constitutional committee backed the plan. The full assembly is set to back the reform in a vote next week and EU leaders have to approve it unanimously at a summit in Lisbon on Oct. 18-19. The second author of the scheme, Romanian Socialist Adrian Severin, was confident of the leaders' backing despite protests from some Italian and Polish deputies. "Changing anything would be like opening Pandora's box," he said. Germany, which has 82.4 million people, will lose three seats from 99. This is because the new treaty sets the biggest national quota at 96 and the smallest at six -- the number of votes available for Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta. France, with 62.8 million people, will see its seats rise by 2 to 74. Austria and Sweden will also get two extra seats each. Britain, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Latvia, Slovenia and Malta will each get one extra seat to command 73, 26, 18, nine and six seats respectively. Italy will keep 72 members. Poland increased the number of its seats by just one to 51 after the committee rejected demands by some Polish lawmakers that their country get four more votes to equal Spain. Some deputies argued Poland's population shrank by one million since 2000 because many Poles had emigrated to Western Europe since Poland joined to the EU in 2004. "Spain has so far been underrepresented," Lamassoure said, rejecting criticism that Spain's population increase mainly reflects normalising the status of illegal immigran
