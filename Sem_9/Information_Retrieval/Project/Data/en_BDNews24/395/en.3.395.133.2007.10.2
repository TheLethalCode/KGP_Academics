 NEW DELHI, Tue Oct 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Giant neighbour and friend India renewed pressure on Myanmar on Tuesday to hasten political reform, saying it had urged the military rulers to consider probing the use of force on pro-democracy campaigners. Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee held talks with his Myanmar counterpart U Nyan Win on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Monday and expressed fresh concern over the turmoil in the former Burma, a statement said. "The minister also expressed the hope that the process of national reconciliation and political reform, initiated by the government of Myanmar, would be taken forward expeditiously," the foreign ministry statement said. "Further, he suggested that the government could consider undertaking an inquiry into recent incidents and the use of force," it added.

New Delhi initially supported Nobel laureate Aung Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, but changed its strategy in the early 1990s to court the military regime in what is seen as an effort to counter rival China. It has invested in developing ports, building roads and railways, supplied arms and is also competing with Beijing for Myanmar's oil and gas reserves. The two countries have also exchanged several high-level visits in recent years. India has traditionally maintained that Myanmar's pro-democracy movement was its internal affair and the subtle change in its stance after the latest protests signal New Delhi is walking a diplomatic tightrope, analysts say. On Monday, new Indian army chief General Deepak Kapoor reiterated that Myanmar's recent troubles were its "internal matter", in yet another indication that New Delhi had not abandoned the junta. "We have good relations with Myanmar ... we are for maintaining the close relationship," Kapoor said in New Delhi after formally assuming offi
