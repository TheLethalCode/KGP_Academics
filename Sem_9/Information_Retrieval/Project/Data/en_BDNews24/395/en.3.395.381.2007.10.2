 LONDON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday in line with a rally in global equities as investors began to hope the worst of the credit crunch may be over, while UK retailer Tesco gained after reporting first-half earnings. By 0731 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.7 percent at 1,573.68 points. Not all analysts were confident the fallout of the credit crunch has peaked, however, as the index is still about 4 percent off the six-and-half year highs seen in mid-July. "I think it's bit too quick to say it's done now," said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, a strategist at Germany's Postbank. "We've seen huge (losses) at UBS, at Citigroup ... we can say next quarter will be better and the whole year will be okay, but I think these will not be the last companies we will see with problems coming out around subprime," he said. Global equities earlier hit a record high, while the Dow Jones secured a record close on Monday and Tokyo stocks touched their highest in eight weeks. The rally was triggered on Monday by UBS and Citigroup, which set out the losses stemming from their subprime investments, while Credit Suisse said its earnings would be hit although it expected to turn a profit in the third quarter. Investors are also preparing for two policy decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday, against a backdrop of stubbornly high short-term lending rates. UBS was again among the top-weighted gainers on the FTSEurofirst, rising 2.6 percent. The stock has risen nearly 6 percent in the last two trading days. Barclays rose 3.6 percent, while BNP Paribas gained 2.5 percent and Societe Generale rose 2.7 percent. Battered UK lender Northern Rock tumbled 8 percent, making it the biggest percentage decliner on London's FTSE 100 as bids for the company failed to materialise and on persistent concerns over its future. Shares in Tesco, the world's third-largest retailer, rose 3 percent making it one of the top weighted gainers on the FTSEurofirst after reporting a slowdown in growth in its core British market in the half year, but beating expectations with its like-for-like sales. The FTSE was up 0.8 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX gained 0.4 percent and Paris' CAC 40 rose 0.5 percent. Among other gainers was Spanish construction group Sacyr Vallehermoso, which rose nearly 4 percent to top Madrid's blue-chip IBEX index. Traders said Sacyr was one of the companies that had been punished in the recent stock sell-off and investors were starting to buy back. They brushed off a report on financial gossip website El Confidencial that Sacyr could sell its stake in French transport concessions group Eiffage. The Sacyr-Eiffage row is currently held up in courts. Eiffage was the biggest percentage decliner, falling 2.8 perce
