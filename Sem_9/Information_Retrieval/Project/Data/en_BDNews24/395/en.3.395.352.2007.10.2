 DUBLIN, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish airline Aer Lingus said on Tuesday it will freeze staff pay until unions drop their opposition to a cost-cutting plan designed to stave off the threat posed by budget carriers like Ryanair. The cost cutting plan was first presented to unions in December 2006 and was endorsed by Ireland's Labour Court in March. The carrier said it had been in talks with unions for months over implementing the plan. Aer Lingus, the target of a failed hostile takeover bid by Ryanair Holdings Plc, has been battling with unions to cut overheads since its privatisation last year. "Aer Lingus cannot continue to wait indefinitely to achieve essential savings," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said in a statement. "It is within this context that the decision to suspend increases has been taken." Mannion said three separate payment increases, totalling 7.5 percent, had been frozen until there was a "full and complete implementation" of its plan. "The (annual) value of the 7.5 percent in total is about 20 million euros ($28.4 million)," Mannion told a news conference call. "We are doing this because we have reached the end of the line." The initiative has also aimed to cut other costs including fuel, maintenance and airport handling. Aer Lingus said a management pay freeze was in place since the start of 2007. Mannion said he was confident Aer Lingus would implement the plan "in full before the end of this year". He could not "anticipate" how unions would respond. "We will operate on the basis pretty soon I think of what is good for one is good for the other," Jack O'Connor, General President of the large SIPTU union, told RTE Radio. Shares in Aer Lingus were trading 0.9 percent higher at 2.35 euros by 1330 GMT, compared with a 3.8 percent gain in the wider Irish market. Mannion said in a letter to staff that failure to ensure savings would prevent the airline from maintaining a year-on-year reduction in cost per passenger achieved over the past 5 years. He said cutting passenger costs was a "cornerstone" of its defence against "the competitive threat" from low fare airlines and US carriers on transatlantic routes. Aer Lingus said in August it would transfer valuable London Heathrow slots from Shannon to a new Belfast base in Northern Ireland. The move has triggered strike threats by Aer Lingus pilots who fear staff in Northern Ireland will be employed on lower pay than those in the Republic of Ireland. In September, Aer Lingus rejected a second request by its biggest shareholder Ryanair, Europe's biggest low cost carrier, to hold a vote over the plan to cut the London-Shannon rou
