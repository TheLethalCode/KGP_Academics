<TITLE> Nigeria wants Angola to return detained oil rebel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ABUJA, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria has asked Angola to send back a rebel and suspected arms dealer from the oil-producing Niger Delta to face trial at home, a senior Nigerian government source said on Wednesday. Angolan authorities detained Henry Okah of the rebel Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) on Sept. 3 on arms trafficking charges. The group threatened to resume attacks after Okah's arrest and delta activists fear this could derail government efforts to negotiate with the rebels and find a lasting solution to violence in the region. "The federal government has made requests to the Angolan authorities through the office of the national security adviser that Okah be brought to Nigeria for trial," said the source, who requested anonymity because the case is politically sensitive. "It is not yet decided what government would do with him but it is advised that he be extradited back to Nigeria in view of the Niger Delta problem," said the source. Presidential spokesman Olusegun Adeniyi confirmed the government had asked Angola to return Okah but that the absence of an extradition treaty made this difficult. The MEND was responsible for a series of attacks on oil production facilities and kidnappings of foreign oil workers in the Niger Delta in early 2006 that shut down about a quarter of output from Nigeria, the world's eighth-biggest oil exporter. The group demands "resource control", or local control over oil revenues which it says have been stolen or squandered by Nigerian governments to the detriment of delta residents. After the initial onslaught, the MEND's attacks became less frequent and it failed to carry out its initial threat to completely shut down the Nigerian oil industry. The rebel group has yet to carry out its threat to resume attacks. President Umaru Yar'Adua and Vice President Goodluck Jonathan, who comes from the delta, have tried to reach out to rebels and promised a 15-year development plan to address the underlying causes of conflict. But their efforts are complicated by the fact that there are many competing armed groups, often hard to distinguish from criminal gangs. The government source said Okah was suspected of involvement in several cross-border criminal activities. "He is accused of gun running and even has a case in Equatorial Guinea concerning an abortive coup sometime in the past," the source said. Okah is widely believed to be the same person who has consistently spoken for the MEND using the pseudonym Jomo Gbomo and presented himself as the group's leader. "I think he is Jomo Gbomo but he is not leader of MEND, just their spokesperson who was dishing out propaganda from the comfort of his home in South Africa. The fact is, however, that he represents the best known 'face' of the militants," said the source. The MEND has never publicly explained its structure and hierarchy and several armed groups have used that name, making it hard to discern who is doing what in the moveme
