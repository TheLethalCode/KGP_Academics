<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court began hearing a last-ditch opposition bid to block military president Pervez Musharraf's re-election as a possible ally, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, was due to decide her election strategy. General Musharraf, a major US ally and leader of nuclear-armed Pakistan since he took power in a 1999 coup, looks set to win re-election on Saturday in votes by the two-chamber parliament and four provincial assemblies. But Musharraf has lost popularity since trying to sack the country's top judge in March and still needs to bolster his support, especially because his ruling coalition is expected to lose its majority in a general election due by mid-January. Self-exiled Bhutto, who has been in talks with Musharraf, was due to meet party officials in London on Wednesday to decide whether to join an opposition boycott of the presidential vote. On Tuesday the government said it had decided to drop corruption charges against her. Musharraf has promised to quit as army chief if he is re-elected and serve his new term as a civilian. He nominated a successor as army chief on Tuesday, the clearest sign yet he would keep his vow and hang up his uniform. In a major boost to Musharraf last week, the Supreme Court dismissed challenges to his re-election while army chief. Nevertheless, his opponents have launched new legal challenges to block his re-election, arguing that as army chief he is ineligible and that anyway the presidential vote should be held after general elections. The Supreme Court took up the case on Wednesday but the session was briefly adjourned when a judge, who had taken part in the hearing into the challenges dismissed last week, said he did not want to sit on the nine-member bench hearing the case. "I have already expressed my opinion and it is not possible for me to change it," judge Sardar Raza Khan told the court. Khan had opposed the dismissal of the challenges last week. A reconstituted, eight-member bench later began considering the case. Pakistan's main stock index ended nearly 1 percent higher on Wednesday. It has put on more than 5 percent this week, largely on hope that Musharraf, who has overseen strong growth and booming stocks, will win re-election. An opposition alliance led by the party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is boycotting the presidential election in protest against Musharraf's participation. Its members have resigned from the national and provincial assemblies to deprive the electoral college of their votes. The walk-out will not derail the vote but will detract from its credibility. Bhutto's party, the biggest in the opposition, has not joined the walk-out although she has said her members might do so after all unless her demands for democratic reforms are met. Bhutto, who is planning to return home on Oct. 18, has been in talks with Musharraf on sharing power and one of her main demands has been that she and other civilian officials be given immunity from prosecution. On Tuesday, the government moved to address that, saying it had decided to drop graft charges against Bhutto and others. But a minister said the government still had reservations about another main demand from two-time prime minister Bhutto -- that a ban on a third term for prime ministers be lifted. Bhutto has also insisted that Musharraf run for re-election as a civilian but the decision to drop the corruption cases could convince her assembly members to at least take part in the vote, giving it vital credibili
