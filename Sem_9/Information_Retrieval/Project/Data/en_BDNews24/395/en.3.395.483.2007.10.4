<TITLE> Link to submarine cable snaps in Chittagong </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The optical fibre link of the BTTB that connects the country with its online submarine cable system snapped at about 10pm Wednesday on Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway, some 96km south of Chittagong. The disruption has upset Bangladesh's online and internet telephone links with the rest of the world. Miscreants damaged the cable on a bridge, a BTTB official alleged. "They broke the concrete protection that safeguards the metal pipe which harnesses the optical fibre cable," said a BTTB high official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said BTTB's maintenance crew rushed to the site of occurrence and that authorities were hoping to restore the link by Thursday. "The miscreants apparently tried to steal the galvanised iron pipe," the official said. But he said it would have been of no use as authorities had deliberately perforated the pipe to diminish the commercial value for the thief. The transmission link to the submarine cable system was sabotaged twice in Aug, keeping the country isolated from the rest of the world for 29 hours. A few internet service providers with satellite backup links are able to provide degraded services during such crisis. bdnews2
