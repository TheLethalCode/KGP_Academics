 KARACHI, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African selectors have named Vernon Philander to replace the injured Morne Morkel in their squad touring Pakistan. Fast bowler Morkel fractured his left foot during training before the first test and has been advised to rest for at least six to eight weeks. Philander, 22, who recently played in the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa, has appeared in five one-day internationals since making his debut this year. "Philander will be reaching Karachi on Friday to join the team before the second test," Owen Smith, the team spokesman, said. Smith also said that Australian wicketkeepers Ian Healy and Adam Gilchrist had also sent messages of congratulations to Mark Boucher after he broke Healy's world record for most test dismissals as a wicketkeeper. Boucher crossed Healy's 395 dismissals on the third day of the first test against Pakistan on Wednesday
