 DUBLIN, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish entrepreneur Tony Ryan, who founded Europe's biggest low-cost airline Ryanair, died on Wednesday after suffering from a long illness, his family said. Ryan, 71, founded the airline 23 years. "We are proud of Tony's many achievements, of his spirit of entrepreneurship which created enterprise and opportunity for many people in this country and abroad," Ryan's family said in a statement. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, considered by many to be Ryan's protegee, described him as "one of the greatest Irishmen of the 20th Century". "It was a privilege to work for him and to learn from him. I will miss his guidance, encouragement and friendship," O'Leary said. "We are all determined that Ryanair will continue to carry his name with pride and distinction."
