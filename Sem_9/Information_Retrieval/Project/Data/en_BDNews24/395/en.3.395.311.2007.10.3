<TITLE> Bhs remains cautious despite recent sales pickup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Department stores group Bhs has seen a pickup in sales in recent weeks but billionaire owner Philip Green said it was still too early to say the tide had turned for Britain's struggling retailers. "It's just too early ... to be able to call it. We haven't seen enough of the road yet," Green told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday. "As a retailer you'd want to be cautious ... You need another month at least to get some sort of flavour of what it is going to be like," he added. Green was speaking after Bhs reported a 3 percent increase in operating profit to 50 million pounds ($102 million) for the year to March 31, on sales up 1.4 percent at 872.5 million. Like-for-like sales fell by 1.5 percent last year, but were flat so far this financial year having climbed 3 percent in the latest six weeks, Bhs said in the results statement. Green put the recent improvement down to more favourable weather conditions. "We've got slightly more seasonable weather conditions in September than last year," he said. Britain's retailers have struggled as debt-laden shoppers face higher interest rates, and the wettest summer on record made life particularly tough for clothing sellers. Last month, rival Next Plc's Chief Executive told Reuters the retail environment was getting tougher, with recent interest rate rises yet to filter through.Department stores group Debenhams Plc also warned of tough conditions. Last year, Bhs reported a 54 percent drop in operating profit to 48.5 million pounds as mistakes within womenswear hit sales and margins, with like-for-like sales down 7.1 percent. "The market remains competitive and underlying cost growth continues to be challenging," Green said in the Bhs statement. NO PAYOUT FOR GREEN Like last year, Bhs decided against paying a dividend to Green, having made big payments to him in the past, preferring instead to focus on refurbishments. "We don't need the money ... We're investing in the business and we continue to do that," Green told Reuters. Green said the chain is expected to spend a total of around 100 million pounds ($204 million) refurbishing its stores and is only about 20 percent of the way through that programme. Sales from those stores already refurbished had seen sales up 12 percent on the rest of the business, which Green said was an "encouraging signal ... which is why we want to drive the refurbishment". Seymour Pierce analysts said in a note that since Green had taken back control, Bhs's product had improved "beyond all recognition" and been refocused on its older core customers. "It is remarkable how cash generative this business has been, the analysts said, adding that net cash generated after capital expenditure was 53.39 million pounds. "Moreover, with the merchandise issue resolved and the store refurbishment programme underway, if this year doesn't turn out to be Bhs's year, then next year almost certainly will. A far cry from those who had entirely written off the business". Bhs said bank debt had fallen to 61.8 million pounds, down from 115.2 million last year. "We'll be debt free at Christmas ... which will give us the flexibility to do whatever we want to do," Green said, adding that the group had no targets lined
