 HONG KONG, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks scaled a fresh peak on Wednesday led by financial shares as worries about a global credit squeeze continued to recede, while the dollar slipped after two sessions of gains ahead of key US data this week. Both gold and US crude found a steadier footing following recent sharp declines, and government bonds were bid higher after more bad news on the US housing market kept alive hopes of further US interest rate cuts. Data from an industry report on Tuesday showed pending sales of previously owned US homes fell to the lowest on record, indicating the dire housing market could worsen. US jobs data on Friday will be in the spotlight after payrolls shrank for the first time in 4 years in August. "The credit issues have subsided and that has helped push the market higher, but my concern is maybe we're still not quite out of the woods yet," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO in Australia. "The rate of rise (in the market) would suggest a plateauing or some kind of pull back." At 0305 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had climbed 0.6 percent, while Tokyo's Nikkei was flat, pausing after closing above 17,000 for the first time in nearly eight weeks on Tuesday. The MSCI index hit a fresh high of 553.02 earlier in the session, surpassing the previous peak of 550.71 set on Tuesday. Since plumbing a five-month trough of 402.72 on Aug. 17, the index has soared about 37 percent as credit fears diminished following interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. MSCI's All-Country World index was just shy of Tuesday's record peak and is up nearly 14 percent this year. FINANCIALS UP, TOYOTA DOWN Investors betting that the worst of the credit problems may be over bought shares of banks such as Australia's Macquarie Bank , HSBC Holdings and brokers including Nomura Holdings The MSCI index of financial stocks in the Asia Pacific region rose 1.5 percent. But they sold Toyota Motor, sending the stock down 0.7 percent after the Japanese car maker posted a 1 percent fall in US sales in September, its third monthly decline in a row. Energy shares such as Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum also struggled after the recent fall in US crude. Oil which settled at $80.05 on Tuesday, was steadier at $80.25 a barrel. Among major regional markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index and Singapore's Straits Times Index all set fresh life highs. South Korean financial markets were shut for a public holiday. DOLLAR OFF HIGHS The embattled dollar slipped after two sessions of gains but held above a record low against a basket of currencies reached recently. Investors were wary about pushing down the dollar amid expectations that euro zone finance officials were looking to a Group of Seven meeting later this month to express support for a strong dollar and provide some relief to the euro zone. The European currency has risen 10 percent against both the dollar and yen in the past year. "The market has become increasingly cautious of buying up the euro against the dollar after a number of comments from European officials on currencies," said Hideyuki Inoue, chief manager of currency trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Bank. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.12 percent to 78.207, but held above an intraday lifetime low of 77.657 set on Monday. The euro rose to $1.4171 and popped above 164 yen while the dollar traded at 115.73 yen little changed from late New York levels. The Australian dollar edged higher towards 89 US cents after strong retail sales data reinforced expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia will keep its monetary tightening bias. Earlier, the RBA kept its official cash rate unchanged at 6.5 percent after its policy-setting meeting in a widely expected move. Japanese government bonds remained buoyed by gains in US Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond slipped half a basis point to 1.680 percent. bd
