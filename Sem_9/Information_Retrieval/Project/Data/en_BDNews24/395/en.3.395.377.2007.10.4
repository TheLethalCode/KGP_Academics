<TITLE> JP (Monju) wants EC to bar war criminals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Jatiya Party (Monju) Thursday asked the chief election commissioner to declare terrorists and war criminals ineligible for the polls. Its leaders also tabled a 14-point charter of demands during their dialogue with ATM Shamsul Huda on electoral law reforms. JP secretary general Sheikh Shahidul Islam led a 11-member delegation of the JP faction. The EC has held talks with three parties since it started a series of electoral reform dialogues with the political parties on Sept 12. Meeting sources said the JP demanded the EC take responsibilities of running election campaigns for all candidates. In exchange, it proposed, the EC would ask a candidate to deposit a certain amount of money with it for meeting the campaign expenses. The JP leaders opposed the EC proposal for introducing 'negative votes' in the forthcoming elections. Election commissioners Muhammad Sahul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain, the secretary to the EC, electoral officers and law officers participated in the meeting presided over by Huda. Sheikh Shahidul Islam later spoke to journalists about a move to join the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP). "The process of forming Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi's PDP has not been complete. Once it is complete we will decide in the party council whether we will join it or not." He said party chairman Anwar Hossain Manju has resigned from the party and was now abroad and none had taken the charge of chairman. Pressed to comment on how much impact the EC's sitting with a party that does not have a chairman and whose leaders were possibly going to join other parties would have, EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir said, "It is embarrassing for me to answer this question. But the party was invited on the grounds that it had at least one seat in the last parliament." bdnews24.
