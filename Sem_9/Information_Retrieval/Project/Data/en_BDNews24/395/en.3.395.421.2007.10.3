 KHARTOUM, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eight people were killed in a shoot-out between Sudanese government forces and former rebels in the Darfur town of Nyala, a day before it was visited by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, officials said on Wednesday. Shooting broke out between fighters loyal to the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) of Minni Arcua Minnawi and government personnel late on Tuesday, said a diplomatic source who asked not to be named.

The United Nations reported that armed men seized two aid workers and hijacked their vehicle on Sunday, just 20 metres (66 feet) from their agency's base in Nyala. The two workers were released on Tuesday, one with a severe head wound. Two aid vehicles were also hijacked in North Darfur on Monday, one in the centre of the region's main town of el-Fasher, which was also visited by Tutu and other elders including former President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday. The driver of one of the stolen aid vehicles was still missing, the UN said. Experts say 200,000 have died in more than four years of fighting in Darfur and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes -- figures that Khartoum disput
