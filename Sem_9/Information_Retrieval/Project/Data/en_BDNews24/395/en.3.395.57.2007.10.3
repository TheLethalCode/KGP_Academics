<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The verdict on the graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against Awami League leader and former home minister Mohammad Nasim and wife Laila Arjumand Banu has been scheduled for Oct 8. Judge Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court-1 issued the order Wednesday. During the proceedings, Nasim's lawyer AFA Abdul Wadud appealed to the court for his release claiming him innocent. The prosecution lawyer, on the other hand, asserted that exemplary punishment should be given to Nasim as the allegations against him 'had been proven beyond doubt'. On Sept 17, in a statement, Mohammad Nasim said the ACC had instituted the case on political considerations to "defame" him and his family. An official of the ACC filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station on March 21 against Nasim and his wife on charges of concealing information on wealth worth Tk 1.63 crore in movable and immovable property in Dhaka, Pabna and Sirajganj as well as in bank accounts. ACC deputy director Hamid Bhuiyan submitted a chargesheet against the couple on July 19. The same day, judge Md Azizul Haq of the Senior Special Judge's Court sent the case to the Special Court-1 for hearing. Mohammad Nasim is in prison while his wife is on the run. bdnews
