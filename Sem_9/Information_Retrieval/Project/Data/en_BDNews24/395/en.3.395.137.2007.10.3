He avoided naming names but his comments follow growing friction over space between Moscow, Washington and Beijing. Earlier this year China tested an anti-satellite missile and the U.S. has been developing weapons which can hit satellites. Russia has more than 60 military and dual-purpose satellites in orbit for communications and intelligence, Popovkin said. Russia's space forces have responsibility for military and dual-use spacecraft launch as well as helping defend the country from hostile intercontinental missile attacks. Although the forces were left blind in some areas after the break-up of the Soviet Union, they were now reorganised, Popovkin said. "In 2009, we'll begin testing a new generation satellite. Already, Russia can detect any ballistic missile being launched from earth towards Russia," he sa
