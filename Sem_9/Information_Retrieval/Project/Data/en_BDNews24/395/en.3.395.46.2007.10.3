<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The country's top taxman Wednesday met the head of the corruption watchdog to find ways to collect taxes on tax dodgers' confiscated assets. National Board of Revenue chairman Badiur Rahman met Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury to discuss ways to bolster revenue collections during the government's corruption clampdown. NBR has sought advice from the law ministry through the finance ministry to find ways of realising lost tax revenues. Badiur Rahman declined to comment in detail to bdnews24.com, but said: "These tax evasion cases have been filed to obtain revenue. We want tax evaders to pay the government what it is owed. We are evaluating the tax ordinance to determine exactly how the taxes will be obtained." NBR member (income tax policy) Ali Ahmed had earlier told bdnews24.com: "Our main target is to boost government revenue. The purpose of these cases against undeclared income is to boost revenue, not to harass or take punitive measures. That's why I think that taxes should be collected from the confiscated wealth." Another official, seeking anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "We already sent the finance ministry a letter. NBR will act according to the proposals coming from the ministry." NBR has filed tax-dodge cases against a number of politicians for concealing wealth in their annual tax returns. The special court has already ordered the confiscation of the assets of the accused in several cases. The court confiscated Tk 51.24 crore in tax dodge cases against politicians and businessmen during the state of emergency. But the NBR has not received "back taxes" on the confiscated assets. NBR officials said the tax ordinance does not provide for seizure or confiscation for tax evasion cases. The court has ordered the confiscation of assets in the cases under the emergency powers rules. Some verdicts have been returned in the 39 cases filed by the NBR so far. The special court has awarded asset confiscations and prison terms in some cases. Most of the accused are evading arrest. In the latest case filed by the NBR, the court ordered confiscation of Tk 22.5 crore from Basundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, better known as Shah Alam, and his family. bdnews24.
