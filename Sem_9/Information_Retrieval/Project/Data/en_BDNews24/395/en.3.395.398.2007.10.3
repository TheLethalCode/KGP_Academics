 Dhaka, Oct 03 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh is set to defend itself before the US Trade Representative Thursday against the allegations of labour-rights violations and substandard shrimp and fish processing. Based on the charges, the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations lodged a complaint on June 22 and asked the US authorities to exclude Bangladesh from the Generalised System of Preferences that allows certain developing countries to export designated goods duty-free. Bangladesh did not include any commerce ministry official in the delegation to the hearing, in a break with the common practice to solve trade issues with foreign countries. M Humayun Kabir, Bangladesh ambassador to the US, will lead the delegation to the hearing with eight representatives from public and private bodies from Bangladesh. "Bangladesh will vigorously defend itself against the allegations," Golam Mostakim, additional secretary to the commerce ministry, told bdnews24.com by phone Wednesday. The US labour federation accuses Bangladesh of violating labour rights, particularly in the export procession zones, and engaging child labourers in various industries. The federation particularly focused on labour standards in the readymade garment industry and the shrimp and fish processing sector. The labour body also accused Bangladesh of harassing trade union activists. "Bangladesh exports only $8 to $10 million worth of goods to the US under the GSP facility," Fazlul Hoque, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com. "Withdrawal of US's GSP facility will not hurt Bangladesh financially, but it will incur a huge cost in terms of global goodwill," he added. In May 2004, the Bangladesh government allowed partial labour rights in the EPZ following pressure from the US. In 1990, the US labour federation filed a petition accusing Bangladesh of violating labour rights. Later, in 1999, it filed another petition following the failure of the Bangladesh government to establish labour rights in the EPZ. Bangladesh has been trying to gain complete duty-free access to the US market for a long time. A bill was raised in the US Congress in 2005 seeking total duty-free access to the US market for Bangladesh and 13 other 'least developed countries'. A little headway has so far been made. bdnew
