 KHARTOUM, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan criticised the United States and European Union on Tuesday for failing to impose sanctions on Darfur rebel groups believed to be behind the deadliest attack on African Union troops in the war-torn region. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali al-Sadig said the "most likely" culprits of Saturday's attack on the Haskanita base were a splinter group of either the rebel Justice Equality Movement (JEM) or the Sudan Liberation Army's Unity faction. The African Union said 20 of its personnel were killed or wounded and three were missing after the raid. Leaders from both JEM and SLA Unity have denied responsibility for the attack. Sudanese Justice Minister Ali al-Mardi told Reuters the international community should have punished the rebel groups that have refused to sign peace deals with the government to end the four-year conflict. "I am talking about the big powers, in particular the USA and the EU," he said. "What happened in Haskanita is a direct result of what the international community has failed to do. If they had exerted pressure on them, this attack would not have happened." The African Union mediated a peace agreement between the Sudanese government and Darfur rebels in May 2006 but only one of three rebel negotiating factions signed the deal. Since then, rebels have split into a dozen factions. The United States said late on Monday it was prepared to impose fresh sanctions on whoever ordered the worst single assault on African Union peacekeepers since the mission came to Darfur in 2004. Sadig said rebels behind the attack were "more like bandits than military groups". "The international community should come together to punish whoever was responsible," he said. The African Union said on Tuesday it had established some clear leads in its investigation into the attack, but was waiting for more firm evidence before publishing the findings. "Investigations are under way but they are not complete," said spokesman Noureddine Mezni. He said 10 soldiers wounded in the attack were being treated in Khartoum. A joint UN-AU peacekeeping force with 26,000 police and soldiers is due to deploy in Darfur next year to help the under-funded and ill-equipped 7,000-strong AU force in the vast, remote region. Experts estimate 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003 accusing the government of neglect. Khartoum mobilised mainly Arab militias to quell the revolt. Khartoum say only 9,000 people have died. A delegation of statesmen, including former US President Jimmy Carter and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was due to fly to Darfur on Tuesday to urge peace in the region ahead of talks mediated by the United Nations and AU in Libya on Oct.
