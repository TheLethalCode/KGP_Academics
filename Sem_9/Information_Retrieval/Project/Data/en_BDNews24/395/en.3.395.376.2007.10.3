<TITLE> Poland optimistic of compromise on EU treaty </TITLE>

 WARSAW, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland is optimistic of getting a compromise on a new European Union treaty that takes its demands into account, a top foreign ministry official said on Wednesday. EU leaders hope a mid-October summit in Lisbon will approve the treaty, designed to reform the bloc's institutions and replace a constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005. Poland's main demand is to incorporate into the body of the treaty the so called Ioannina Compromise allowing small groups of states short of blocking power to delay EU decisions. "I am a declared optimist when it comes to reaching a compromise at the summit," Karol Karski, deputy foreign minister responsible for European affairs, told Reuters by telephone. "We already see some understanding for the Polish position among other EU countries." Karski did not say what Poland would do if it did not reach a compromise. The European Union's biggest ex-communist member has not threatened to veto the treaty if it does not get what it wants. Karski said the treaty would be discussed when President Lech Kaczynski visits Berlin and Paris next week. Diplomats believe the final issues with Poland will only be resolved when Kaczynski attends the Oct. 18-19 summit. The summit ends just two days before a snap election in Poland and the ruling Kaczynski twins, who have often quarrelled with EU partners, are likely to be keen to show at home that the summit was a success for their diplomacy. Although the president does not face re-election until 2010, there is no certainty that his brother Jaroslaw, the prime minister, will head the government after the election.
