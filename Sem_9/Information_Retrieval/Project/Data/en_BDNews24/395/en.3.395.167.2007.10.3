 LONDON, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index rose 0.6 percent by mid-session on Wednesday, lifted by rebounding mining stocks and by Northern Rock on talk the troubled lender had two potential suitors. At 1020 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 37 points at 6,537.4, after easing 0.1 percent in the previous session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top companies was slightly higher. "Given the nature of uncertainty which faces the market at the moment, we will see continuing high level of volatility. But volatility is slowly but surely starting to return a more normal level," said Darren Winder, equity strategist at Cazenove. "The financials have been rallying in the last few days as some of the concerns about credit issues are starting to diminish. Of course, they can resurface again." Northern Rock, Britain's biggest casualty of the global credit squeeze, climbed more than 10 percent after sources said advisers of the Newcastle-based lender were in talks with buyout firm JC Flowers over a rescue bid and U.S. firm Cerberus was also interested. Elsewhere in the sector, HSBC advanced 3.1 percent after strong performance of its Hong Kong-listed shares. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB, HBOS, Alliance & Leicester and Standard Chartered were also up.

But oil shares were the biggest losing sector on the index after traders cited market talk that BP was preparing a profit warning. BP, which denied it was giving off-the-record guidance to analysts that its third quarter results would be lower than expected, fell 1.7 percent. Rival Royal Dutch Shell shed 1.3 percent. Index heavyweight Vodafone fell 1 percent. "We have seen some rotation out of mining and oils and telecoms into financials and interest rate sensitive stocks more generally at the moment," Darren said. Also on the downside, Wolseley, Kingfisher, Resolution, International Power and Tullow Oil fell after trading without the rights of dividend. Pub group shares rose as the sector caught up with the recent market recovery after the global credit squeeze jolted equities worldwide, traders said. Punch Taverns rose 3.8 percent, Enterprise Inns added 2 percent and Mitchells & Butlers put on 2.3 perce
