 LONDON, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares dipped early on Wednesday as investors pressed the pause button on a two-day rally and losses in telecoms and oil stocks offset strength in financials boosted by Deutsche Bank. At 0826 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,567.35 points, with indexes in Britain, Germany and France all lower by 0.1 to 0.3 percent. Deutsche Bank rose 1.4 percent after it said it expected quarterly net profit to exceed 1.4 billion euros and flagged third quarter charges linked to leveraged loans. Bank stocks, the worst affected by a 13-percent slump in European equities between mid-July and mid-August, continued to gain, two days after profit warnings from UBS and Citigroup were seen as removing uncertainty over damage from a credit crunch.

He said analysts were likely to revise their estimates downwards after third-quarter results were announced, but added that longer term, valuations were a cause for optimism about equities. "We see equities at the same level or slightly higher by the year-end in Europe," he said. Northern Rock, the most prominent British casualty of the credit market squeeze, soared 10 percent on a newspaper report that private equity group JC Flowers had secured 15 billion pounds of funding that could be used for a takeover. HSBC was the top weighted gainer on the index, rising 2 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland gained 1.9 percent and Barclays was up 1.6 percent. Shares in heavyweight oil groups Royal Dutch Shell, Total and BP slipped 0.8 to 1.1 percent. Traders cited market talk that BP was preparing a profit warning but BP had no immediate comment. And France's Lagardere, a major shareholder in defence and aerospace group EADS, tumbled 5.7 percent after a newspaper said that France's stockmarket watchdog has accused top executives and shareholders at EADS of selling shares before it unveiled problems at its Airbus unit.
