 LONDON, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troubles at major banks and a sharp fall in European service sector sentiment on Wednesday showed how widely wreckage from the global credit crisis has spread. But financial markets were unperturbed by the latest evidence, preferring to know what damage has been wrought and looking to buoyant forecasts of future bank revenues. Euro zone services growth suffered its biggest slowdown in at least nine years in September as market turmoil hurt business and new orders, a key survey showed. Germany's largest bank Deutsche Credit Suisse said the mortgage credit market would be problematic for the next 6-18 months but it had a strong liquidity position and saw opportunities to take advantage of trading opportunities. The Swiss bank announced on Monday its third quarter results would be "adversely impacted" but would still show a profit. U.S. giant Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, said on Tuesday it would slash 600 jobs in its residential mortgage business -- the latest sign that the home loan slump was expected to linger. Analysts said investors were more relieved that major banks were confident about profitability going forward than shocked by the scale of losses linked to the U.S. subprime mortgage market. "One would hope this is Deutsche drawing a line under its losses," said David Williams, analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. "Also Deutsche Bank's commitment to 2008 targets is encouraging." Stock markets have climbed sharply in recent sessions despite banks worldwide unveiling hefty subprime losses -- the MSCI main world equity index hit an all-time high for the third day running on Wednesday. Money market rates also eased. London interbank offered rates for three-month euro deposits inched lower from this week's six-year high, while lending rates for sterling for the same period hit a seven-week low. Almost no matter what the scale of damage to balance sheets, nothing is worse than the fear of the unknown. "A lot of the bad news is fully discounted ... and the market views as positive getting as much information out into the public domain as possible," said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at BTM UFJ. The RBS/NTC Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers Index fell to 54.2 in September from 58.0 in August, the sharpest one-month decline in its nine-year history, and Germany's index was particularly hard hit as the global credit crunch hammered business nearly twice as hard as expected. Germany has been the European nation worst afflicted by the crisis stemming from U.S. home loans mainly to people ill-equipped to pay, which were packaged into securities and sold to investors around the globe. The knock-on effect saw lending among banks seize up while they tried to work out the extent of their exposure to subprime mortgages, forcing central banks to pour money into the system to prevent it grinding to a halt. "The financial turmoil has dealt a severe blow to euro zone service industry growth," said Martin Van Vliet, economist at ING. "The sharp slowdown in overall services presumably largely reflects the problems faced by the financial services sector." But he said signs of credit markets calming, and the rebound in equity markets, pointed to better times in October. Demonstrating the global scale of the crisis, shares in RAMS Home Loans Group Ltd fell 27 percent on fears the Australian mortgage lender, hit by subprime exposure, would struggle to refinance its debts. RAMS agreed to sell its brand and distribution business to Westpac Banking Corp on Tuesday and sold A$300 million of mortgage-backed bonds on Wednesday to allow it to continue writing home loans until Westpac takes over new business. But traders and fund managers said there was still concern RAMS may not be able to cover more than A$4 billion of debt it needs to refinance in the syndicated loan market until February. Shares in Northern Rock jumped over 13 percent after sources said it was in talks with buyout firm JC Flowers over a rescue bid and US firm Cerberus was also interested. Savers besieged branches of Britain's fifth-largest mortgage lender to get their money out last month after it was forced to take emergency funds from the Bank of Engla
