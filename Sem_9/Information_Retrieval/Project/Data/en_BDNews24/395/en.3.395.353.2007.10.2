 DAR ES SALAAM, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The success of Kenya's flower export industry shows how relatively small investments and technical assistance from donors can bring huge rewards, an African trade forum heard on Tuesday. Wrapping up a two-day "Aid for Trade" meeting in Tanzania, World Trade Organisation (WTO) chief Pascal Lamy said Kenyan horticulture was a striking example of how targeted investments by lenders could boost market access and earnings. "(African nations) are improving their capacity to benefit, look at flowers. It's rocketing," he told reporters. "This region is becoming so competitive in the global market because you have good natural conditions, labour costs are lower than in the Netherlands or Florida, and there are no subsidies on flowers in the Western world." Kenyan flower exporters had been barred from EU and US markets due to pesticide residues on their blooms. But, Lamy said, the growers changed their processes with technical help. WTO officials estimate that for EU aid of only about 5 million euros to phase out the pesticides some five years ago, farmers were now accessing a lucrative and growing market. Horticulture earned Kenya more than $700 million last year as the sector overtook tea to become the east African country's second highest forex earner after tourism. Kenya is now the biggest exporter of cut flowers to the European Union, with a market share of some 32 percent, up from 11 percent in 2005. The sector employs some two million Kenyans directly, 80 percent of them small-scale farmers. The trade forum in Dar es Salaam, which was organised by the WTO, African Development Bank and United Nations, was the third in a series of regional meetings that will report to a WTO "Global Review" in Geneva on Nov. 20-21. Africa's share of world trade is less than 3 percent, experts say, and often crumbling infrastructure make the cost of doing business there far higher than elsewhere. The cost per mile of operating a two-axle truck in Tanzania, for instance, is more than twice as much as in Indonesia or Pakistan. "We have heard the problem is not a lack of competitive firms, but the lack of competitive economic systems," Lamy said in his closing speech to delegates. "If we can address this problem Africa can compete with the worl
