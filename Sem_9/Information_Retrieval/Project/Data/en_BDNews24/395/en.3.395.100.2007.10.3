 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Wednesday had the green signal to hold the elections of the District and Divisional Football Associations (DFA) in accordance with the FIFA-approved constitution. The NSC has advised the country's football body in writing to take the necessary steps to hold the DFA elections in keeping with the existing laws in the country. "After examining the FIFA-approved DFA constitution, the NSC has asked us to take steps to form DFA in course of time and we have called an emergency meeting on Friday," said BFF acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu Wednesday. The BFF received the FIFA-approved DFA constitution on September 27 and sent it to the NSC on September 30 for the final approval from country's supreme sports body. To implement the DFA constitution, it needs to get the approval from the BFF annual general meeting (AGM), and the BFF emergency meeting will finalise the date of AGM. According to the DFA constitution, the divisional associations will be a 12-member committee and the district associations an 11-member committee through elections. Sources said that assistant deputy commissioner and police supers of the respective divisions and districts would head the committees through elections in the way the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) president is elected. The FIFA has asked the BFF to appoint a salaried general secretary and a deputy secretary on the DFA committees meaning the BFF has to arrange the elections sans the posts of general and deputy secretary.
