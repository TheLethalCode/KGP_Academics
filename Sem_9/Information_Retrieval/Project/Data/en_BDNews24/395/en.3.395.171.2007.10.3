 BERLIN, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday's German Unity Day holiday there was still a lot to be done to rebuild the former Communist east as a new opinion poll revealed one in five Germans want the Berlin Wall back. Germany marked the 17th anniversary of its 1990 reunification on Wednesday with a ceremony in the eastern city of Schwerin, where Merkel said rebuilding the east would remain a top priority for years to come. "When you look around at all that's happened, you can see we've come a long way," Merkel told ARD television. "A lot has been accomplished but there is also a lot that still has to be done. Rebuilding the east will remain a top priority." A poll by the Emnid research institute for N24 television found a stunning 19 percent wanted the Berlin Wall back again while 75 percent were glad the symbol of the division of East and West Germany during the Cold War had gone. The survey of 1,000 this week found disenchantment was most pronounced in the east, where change has been greatest -- 21 percent want the Wall back and 74 percent said they feel like they are "disadvantaged" or "second-class Germans". It was the latest poll to show deep social divisions between the two halves of Germany. Tensions and ugly finger-pointing over the economic slide in the once affluent west and social upheaval in the east have boiled over into animosities. The east still relies on massive transfers from the federal government to prop up its economy -- some 1.5 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion) since 1990 and now 90 billion euros annually. Eastern wages are still lower even though they have longer working weeks and the unemployment rate is nearly twice as high as in the west. Depopulation has also hit many eastern towns. Easterners die younger, vote for different political parties, read different newspapers and watch different films. Germans disparage each other as "Wessies" and "Ossies" and almost never inter-marry -- only two percent of the weddings each year in Berlin are between east-west couples. "The fact of the matter is that 'Ossies' and 'Wessies' can't stand each other," said Norbert Lammert, president of the German parliament, in at the start of his keynote speech in Schwerin. He said he was only quoting from a novel written in 1987 but his words stunned the audience of 700 dignitaries and a national television audience as they struck a sensitive chord. But Lammert said unification was a success story. He said nowhere has one part of a country reached out to help another part as much as in Germany and urged his compatriots to focus on the triumphs rather than moan about the "indisputable burdens."
