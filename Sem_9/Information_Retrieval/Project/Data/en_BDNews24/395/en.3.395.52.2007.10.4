<TITLE> Bloomberg sex discrimination suit accuses mayor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Edith Honan NEW YORK, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three women at the center of a lawsuit against Bloomberg LP said company officials at the highest level -- including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- condoned a systematic mistreatment of women, according to court papers filed on Wednesday. Tanys Lancaster, 38, Janet Loures, 41, and Jill Patricot, 35, three high-level executives at Bloomberg, said that they were subjected to unfair demotions, decreased compensation and were denied advancement after becoming pregnant. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last week sued the company in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on behalf of the women. The three women on Wednesday filed a motion to join the case. Bloomberg LP spokeswoman Judith Czelusniak called the motion "a publicity stunt." She said before Bloomberg stepped down as company CEO to run for mayor, he pioneered "some of the best benefit programmes around for all employees, especially families and women." He was elected mayor in 2001 but retains a majority stake in the company. In the court papers, the women said the company's culture "prizes physical image and once female executives announce that they are pregnant and/or become new mothers, they fall into disfavor." The papers said a "systemic, top-down discrimination against female employees is fostered, condoned and perpetuated by the highest levels of management within Bloomberg and by ownership of Bloomberg," including Michael Bloomberg. The lawsuit filed by the EEOC claimed the company that Bloomberg founded in the 1980s paid the women less when they returned from maternity leave. It also said the company demoted those women and replaced them with "junior" male employees. The suit said the company's human resources department dismissed the women's complaints. The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction blocking the company from discriminating based on sex and pregnancy, and seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay, compensation for lost pay, and punitive damages. It accuses the company of unlawful employment practices during a period from about February 2002 to the present. Reuters Group Plc competes with Bloomberg LP in providing news and financial data.
