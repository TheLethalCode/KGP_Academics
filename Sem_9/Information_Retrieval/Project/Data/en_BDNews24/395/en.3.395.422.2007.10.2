<TITLE> EXCLUSIVE Not giving Gandhi Nobel prize was a mistake: Nobel Foundation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Stockholm, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)  There is a long list of world leaders who were considered and debated at different points of time and yet never made it to the list, possibly reducing the weightage that the Nobel would have for many. Of the misses, there was none more stark in its omission than that of Mahatma Gandhi. And the Nobel Committee now officially, for the first time in history, regrets it and accepts it was a mistake. In Stockholm, Sweden, the executive director of the Nobel Foundation, Michael Sohlman, says that it was a mistake by the Norwegian Peace committee. "The only missing laureate we had is Gandhi. It's a big regret that he did not get it (Nobel Prize), that's very clear," Solhman admits. It is speculated that race played a major rolelaureates were exclusively selected from United States and Europe. Solhman agrees that could be the case. "There was a very narrow vision at that time. I usually don't comment on what the Nobel Committees or prize awarding institutions decide. But here, they themselves think he is the only one missing," says Sohlman. Solhman is the grandson of Ragnar Solhman, the man who executed Alfred Nobel's will after Nobel died, which resulted in the creation of the Nobel prize. At the Nobel Museum, curator and director Dr Anders Barany says the irony is that eminent personalities, who based their actions on the Mahatma's teachings, were awarded the Nobel in later years. "Mahatma Gandhi is the one we miss the most at the Nobel museum. I think that's a big empty space where we should have had Mahatma Gandhi. I think it was a mistake. I think they could have made up for that little difference," says Barany. Barany is also part of the committee which chooses the Nobel prize for physics and chemistry every year. Gandhi taught the world a new method of struggle and redefined diplomacy. But the strongest symbol of non-violence in the 20th century was never selected for the Nobel prize. The denial of the prize to Gandhi invited worldwide controversy that is still being debated today. Gandhi was nominated five times for the Nobel but the Norwegian Nobel committee believed that the champion of non-violence could not be awarded because he was "neither a real politician nor a humanitarian relief worker". But at the time Gandhi died, the rules stated that a candidate had to be alive until February 1 to be in the reckoning. Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, two days before the closing date for that year's Nobel Peace Prize nominations. In that year, the Nobel Committee decided to give no peace award on the grounds that there was no suitable living candidate. In fact, Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Prize five times but he never won it. That year itself, the Committee received six letters of nomination for Gandhi. bdn
