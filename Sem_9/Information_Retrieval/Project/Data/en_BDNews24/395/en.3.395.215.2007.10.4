 SIGNAKHI, Georgia, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Thursday no nation could veto Georgia's bid to join the US-led military alliance and that the door remained open to the small ex-Soviet state. The United States has pushed for NATO membership for Georgia, which is at the centre of the Caucasus region and is home to a pipeline taking oil from Asia to Europe. But Russia, Georgia's big northern neighbour, strongly opposes the Western military bloc expanding on its borders. "No other nation, big or small, has a veto on the course Georgia and NATO want to follow together," de Hoop Scheffer told reporters at a news conference in a provincial town alongside President Mikhail Saakashvili. He subsequently said no country had a right to have a say in Georgia's aspirations, which were for it to decide. "That is the process that has to be decided finally by all the 26 NATO allies and no nation, I repeat big or small, will be able to influence that process." Scheffer appeared to be alluding not only to Russia but also to NATO member France whose defence minister, Herve Morin, told Reuters on Wednesday that Paris would not support Georgia's NATO bid if it meant Russia felt threatened. "No nation, big or small, will have a veto or a 'droit de regard', to say it in French, over NATO's enlargement process", the NATO chief said. De Hoop Scheffer described his visit as "a sign of encouragement" to Georgia but made clear that Tbilisi needed to successfully complete defence and judicial reforms and said NATO would be watching the country's electoral process carefully. Georgia has presidential and parliamentary votes next year. Relations between Russia and the small former ally on its southern fringes have sharply deteriorated since pro-Western Saakashvili won power in a peaceful 2003 revolution and vowed to win back two pro-Russian rebel regions. Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in wars after the 1991 break up of the Soviet Union. "My visit today here of course is also a sign of encouragement for Georgia to continue the path of reform. Let me stress once again, loud and clear -- NATO's door was open and is open," de Hoop Scheffer said at news briefing in Signakhi, two hours drive east of Tbilisi. But he ruled out any role for NATO in resolving tensions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Saakashvili is facing his biggest domestic challenge yet after the fragmented opposition united this weekend and called for his resignation on corruption allegations. Saakashvili has called the allegations lies. Russian soldiers stand as peacekeepers between the rebel forces of South Ossetia -- only around a two-hour drive from Tbilisi -- and Abkhazia, on the Black Sea Coast. The Georgians accuse Moscow of providing moral and financial backing to the rebels, with whom they sporadically exchange rocket fire. This year a war plane flying from Russia dropped a missile that landed in a field near a Georgian village, though it did not explode. Helicopters have fired on houses. Moscow military deny involvement in these inciden
