<TEXT>
 Feni, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)Feni police Tuesday arrested the younger sister of fugitive Awami League leader Joynal Hazari, hours after the Anticorruption Commission filed a case against them for "amassing wealth beyond their known sources of income". ACC deputy director Shafiqur Rahman filed the case against Joynal Hazari and Khodeja Hazari with Feni Police Station. Khodeja is the vice-president of district Mahila Awami League. The plaintiff of the case said Joynal Hazari deposited an amount of illegally acquired Tk 1 crore with Rupali Bank in Feni on Jan 5, 1999 by opening an account in his sister's name. Khodeja concealed all information about the money and the interest collected while submitting her income tax returns, according to case details. Subsequently, during an ACC investigation into the matter, Khodeja in a written statement submitted on June 20, 2007, admitted that the Tk 1 crore belonged to her brother. According to an ACC investigation and listing of assets, Joynal had hidden Tk 1.13 crore in illegally acquired assets in connivance with his sister. After the case was filed, Feni police chief Kamrul Hassan arrested Khodeja and she was sent to jail by the magistrate after she was taken to court. The ACC asked Joynal Hazari in March for his wealth statement, but he failed to do so. Eventually, the court sentenced him to three years in jail in absentia. bdnews2
