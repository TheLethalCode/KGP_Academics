Arroyo, who was on a visit to China, told President Hu Jintao on Tuesday that she had cancelled the ZTE contract. "That was a good move," Earl Parreno, a political analyst at the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms, told Reuters. "That was the only way to stop the senate investigation and keep her coalition government from falling apart.
