<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK insurers on Tuesday pressed the government to bring forward its planned increase in spending on flood defences to help reduce the risk of further flooding of the kind that affected large swathes of the country this summer. In a meeting with ministers to discuss the aftermath of the June and July floods, Stephen Haddrill, director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), called on the government to bring forward its planned increase in flood defence spending to 800 million pounds ($1.6 billion) a year for 2010 through 2011. "We pressed the Government to act quickly to reduce the level of flood risk, whether associated with river, coastal or surface flooding," Haddrill said in a statement. The insurance industry faces a bill of over 3 billion pounds from the worst floods to hit the country in 60 years. Firms are dealing with over 130,000 claims that resulted from the torrential rainfall that hit central, northern and western England. The ABI also warned the government that some homeowners are unlikely to be able to return to their properties for months, as it will take a long time for them to properly dry out before reconstruction work can take place. "We understand that many people will be frustrated that they can't return to their homes as soon as they would like ... But we warned ministers that, in many cases, more haste could mean less speed and the process of recovery will be a long haul lasting well into 2008 for some," said Haddri
