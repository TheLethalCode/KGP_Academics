<TITLE> UK to help return laundered money: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)The UK has assured the Anticorruption Commission of assistance in returning laundered money if specific information on such cases is provided, an ACC official said Tuesday. British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury and Foreign and Commonwealth Office Director for South Asia John Dennis met with ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury at his Segun Bagicha office Tuesday. However, while ACC secretary Mokhles-ur Rahman told reporters that the British officials had given their assurance in sending back the money laundered to the UK, Choudhury and Dennis mentioned nothing about the matter to reporters following the meeting. Mokhles-ur also said Choudhury and Denis had met with the ACC chairman to discuss possible UK assistance in improving management of the anti-graft agency, and further empowering the body to investigate corruption cases. After the hour-long meeting, Choudhury told reporters that taking action against corruption does not mean only running after some big shots. It is also a matter of improving the overall quality of people's life, he said. He said people are directly affected by corruption within different organisations, and lauded the ACC's recently announced initiative to tackle institutional corruption. Dennis said the drive against corruption, from whichever source it is conducted, was important for a politically responsible and sensitive society. In a visit to the UK last month to attend an international conference on money laundering, the ACC chairman had also discussed the matter at Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police. According to the ACC chief, it is difficult to recover laundered money from abroad. Bangladesh Bank has also attempted and failed in the past to return laundered money to the country, he said. However, returning from the UK last month, Hasan Mashhud had reported that Scotland Yard would assist the ACC in returning money in such cases if specific information could be given and the source of information was trustworthy. bdne
