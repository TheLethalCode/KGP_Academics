 PARIS, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares were slightly higher midday on Wednesday, adding to a two-session winning run as details of the impact of the credit crisis on Deutsche Bank reassured investors and fuelled a rally in banks. But retreating energy and telecoms shares limited the gains. At 1051 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.15 percent at 1,570.58 points. Shares in financial institutions added to recent gains as investors were relieved by greater clarity on the impact of the squeeze in the credit markets on banks' results. Deutsche Bank, which said it expected net profit to rise to more than $2 billion in the third quarter, despite more than $3 billion in write-downs in the wake of global credit market turmoil, gained nearly 3 percent. The news followed profit warnings by Swiss bank UBS and Citigroup earlier this week, as both banks have been hit by the global credit crisis. "People were expecting very, very bad news, so it's a relief rally," said Arthur van Slooten, strategist at Societe Generale, in Paris. "It's reflecting the fact that now that we know, we no longer have to guess. So this brings more certainty than the vague worries that we had before. Risk aversion is dropping quite significantly just because we now know." HSBC was the top weighted gainer on the index, rising 3 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland gained 3.5 percent and Barclays was up 2.3 percent. On the downside, oil and gas firms echoed falls at U.S. peers late on Tuesday, despite a slight rise in crude oil prices. Total dipped 1.5 percent, Royal Dutch Shell dropped 1 percent, and BP shed 1.7 percent. Telecoms, led by Vodafone and Telefonica, also lost ground, as investors took profits on defensive stocks after a sharp rally in recent weeks. Analysts said there could be setbacks in the short term, but equities remained a good bet. "We're happy to see the market rebound, as we were very optimistic throughout the crisis, but we think it's time to take some profits in the short term," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Pictet & Cie. He said analysts were likely to revise their estimates downwards after third-quarter results were announced, but added that longer term, valuations were a cause for optimism about equities. "We see equities at the same level or slightly higher by the year-end in Europe," he said. Northern Rock, the most prominent British casualty of the credit market squeeze, jumped 10 percent on a newspaper report that private equity group JC Flowers had secured 15 billion pounds of funding that could be used for a takeover. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index gained 0.1 percent, the UK's FTSE 100 index gained 0.6 percent, and France's CAC 40 was up 0.1 percent. France's Lagardere, a major shareholder in defence and aerospace group EADS, tumbled 7 percent after a newspaper said France's stockmarket watchdog had accused top executives and shareholders at EADS of selling shares before it unveiled problems at its Airbus unit. EADS declined to comment. Lagardere told Le Monde newspaper it vigorously rejected allegations of insider deali
