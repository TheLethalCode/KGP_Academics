 BUCHAREST, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania's minority government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday, prolonging political deadlock which has all but blocked reforms in the new European Union nation. The motion, proposed by the opposition Social Democrat Party (PSD), was defeated with 220 deputies voting to support it, short of the required 232. The ballot was secret and analysts had said some PSD deputies might disobey the party leadership and vote to sustain the government. "It's a good thing we remained in place," defence minister Teodor Melescanu told reporters. "It will require huge efforts from (Prime Minister Calin) Tariceanu's cabinet to garner a parliament majority to back the adoption of important documents, including the 2008 budget." The vote means Tariceanu remains dependent on the support of opposition parties to conduct policy, which analysts say could threaten Romania's fiscal prudence ahead of a national election next year. Tariceanu lost his majority in parliament when his Liberal Party split with allies, including the Democrats of President Traian Basescu, over the direction of reforms. His three-year-old government was praised for speeding up reforms that won Romania entry to the European Union in January. Political feuds, particularly between Basescu and the prime minister, have all but stopped policy momentum.
