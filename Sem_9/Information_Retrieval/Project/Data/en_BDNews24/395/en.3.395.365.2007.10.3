<TITLE> Kim Jong-il: ill or just grumpy? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Wed Oct 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's body was slightly slouched, his pace measured and expression dour at the start of a summit with the South, sparking questions over whether he might be seriously ill or just seriously surly. Kim appeared aloof, tired and overweight as he greeted South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun in Pyongyang on Tuesday, in sharp contrast to the energetic and engaging welcome he gave to Roh's predecessor seven years ago at the Koreas' first summit. Kim, now 65 and with a large paunch pressing snugly against his trade-mark jumpsuit, stood motionless with his right shoulder slumped as he waited for Roh to arrive, then briefly exchanged greetings and silently reviewed an honour guard. "Chairman Kim has the features typical of someone suffering from diabetes, such as abdominal obesity," the mass-circulation Dong-a Ilbo newspaper quoted one doctor as saying. The reclusive Kim has been the subject of persistent rumours in the South about his health, but his actual condition is one of the secretive state's most tightly guarded secrets. Another doctor speculated that Kim's complexion showed possible kidney disease. A practitioner of oriental medicine said in the JoongAng Ilbo daily that Kim appeared to have regained weight and showed signs of heart problems. When Roh raised a toast to Kim's health at a banquet on Tuesday evening, the North's leader was conspicuously absent. But the conclusions were largely based on a few minutes of video footage during Kim's first meeting with Roh. When the two leaders met again on Wednesday, Kim was full of smiles. "There is one thing indispensable for peace and the economy to go forward on the Korean peninsula," Roh had said in an official banquet toast on Tuesday night. "Chairman Kim Jong-il must have a long and healthy life." Kim made clear on Wednesday he considered himself healthy when he responded to Roh's thanks for greeting him on his arrival the previous day. "I've no reason to stay at home. I'm not a patient," Seoul's Yonhap News Agency quoted Kim as telling his guest. Wendy Sherman, who as a senior US State Department official met Kim in 2000, said his dour visage was probably more a sign of ageing plus restraint as he played host to a South Korean leader who is slightly younger and nearing the end of his term. "My sense is that Kim Jong-il, like all of us as we grow older, has some problems. But I don't have a sense and didn't see in any of the photographs that he is anywhere close to his demise." In June, South Korea's National Intelligence Service knocked down speculation that a team of German doctors had flown to Pyongyang to perform heart surgery on Kim but said he did suffer from diabetes and heart problems. Kim was once a legendary eater, who demanded the best food for his table, according to a book by Kenji Fujimoto who served as his sushi chef for 13 years from 19
