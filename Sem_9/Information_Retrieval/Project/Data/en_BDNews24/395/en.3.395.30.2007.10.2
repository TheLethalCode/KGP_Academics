<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)  Myanmar refugees, mostly women, Tuesday staged peaceful demonstrations in Dhaka to demand restoration of democracy in their country that recently saw a violent crackdown on anti-government movement by the military junta. Around 70 Myanmar nationals, including some Buddhist monks, gathered in Gulshan diplomatic zone and chanted slogans branding the ruling military junta chief General Than Shwe 'murderer'. They also demanded that the military step down and release democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been put under house arrest for years. "We want this government to step down immediately as it is destroying the Burmese economy, raping women and killing innocent people," Saw Mra Raza Linn, a leader of Rakhain Women's Union, told bdnews24.com. Linn, who came to Bangladesh in 1988 fearing government persecution, urged the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the affairs in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The protesters, who belong to 11 organisations mainly from Rakhain state of Myanmar, gathered from across the country and headed for Myanmar embassy in Gulshan diplomatic area at around 11am. "There is no anti-religious government like the present Burmese regime. They killed and arrested monks and people holding peaceful demonstrations. We want this government's resignation," U The Lavan Sa Thero, a Burmese monk in exile, told bdnews24.com. He also demanded immediate release of all political prisoners and monks who had taken part in the recent demonstration against the military regime in Myanmar. As the police intercepted, they gathered at west side of the road 84 beside the Australian High Commission and demonstrated for about an hour. The protesters with red ribbon wrapped around their heads chanted slogans: "Burmese military Junta, murderer, murderer. We want democracy. Release. Aung San Suu Kyi. Burmese military constitutionno need, no need." The police allowed some of the protesters go to the Burmese embassy nearby and hand over the protest letter against the military ruler, who had been in power since the 1988 uprising. In 1988, the Myanmar army, which usurped state power in 1962, killed around 3000 people who demanded restoration of democracy. Myanmar people, led by highly revered Buddhist monks, in mid-September poured onto the streets across the country to protest the government decision of doubling the fuel price and increasing the gas price five folds. The military government issued warnings to protesting monks and people to "go home or face crackdown". As people turned down junta's warnings, troops and the police fired on the protesters and killed at least 11 people including a Japanese photojournalist. Rights groups said 1,000 people, who took part in the protest, were missing in Myamar. The government has taken control of the streets by its repressive policy. In 1990, the army held an election which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won bagging more than two-thirds seats of national parliament. Instead of handing over power to the NLD, the military junta put Suu Kyi, who won Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, under house arrest. The organisations, which held Tuesday's demonstration, are United Front of Sangha, Rakhain Women's Union, Independent Forces of Arakan, All Arakan Students' and Youths' Congress, Rakhain Environment and Human Rights Watch, Arakan Community Council, Shwe Gas Movement, Opposition Force of Burma, Narinjara News Agency, Shwe Pray Rakhaing News Age
