 BERLIN, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel tried on Wednesday to douse any speculation of an early election even though her Christian Democrats have opened a wide lead over their Social Democrat coalition partners in opinion polls. Two years before the next scheduled parliamentary ballot in 2009, Merkel said in an interview with Die Zeit weekly newspaper that the electorate has no stomach for another early election after the last session was cut a year short in 2005.
