 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)Plans to adopt sustainable measures to combat the annual monga season may be difficult but not insurmountable, fisheries and livestock adviser CS Karim said Tuesday. The annual food crisis or monga season hits thousands of rural workers following the harvest period as they suffer acute unemployment which leads to food insecurity. The northwestern region is usually hit the hardest causing a widespread displacement of people in search of work. "The problem may be difficult but is not insurmountable," said Karim at a workshop, organised by the Power and Participation Research Centre. "We plan to adopt sustainable longstanding measures to combat monga , in addition to relief in a bid to alleviate the sufferings as far as possible," the adviser said. According to PPRC executive director Hossain Zillur Rahman, addressing monga will warrant diversifying local agricultural practices. Equipping the locals with various life and professional skills, developing communication systems and planned migration of communities, would be included in such a programme, Rahman said. "The prevalence of monga has been diminishing," the adviser claimed. "And I believe it can be managed successfully. Integrated and comprehensive programmes can help ease sufferings." Fisheries and livestock secretary Syed Ataur Rahman claimed it was possible to alleviate countrywide poverty by comprehensively planning and implementing fish-farming alone. "We have planned to bring all the water bodies in the monga stricken districts under integrated fish farming, involving the grassroots," he said. Welcoming the discussions on monga management throughout the two-day workshop, DFID country representative Chris Austin said his organisation was ready to lend a hand in efforts directed towards alleviation of the annual food crisis. Former agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury in a final word said she was pleased to note that the workshop had established that the buying power of people in the monga stricken areas has been diminishing. "This contradicts the finance adviser's recent comment that celebrated the augmented buying capacity of Bangladeshis," she said. bdnews24.c
