 ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 80 opposition members of Pakistan's parliament tendered their resignations on Tuesday to protest against military president Pervez Musharraf's bid to seek re-election. Shortly before the members of parliament resigned, opposition lawyers made last-ditch efforts to block Musharraf's re-election on Saturday, telling the Supreme Court as army chief he should be ineligible and the vote should be postponed. US ally General Musharraf, leader of the only nuclear-armed Islamic nation, is expected to win re-election in a vote by the two houses of parliament and four provincial assemblies. Although his popularity has slumped, Musharraf's ruling coalition holds a majority in parliament, which is due to be dissolved next month before a general election due by mid-January. Once re-elected, Musharraf has vowed to quit as army chief and become a civilian leader. Apparently unable to derail Musharraf's re-election plans, an opposition alliance led by the party of former prime minster Nawaz Shaif had vowed to quit from the national and provincial assemblies in protest. "These resignations are against dictatorship," Fazal-ur-Rehman, leader of the opposition and secretary-general of the Islamic Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, told reporters after handing in his members' resignation papers. "If this house votes for Musharraf, it would have no political value and the president himself would have no value in the eyes of the people." Speaker of the National Assembly, Chaudhry Amir Hussain, said he had received the resignations of 85 members of the 342-seat lower house. The biggest opposition party, that of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, has not joined in the walk-out. "INELIGIBLE" Bhutto has been in talks with Musharraf on a post-election power-sharing deal although she has consistently opposed his election while army chief. She has said her members might also resign from the assemblies unless her demands for democratic reforms were met. She is due to decide her strategy at party talks in London on Wednesday. The walk-out will not derail the vote, even if Bhutto's party joined in, but it will detract from its credibility. Opposition members also resigned from provincial assemblies. In a major boost to Musharraf, the Supreme Court last week dismissed legal challenges to his bid for re-election while still army chief. Later, the Election Commission also rejected opposition objections to his candidacy. Nevertheless, anti-Musharraf lawyers and Bhutto's supporters filed fresh challenges to Musharraf in the Supreme Court. "The COAS (chief of army staff) should be declared ineligible and until a decision on the petition, the election should be stayed," lawyer Ashtar Ausaf Ali told reporters at the court. Ali is a lawyer for election candidate Wajihuddin Ahmed, a former Supreme Court judge who resigned in 2000 rather than swear allegiance to Musharraf. The other main candidate is Makhdoom Amin Faheem, from Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. It was not clear when the court would take up the petitions. Bhutto has lived in exile since 1999 rather than face corruption charges but has vowed to return on Oct. 18.
