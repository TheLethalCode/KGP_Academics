Aklima Akhter, an officer from Chakoria Police Station, told bdnews24.com that the police had arrested the three in Harbang area in Cox's Bazar at about 4 am. They were found carrying hacksaw blades and a tool to cut pipes and cables. The metal pipe is used to protect the optical fibre line as it spans the Aziz Nagar Bridge on Cox's Bazar Highway. This is the sixth time the optical fibre line has been severed in recent times. Chakoria police chief Ruhul Amin Siddiqui said the three men had confessed after being interrogated over the incident.
