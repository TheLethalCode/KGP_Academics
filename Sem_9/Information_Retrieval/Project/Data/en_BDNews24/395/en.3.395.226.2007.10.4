<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities traded near intra-day highs on Thursday, boosted by the fourth day of gains in banking stocks as credit market worries eased, and ahead of a rate verdict due from the European Central Bank. The DJ Stoxx banking sector index jumped 1.4 percent to 489.5, stretching gains to nearly 6 percent so far this week. Royal Bank of Scotland rose over 3 percent as it neared the finishing line in the takeover race for ABN AMRO against an improving equity and credit market backdrop, easing concerns it is taking on a risky deal at a bad time. By 1110 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was 0.3 percent stronger at 1,576.1, near the day's high of 1,576.6 and wiping out earlier losses. Boosted by banking stocks, the index rose 1.3 percent in the previous three sessions. "Most of the bad news has been discounted ," said one trader. "People seem somewhat relaxed about the subprime issue as companies have held up their hands and admitted to losses." The pan-European index has gained 10 percent after falling 13 percent in one month from a 6-1/2-year high hit in mid-July as the U.S. housing downturn spread to credit markets and battered global stocks. The European Central Bank is set to leave interest rates on hold for a fourth month running as it mulls the economic impact of financial market turbulence and the strong euro. "While upside risks to inflation are likely to be stressed again, downside risks to growth will be emphasised as well, so that the net outcome will likely be a sort of move toward a more neutral bias," Unicredit economist Aurelio Maccario said. The ECB decision is due at 1145 GMT. Investors will mainly focus on the news conference that will follow the ECB decision, seeking clues on the outlook for rates. As expected, the Bank of England left rates on hold at 5.75 percent for the third month running. The FTSE 100 index was up 0.6 percent, the CAC 40 up 0.1 percent while the DAX was flat. US stock futures indicated a firm start on Wall Street. Shares in Fortis jumped 7 percent and Santander added 1 percent. ABN shares edged up 0.6 percent to 37.7 euros, near the 38 euro level of the RBS-led consortium's offer. Barclays -- set to miss out on ABN when its offer closes later on Thursday -- rose 1.5 percent, also supported by persistent bid talk. RBS and its partners Santander and Fortis are expected to succeed with a 71 billion euro offer for ABN when its offer period closes on Friday. "Coming to the end of the ABN uncertainty won't hurt, but it's mainly a mood that the whole sector may be through the worst," one analyst says. Among losers, SAP fell 1.0 percent, while Infineon fell 2.2 percent and STMicroelectronics 1.3 percent on negative sector comments from a brokerage. Miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton tracked weakness in commodity prices after recent hefty gains. Among standout winners, Abbot Group surged 21 percent after the oil rig operator said it has received proposals that could lead to a takeover off
