 KATHMANDU, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's government alliance prepared on Thursday for last ditch talks to persuade former Maoist rebels to participate in November elections amid fears the vote could be delayed. The Maoists quit the interim government last month demanding the monarchy's immediate abolition before scheduled Nov. 22 elections for a constituent assembly, a key part of a peace deal last year aimed at ending a decade-long war with the insurgents.

The cabinet would nominate the rest.

Some analysts say the Maoists, who joined the political mainstream only last year, were afraid of losing the polls and believe the proportional representation system will give them more seats in the assembly. More than 13,000 people were killed in the Maoist conflict that ended last year when the guerrillas signed a peace deal with the government and deposited their arms in containers under the United Nations monitori
