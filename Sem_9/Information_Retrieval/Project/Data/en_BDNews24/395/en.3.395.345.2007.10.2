<TEXT>
 KOCHI, India, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist on Tuesday criticised the behaviour of some players during the second one-day international win over India. Australia overcame injury woes and displayed all round strength to win by 84 runs and take a 1-0 lead after the first game in the seven-match series was abandoned due to rain. However, the match was marred by verbal exchanges between players, with temperamental Indian paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth once again in the spotlight. "I saw some really hard fought cricket," Gilchrist told a news conference. "There were some comments between different players and that happens. "I also saw a few things that I wouldn't expect from my son Harrison in a backyard game of cricket. "There is no doubt the way Sreesanth wants to play cricket. When we get our chance, we'll play aggressive cricket too." Sreesanth clashed with Andrew Symonds and Brad Haddin, joint top scorers with 87, as they dominated the bowling. Harbhajan Singh and Michael Clarke also appeared to become involved in an exchange later when the Indian spinner was steered away by senior team mate Rahul Dravid. Sreesanth has been fined a few times in the last year, the latest for excessive appealing during the semi-final win over Australia at last month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Indian skipper Mahendra Dhoni played down the behaviour of Sreesanth. "Sreesanth was heated up but he's changed over the last six months," he said. "He was playing in front of his home crowd and got excited." Gilchrist was delighted with the win after the washout. "In two games in a row, we've responded and rebounded really well," he said. "The guys gave our bowlers something to defend, and I thought they executed really well.
