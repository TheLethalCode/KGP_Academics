 WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday reported raising $27 million in campaign money in the third quarter, surpassing all other candidates in the race. "Hillary wanted you to know that this was our best quarter yet," said an e-mail from her campaign manager, Patty Solis Doyle. Her top rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, reported raising $19 million for the primary election season and $1 million for the general campaign in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Clinton's $27 million included $22 million for the primary race that begins in January and the rest for the general campaign ahead of the November 2008 election. Doyle said the amount was "substantially more than any other candidate in the race."
