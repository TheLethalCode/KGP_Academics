 HONG KONG, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One of the rarest gems in the world, a flawless blue diamond, will be auctioned off in Hong Kong next week for an expected $6 million, which would make it the most expensive diamond, per carat, ever sold. "Blue diamonds are the rarest kind of colored diamonds ... and this particular gem it is over five carats of the purest blue color," said Patti Wong, Chairman of Sotheby's Asia which is putting up the gem for sale on October 8 in Hong Kong. "For a stone like this, we've attracted attention from all over the world," she added of the 6.04 carat, internally flawless stone put up for sale by a private Asian collector. Blue diamonds have long captivated the rich and powerful -- shimmering with a certain dark mystique. The famous 'Hope Diamond', a 45.52 carat grey-blue beauty, was passed down through the ages by King Louis XIV of France, Marie Antoinette and American heiress Evalyn Walsh Mclean among others. It now rests in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. The Sultan of Brunei reportedly bought another massive "blue" which surfaced briefly in the 1980s. While not a large stone, the Sotheby's diamond has an esteemed cut and 'fancy vivid blue' hue, factors likely to edge its price to a world record $700,000 per carat -- nearly six times the per-carat price of white diamonds, Wong said. The blue hue is a result of trace amounts of boron in the stone's crystal structure. Other colored diamonds with pink and reds hues can be mined in multiple locations across the globe including Brazil, India and Australia, but 'blues' are mostly found at just one site on earth -- the Premier Mine in South Africa. The odds of mining a blue diamond are much less than 'one in a million,' said Won
