 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  The first round of the annual polio vaccination drive will begin on Oct 27, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman said Thursday. "About two and a half crore children aged up to five years will be covered by this year's national polio vaccination drive," Rahman said. This will be the 16th year of the programme. National Immunisation Day and the second round of vaccinations have been scheduled for Dec 8, 2007. Rahman said: "This year our challenge is to achieve 100 percent coverage, we don't want to see a single child paralysed for the rest of their lives." Vaccination centres will be established at transportation hubs across the country in order to reach as many children as possible, including those without fixed addresses. "The government and donor agencies will spend approximately Tk 100 crore on the two rounds of vaccinations," the adviser said. In the first round, children aged between two and five years will also be given Vitamin A capsules to combat night blindness in addition to their polio vaccinations. On Dec 8, children will be given their second dose of polio medication as well as tapeworm medication. The adviser said Bangladesh has been polio-free for the past ten months with the last case reported in November 2006 in Chandpur. "It took us three years to attain polio-free status. However, we will never win the World Health Organisation's certificate to this effect until neighbouring countries also adopt similar measures," said the adviser. Rahman said the occurrence of night blindness among children had fallen to 0.04 percent, compared to 3.76 percent in 1973. "It is a great advancement," said Rahman. The health advisor added that the success of recent drives should not breed complacency, saying: "We get 40 lakh new born babies every year." The drive will see 1.2 lakh vaccination centres established, attended by six lakh volunteers. bdnew
