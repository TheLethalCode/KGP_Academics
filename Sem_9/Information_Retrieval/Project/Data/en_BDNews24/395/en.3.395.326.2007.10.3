<TITLE> End emergency well before 2 months from polls: AL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Wednesday demanded an end to the state of emergency earlier than two months before the general elections. It snubbed the statement of chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda who said Tuesday that the emergency should go two months before the elections. The party also asked for lifting the ban on indoor politics across the country, saying it was necessary to involve the leaders and activists in the process of voter registration. It said the Election Commission's proposal on the registration of the political parties was not pragmatic. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman and presidium member Tofail Ahmed briefed the media on the meeting with Samyabadi Dal as part of the AL's series of talks with its allies in the 14-party alliance. The AL held talks with Workers' Party on Sept 29 and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu) on Oct 1. "As part of the series of talks we have discussed with the Samyabadi Dal. We have agreed on many matters," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home after the meeting. "We had a substantive discussion. We are attempting to be a unique voice. In the talks with the Election Commission the 31-point proposals of the 14-party alliance will be the main issue," Tofail, who is coordinating the talks, said. "Work on voter list and ID card is underway. It is good that the army has been involved in the work and we support their involvement." "But we think our leaders and workers should also be involved in the work. For this the embargo on the indoor politics from across the country should go," the senior leader said. "People would be happier if the elections were held before December. We will go for talks on the implementation of the roadmap of the Election Commission, though we have yet to decide," Tofail said. "The emergency should go [earlier than two months before elections] so that the political parties can run their activities." Tofail, however, would not specify a timeframe for the ban on emergency to end. "The matter is not about two or six months, we think the emergency should go at the right time." He said the proposals of registration of the political parties in the draft reforms of the EC were not "completely realistic". "That the political parties can get easily registered should be ensured. We are in favour of registration, but we don't want the political parties controlled in the name of registration. "Care should be taken so that the political parties are registered without any trouble. We have our doubts about whether if any political party in Bangladesh can register following the proposals." He however said they supported the EC proposals on a cut on electoral expenses. Tofail said the EC would implement the law that any party with religious name, sign or symbol would not be registered. "We are ready to help [the Election Commission] implement the electoral roadmap, but the government will have to take positive steps," he said. "The CEC said the election would take place if any major incident does not occur. What is this? It has made us apprehensive," Tofail said. Samyabadi Dal chief Dilip Barua said, "The Election Commission should be made independent, keeping it away from clout of the office of the prime minister or the chief adviser." "Elections, although a bit prolonged according to the roadmap that the Election Commission has announced, will be held and the polls will live up to people's hope," he added. bdnews
