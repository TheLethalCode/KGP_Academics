 KARACHI, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan were struggling to avoid the follow-on after being reduced to 127 for five by South Africa, who made 450 runs, on the second day of the first test on Tuesday at the National stadium. Captain Shoaib Malik (9) and Abdul Rehman (1) were at the crease with the home side still requiring another 124 runs to make the visitors bat again. South Africa, riding on a brilliant 155 from Jacques Kallis and 77 from AB de Villiers, dominated the second day's play with left-arm spinner Paul Harris getting prodigious turn and bounce on the uneven surface to snap up openers, Kamran Akmal (42) and Mohammad Hafeez (34). He was well supported by pacers, Andre Nel, Kallis and Dale Steyn who took a wicket each. Harris came into his own after the makeshift pair had plundered 71 runs in quick time. Harris trapped Akmal leg before with an armer and than picked up Hafeez to a catch by Kallis at first slip to leave Pakistan reeling on 84 for two in the final session after the home side had gone to tea on 17 for no loss. Two runs later Nel delivered a body blow by bowling Younis Khan (6). Faisal Iqbal (7) got an inside edge to his stumps off Kallis to leave the home side on 97 for four. Misbah appeared untroubled by the pitch to hit four boundaries as his first scoring strokes but on 23 he chased a wide ball from Steyn to be caught behind. South Africa looked set for an impregnable total after going to lunch on 385 for five but lost their last five wickets for 58 runs
