 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday overturned the High Court rule and froze the bail to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in GATCO corruption case. A seven-strong full bench of the Appellate Division led by chief justice M Ruhul Amin also ruled that the proceedings of the graft case could go on in the trial court against the BNP chairperson. The High Court Sunday awarded bail to Khaleda but a day later the government and the Anticorruption Commission sought Supreme Court freezes on the High Court order and the stay on GATCO corruption case proceedings. The Supreme Court also halted the stay order in four separate corruption cases against Khaleda Zia, her sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco, former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed, former communications minister Nazmul Huda and his wife. The latest rulings removed barriers to the proceedings of the cases. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "The Supreme Court has stayed the High Court bail to Khaleda Zia. It also halted the High Court order in four other cases. So there will be no problem in running the cases." Barrister Rafique-ul Huq, counsel of Khaleda and others, said, "A full bench of the Supreme Court stayed the High Court order that had granted bail to Khaleda Zia." The chamber judge of Supreme Court Tuesday held a brief hearing on the five appeal petitions of the government and the ACC against the High Court orders and set Thursday for a full bench hearing on the petitions Two separate writ petitions were filed with the High Court on Sept 27 challenging the legality of the inclusion of GATCO graft case under the emergency powers rules. The case was filed by the ACC against 13 persons including Khaleda and Coco. The same day another three writ petitions were filed challenging the graft cases against Tarique, Moudud, Nazmul Huda and Sigma Huda. On Sept 30, an High Court bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury granted bail to Khaleda Zia on a writ petition. It also stayed the case proceedings against her and Coco. However, Coco did not get bail. On Oct 1, the same bench stayed the proceedings of three separate graft cases against Tarique, Moudud, Nazmul Huda and Sigma Huda. However, the court did not issue any order on their appeals for bail. On Sept 2, the ACC filed the GATCO corruption case.
