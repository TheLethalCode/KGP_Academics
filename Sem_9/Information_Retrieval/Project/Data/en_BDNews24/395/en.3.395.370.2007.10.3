 BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany is leading a push within the European Union to drop certain sanctions imposed on gas-rich Uzbekistan for the crushing of a revolt in the town of Andizhan in 2005, diplomats said on Wednesday. The sanctions, including visa bans on eight Uzbek officials and a ban on sales of military equipment to the authoritarian Central Asian state, come up for renewal in the middle of next month and there must be an EU consensus for them to be extended. "Our concern is that the sanctions are not really biting," said one EU diplomat whose country was among those in favour of an easing of the measures, adding that they could be impeding EU efforts to draw Tashkent into a dialogue on human rights. However diplomats said the push faces resistance from Britain, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands who point to continued repression and politically motivated jailings and argue that a softer EU line would send the wrong signal. "We are prepared to look at ways of encouraging them to make progress but we do not think you should throw in your best cards -- that is, the sanctions -- too early," said one envoy. "We are back to where we started six months ago," he added of a debate that took place this year under the EU presidency of Germany, which wants to deepen ties with potential energy partners in Central Asia and called then for an easing. That led in May to a decision to take the names of four Uzbek officials off the visa ban list. Those still subject to bans include Defence Minister Ruslan Mirzayev and seven others including the chief of the National Security Service Rustam Inoyatov and several special forces officers. Witnesses in Andizhan said hundreds of people, among them women and children, were killed when troops opened fire on unarmed protesters in May 2005. Uzbekistan says 187 people, all troops or "terrorists", were killed in a police action against Islamist extremists. Rights activists have urged the European Union not to soften its stance on Uzbekistan, warning the bloc this could trigger further repression and pointing to continued jailings of those who speak out about the Andizhan events. Diplomats said Portugal, who took over the EU presidency from Germany in July, had proposed a compromise under which the visa bans would be suspended for six months but be automatically reimposed if no human rights advances were seen. One envoy said the debate focused on the visa bans and that there was no discussion at this stage of lifting the arms embargo. Uzbekistan is due to hold a presidential election on Dec. 23. However opposition parties are outlawed in the mostly Muslim state of 26 million and it is still not clear whether President Islam Karimov, in power since 1989, would seek another te
