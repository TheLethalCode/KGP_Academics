The names of the artists performing in this year's event were not released. "Today, we are happy to announce that 46664 will stage a similar concert here in Johannesburg on the First of December on World AIDS Day," said Mandela, whose son died of the disease in 2005, in one of his rare public appearances. His AIDS charity is named after the prison number assigned to him during the 27 years he spent in jail. Profits for the event will help fund HIV/AIDS awareness and outreach programs throughout southern Africa, the epicenter of the worldwide AIDS epidemic.

A list of the performers will be released later this mon
