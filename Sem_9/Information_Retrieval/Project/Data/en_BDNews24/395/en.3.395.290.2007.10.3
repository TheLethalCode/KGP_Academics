 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The relegation matches of the previous edition of Premier League begins Thursday amid threats of teams not turning up at Sher-e-Bangla Naitonal Stadium. "We have taken the necessary steps to hold the match. If the clubs don't turn up, action will be taken in line with bylaws," said the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) Grounds and Facilities Committee chairman Shafiqur Rahman Munna Wednesday. Jahandar Rashid, cricket secretary of City Club, told the bdnews24.com that the bylaws have ambiguity in case of both teams refusing to play. "According to the bylaws, if a team refuses to play, then the team will be fined Tk 10,000 and demoted to the first division league automatically. "But, the bylaws don't say clearly what happens if both teams refuse to play," explained Rashid. The BCB has decided to hold the relegation matches among three bottom-placed Brothers Union, Indira Road KC and City Club in the 12-team point-table on October 4-7. Two clubs will be relegated to the First Division League from the Premier League, but all three have expressed their unwillingness to play the matches. The three clubs on Monday served a legal notice on the BCB, asking it to explain in two days why its had moved to hold the relegation matches of the Premier League seventh months into its conclusion. "Our lawyer has still not received any response from the board," Brothers Union general secretary Mizanuddin told bdnews24.com Wednesday evening. "We have sent our reply to their lawyer in afternoon," said BCB member Munna. The clubs in a joint statement Wednesday said they would refrain from playing the matches because of the "unacceptable fixture" of the relegation league. They said the Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis (CCDM) would have to bear all responsibility. bd
