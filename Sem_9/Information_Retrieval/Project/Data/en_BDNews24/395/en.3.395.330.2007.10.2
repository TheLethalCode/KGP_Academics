<TITLE> Lebanon can't afford fiasco in picking president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon will miss a huge chance to heal its wounds if it fails to elect a new president due to rifts between the anti-Syrian majority and the opposition, a prominent candidate said on Tuesday. Parliament met a week ago to try to choose a replacement for pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud, whose term ends on Nov. 23, but the session was postponed to Oct. 23 because most MPs from Hezbollah and other opposition factions stayed away. "Lebanon today is free of Israeli occupation, free of Syrian hegemony," Nassib Lahoud, one of two contenders endorsed by the anti-Syrian alliance known as March 14, told Reuters. "This is a terrific opportunity after long years of war and disruption to try and put the country together," he said, citing broad Arab and foreign support for rebuilding Lebanon. "My biggest worry is that we might miss this opportunity, which might not come back for years to come." Syria, which dominated Lebanon until forced to withdrew its troops in 2005 after the killing of ex-premier Rafik al-Hariri, previously had a decisive say in presidential elections. Ex-army chief Michel Aoun is the only declared opposition runner, but the next president might also come from an array of undeclared hopefuls once the political horse-trading is over. Lahoud said he hoped a consensus on the presidency, reserved for Maronite Christians in Lebanon's power-sharing system, would emerge before Emile Lahoud, his cousin and political foe, leaves office, but said negotiations could go down to the wire. The process is complicated by the links of various Lebanese factions to outside powers such as Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States and others competing for regional influence. "Frankly, I would like no one to interfere," declared Lahoud, a 62-year-old British-trained engineer. He acknowledged that Syria had interests in Lebanon, but said it must respect his country's sovereignty and independence. The Syrians should "withdraw support from illegal armed Palestinian groups" in eastern Lebanon, exchange ambassadors with Beirut and agree to demarcate the Syrian-Lebanese border. bdnews24.com/lq/2046hrs "Over and above that, we would expect their full cooperation with the international tribunal set up by the United Nations to try the perpetrators of Hariri's assassination." Syria, which denies any hand in Hariri's killing or a string of later assassinations, still wields influence in Lebanon, notably through the Shi'ite factions Hezbollah and Amal. Lahoud said "all weaponry must be in the sole custody of the Lebanese government", advocating a dialogue over the weapons held by Hezbollah, the only Lebanese group to stay armed to fight Israel after the country's devastating 1975-90 civil war. "We would like to benefit from the defence capabilities of Hezbollah within the framework of the Lebanese government," Lahoud added, without explaining exactly how this could be done. He put stabilising the south, where Lebanese army troops deployed alongside U.N. peacekeepers after last year's Israel-Hezbollah war, among the country's top priorities. Others were reviving the economy, reactivating paralysed institutions and preparing for parliamentary elections. "That's a lot of things and a president in Lebanon at this time could play a crucial role in bringing this together," he said at his home in Beirut's Christian Ashrafiyeh district. The Taif accord that ended Lebanon's civil war stripped the president of some powers and gave them to the prime minister and cabinet, but the head of state remains more than a figurehead. A former ambassador to Washington and a member of parliament from 1991 to 2005, Lahoud said he would try to be even-handed if elected, without renouncing his March 14 bloc's principles. "I could play the role of what the president of Lebanon should be -- an arbiter equidistant from all the Lebanese who would benefit from
