 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com) BRAC has been awarded the 2007 Stop TB Partnership Kochon Prize, an official said Tuesday. The Bangladesh-based NGO is one of two recipients of the prize, introduced by the World Health Organisation in 2006. "Our achievement is due to successful partnership with female health volunteers who are responsible for detecting TB patients in the remotest areas of the country," BRAC's health programme coordinator Dr Akramul Islam told bdnews24.com. "Our aim was to reach every corner of society, and the female health volunteers who are also our microcredit beneficiaries works very hard to find patients and ensure completion of the six-month drug taking course," Dr Islam said. BRAC has been implementing its tuberculosis programme in partnership with the government since 1994 and has covered almost two thirds of the population, or 86.2 million people in 42 districts. bdn
