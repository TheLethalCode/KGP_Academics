 WARSAW, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski was widely seen as the loser in a debate with Poland's leftist ex-president, but analysts said their lacklustre sparring would sway few voters ahead of a parliamentary election. Neither the conservative Kaczynski nor Aleksander Kwasniewski landed any major blows in the debate watched on Monday by a record 9.1 million Poles, three weeks ahead of the election in the European Union's biggest ex-communist member.

The euro-sceptic Kaczynski, who runs Poland with his twin brother Lech, the president, said on Tuesday that his party has opinion polls showing Law and Justice is close to winning a majority and create a government without a coalition partner.
