 By Joe Bavier KINSHASA, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian-made cargo plane with 17 people on board crashed and exploded on Thursday in a teeming neighbourhood of Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, killing many people, officials and witnesses said. The Antonov aircraft belonging to Congolese airline Africa 1 came down on several shacks in the Kingasani neighbourhood near Ndjili international airport, the sources said.

Ageing planes suffer from a lack of maintenance and spare parts but they are often the only way to transport people and goods across the vast central African country that is slowly recovering from a 1998-2003 civil war. Eight people were killed in early September when a cargo plane overshot the runway and caught fire while landing in the eastern Congolese town of Goma. Congo, a country the size of West Europe with only a few hundred kilometres (miles) of paved roads, has one of Africa's worst air safety records and was dubbed an "embarrassment" by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) last year. Africa 1 is on the European Union's airline blacklist. All airlines certified by Democratic Republic of Congo authorities -- except for Hewa Bora Airways -- are banned from the
