 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The police in a raid Wednesday confiscated moveable property of nine people facing charges of underselling 18 state-owned homes during the reign of the latest BNP-led coalition. Sub-inspector of Gulshan Police Station Mainul Hossain said they failed to seize any valuable property during their search in most of the homes of the accused. The police did not find anything during their raid on the home of former BNP minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury at House 15, Road-66, Gulshan-2. Sub-inspector Hossain said they seized a refrigerator, a TV set, dinning table and some other valuables from the home of former RAJUK secretary Mir Mosharraf Hossain. The police made similar drives at the homes of vice chairman of Entex Group of Industries Hasna Ahmed, former RAJUK engineer Emdadul Islam, M&N Company's chairman New J Mendes, chairman of Advanced Development and Technology SM Anwar Hossain, former MP Shafikur Rahman Kiran, Public Works Department's engineer Ziauddin Ahmed. The seizure came two days after a Dhaka court order. The Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court Tuesday also ordered arrest of Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, former prime minister's political secretary Harris Chowdhury and Basundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, better known as Shah Alam, and 20 others. In the same case, two more persons face orders to appear in court in so-called "warrants of custody" as they are already detained in jail in separate cases. Judge Md Azizul Haque issued the warrants against a total of 25 people on charges of having roles in selling 18 government houses without tender, forcing the government to count about Tk 128 crore in losses. Among the accused, former housing and public works minister Mirza Abbas and former Rajuk director (finance) Humayun Khan are in jail. Deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission Rezaul Hasan Tarafder submitted 15 charge sheets to the court on Sept 20 against the 25 people. Forty people have been made witnesses in the case. ACC assistant director Shahidul Alam on March 29 filed the case with Motijheel Police Station charging them with abusing powers to sell the houses without following a proper procedure. The case alleged that Mirza Abbas in collaboration with the former and present officials of the city developer sold the abandoned houses in Dhanmondi, Gulshan, Banani and New Eskaton without tender. The houses were sold at much lower than market prices and their "corruption" cost the state coffers Tk 127.64 crore in losses, it was alleged. bdnews24.com/lh/g
