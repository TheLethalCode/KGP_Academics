 KOCHI, India, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Symonds and Brad Haddin powered their way to 87 runs apiece to pull Australia out of trouble to 306 for six against India in the second one-day international on Tuesday. Symonds bludgeoned nine fours and two sixes facing 83 balls and raised 108 runs for the fifth wicket with Haddin, who was unbeaten on 87 off only 69 deliveries after reaching his second successive fifty. Symonds transformed the innings with a crucial 94-run stand for the fourth wicket with fellow Queenslander Matthew Hayden, who hit a well-paced 75 to leave India facing a daunting chase. The dreadlocked batsman often exchanged words with the temperamental paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, who finally had him caught off his own bowling after he miscued a pull. Sreesanth even made a run out appeal against Symonds after he walked down from the non-strikers' end to confront the bowler, who appeared to say something to Haddin after a delivery. Sreesanth has been fined several times in the last year for poor behaviour. He was docked 25 percent of his match fee and was given a warning during last month's Twenty20 World Cup. India's pacemen reduced Australia to eight for two wickets after skipper Mahendra Dhoni chose to bowl first to exploit early seam movement after the start was delayed 30 minutes. Clarke (27) led the initial recovery by adding 58 runs for the third wicket Hayden until seamer Irfan Pathan had him stumped by 'keeper Dhoni standing up to the stumps. Hayden hit powerful shots for his five fours and three sixes, first attacking Khan and Sreesanth before rendering both spinners Harbhajan Singh and Ramesh Power ineffective. Andrew Symonds kept up the scoring with Haddin after Hayden, who completed his 31st one-day fifty, was bowled leg-stump by Pathan returning for a fresh spell. Symonds, who began with a miscued four over cover against Harbhajan, played all around the pitch, smashing both Harbhajan and Powar for sixes over long on. Haddin, who hit 69 in Bangalore on Saturday, hit eight fours and three sixes and stayed on until the end. Left-arm Zaheer Khan had removed Adam Gilchrist for nought in the first over after dismissing him for 12 in the rain-abandoned opening fixture when the stand-in skipper edged to slip. Sreesanth had Brad Hodge (3) caught behind at the other end after he had removed the batsman for a duck in the first game to the roar of the 60,000-strong holiday crowd. The local bowler returned three for 67 and Pathan took two for 47
