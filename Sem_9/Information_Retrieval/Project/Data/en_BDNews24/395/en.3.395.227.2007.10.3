 Gazipur, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) -- ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, Wednesday said the caretaker government had hindered justice. "Although justice is a constitutional right of citizens, it is being hindered during the rule of the current government," said Hannan Shah, referring to the case against Khaleda, now in jail on charges of corruption. "The government is not working in line with people's expectations. It is losing public support because it is playing different roles in different areas," he said. The BNP leader made the remarks when he spoke to reporters in Gazipur after appearing in court to register his attendance as he had been released on bail in an extortion case filed by an Awami League leader. He criticised the government for not releasing the BNP chief despite the High Court bail awarded to her Sunday in the GATCO scam case. The government has appealed to the Supreme Court chamber judge in a bid to scuttle the bail, but the judge sent the appeal to the full bench of the Appellate Division for further hearing. "It means the bail order is still in effect. But Khaleda Zia was not freed. It also shows the similar attitude to Sheikh Hasina," he said, referring to the Awami League president, detained in jail since July 16. bdnews24.comcor
