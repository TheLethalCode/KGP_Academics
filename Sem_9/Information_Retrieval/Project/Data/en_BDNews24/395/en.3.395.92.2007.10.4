However, I think they are satisfied. The ACC officials asked all their questions in front of me." "She has told them that there is no discrepancy in her wealth statement. Nor did the officials say that there is any discrepancy in her wealth statement." He said Khaleda was informed midday Thursday that ACC officials would meet with her.
