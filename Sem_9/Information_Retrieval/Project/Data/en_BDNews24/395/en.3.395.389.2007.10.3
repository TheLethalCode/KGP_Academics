 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks took a downturn Wednesday, led by Trust Bank, as investors initiated sell-offs to lock in gains from a three-day rally. "It appears that a fall in Trust Bank shares has pushed the market down. The market also witnesses a sluggish trend ahead of Eid," said Ziaul Haque Khondker, managing director of state-run investment bank ICB. "I hope the market will regain pace after Eid," said Khondker. The market climbed on a buying spree in morning trade but fell in the midday session due to profit taking. Buying pressure in the last hour of trade helped narrow the losses however. IT stocks continued rallying but state-run power companies slipped on profit-taking. Bank and mutual funds closed mixed. Trust Bank, the most active issue, dived 10.03 percent to Tk 822.50 following a two-day surge since its listing on October 1. The bank, with an earning per share of Tk 17.06 in the six months to June, floated primary shares at Tk 150 with a premium of Tk 50. Speculation of good business pulled second most active share AB Bank 7.07 percent up, to finish at an all-time high of Tk 2816.75. Sector heavyweight, AIMS 1st mutual fund also edged up 2.86 percent to hit an all-time high of Tk 8.98 after posting 10 percent cash and 20 percent stock dividends for 2006-07. BRAC Bank dipped 0.78 percent to Tk 1298.75, due to profit-taking after recent gains. UCBL regained pace and finished 2.80 percent higher at Tk 4598.5. Of the other most active shares, Heidelberg Cement, LankaBangla Finance, Summit Power and Phoenix Finance gained. Grameen1 MF ended low. The DGEN or general index was down 5.79 points or 0.21 percent to 2641.72. The DSI or all-share price index declined 3.32 points or 0.15 percent to 2188.40. The DSE-20 blue chip index shed 11.05 points 0.54 percent to 2021.23. Losers beat gainers 106 to 93. Some 13 issues held steady. Turnover fell to Tk 1.86 billion from the trading of 23,768,655 shares. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange, except for the CSE-30 index, closed up.
