 TOKYO, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average retreated 0.6 percent on Thursday from the previous session's nine-week closing high, dragged down by high-tech shares such as Kyocera Corp after a negative report on Intel Corp. Retail giant Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd dropped more than 3 percent on news it will likely miss its first-half profit target. Aeon Co Ltd , Japan's second-biggest retail group, lost nearly 5 percent. It said minutes before the closing bell its first-half operating profit fell 18 percent, hit by poor sales at its US apparel unit Talbots Inc The market received some support as banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group continued their rally on the notion the worst is over for the US subprime mortgage market, said Akihito Yamanoi, general manager of the equity investment department at AIG Global Investment Corp. (Japan). "It's natural for the market to adjust itself after the recent rally ... but before the US jobs data, investors find it hard to make a move," he said. Investors are watching Friday's release of September US payrolls data, which may suggest the housing slump and credit market turmoil is seeping into the broader US economy. Yamanoi said high-tech shares weakened following the brokerage coverage on Intel, while the upside for bank shares may be limited as investors have bearish earnings expectations on the sector. The Nikkei average fell 107.40 points to finish at 17,092.49. On Wednesday, the benchmark booked its highest close since July 31 at 17,199.89. The broader TOPIX shed 0.5 percent or 8.41 points to 1,655.60 after logging its highest finish since Aug. 9 the previous day. Trade was moderate, with 2.0 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section, compared with last week's daily average of 1.9 billion. Declining stocks beat advancing ones by a ratio of two to one. HIGH-TECH STOCKS DOWN, BANKS GAIN AGAIN Kyocera and high-tech stocks were among the main losers, taking their cue from a drop in U.S. giant Intel. Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the chip maker with an "underweight" rating, saying it expected an inventory correction and a price war. Shares of Kyocera were down 2.1 percent to 10,630 yen, while Sony Corp lost 2.4 percent to 5,760 yen and Advantest Corp shed 0.8 percent to 3,670 yen. Easing concerns for subprime problems encouraged investors to buy financial shares, which had been among the worst performers so far. Tsuyoshi Segawa, equity strategist at Shinko Securities, said credit market-related losses revealed by major global banks were welcomed by investors as they helped alleviate uncertainty. Mitsubishi UFJ gained 1.1 percent to 1,171 yen, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc rose 1.2 percent to 958,000 yen and Mizuho Financial Group Inc climbed 1.7 percent to 703,000 yen. Shares of Seven & I Holdings dropped 3.3 percent to 2,920 yen after the Nikkei business daily reported Seven & I would likely miss its first-half operating profit target, hit by costs for its new electronic money system. Shares of Aeon fell 4.6 percent to 1,623 yen. Shares of trading houses also fell after a rally. Shares of Mitsubishi Corp dropped 3.6 percent to 3,490 yen, Mitsui & Co Ltd lost 3.6 percent to 2,780 yen and Itochu Corp tumbled 5.4 percent to 1,383 yen. KDDI Corp, Japan's No. 2 mobile phone operator, inched 0.2 percent higher to 845,000 yen after it unveiled a new pricing plan that cuts basic fees and calling rates while raising handset prices in a move that could fuel a price w
