<TITLE> French politicians dismayed at latest EADS scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's opposition Socialists said the previous centre-right government must share the blame for the latest scandal at EADS and politicians of all parties voiced dismay at allegations of insider dealing at the aerospace group. "The behaviour of certain top executives, as scandalous as it may be, must not hide the responsibility of the state which backed up these sales," the Socialists said in a statement. France's bourse watchdog AMF confirmed on Wednesday it had sent prosecutors a report on possible insider dealing at EADS, in which the French state holds a 15 percent stake. According to a judicial source with knowledge of the report, it says there were "massive and concurrent" sales of shares by well-placed insiders prior to a sharp drop in the share price, although it makes no formal accusation of insider dealing. The report follows a year-long investigation into claims of insider trading at the owner of the Airbus group, which saw its share price slide 26 percent following delays to its prestigious A380 jumbo airliner last year. A number of top executives and two main shareholders, France's Lagardere and Germany's DaimlerChrysler, sold large numbers of shares in the first half of 2006, before the full extent of the A380 problems emerged in June that year. "If the AMF report is correct, these are serious actions that have to be pursued," said Patrick Devedjian, secretary general of the ruling centre right UMP party. "What's serious is that people, notably civil servants, should have abused their trust irresponsibly with regard to the interests of a national company in which the state held shares and in their own interest," he said. Lagardere has denied any insider dealing, while DaimlerChrysler has declined to comment. EADS said it was surprised by the publication of information concerning the investigation. BIG BLOW The affair has strengthened criticism of the often opaque links between the top levels of French business and politics and increased calls for more transparency at groups like EADS in which the state can exercise control over management. Francois Sauvadet, head of the New Centre group, which is allied to the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, said there had to be a full explanation of what happened. "This is a big blow to the image of France," he said. "The justice system has to get right to the bottom of this because it really poses questions about transparency and management." He said Thierry Breton, finance minister at the time, should give a full explanation of the conditions under which the share sales were authorised. Breton said on Wednesday that authorities had acted with full propriety and that the French state itself had not sold any of its EADS shares. But Socialist leader Francois Hollande said the then centre-right government must have been aware of the problems at the group when the disputed share sales went ahead. The fact that Lagardere sold some of its shares to state bank Caisse des Depots made it even worse, he said. "How could the state have let the Caisse des Depots buy shares from Lagardere when it was known that they were at a very high level and that they were inevitably going to fall?" "The state is doubly responsible, firstly for letting the sale go ahead and secondly for letting the Caisse des Depots buy them," he said.
