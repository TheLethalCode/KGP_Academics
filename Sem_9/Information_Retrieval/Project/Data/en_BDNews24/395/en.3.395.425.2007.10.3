<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The leader of the BNP's reformist faction Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Wednesday called for a united BNP that rose above divisions within the party. "The BNP has to participate in the next elections as a united party. That's why I still say, no more factions. Let us all be together," he said. The expelled secretary general of the BNP told reporters at his Gulshan home that his reform plans were not meant to divide the party but to strengthen it. Bhuiyan said differences over reforms needed not split the party and urged fellow party members to be united. He also said the country would not return to its pre-Jan 11 situation. "No-one should do or say anything that could disrupt the unity of the BNP," he said. He trashed the decision to expel him from the party saying it had been done without the approval of the party forum. Most of the central leaders and former MPs agree with him, he added. But he refused to comment on the appointment of Khandaker Delwar Hossain as his replacement. Bhuiyan explained his position on party reform: "We think reforms are necessary. The BNP's tarnished image and the problems within the party can be only corrected through reform. "I have said earlier and am saying now that the reform proposals are just proposals. All proposals have to be finalised by the party council. But we don't want divisions in the party over this." On the 14-party alliance's demand to ban religion-based and racist political parties, Bhuiyan said that the Election Commission was not authorised to ban anyone except terrorists. "The law has specific provisions for war criminals. The polls will decide who the people will accept or reject." Bhuiyan supported the lifting of emergency prior to the polls for a free and fair election. But he commented that the emergency came as a result of violence committed by the political parties. Replying to a query about an Awami League-BNP joint movement, Bhuiyan made it clear that no movements were being contemplated. He said that the party's organisational activities and reforms were underway although the party's office was closed. Bhuiyan told reporters that the party office was closed long before the ban on indoor politics had come, but that party activities had not been halted. "No matter what, the BNP will rise again through unity," a confident Bhuiyan said. Former minister Osman Farruk stressed party unity and said that appointments or expulsions were of secondary concern. "We want unity in the party; we share the same values. There may be misunderstandings, but that does not mean we want to divide the party," he said. Vice-president of BNP Major (retd) Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, adviser to the chairperson AHM Mofazzal Karim, former MP Nazir Hossain, and Masud Arun, among others, were present. bdnews24.
