 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has initiated a move to make most of the official secret records open to the public in a bid to ensure transparency and stop corruption, an official said Wednesday. However, records that are sensitive and linked to state security will not be made public. The initiative would, in effect, relax the Official Secrets Act. Establishment secretary Md Abdus Salam Khan told bdnews24.com: "We willas far as possiblemake official matters open to the public. A committee has been constituted for the purpose." Md Aminul Islam, secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office, also told bdnews24.com: "Work to make records open to people is going on. We hope to complete the work by year-end." He further said, "If people are able to know about official documents, records and publications, they will be conscious of their rights. This will reduce harassment as well as corruption leading to accountability of the government." A senior government official, preferring not to be named, told bdnews24.com, "Through this move, the Official Secrets Act is virtually being relaxed. The act had widespread use in the past. Now, only national security issues and those vulnerable will remain under its purview." He further said, "The government had kept many issues under wraps for long though there was no compulsion to do so under the Official Secrets Act. When these official records are opened, the use of the act will relax." The official said work would be done in phases, as records on different issues could not be opened at a time. An 11-member committee headed by the establishment secretary has been formed to determine records to be released first. Ministries will prepare separate reports on the issues and the committee would help them in their work. After the reports are prepared, the committee will sit separately with the relevant ministries and determine the subjects to be released on the basis of priority. The official expected the work to be complete in two months. The official further said that different ministries had, in the meantime, started meetings on the subject to prepare recommendations. A meeting was held at the Chief Adviser's Office in September. The decision was taken to make the people aware of laws relating to the NGO Bureau, under the Chief Adviser's Office. All information of the bureau would be made available in phases on the internet. Similarly, another meeting was held at the home ministry. The official said the meeting decided to make public the laws of different directorates and also agreements with different countries on the website. Apart from issues linked with state security, a list of subjects related to ministries and directorates will be sent to the establishment ministry. bdnews24.c
