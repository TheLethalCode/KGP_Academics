<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  Sweltering heat was blazing across the country as a low over the mid and northwest Bay of Bengal deepened Thursday, weathermen said. The country, as a result, was experiencing a hot and humid spell. Samarendra Karmakar, director of the Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com, "We're observing the well marked low, which has the potential of deepening further." A Thursday weathercast said the low in the Bay had developed into a well-marked low at about 9am. It could deepen further and advance westward, the forecast added. The low Bay was impeding the flow of the monsoon winds inland, pushing the day temperature to 36 degrees Celsius at Sitakunda in Chittagong. Dhaka temperature was recorded at 34.9 degrees Celsius and the humidity 70 percent. Rain is expected as the low advances inland and makes landfall, and with the rainfall, the heat should dissipate, weathermen said. All trawlers and fishing boats in the Bay have been asked to cruise near the coastline and not venture into the deep sea until otherwise advised. bdnews24
