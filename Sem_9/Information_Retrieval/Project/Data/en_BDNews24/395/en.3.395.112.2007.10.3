<TITLE> Tata's $3bn proposal hangs in the balance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 03 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Wednesday said the caretaker administration is not in a position to approve or reject Indian business giant Tata's $3 billion investment proposal. "Technical issues like guaranteeing the gas supply and its pricing are yet to be settled," Azizul told reporters following a meeting with Asian Development Bank official Kunio Senga. Tata's investment proposals include a 1,000 megawatt gas-fired power plant and a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant. Also on the cards is a fertiliser plant with a one million-tonne a year capacity and a 2.4 million-tonne steel mill at Ishwardi. The Indian business conglomerate's proposal has now remained unresolved for over two years. "Tata wants a guaranteed gas supply, but we simply do not know what our reserves are," the adviser said. "So the government is not in a position to say 'yes' or 'no' to the proposal," he added. Dhaka has already rejected Tata's initial 2004 offer to buy gas at a fixed rate of $1.10 per unit over a 20-year period from the government. Dhaka said the price was far too low compared to the international rate. Later, in April 2006, Tata came up with a new proposal that offered to pay $3.10 per thousand cubic feet (TCF) of gas for its fertiliser plant. The revised deal also included a proposal to pay $2.60 per TCF for the steel plant's power supply. However, the plan remained pegged to a 20-year guarantee to supply natural gas to the projects. The adviser, however, remained positive regarding British multinational Asia Energy's coal mining investment proposal, which could potentially cover the Phulbari field. "Asia Energy's proposal depends on a finalisation of the coal policy," said Azizul. Senga told reporters: "The ADB is interested in investing in Phulbari Coal Mining, if the government decides it wants that." The ADB official added that the Bank would make a decision on the investment after talks with a government-formed technical committee. Other talking points between Azizul and the ADB official included flood assistance, sustainable power development, individual power plants and the Sirajganj 450 MW power plant. The adviser said financial losses resulting from the recent flooding are yet to be fully assessed although governmental agencies and donors are working on it. "We estimate losses could amount to between $200-250 million," Azizul said, adding that he hoped most of it would come from donors such as the World Bank and ADB. The WB has already announced it will provide the government with $75 million in flood assistance. The ADB official also met Mir Nasir Hossain, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry at the apex trade body's office. "Some of Asia Energy's proposals go against the interests of the country," Hossain told reporters after the meeting. bd
