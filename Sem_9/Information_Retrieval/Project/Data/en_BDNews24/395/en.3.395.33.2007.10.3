 BOGOTA, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pentagon sees crime, drugs and street gangs as Latin America's top security problems and backs the use of the region's soldiers, rather than police, to tackle the issues. The US military is generally prohibited from law enforcement at home but for Latin America, where many countries have had periods of military dictatorship, US officials view the armed forces as the only institutions capable of responding to crises and combating organized crime. "There was a line of thinking in the 1980s and the early 1990s that we needed to divorce militaries from police functions and try to push that within the hemisphere because the model that we have, of course, we believe is the model that everybody should have," said one US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But some Latin American countries lack competent police forces, the official argued, citing Mexico as an example. "It's going to take several years of Mexico applying some brain power to this and also considerable political effort to convince its citizens that it needs a stronger police force," said the US official, who traveled with Defense Secretary Robert Gates to Latin America this week. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has won lavish praise from Washington for deploying about 25,000 troops to fight drug-smuggling cartels since he took office last December. The United States has sent billions of dollars in aid to Colombia for its army-led offensive against Marxist guerrillas and cocaine cartels in recent years. Governments in Central America have also deployed troops to patrol cities ravaged by violent youth gangs known as 'maras'. Using army troops in traditional law enforcement roles, however, raises questions about the US commitment to democracy in the region, some Latin America experts argue. "They should be saying 'No, this is a civilian responsibility,'" said George Withers, an expert on regional military affairs at the Washington Office on Latin America. The US Southern Command, responsible for military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, sees very little chance of a war between countries in the region and has identified crime and drugs as its biggest security threats. Adm. James Stavridis, commander of the Southern Command, told Congress in March that Latin America's proximity and close ties to the United States make the drugs war and other criminal gangs "a security concern here at home as well." The US military says it encourages militaries in the region to play a supporting role in policing duties, and the Pentagon has attempted to train both military and police forces. But armies are already being used in a lead role in some areas, and sometimes with lethal effect. In Mexico, soldiers were arrested in June in the deaths of children and women at an army drug checkpoint in the western state of Sinaloa. "For us to export the notion that we should be having militaries go in with their heavy hammer and their heavy weapons to try and keep the peace is exactly the wrong approach," Withers sa
