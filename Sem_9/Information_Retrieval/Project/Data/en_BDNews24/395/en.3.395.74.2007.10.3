<TITLE> Lebanon's woes will not stop Hariri court: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An international court to try suspects in the 2005 killing of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri will proceed even if Lebanon fails to elect a new president, the Lebanese justice minister said on Wednesday. "No one can stop the machine, the machine is unstoppable," Charles Rizk told Reuters at his home in the Christian Achrafiyeh district of Beirut. "If we have the type of worst case scenario, it might hinder, it might retard the action of the tribunal. It will never stop it." The United Nations Security Council approved in May setting up the tribunal which is at the heart of a protracted political crisis in Lebanon between the anti-Syrian government coalition and the opposition led by the pro-Syrian Hezbollah group. The next big problem facing Lebanon is finding a new president acceptable to both camps but fears are running high that if there is no agreement, Lebanon may end up with two rival governments and more bloodshed. Rizk, a Maronite Christian presidential hopeful, said the prospect of a compromise deal that would enable the divided parliament to elect a consensus candidate were 50-50. "Much will depend on the awareness of all parties on the unforeseeable and unforeseen consequences of a non-election. I would say 50-50 -- that's my position today." Already delayed once, the election is now set for Oct. 23, by which time it is hoped the Western-backed ruling faction and the opposition, backed by Syria and Iran, will have reached a deal that would allow parliament to elect a new head of state. Anti-Syrian leaders, led by the son of Hariri, Saad, blame Damascus for Hariri's and other political killings. Syria has consistently denied involvement and its allies in Lebanon's opposition fear the court would be used for score-settling. A UN team is investigating Hariri's killing as well as other assassinations and bombings in the past three years. After the Security Council enforced the court's creation in May under Chapter 7, which makes it mandatory, focus has now shifted to electing a successor to pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud whose term ends on Nov. 23. Rizk warned against a new head of state not committed to the tribunal, which UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said last month he hoped to appoint judges for by the year-end. Rizk has played a key role in the inception of the tribunal and has already sent names of potential judges for the UN to choose from and the first instalment of funds to run the court. "My belief is that if we have anyone for president, a president we should not have a man not committed to the tribunal ... I'm sure this president won't stay long," Rizk said. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's government has been crippled since November after six opposition ministers resigned to protest against the majority coalition's refusal to give them greater powers. "What's important is not to be elected president, what's important is to remain president for six years and this is quite an exercise," said Ri
