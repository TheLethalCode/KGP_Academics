 LONDON, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares ticked up in early trade on Wednesday, tracking gains in Asia and stretching a two-day winning streak on the prospect that the worst of a credit market crunch may be over. At 0717 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,570.25 points, led higher by banking stocks. HSBC was the top weighted gainer on the index, rising 2.6 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland gained 2 percent. Analysts said a recovery was underway and while there might be setbacks in the short term, shares were cheap relative to corporate earnings. "We're happy to see the market rebound, as we were very optimistic throughout the crisis, but we think it's time to take some profits in the short term," said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Pictet & Cie. He said analysts were likely to revise their profit estimates downwards after third-quarter results were announced, but added that in the longer term, valuations were a cause for optimism about equities. "We see equities at the same level or slightly higher by the year-end in Europe," he said.
