 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  More than 50 percent of beneficiary owner accounts have remained without transactions of shares, the chief executive of the Central Depository Bangladesh Limited said Wednesday. As many as eight lakh of 15.5 lakh BO holders had never transacted shares because they did not get primary shares through IPO subscriptions, Mohammed Habibus Samad, managing director and chief executive of CDBL, told bdnews24.com. "But we are not thinking of closing the accounts right now. If they pay the account maintenance fees, they can continue," he said. The executive of CDBL, a platform of electronic book entry system for recording and transferring securities, made the remarks after the Securities and Exchange Commission deadline to pay the annual fees for maintaining BO accounts had expired on Sept 30. Holders of BOs were asked to submit the fees through their respective depository participants (DP). But many BO holders missed the deadline. "We won't take any abrupt action," he said. CDBL fixes a date of closing the accounts after reviewing the status with the DPs and taking guidance from the SEC. Samad also said his office has already withdrawn the custodian charges for having shares in BO accounts. The SEC imposed the fee of Tk 300 a year through a gazette notification in June to check the use of fake and suspicious BO accounts during IPO subscriptions. SEC had earlier asked DPs to start freezing or scrapping dormant BO accounts from Oct 1 if the account holders failed to pay the fees by Sept 30. Anwar Hossain, managing director of Anwar Securities that provides BO account opening services, said his office had started closing BOs holders of those who are reluctant to continue. "About 2,000 BO holders chose to discontinue their accounts. We are only closing them," he said. "We will start closing BOs without fees later." Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of Dhaka Stock Exchange, observed that the deadline to pay account maintenance fees should be relaxed. "It's a new system. We should be flexible if we want to make it effective," he said. bd
