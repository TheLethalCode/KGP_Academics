 LONDON, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks surged to an all-time peak on Tuesday and the dollar rose from this week's record low as investors grew optimistic that financial markets may have seen the worst of the credit crisis. The stabilising dollar took the shine off gold, which hit a 28-year high on Monday, while interbank lending costs for three-month euro deposits hit six-year highs as investors bet on steady euro zone interest rates at a time when the cost of borrowing is expected to fall in the United States and Britain. On Monday UBS, Citigroup and Credit Suisse detailed expected losses from the credit crisis stemming from the fallout in U.S. subprime mortgages. Greater transparency about banks' exposure to housing and credit markets has helped investors shift their focus back to the strong fundamentals the global economy is enjoying this year. "Sentiment has swung 180 degrees in the course of the last week or so. Markets are beginning to take a bet that we can't lose," said Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at Williams de Broe. "Since the Fed rate cut the belief has been growing that markets can't lose because either the US economy's fine and the market's cheap," he said, adding that if the economy did falter the Fed would cut interest rate further. MSCI main world equity index surged past the previous July high to 418.05 points, an all-time high. The index is up 14 percent on the year. Even stronger gains came from emerging markets, where MSCI Asia index outside Japan and the broader emerging index rose 2 percent to record highs. Both indexes are up more than 30 percent this year. Europe lagged slightly, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index up 0.7 percent at a two-month high. Shares in troubled bank Northern Rock rose 6 percent with traders citing talk of a rescue package. Speculation also pushed sterling higher. US stock futures were pointing to a firmer open on Wall Street. Closely-watched data on US pending home sales is due ahead of the open. The dollar was off Monday's record low against a basket of six major currencies while it was up 0.5 percent at $1.4155 per euro after hitting a record low on Monday. The euro extended losses after sources told Reuters that Europe will push for a tougher stance on exchange rate volatility from a Group of Seven finance chiefs meeting in October to help stop the euro's surge against the dollar. In the money market, three-month euro interbank lending rates hit new six-year peaks at daily fixings in London and the euro zone of above 4.79 percent, nearly 80 bps above the European Central Bank's benchmark interest rate. Demand for funding covering the new period, along with expectations that euro zone rates were unlikely to fall from the current level, are keeping interbank lending costs high. "Although markets may be normalising, the economic damage may just be beginning. Many institutions faced with higher funding costs and lower profits will have tightened lending standards to commercial and private borrowers, which in turn will negatively impact consumption," Calyon said in a note to clients. The iTraxx Crossover index, mostly-widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, tightened 9 basis points, while emerging sovereign spreads was tighter by 1 bps. The December Bund future was down 18 ticks. Oil was down broadly after hitting record highs above $80 in September. London Brent crude oil was down 1.4 percent at $76.59 a barrel. Gold fell 2 percent to $731.15 an oun
