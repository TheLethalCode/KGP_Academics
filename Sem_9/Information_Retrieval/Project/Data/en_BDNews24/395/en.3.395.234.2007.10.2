<TITLE> After vote, Ecuador's Correa pushes leftist reforms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 QUITO, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said on Monday he would seek to dissolve Congress and bolster the state's role in the economy after claiming a majority in a weekend vote for an assembly to rewrite the constitution. A leftist who often attacks free-market policies, Correa joins allies Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales in setting up an assembly to push through reforms. His Alianza Pais party won a clear majority in the election on Sunday, a victory that will allow Correa to sidestep opponents in Congress who have tried to block his plans for a "21st Century socialism". "It is difficult to act with this Congress ... this Congress must be tossed back onto the street," Correa told reporters. He called for his delegates to press for early presidential and congressional elections after the assembly finishes its work as well as end the central bank's autonomy and abolish special oil saving funds that restrict government spending. But he struck a more moderate tone in dismissing opposition concerns that he wants to expand his presidential powers. He also said his renegotiation of oil contracts would be "friendly" with no deep reforms in the energy and mining sectors. "We are not a fundamentalist government. We are pragmatic, we recognize there has to be free competition in some sectors to improve their efficiency," he said. Correa, who came into office in January, wants to weaken Ecuador's traditional parties, which are widely blamed for the instability that ousted three presidents in a decade. A government-linked exit poll from Sunday's election and a quick count -- in which a sample of the votes are tallied -- showed Alianza Pais won far more than the 66 seats needed to control the 130-member assembly. Early official results also showed Correa's party with a lead, although a full tally of seats could take weeks. Correa said his party may have secured 80 seats in the assembly. WALL STREET JITTERS Wall Street investors had expected a Correa victory and there was only a moderate move in debt prices on Monday. Ecuador's benchmark 2030 global bond fell 0.250 point to bid 90.000 with a yield of 11.359 percent. Foreign investors are worried by Correa's promises to renegotiate a $10 billion foreign debt, rework oil contracts in South America's No. 5 crude producer and review mining deals. "With Alianza Pais in the driver's seat, the new legislature is likely to validate greater government intervention in critical sectors of the economy," Goldman Sachs senior economist Alberto Ramos said in a note to clients. Pro-government candidates say they are still discussing the reforms they want. But Correa's key delegate and choice for assembly president is Alberto Acosta, a former energy minister who favors more state control over energy resources. A US-trained economist, Correa is highly popular for his rallying cry against career politicians as a corrupt mafia, but critics fear he will amass power and follow Chavez by steering his poor Andean country away from free-market policies. Correa says his majority bloc in the new assembly will push to dissolve the Congress and replace it with a legislative committee that will reflect his majority in the assembly. The assembly will debate a draft of constitutional reforms put together by academics, and will work for at least six months. Its final constitutional reform proposals must be approved in a referendum. bd
