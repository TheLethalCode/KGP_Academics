 BUCHAREST, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania's parliament launched debate on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu's minority government on Wednesday, with deputies from the divided opposition likely to decide his cabinet's fate. Analysts say Tariceanu, who lost his majority when his Liberal Party split with its allies, can survive the cliffhanger vote because some leftist deputies from the Social Democrat Party (PSD) may refuse to oust him. Results of the ballot are expected after 1400 GMT. Tariceanu has won praise for speeding up reforms that earned Romania entry to the European Union in January, but political feuds, particularly with President Traian Basescu, have stalled policy momentum.

"Almost 80 percent of Romanians do not experience the benefits of economic growth," PSD head Mircea Geoana said. The no-confidence motion requires support from at least 232 out of 462 votes in both houses of parliament. The PSD has 146 seats. Along with 77 Democrat deputies and some 30 deputies who have left Tariceanu's Liberal party, they have enough votes to remove Tariceanu. But analysts say many PSD deputies may defy the leadership and hold fire in the secret ballot, loathe to torpedo a weak cabinet which they now have influence over. Romanian media have speculated that a top candidate for Tariceanu's job could be former Interior Minister Vasile Blaga, praised in Brussels for his work in helping Romania join the
