 Dhaka, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com) -- Some 1.6 lakh Bangladeshi workers who have already been approved will be able to go to Malaysia for work, senior government officials said Thursday. The announcement of a fresh ban on the import of Bangladeshi workers on Wednesday had cast a shadow of uncertainty over hundreds of workers who had already received Malaysian visas. "The Malaysian government has shut down fresh recruitment, but it will import 1.6 lakh Bangladeshi workers who are already in the pipeline," Abdul Matin Chowdhury, expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary, told bdnews24.com after a tripartite meeting of the ministry, the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training and recruiting agencies. Malaysian home minister Radzi Sheikh Ahmad announced a ban on the import of workers from Bangladesh Wednesday following what he termed "too many problems" relating to hiring Bangladeshis. Media reports claim that the ban followed an incident where hundreds of Bangladeshi workers were stranded at an airport because their employers had failed to collect them promptly. The Malaysian government placed a similar restriction in 1999 but lifted it in 2006 and approved a fresh intake of 345,000 workers. "Of them 182,500 have already reached Malaysia," Chowdhury said. "The remaining 162,500 will go there in phases." "There is no concern for those who have already been approved," Abdul Malek, director general of BMET told bdnews24.com. "Some 1,400 workers went to Malaysia on Wednesday," he said. He said the pre-approved workers would be able to go in the next 3 to 4 months. Chowdhury said he has directed the recruiting agencies to address the allegation that hundreds of workers were stranded at a Malaysian airport. "We've asked the recruiting agencies not to send any worker without job confirmation," he said. Responding to questions about the government's strategy to deal with the new ban, Chowdhury said, "We'll decide after getting the Malaysian government's decision." Nasiruddin Majumdar of Madina Overseas, one of the major agencies dealing with the labour placement in Malaysia, blamed some third countries for the ban. "Some countries do not want Bangladeshis to go there (Malaysia)." He blamed airlines for charging higher faresTk 32,000 instead of Tk 18,400for the flight to Malaysia. Malaysia's booming economy has become a magnet for cheap labour, especially for menial work that locals are unwilling to do. Some 27 lakh foreign workers mainly from Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Philippines and Pakistan legally work there. It has been reported that hundreds of thousands more were working illegally. bdnew
