 LONDON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares in beleaguered UK mortgage bank Northern Rock were hit by yet another day of volatile trade on Tuesday, touching a historic low at one point, after a media report that a Spanish suitor had pulled out. Engulfed in crisis since it was offered emergency funds by the Bank of England last month, Northern Rock's share price has fallen more than 80 percent since the start of September and some 90 percent from its year high of 1,258 pence in February. The stock fell 15 percent to 112 pence in early trade on Tuesday on fresh concerns it could be sold at a sharp discount as no bid has materialised, but then bounced back before lapsing again, to trade around 127 pence by 0929 GMT. That compares with a 0.3 percent rise in the FTSE all-share index and a 2.2 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx index of European banking stocks, boosted after profit warnings from leading banks UBS and Citigroup on Monday eased uncertainty over losses in the aftermath of the credit crunch. A report by Spanish newspaper ABC said that businessman Jose Maria Ruiz-Mateos, who emerged as a suitor last week, had scrapped plans to bid for a stake in Northern Rock. The paper said Ruiz-Mateos wrote to Merrill Lynch complaining that a meeting was set too late, 10 days after he first expressed an interest. He said the bank's situation had since "considerably worsened". Some analysts are now saying Northern Rock shares are trading below its value in case of a run-off -- if the bank is effectively closed and its business wound down. "You have a lot of speculation, combined with a high degree of illiquidity in the shares at the moment -- that makes it very highly geared to every change in rumour," analyst Mike Trippitt at Oriel Securities said. "I'm of a view that it is dramatically undervalued at 130p -- it's trading about a pound below the run-off value. Admittedly, short-term the cost of funding from the Bank of England is going to kill the earnings, but that is something that is going to be worked through." Meanwhile the cost of insuring Northern Rock's debt against default rose early on Tuesday, with five-year senior credit default swaps widening 5 basis points to 140 basis points, according to Deutsche Ba
