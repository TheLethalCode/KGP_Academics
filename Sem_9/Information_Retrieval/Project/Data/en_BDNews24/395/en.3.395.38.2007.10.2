 WASHINGTON Tue Oct 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most Americans oppose fully funding President George W Bush's $190 billion request to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while a majority supports expanding a children's health care program he has threatened to veto, a Washington Post-ABC News poll shows.

Bush's approval rating stands at 33 percent, equal to his all-time low in this poll and just 29 percent approve of the job Congress is doing -- a 14-point drop since Democrats took control in January, the newspaper said. More than eight in 10 liberal Democrats said Congress has been too restrained in challenging Bush's Iraq policy; about the same percentage of conservative Republicans said it has been too aggressive and a narrow majority of independents, 53 percent, want Congress to do more, the Post reported. Only about 25 percent of Americans support the administration's $190 billion war funding request; 70 percent want the proposed allocation reduced, the Post said. According to the poll, more than seven in 10 support the planned $35 billion increase included in legislation that would renew the children's health care program administered by the states.
