 LONDON, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A giant spider took up residence on the banks of the River Thames in central London on Wednesday, but Arachnophobes can relax -- it doesn't bite or even move.

She has always been at the forefront of new developments in art, exploring her ideas in painting, printmaking, sculpture, installation and performance, using varied media, from wood and stone to latex and rubber. Bronze casts of Maman are on permanent display at The Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea, Mori Art Center in Tokyo and the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. The Tate's Maman is a taster for an exhibition of 200 works by Bourgeois that will open in the gallery on October 10 and run to January 20, 2008.

That will be unveiled on Monday and run for six mont
