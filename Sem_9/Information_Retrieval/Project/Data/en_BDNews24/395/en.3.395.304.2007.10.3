 BELGRADE, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rangers produced the biggest surprise in the Champions league on Tuesday with a 3-0 win at Olympique Lyon that gave them maximum points in Group E. Goals from Lee McCulloch, Daniel Cousin and DaMarcus Beasley put Rangers level on six points at the top of the group with Barcelona, who were 2-0 winners at VfB Stuttgart thanks to second-half goals by Carles Puyol and Lionel Messi. On a bright evening for British clubs, Manchester United edged Roma 1-0 at Old Trafford to put themselves in the driving seat in Group F and Arsenal beat Steaua Bucharest by the same score in Romania to keep top spot in Group H. Goals from Tonel and Polga gave Sporting Lisbon a 2-1 win at Dynamo Kiev after their opening home defeat by Manchester United while Sevilla bounced back from a 3-0 rout at Arsenal to record a 4-2 victory over visitors Slavia Prague. In Group G, Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored with a penalty and a header in the first half to hand 10-man Inter Milan a 2-0 home win over PSV Eindhoven after Cristian Chivu was sent off in the 65th minute. The result put Inter level with PSV on three points from two matches behind leaders Fenerbahce, who have four points after their 2-2 draw at CSKA Moscow in the afternoon kickoff. Three Brazilians scored in the encounter, Alex giving the Turkish champions an early lead and Deivid snatching a late equaliser after Serbian midfielder Milos Krasic and Vagner Love and had turned the match for CSKA, who have one point. SUPERB FINISH Although a cautious approach by Roma ensured there would be no repeat of the 7-1 drubbing they received at Old Trafford last season, a superb finish by Wayne Rooney still gave United three hard-earned points. The home side were rewarded for their second-half pressure in the 70th minute when Rooney netted his first goal of the season with a crisp first-time shot on the turn after a neat pass by Nani. United had to survive a nervy finish with 10 men on the pitch as Cristiano Ronaldo came off with a bleeding forehead after they had made all three substitutions and Mauro Esposito fired just wide of the far post for Roma. There was no such drama in Lyon, where Rangers produced their best Champions League performance of recent times in an emphatic victory over the winners of six successive French league titles. McCullough headed Rangers into a 23rd minute lead, Cousin rifled in the second and Beasley calmly slotted home the third as the Scottish side ended their nine-game winless away streak in the competition dating back to 2000. In Bucharest, Robin van Persie settled a tight affair when he drilled a 76th-minute winner into the roof of the net after strike partner Emmanuel Adebayor made a darting run and cut the ball back to the Dutchman. Goals from Frederic Kanoute, Luis Fabiano, Julien Escude and Arouna Kone gave Sevilla a comfortable win over Slavia in their first home match in the Champions League, leaving them level on three points with the Czech side in Group H
