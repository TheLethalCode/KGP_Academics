 BAGHDAD, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq will put off carrying out the death sentence against Saddam Hussein's cousin, widely known as "Chemical Ali", until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 10 days time, the prime minister said on Wednesday. An Iraqi appeals court upheld Ali Hassan al-Majeed's death sentence at a hearing on Sept. 4, with the sentence to be carried out within 30 days of that decision.

Rumours had swirled soon after the appeal court decision that Maliki's Shia-led government would move to hang Majeed before the start of Ramadan last month but he remains in custody in a US detention facility. Sunni Arabs, dominant under Saddam, accused the government of acting with unseemly haste in carrying out Saddam's death sentence on Dec. 30, four days after a court rejected his appeal in a separate case. Sunni Arab governments, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, also criticised the timing of the execution, which took place at the start of the Eid al-Adha religious feast.

Prosecutors in that case had warned he could be executed before the trial was complet
