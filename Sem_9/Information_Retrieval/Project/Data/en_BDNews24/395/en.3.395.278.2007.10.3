 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police has asked the UNDP for specialised equipment to help fight mobile phone-assisted crime, a senior police official said Tuesday. A letter from Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Naim Ahmed to the United Nations Development Programme asked for 2,000 closed-circuit cameras and a mobile telephony interceptor. "We need the equipment to improve services in the department which currently lacks confidence and competence. We also suffer from a lack of modern equipment to trace high-tech crime," Ahmed said. Over the last few years, police have recorded an increase in crimes such as extortion and ransom demands that have been facilitated by the wide spread use of mobile phones. Police drives to catch criminals have also been compromised by the speed information can now travel around the country. A UNDP official, who requested not to be named, said they had received a request from Dhaka police for assistance in phone related crime. Ahmed also said they were planning to modernise the department's services under a project called Corporate Plan. The DMP wants to install the closed-circuit cameras at busy intersections, market places, bus stations, ferry terminals and railway stations. The controversial mobile telephony interceptor is used to jam mobile phone calls and has been criticised widely for its uncertain legality. "Our aim is to deal with crime. Implementation of the Corporate Plan will increase the competence of Dhaka's police force. We have specific aims in mind," Ahmed said. The Corporate Plan aims to make police stations more service-oriented, increase internal discipline and create a special crimes team as well as install a criminal database. "Preparation of the criminal database is underway. It will contain 17 different types of data including the photographs of criminals in all police stations in Dhaka," the DMP chief said. bdnews24.com
