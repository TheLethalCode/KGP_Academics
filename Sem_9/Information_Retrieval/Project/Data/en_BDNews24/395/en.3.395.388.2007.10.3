 CAIRO, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Profit-taking by local and Arab investors sent Egyptian indexes slightly down on Wednesday, putting the brakes on a bullish run that saw the bourse hit all-time highs, traders said. "This is the normal profit taking we see in the market every 200 points move up," said Mohamed Fathallah of el-Shorouk Brokerage. The benchmark Case 30 index lost 0.6 percent to 8,757.59 points while the well watched Hermes index was down 0.5 percent to 76,926.96 points. The broader CIBC index shed 0.1 percent to 388.01 points. The Commercial International Bank (CIB), which led the market up on Tuesday, lost 0.3 percent to last trade at 78.99 Egyptian pounds ($13.74). "CIB is fundamentally very solid and that's why the profit taking is so mild on the stock," Fathallah said. News of a possible merger between CIB and Arab African International Bank that could create the biggest private lender in the country pushed the stock to new record highs on Tuesday. The banking sector, however, maintained its momentum, said Eissa Fathi Eissa of the Strategic Company for Securities. Housing and Development Bank jumped 9.4 percent to last trade at 57.98 Egyptian pounds a share. Credit Agricole rose 0.5 percent to 18.30 pounds, while National Societe Generale Bank gained 2.1 percent to 45 pounds. "The possible CIB merger still had an effect on the sector and also investors are expecting good results and some capital increases," Eissa added. Egyptian Resorts Company was the second-biggest loser on the CASE 30 index in heavy trading after an auction to sell a 24 percent stake in the company owned by the government on Tuesday was delayed indefinitely. The stock skidded 3.3 percent to 11.52 pounds with "investors speculating over the reason of the delay," said Fathallah. "Either they didn't get serious offers or the offers were too low and both possibilities are bad," he added. ($1 = 5.57 Egyptian poun
