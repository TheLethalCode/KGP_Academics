 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Tuesday refuted media reports that he had wanted the state of emergency to continue through parliamentary elections. "I didn't say the emergency should remain in force until the election," the CEC told reporters in his office, referring to his Monday speech in Tangail, allegedly misquoted by many newspapers. Huda said: "The reports are completely baseless." "I said there (in Tangail) that elections cannot be held under emergency. So the sooner the election is held, the earlier the state of emergency will be withdrawn. "For this, I have urged all to extend cooperation to the Election Commission, especially in making the voter list," he said. Huda said the state of emergency needs to be withdrawn from specific areas at least two months before the elections to city corporations and local bodies. On the Jatiya Sangsad elections, the CEC said: "And it is up to the government when it will lift the emergency clearing the way for parliamentary elections." bdnew
