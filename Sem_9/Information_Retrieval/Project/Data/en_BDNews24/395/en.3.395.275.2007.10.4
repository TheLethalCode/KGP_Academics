<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's state broadcaster has cut back on Indonesian songs on its airwaves and urged private broadcasters to follow suit, an official said on Thursday, following a row over ownership of a folk song. The ruling by the Information Ministry came as the two states bickered over a folk song that many Indonesians say belongs to their country but used by Malaysia in its tourism campaign. The issue over the song, "Rasa Sayang" (Feeling of Love), is threatening to turn into a diplomatic spat between the neighbouring nations, which share religious and cultural ties. A Malaysian information ministry official said the government had told private radio stations not to be obsessed with airing of Indonesian songs on their airwaves. "The frequency of airing the Indonesian songs is threatening the songs of our artistes," the official said, quoting his minister, Zainuddin Maidin. "We regret Indonesia is not giving the same treatment to Malaysian artistes," he added. Indonesian Tourism Minister Jero Wacik has said he and several experts were trying to gather proof that "Rasa Sayang" belonged to Indonesia, and would protest if there was evidence. Malaysian Culture Minister Rais Yatim, joining in the fray, said Indonesia would not able to prove it. "But if Indonesia wants to pursue the matter, it will face a dead end and will also affect Malaysia-Indonesia ties," news agency Bernama quoted him as saying. Indonesians believe the song originated from the eastern islands of Muluku, as the lyrics of the Indonesian version suggest. An Indonesian official on Thursday sought to defuse the row. "There's no need to claim and counter-claim. This folk song had existed even before we were born. There's no need to make a fuss of it," State Secretary Hatta Radjasa said. Resentment against Malaysia sometimes spills over, often tied to reports of abuse of Indonesian maids or the treatment of the many other Indonesian workers in the country. In late August, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was forced to apologise to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono after an Indonesian karate referee alleged he was assaulted by the Malaysian police outside Kuala Lump
