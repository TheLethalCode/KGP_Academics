<TITLE> EU to mull time curbs on bloc's doorstep sellers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Doorstep sellers who ply their goods and services to the European Union's 490 million consumers may face curbs on when they can call, an EU document showed. The EU's executive European Commission is reviewing a 20-year-old set of rules that protect consumers when they negotiate with sellers away from traditional business premises. The EU executive is due to launch a consultation on how the rules should be updated, and according to a draft obtained by Reuters, will ask whether time restrictions on unsolicited visits -- as enforced in Belgium -- should be EU-wide. "Do you feel that the introduction at European level of restrictions on the hours during which direct sellers can make unsolicited visits to a consumer's home would benefit consumer protection," the document said. It will also ask whether the scope of the rules should be extended to arranged visits. "The Commission is aware, for instance, of calls in certain member states to extend the protection offered by the directive to all solicited visits, which seem to be more common nowadays," the document said. It will seek comment on whether the French practice of banning advance payments before a minimum seven-day right of withdrawal period has passed, should also be EU-wide. The issue of rogue traders who put heavy pressure on vulnerable consumers to buy is already addressed in another piece of EU legislation. The consultation will ask whether the scope of the rules should be widened to include the street, fairs, during excursions or at other occasions where people can be approached. Transactions worth less than 60 euros are excluded from the rules but the consultation will look at whether this needs adjusting or harmonising across the EU.
