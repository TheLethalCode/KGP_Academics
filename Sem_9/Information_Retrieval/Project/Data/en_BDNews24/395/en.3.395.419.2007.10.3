 KARACHI, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has denied agreeing to pay 10 million rupees ($152,000) to former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq to mark his retirement from all forms of cricket. Speculation has been rife about the future of the senior batsman, with newspapers and television channels reporting that Inzamam was set to retire after playing in the second test against South Africa starting on Oct. 8 in Lahore. The Jang said Inzamam had held a meeting with PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf in which it was decided that Inzamam would be paid 10 million rupees for his services to Pakistani cricket. The board said on Wednesday, however, that it would be announcing a decision on Inzamam's future in the next few days. "The news about the PCB assuring and guaranteeing Inzamam 10 million on his retirement from test cricket is absolutely incorrect," a PCB statement said.
