 PANAMA CITY, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Panama Canal reported its busiest-ever year in the last 12 months, according to figures released on Tuesday by the body that manages the inter-oceanic waterway. Posting figures for its fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, the Panama Canal Authority said transits though the 50-mile (80-km) waterway were up 3.7 percent to a record 14,721 from 14,194 in the year-ago period. It also said that cargo volumes surpassed the symbolic barrier of 300 million tons in the last 12 months, thanks in part to a 10 percent jump in container ship transits and a rise in the number of large vessels traversing the canal. Work began last month on an ambitious project to double the canal's capacity so that even bigger ships can pass through. The $5.25 billion project is expected to be completed by 2014. It is by far the biggest expansion project in the canal's 93-year history and has engineering firms from around the world scrambling to win contracts. The pre-qualification period for the biggest contract will conclude later this month, when the field of firms hoping to win a $3 billion-plus tender to build a third set of locks will be whittled down to four consortia. bd
