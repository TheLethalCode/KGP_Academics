 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  The two major political camps set aside their see-saw rivalry Wednesday to put a squeeze on the military-backed interim administration to end emergency rules sooner rather than later. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and senior Awami League leaders aired that demand that went in stark contrast to the chief election commissioner's recent preference for lifting the emergency two months before the general elections. CEC ATM Shamsul Huda Tuesday said he would like an end to the emergency rules two months ahead of the next elections scheduled for end-2008sometime between October and December, to be precise. Both camps Wednesday stood for a clear "political context" for free and credible vote. "We want the state of emergency to go as soon as possible. A political environment will not come back unless people's rights become vibrant and the ban on political activities goes," Delwar said. "Lifting the state of emergency is important for free and acceptable (national) elections," he said. He also reminded the interim administration that it had been mandated to stage national elections to hand over power to an elected government and that other elections could wait. "The constitution suggests so," Delwar told reporters at his Mohakhali home in the city. Delwar did not give a direct reply on whether the BNP would take part in any voting apart from the national elections. "The caretaker government's task is to hold the national elections. The local government elections usually do not happen with direct political nomination. "We want that the Election Commission stage a free and fair election after creating a political atmosphere." The Awami League said it wanted an end to the state of emergency earlier than two months before the general elections. "The emergency should go [earlier than two months before elections] so that the political parties can run their activities," Zillur Rahman, acting president of the party, told reporters after a meeting with Samyabadi Dal, one of the allies of its 14-party coalition. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed was did not set any timeframe. "The matter is not about two or six months, we think the emergency should go at the right time," he told reporters as he accompanied Zillur during the post-meeting briefing at the latter's Gulshan home. bd
