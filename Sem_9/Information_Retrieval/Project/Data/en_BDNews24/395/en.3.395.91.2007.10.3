 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  Tim May, chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers Association (FICA), is likely to come in Dhaka in November to assess the activities of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB). The CWAB's FICA membership will hinge on the former Australian Test cricketer's assessment, an official said Wednesday. "He (Tim) was supposed to come here between October 10 and 15 to see the CWAB activities, but we have requested him to defer his tour because of Eid festival," member secretary of interim CWAB committee Debabrata Paul told bdnews24.com. "He may come here sometime in November and he will let us know about his trip schedule on November 1," said Paul, a fast bowler of the Barisal Division team of the upcoming National Cricket League. The former Australian off-spinner represented the Bangladesh in the FICA annual general meeting on September 10 in Johannesburg as former CWAB general secretary Naimur Rahman Durjoy could not attend the meeting because of a visa delay. Paul said world's renowned cricketers including FICA vice president Courtney Walsh and Sri Lankan Cricketers Association president Mahela Jayawardene had attended the Johannesburg meeting. They had suggested a report on the CWAB activities for considering the membership, Paul added. bdnew
