 MADRID/LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Spain's Ferrovial said on Wednesday its plans to refinance up to 10 billion pounds ($20.4 billion) of debt were at risk if British regulators pressed ahead with planned price controls for its UK airports. Earlier, Britain's Competition Commission proposed new caps on the charges that the construction group's UK subsidiary, BAA, levies from airlines at its Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London. The Commission also slammed BAA for its standard of service, particularly for its failure to manage queues at security checks. However, analysts said the price caps were not as severe as they had expected, and shares in Ferrovial actually rose sharply, trading 3.6 percent higher at 64.5 euros by 1043 GMT. One BAA bondholder said he didn't think the refinancing would be shelved. "I don't think the refinancing is going to be materially jeopardised. I think it's just going to be further delayed," said Jonathan Pitkanen, at Morley Fund Management. Ferrovial is trying to refinance debt taken on to buy BAA last year plus existing BAA debt, a task made difficult by sharply reduced liquidity in lending markets. At the same time it is fending off widespread attacks from the British media, politicians and airline bosses, who have blasted Heathrow and Gatwick's poor service, ageing infrastructure and long queues. SPREADS WIDEN BAA said it was committed to improving service at the airports, but warned the proposed price controls for the next five years would make that job harder. "We see little in the Competition Commission's report which delivers the incentives to transform the airports," said Stephen Nelson, chief executive of BAA, in a statement. "Nor do we believe the Competition Commission recognises the scale and nature of the challenges we face in seeking to deliver a step change in the passenger experience." Separately, Ferrovial said the proposed price caps put its massive refinancing at risk. The deal, the largest ever of its kind, uses revenue streams from the airports as collateral against debt, in the hope of securing cheaper rates. "These proposals introduce a high degree of risk that the refinancing plans in the form developed over the last year might not be able to be implemented as currently envisaged," the firm said. The cost of insuring BAA's debt against default rose sharply, with five-year credit default swaps rising 20 basis points to 100 bps, which means it costs 100,000 euros a year to insure 10 million euros of its debt against defa
