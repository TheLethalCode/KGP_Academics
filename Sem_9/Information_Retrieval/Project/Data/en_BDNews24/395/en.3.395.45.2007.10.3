He avoided naming names but his comments follow growing friction over space between Moscow, Washington and Beijing. Earlier this year China tested an anti-satellite missile and the US has been developing weapons which can hit satellites. Russia has more than 60 military and dual-purpose satellites in orbit for communications and intelligence, Popovkin said. Russia's space forces have responsibility for military and dual-use spacecraft launch as well as helping defend the country from hostile intercontinental missile attacks.

Already, Russia can detect any ballistic missile being launched from earth towards Russia," he sa
