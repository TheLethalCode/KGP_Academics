 Al Amin Dewan bdnews24.com CU correspondent Chittagong, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)  An ongoing investigation by a Chittagong University committee has uncovered huge irregularities in the recruitment of staff at the institution. "We could not imagine such levels of corruption in the recruitment process of a university," Prof Md Anisul Islam told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The investigation found most of the 51 staff members uncovered by the report were not qualified for the posts they were appointed to. Appointment letters were issued without the signatures of either the employees or the employer and additional staff was recruited unnecessarily, the report said. The committee also found that employees had been recruited without complying with the conditions of the University Grants Commission or the university budget. The committee identified irregularities at every point of the recruitment process which covered an eight-month period from July 2005 to February 2006. Most irregular appointments were made at the end of former vice-chancellor Professor AJM Nuruddin Chowdhury's tenure. The findings follow an initial investigation, completed in May 2007, which advised a more exhaustive probe on the basis of an alleged lack of transparency in recruitment. The follow-up committee was headed by Prof Imran Hossain from the history department and Prof Helal Uddin Nizami from the accounting and information department. Prof Hossain told bdnews24.com: "All recruitments in the university are finalised by the VC." Serving VC at the university, Prof M Badiul Alam told bdnews24.com: "The probe committee's findings are accurate. The syndicate will take appropriate action." bdnews24.com/a
