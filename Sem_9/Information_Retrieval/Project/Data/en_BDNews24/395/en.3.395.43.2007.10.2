 BLACKPOOL, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Conservatives played the law and order card on Tuesday ahead of a possible snap election, promising to scrap an early release scheme for prisoners and pledging a tougher line on immigration. Home Affairs Spokesman David Davis said the party would ditch the government's controversial ID card scheme to pay for the building of more jail cells. The move would allow the Conservatives to end the government's early release scheme, introduced to ease prison overcrowding by letting 25,000 inmates a year out of jail before the end of their sentences.

Davis said the Conservatives would create a dedicated border force based on a blueprint drawn up for the party by former London police chief Lord Stevens. He contrasted it with the border service announced by Brown in July combining customs and immigration officers, which will not include police. "His new border force is the same people with the same powers. The only real change? A nice new uniform," Davis said. The Conservative immigration restrictions would be limited to citizens from outside the European Union who do not have a legal right to work in Britain. They would include transitional arrangements for new EU members along the lines of those in plac
