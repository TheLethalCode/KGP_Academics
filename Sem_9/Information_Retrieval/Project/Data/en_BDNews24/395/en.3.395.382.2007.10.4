 KARACHI, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Experienced Pakistan duo Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf are set to return to the side for the second test against South Africa from Oct. 8 in Lahore. Sources close to the national selection committee told Reuters on Thursday that both Inzamam and Yousuf had made themselves available for the Lahore test. "Yousuf is already training with the team while Inzamam will join them by tomorrow," said the source. Pakistan are facing defeat in the first test against South Africa at the National stadium. Inzamam, 37, who has appeared in 119 tests, resigned from the captaincy and retired from one-day internationals after Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup in the Caribbean. Yousuf pulled out of the first test due to a lack of match fitness on Monday. "With the Indian tour also coming up from next month and with Australia due next year, the feeling is the presence of these two is required in an inexperienced middle order," the source said. "Inzamam will be meeting with key board officials and the selectors in Karachi to decide if will extend his career or retire after the Lahore test." Inzamam is expected to hold a news conference on Friday
