<TEXT>
 Lucknow, India, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Hindu monk was arrested on Wednesday in connection with a bomb attack that killed four people in September in Maharashtra's Malegaon town. The 36-year-old man, head of a Hindu monastery, was charged with conspiring in an attack on Malegaon, a predominantly Muslim town about 200 miles east of Mumbai. Police said the man Sudhakar Dwivedi, who often used the alias Swami Amritanand, was arrested in Kanpur. Earlier this month four other Hindus, one of them a senior army officer, were arrested in connection with the Malegaon attack and a second bombing in Modasa, more than 200 miles north of Mumbai. There have been bomb attacks this year in the major cities of Bangalore, New Delhi, Jaipur and Ahmedabad. For years, bombings in India have mostly been blamed by the authorities on Islamists seeking to foment hatred between the majority Hindus and minority Muslims. Police have detained dozens of Muslims whom they suspected of involvement in the attacks. In October more than 80 people were killed when 11 bombs ripped through Assam. An Islamist group claimed responsibility. In August, two suspected Hindu militants died while trying to build a bomb in Kanpur.
