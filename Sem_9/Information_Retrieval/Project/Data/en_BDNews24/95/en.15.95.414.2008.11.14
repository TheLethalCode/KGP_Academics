 LONDON, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - London metropolitan police are investigating an incident involving Chelsea striker Didier Drogba who threw a coin back into the crowd during the League Cup loss to Burnley at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. "We are investigating the incident as a whole," a police spokesman said on Thursday. "It's obviously very early stages at the moment." Drogba had gestured to Burnley fans while celebrating his first goal of the season. Championship (second division) Burnley won 5-4 on penalties after the fourth round tie ended 1-1 following extra time. "I tried to celebrate the goal and I received some things at me," he told the Chelsea website (www.chelseafc.com). "The big mistake I did was to throw it back so if someone was hurt I just want to apologise for it. This is not something I should show in a football match. "It was an incident in the heat of the moment and I regret it. It was just a mistake and nothing more." An FA spokesman said the governing body would issue a statement later on Thursday
