 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP lawmaker Nasiruddin Pintu has been accused of assaulting deputy jailer Nasir Ahmed at the prison wing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, where the ex-MP is detained. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com on Monday that two deputy jailers and a security guard went to the BSMMU cabin where Pintu was receiving treatment under custody. "The jail officials were assigned to escort Pintu to court," said Siddiqui. "He was later taken back to jail after the hospital authorities issued a release order," the DIG said. The BNP leader has failed to appear in court twice previously due to 'poor health', Siddiqui said, adding that the court this time warned of actions if jail authorities failed to produce the accused on Monday. "Pintu became excited when he saw deputy jailer Nasir, whom he believed to have propagated rumours against him. He slapped and punched the officer," said Siddiqui. The two others managed to intervene and eventually took the prisoner to the court, the DIG added. Jail authorities filed a case with Shahbagh police. Shahbagh assistant sub-inspector of police told bdnews24.com that the aggrieved jail officer filed a case accusing Pintu of obstructing government work and manhandling officials. Nasiruddin Pintu was arrested on Feb 17 last year. He was transferred from jail to the BSMMU prison wing on Apr 11 last year for treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes. On Sept 11 the same year he was taken back to jail. The BNP leader returned again to BSMMU on Jan 5 this year, staying until March 27. He was admitted for a third time under custody on Aug 24 last. The ex-MP was produced before court in a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face earlier this month. bdnew
