<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Fri Nov 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With six kids to watch over, "Changeling' star Angelina Jolie told the BBC she plans to fade away from acting to spend more time raising her family, but she stopped short of pledging to quit her craft for good. "I don't plan to keep acting very long, I'm ready to do a few things now and fade away and get ready to be a grandma one day," Jolie told the British broadcaster in an interview posted on the BBC website on Thursday. Jolie and her partner actor Brad Pitt have emerged as a Hollywood power couple, and together they have three biological children and three adopted children. In response to a question about whether she will give herself a "cutoff point" for acting, Jolie, 33, said she would make no pledge to completely stop acting. Jolie, who stars in the movie "Changeling" from director Clint Eastwood, said she has not worked on a movie for a year. Apart from starting a project in February, she said that she will probably not work again for another year. "So maybe it will be once a year and then maybe it will be once every three years, and then just naturally -- I like being home a lot these days," Jolie told the BBC. Jolie, who earned an Oscar for her supporting role in the 1999 movie "Girl, Interrupted," would not be the first actor to talk of walking away from it all at a young age. Last month, "We Own the Night" star Joaquin Phoenix, 34, said that he was retiring from acting to focus on making music. Sean Penn, 48, has also talked about retiring from acting over the years, but his career continues and he stars in the movie "Milk," which opens on December 5
