<TEXT>
 ABU DHABI, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An undefeated century from Shivnarine Chanderpaul proved in vain as Pakistan beat West Indies by 24 runs on Friday to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Chanderpaul hit 107 in 149 balls to lead West Indies to 208 all out in 48.5 overs after Pakistan, who won the first match by four wickets on Wednesday, had chalked up a total of 232. The left-hander, playing his 236th one-dayer, struck his ninth hundred to keep his team in the run chase after they had slipped to 14 for two. Playing patiently, Chanderpaul stroked six fours but lacked support once Ramnaresh Sarwan fell for 45 in the 29th over after the pair had compiled a 92-run third wicket partnership. Earlier, pace bowlers Jerome Taylor and Daren Powell claimed three wickets apiece after Pakistan won the toss and batted first. Misbah-ul-Haq (52) and Kamran Akmal (45) came to the rescue after Pakistan had slumped to seven for two. Taylor, who suffered the ignominy of conceding 17 runs in the final over of the first game to hand Pakistan a close win, redeemed himself by dismissing Salman Butt, Shahid Afridi and Rao Iftikhar. Younis Khan batted steadily for 34 before he was bowled by a sharp yorker from Powell, sweet revenge for the paceman after the Pakistan batsman had earlier hit him for three successive fours. West Indies then lost both openers for a duck before Chanderpaul and Sarwan rallied. However, with the run-rate and pressure mounting, Sarwan was trapped lbw by Afridi after having hit four boundaries. Chanderpaul stood firm at one end as Pakistan's bowlers picked up regular wickets at the other and the match was ended when seamer Umar Gul removed Powell and Lionel Baker in the penultimate over. The third and final match is on Sunday
