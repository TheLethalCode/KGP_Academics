 Liton Haider and Prodeep Chowdhury Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Monday ordered BNP leader M Saifur Rahman, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed to jail in the Barapukuria coalmine case. Their lawyers appealed to the judge Amar Kumar Roy to adjourn the hearing and 'uphold' their bails since the High Court was scheduled to give a ruling on Tuesday. But the prosecution said they were not on bail and hence should be detained. The High Court had earlier ordered the three to surrender to the trial court by Nov. 10. Deputy inspector general, prisons, major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that the accused were sent to Dhaka Central Jail at 3:15pm. The court also sent BNP leader, former minister of state for energy Mosharraf Hossain to jail after he surrendered to the court later in the day, denying him bail. Earlier, hundreds of Jamaat supporters chanting anti-government slogans flooded around the Jatiya Sangsad premises where the special court is located, as the Jamaat leaders arrived. Manik Mia Avenue and Rokeya Sarani were closed as part of a tight security cordon around the area. Nizami was the first to enter the Special Judge's Court-2 in the paeliament complex at around 10am, followed by Mojaheed. Saifur arrived at 11:30am. Another accused in the case, former energy minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain, was sent to jail Sunday after surrendering to the court on Sunday. bdnews24.co
