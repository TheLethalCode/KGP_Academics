<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The national elections will be held in "a free environment", an adviser said on Saturday, hinting at an environment free of the state of emergency. "The government will consider fully lifting the state of emergency if the election environment develops smoothly," commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters at a press briefing at the Chief Adviser's Office. Before the full withdrawal, another phase of relaxation of emergency was under consideration after the nomination process was complete, he said. With BNP continuing to press its demand for a total withdrawal of emergency as a condition to joining the election, and Awami League declaring it is "all set" for parliamentary polls on Dec. 18, the adviser's statement signals continued attempts to smooth an accord with the two major parties. On the demand by parties for "a level playing field", he said: "A huge change has been brought in field administration at the request of the Election Commission." "The government is determined to strictly control any tendency that influences the electoral process," Hossain Zillur said. If the EC received any complaint of bias, proper measures would be taken in this regard, he said. He added that amendments had been brought to Representation of People Order Ordinance. The power of the EC had been ensured to resolve any such allegations, he said. On the pending trial of a number of cases against potential candidates, the adviser said that the issue was under the purview of independent judicial system. Asked about the redrawing of constituencies, he said: "As the issue has been resolved in the court it is no more relevant." bdnew
