 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) - Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Saturday rejected World Bank advice to reduce direct subsidy to the agriculture sector, spreading it to other sectors to manage food price inflation. The decreasing prices of commodities, including fuel, food and fertiliser in the international market, meant the rate of subsidy in 2008-09 fiscal year would be less than estimated, said the finance adviser at a South Asia Regional Conference on Managing Food Price Inflation. WB senior manager (regional programmes) Sadiq Ahmed, speaking earlier in the conference, had suggested the money set aside for agricultural subsidies should be used for improving rural infrastructure, on-farm technology and research as alternate means to subsidies for raising farm output. For the first time in South Asia's history, double digit inflation rates have hit all countries in the region, with the global economic crisis "adding fuel to the fire", said Ahmed. Although food prices are coming down, long term measures against further food shocks must be considered, said the economist. Paying high prices to producers is not necessarily the answer, he intimated. But speakers, the finance adviser among them, criticised the Bank's proposal for withdrawing subsidy from the agricultural sector. Mirza Aziz replied, ""If direct subsidy is not given in the agriculture sector now, and farmers do not get prices according to their production costs, they will be discouraged." "The prices of basic commodities will soar further and the country will face further food crises." The adviser also pointed out that the present budget had adequate allocations for infrastructure development. "In taking long term policy decisions, we will give more attention to increased production," he said. "At the same time, farmers will be given improved technological assistance." "A fund has been formed for agricultural research in the present budget," he added and hoped that such assistance would continue in future. Expressing optimism about the present food stock of the country, which stands at 14 lakh tonnes, the finance adviser dispelled any possibility of a food deficiency in the future. The two day conference was being jointly organised by the Power and Participation Research Centre and World Bank, with representaives from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are participating. The inaugural function was held at the Radisson Water Garden Hotel on Saturday. bdnews24.c
