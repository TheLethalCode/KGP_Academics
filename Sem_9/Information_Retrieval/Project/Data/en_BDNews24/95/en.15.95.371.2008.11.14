 RANCHI, Fri Nov 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six tribal children died and more than 60 fell ill after drinking adulterated milk in a state school in Jharkhand, officials said on Friday. The students, aged between 8 and 13 years, began vomiting and complaining of stomach aches after drinking milk and eating snacks on Thursday evening, officials said. More than 30 children are in hospital in Ranchi, nine in critical condition, doctors said. "Adulterated milk seems to have caused food poisoning," said Bandhu Tirkey, the state's Human Resources Development Minister, without elaborating further. The school is run by the state's welfare department to give free education and food to children of ethnic tribespeople, among the poorest and least-developed communities in India.

Villagers gathered near the school on Friday to protest against the deaths. "We never imagined that free education and free food would cause the death of my son," the father of one of the children said
