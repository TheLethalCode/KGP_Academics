 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) - Jamaat-e-Islami and student front Islami Chhatra Shibir, protesting the recent arrests of Jamaat leaders, clashed with police at Baitul Mokarram mosque Tuesday, leaving at least 15 people including policemen injured. Jamaat and Shibir supporters gathered near the north gate of the mosque after Asr prayers, chanting anti-government slogans and demanding the release of chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, police said. "At one stage, the protestors took to the streets. When police asked them to leave the road and make room for traffic, they heckle the law enforcers," Motijheel additional deputy commissioner of police Nahidul Islam told bdnews24.com. A group from inside the mosque pelted brickbats at the police. As tension mounted, police clubbed to disperse the agitators, said Islam. The clashes continued for about 25 minutes during which some 15 people were injured, among them AKM Nahidul Islam. Traffic movement in the area came to a halt, said Islam. "Police eventually brought the situation under control with the help of some Jamaat leaders," he added. Meanwhile, Sylhet too saw further protests on Tuesday by Jamaat, Shibir and BNP's student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal in the form of processions and rallies to protest the arrests of Nizami, Mojaheed and former BNP minister M Saifur Rahman. A special court Monday ordered the three to jail after their surrender to a special court in the Barapukuria coalmine case. Jamaat turned out in countrywide protests Monday after the arrests, while the four-party alliance announced country-wide protest programme. bdnews24.c
