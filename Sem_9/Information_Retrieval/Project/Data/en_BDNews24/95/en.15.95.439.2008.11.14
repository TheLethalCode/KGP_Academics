 MADRID, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luis Fabiano scored a hat-trick to help Sevilla through to the last 16 of the King's Cup with a 4-1 aggregate win over third-tier Ponferradina on Thursday. Primera Liga strugglers Osasuna also progressed, beating 2007 and 2008 losing finalists Getafe 1-0 in Pamplona thanks to a first-half goal from Walter Pandiani. Sevilla were trailing 1-0 from their away leg two weeks ago and it took the 2007 winners half an hour to breach the Ponferradina defences. Luis Fabiano rose unchallenged in the area and directed a powerful header into the net from Ivory Coast midfielder Ndri Romaric's cross. The Brazilian striker netted again with a classy chip just after halftime and grabbed a third mid-way through the second period with a smart turn and finish inside the area. Enzo Maresca scored the fourth just before the end. The final scoreline was harsh on Ponferradina, who had what looked to be a legitimate goal ruled out just before Luis Fabiano's third that could have taken them through. In Pamplona, Osasuna striker Pandiani made the most of a goalkeeping blunder to give the home side the lead just after the half hour. Jose Antonio Camacho's side are bottom of the league, having scored only three goals in 10 matches, and it took a mistake by Jacobo to help them find the net and record their first win of the season. Pandiani intercepted the Getafe keeper's weak pass out of defence, evaded Jacobo's desperate lunge and scrambled the ball into the empty net. Getafe had Manu del Moral sent off in injury time and Osasuna held on for a 1-0 aggregate win after the first leg in Madrid two weeks ago ended goalless. Segunda B (third tier) sides claimed two big scalps in Cup matches earlier this week. League champions Real Madrid were knocked out on the away goals rule by Real Union on Tuesday after they drew 6-6 on aggregate. Villarreal, second and unbeaten in the Primera Liga, followed Real out on Wednesday, losing 6-1 on aggregate to Poli Ejido
