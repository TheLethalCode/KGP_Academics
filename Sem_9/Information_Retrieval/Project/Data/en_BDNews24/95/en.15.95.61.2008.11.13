 KABUL, Thu Nov 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car-bomber attacked a convoy of US-led troops in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday killing 11 people, including a US soldier, and wounding 58, the US military said. Earlier, a US military spokesman said 20 people had been killed in the attack on the outskirts of the eastern city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan. Afghanistan is facing its worst spell of violence this year, the bloodiest since the Taliban's overthrow in 2001, raising fears about the success of international efforts to bring peace and to develop the country. Interior Ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary said the bomber rammed his vehicle laden with explosives into the convoy as it went through a crowded market just outside Jalalabad. Ten of those killed in the suicide bombing were civilians as were the 58 wounded. "The enemies of Afghanistan committed another barbaric act today," Bashary said, referring to Taliban insurgents and their al Qaeda allies. Afghanistan's NATO-led force said two of its soldiers were killed in a blast in the south of the country on Wednesday. It gave no more details. Also on Wednesday, suicide bombers struck in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar killing more than 10 people. The Taliban's spokesman could not be contacted for comment.
