 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday issued contempt of court rule against leading daily Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, publisher Mahfuz Anam and correspondent Mizanur Rahman Khan. They have been asked to appear before the High Court in person on Nov. 18 and reply why they would not be charged with contempt of court. The bench of Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Kamrul Islam Siddiqui gave the order on a petition filed by barrister Munshi Ahsan Karim on Nov. 10. Prothom Alo on Nov. 9 published a report titled "Order in 298 cases in 315 minutes." The report said the bench led by Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader granted bail to the persons accused in murder case despite submission of charge sheet. The attorney general was surprised by the orders and senior lawyer Dr Kamal Hossain wanted investigation by the Supreme Judicial Council. It also said on Aug. 28,2008 orders were given in 434 cases by six benches  21 by bench no. 11, 60 by bench no. 12, 19 by bench no. 15, 17 by bench no.18 , and 298 cases by Justice Chaklader's bench no. 22. It also said the bench led by Chaklader had taken on average 63 seconds in one case to pass orders. At the beginning of the hearing the court asked Munshi Ahsan Karim, "Why have you not brought a senior lawyer?" Barrister Ahsan Karim said to the court, "I requested three senior lawyers to participate in the hearing. (But) None of them dared to conduct a case against Prothom Alo." The court said, "A senior lawyer has said the Supreme Court should be destroyed by a tsunami. Where were you then?" "If there is no Supreme Court, you, I and that lawyer, none of us will exist," one of the judges said. At that stage, Karim said the bench of Justice Chaklader gave such orders in a break with the Supreme Court tradition. The media did not have jurisdiction to publish such report and the mention of Justice Chaklader in the report bordered on audacity, he contended. The court said all High Court bench has the authority to hear contempt of court petition. "Why did you not go to the bench on which the report was written?" Karim said the Prothom Alo report was an attack on all justices, "about two lakh people" who read the Prothom Alo would have a wrong impression about the court. bdne
