 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Oddvar Hesjedal has been appointed new chief executive officer of Grameenphone. Hesjedal (58) takes up the position immediately, succeeding Anders Jensen, who announced in September his decision to shorten his tenure as CEO for family related reasons, the country's largest mobile operator said in a statement Monday. "The board of directors is very pleased to appoint Oddvar Hesjedal as Grameenphone's new CEO. His extensive experience within the mobile industry will be a great benefit to the company. Furthermore, his knowledge of both the organisation and Bangladesh is an advantage," said Sigve Brekke, chairman of Grameenphone's board and CEO of Telenor Asia. Hesjedal has served as GP's chief technology officer since June this year. Prior to joining the company, he held various top management positions within the Telenor Group. Before joining Norwegian telecoms giant Telenor, the majority owner of GP, he was CEO of software and consultancy companies in Norway and Sweden. "I am honored to be given the task to lead the premier mobile operator in Bangladesh," said Hesjedal. "Grameenphone has played a decisive role in developing the communications sector in the country and will continue to do so in the future." "I have deep respect for the achievements made by Anders during his time as the CEO and look forward to continue in the direction he has set forth for the company," said the new CEO. "It has been a great pleasure to have been a part of the development and continued success of Grameenphone. The company has a great team, and I congratulate Oddvar on his appointment and wish him and Grameenphone the best of luck for the future," said Anders Jensen. "Anders Jensen has done a great job over the last year, and he has headed the company in a professional and strong, yet empathetic and listening manner. Although it is sad that he is leaving the company, we fully respect his decision and wish him all the best in his future career," noted Brekke.
