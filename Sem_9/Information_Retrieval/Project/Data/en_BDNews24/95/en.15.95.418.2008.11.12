 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will meet the Myanmar prime minister on the sidelines of BIMSTEC summit in New Delhi to discuss the recent military tension over Yangon's oil and gas exploration in the disputed Bay waters, the foreign office says. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and his Myanmar counterpart U Nyan Win on Wednesday had a meeting on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC foreign ministers' conference preceding the summit, according to a press release. The two leaders agreed at the bilateral meeting that Fakhruddin and Prime Minister Thein Sein should have talks there. "The two leaders discussed a wide range of issues that include the recent incidents in the Bay of Bengal as well as potential of cooperation in political and economic fields," said a foreign ministry release on Iftekhar's meeting with U Nyan. "We need to follow up on the ground after the very useful discussions during vice senior general Maung Aye's recent visit to Bangladesh, " the statement quoted the foreign adviser as saying. "We agreed to continue with high level contacts including a meeting between the Myanmar prime minister and the chief adviser when they both arrive in New Delhi," the adviser was further quoted as saying. Fakhruddin reached New Delhi on Wedenesday by a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight which took off at 11:00am from Dhaka. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka are the members of the grouping, Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), floated on June 6, 1997. Bangladesh and its only southeastern neighbour built up naval and border forces inside their territories over tensions triggered by Yangon's bid to drill for oil and gas in the disputed waters of the Bay of Bengal. But the tension was defused as Daewoo, which got the exploration contract from Myanmar, suspended drilling in the face of Bangladesh's strong protest. bdnew
