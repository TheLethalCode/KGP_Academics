 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission will suspend its activities in the wake of a challenge against the commission's legality in the High Court, said its chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan on Saturday. The chairman and its two members will not attend office until the Supreme Court's final ruling, he said. The TAC chairman told bdnews24.com: "As the High Court has issued a rule regarding the commission, its functions will be suspended until a final verdict by the Appellate Division." "The commission has made a good progress within a short time but its future is now dependant on the Supreme Court's decision." The HC bench of justices Mir Hashmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain on Thursday declared the Voluntary Disclosure Ordinance 2008 that begot the Truth and Accountability Commission illegal and unconstitutional. After the verdict, attorney General Salahuddin Ahmed said: "The government will appeal against the High Court order." The HC gave its ruling on a writ petition filed on Aug. 25 by Supreme Court lawyer Adilur Rahman Khan, UBINIG executive director Farida Aktar, Awami League's women affairs secretary Dipu Moni and Odhikar acting director Nasiruddin Elan. On Aug. 28, the High Court had asked the government to explain why the ordinance should not be declared unconstitutional and illegal. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed the ordinance on June 8. According to the most recent figures, 389 people have applied to the TAC for clemency to date. Of the 389, 20 sought clemency personally, 192 through the Anticorruption Commission, 167 through the National Coordination Committee on prevention of serious crimes and the remaining 10 through court. Hearing on 259 mercy-seekers had concluded, 105 applicants have been awarded clemency. Some Tk 14.46 crore had been deposited to the government treasury against a total of Tk 26.17 crore expected. The commission extended the latest deadline for mercy petitions to Nov. 15. bdnew
