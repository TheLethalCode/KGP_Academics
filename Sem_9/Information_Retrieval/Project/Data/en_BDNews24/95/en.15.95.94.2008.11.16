<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  BRAC's BDmail Network has declined a licence to operate Wimax in Bangladesh. "BRAC BDmail will not pay for the licence. They informed us in a letter," BTRC chairman Monzurul Alam told bdnews24.com Saturday. The company sent the letter to Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission last week. "As per our guidelines, we will invite the company who gave the next highest bid in auction. We will make a final decision on Sunday," said the BTRC chief. The telecoms regulator had already extended the deadline for payment of the licence fee from Oct. 16 to Nov. 15, on request by BDMail and another licence winner BanglaLion Communications. The winning companies must pay Tk 215 crore for each licence, 50 percent by the deadline and the rest in the next 90 days. Aguree Wireless was the third licence winner in an open auction in September. Vitel Bangla came fourth among the bidders. Abdus Salam, consortium member of Vitel Bangla, told benews24.com: "If BTRC invites us, we will pay for the licence." Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited will also apply for the remaining licence, said a BTCL official. According to the licence guidelines, WiMax operators will initially have to install 90 base stations and expand their network within three years. More than 60 percent foreign investment will not be allowed, though non-resident Bangladeshis may invest 70 percent. bdnews
