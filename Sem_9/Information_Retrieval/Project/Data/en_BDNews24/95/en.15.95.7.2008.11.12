 KABUL, Wed Nov 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Attacks on military supplies coming to Afghanistan are just one tactic of the widening Taliban insurgency, but one that forces Western nations to deal with the geopolitical reality of fighting a war in a landlocked nation. The Taliban declared they would increase attacks on troop supply lines this year, repeating a strategy the mujahideen used against Soviet forces in the 1980s and even against the British in Kabul in the 1840s. So far they have lived up to their word. The US military sends 75 percent of supplies for the Afghan war through or over Pakistan, including 40 percent of the fuel for its troops, the Defense Department said. "You essentially have to face the fact that bulk cargo moves to Pakistani ports by sea and bulk cargo moves best by road," said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "If you have to do this through air lift, it puts a tremendous strain on U.S. Air Force and US air mobility assets to move very ordinary equipment and goods," he said. There are only two major routes into Afghanistan from the main Pakistani port of Karachi, one via the Khyber Pass to the north and the other through the town of Chaman to the southwest linking to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. Both routes have come under attack with dozens of fuel trucks torched this year and four U.S. helicopter engines worth more than $13 million stolen in September. This week 13 lorries carrying two Humvees and tonnes of food were stolen. DEALS The vulnerability of the Pakistan route was further brought home to NATO when the Islamabad government itself cut off fuel supplies to Western forces in Afghanistan for several days in September in response to a raid by U.S. forces into Pakistan. That has meant NATO has had try to make deals with Afghanistan's other neighbours in order to secure supply routes. With Iran out of the question, that leaves Russia, a country fiercely opposed to NATO plans to allow Georgia to join the alliance and U.S. plans for a missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. NATO and Russia signed a land transit agreement in April allowing the alliance to use Russian land to deliver non-lethal supplies to troops in Afghanistan, but talks are still ongoing with Kabul's immediate neighbours Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for the goods to reach the Afghan border. The alliance is still negotiating an air transit agreement with Moscow. While Moscow has publicly stated it would not make a political issue of the transit agreements, the Russian ambassador to Kabul said in September his government could close its airspace to NATO if it did not stop its "hostile" policies. NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the US coalition in Afghanistan are reluctant to quantify either the number of attacks on supplies or the scale of their losses, but say they have yet to feel any impact on their operations. "Every morning we have the reports with a green colour code on resupply. Even though we are losing some, we are ensuring we have enough for our operation. That's basic military prudence," said ISAF spokesman Brigadier General Richard Blanchette. "Even if one supply route was blocked totally, which we don't foresee, there are always alternatives, land and air alternatives," said NATO spokesman James Appathurai. "They might be more costly, they might be more complicated, but there are enough ways to get our supplies into Afghanistan that there is no strategic concern about this issue. It can be more painful but it can still be done.
