<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, who have barely spoken to each other for the past 17 years, are ready to sit and talk political issues, their parties said on Wednesday. Khaleda was ready to sit with Hasina 'for the sake of the nation', BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters at her political office in Gulshan in the evening. Hours earlier, Awami League's spokesperson said Hasina was ready to sit with her BNP counterpart for issue-based discussion. "Our president is ready for discussion. But that must have an agenda," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after Hasina met with three envoys at her Sudha Sadan home. The announcements came amid efforts by diplomats, business leaders and the government to seat the two together, who have alternated as prime minister for the past 15 years until 2006. "Talks with the Awami League chief... on the issues of welfare of the country and the people are possible," the BNP joint secretary general quoted Khaleda as saying. "A broad spectrum of issues including the country's economy, political situation, the election and post-election government are likely agenda for the prospective meeting," Khan said. "Any initiative from Sheikh Hasina for talks will be cordially welcomed." Asked if Khaleda would accept any such initiative from the government, Khan said, "That wouldn't perhaps be necessary but the BNP chief has no problem with that too." Proposals or initiatives from any quarters would be accepted, he added. Earlier in the morning, the Awami League president held a meeting for one and a half hours with ambassadors of Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. After the meeting Swedish envoy told reporters they hoped that an acceptable election would be held on the declared day with the participation of all parties. They stressed the two leaders should sit for discussions to resolve thorny issues. Ashraful said: "The December 18 election must be held. It is necessary for a good future of the country." "The country's future is depending on the elections now," he said. "We have told the government a free and fair election should take place with the participation of all parties. People will not accept it if the date is deferred." Khaleda was released on bail on Sept. 11 after a year in detention on corruption charges. Hasina spent a year in jail on similar charges before being given medical parole in June to seek treatment in United States. She returned home on Nov. 6. The military-installed government -- which has run the country since Jan. 11, last year when, after debilitating political protests, scheduled elections were scrapped and emergency law was imposed -- is desperately trying to make them sit across the table ahead of the Dec. 18 general election. bdnews24.co
