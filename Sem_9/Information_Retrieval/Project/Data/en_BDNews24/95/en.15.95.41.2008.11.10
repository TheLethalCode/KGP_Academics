 SYDNEY, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia have recalled Harry Kewell, Vince Grella and Mark Bresciano for next week's World Cup qualifier against Bahrain. The three players missed Australia's 4-0 win over Qatar last month but have been included in a 24-man squad for the Nov. 19 match in Manama. Australia coach Pim Verbeek said he was confident Kewell and Bresciano would play but had doubts about Grella after the midfielder injured a hamstring playing for Blackburn at the weekend. "It doesn't look good. I've put him on the list because that's the way it works with FIFAif I take him off he can't play," Verbeek told reporters on Monday. "But that's one of the players we have big doubts if he's to be available for next week." The possible unavailability of Grella was balanced by the return of midfielder Carl Valeri from suspension and the call up of goalkeeper Adam Federici. Defender Craig Moore was the only player from the Australian A-League to be selected in the squad. Australia currently lead Group A with six points, two ahead of Qatar and Japan. Bahrain and Uzbekistan have one point each. Australia: Mark Bresciano, Jacob Burns, Tim Cahill, David Carney, Chris Coyne, Jason Culina, Bruce Djite, Brett Emerton, Adam Federici, Richard Garcia, Vince Grella, Brett Holman, Josh Kennedy, Harry Kewell, Scott McDonald, Craig Moore, Lucas Neill, Michael Petkovic, Mark Schwarzer, Matthew Spiranovic, Shane Stefanutto, Mile Sterjovski, Carl Valeri, Luke Wilkshire
