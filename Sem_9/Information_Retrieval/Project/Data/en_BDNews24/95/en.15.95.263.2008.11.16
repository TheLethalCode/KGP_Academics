 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Myanmar began maritime border talks Sunday at the foreign ministry in Dhaka. Foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain said the two-day technical-level committee talks kicked off at 10am at the ministry office. Myanmar deputy minister Maung Myit heads an 11-member delegation while additional foreign secretary MAK Mahmud is leading the Bangladesh delegates in the talks. On the agenda, the foreign secretary told bdnews24.com, "The deliberations are a follow-up of the talks already initiated by the two countries to resolve the confusions prevailing over their sea boundaries." The two nations met earlier this year in April to discuss maritime demarcation after a hiatus of 22 years. According to an agreement, both countries have committed to forego oil and gas exploration in disputed waters until the boundaries are drawn through negotiations in line with United Nations conventions. But tension flared between Bangladesh and its southwest neighbour earlier this month as Yangon began oil and gas exploration activities in the Bay of Bengal, some 60 nautical miles south of Saint Martin's Island, an area claimed by both countries. The dispute was resolved diplomatically after Dhaka sent letters of protest to Yangon and South Korean industrial giant Daewoo requesting them withdraw their installations in the Bay. bdnews24.c
