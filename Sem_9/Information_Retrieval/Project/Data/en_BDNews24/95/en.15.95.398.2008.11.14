<TITLE> Indian state votes amid violence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 India, Nov. 14 (BBC online) The beginning of a crucial round of state elections in India has been marred by outbreaks of violence. Maoist rebels have snatched voting machines, kidnapped polling officials and set off a landmine in the central state of Chattisgarh, police say. The police say that they have had gun battles with rebels in at least six places in the state. The election is the first in a series of votes that may determine whether the government calls an early general poll. A general election must be held by May but could be called earlier. Voting in six mostly central and western states will take place over six weeks, amid signs of economic slowdown. Alliances Chattisgarh is one of at least 13 states in India where Maoist rebels are active. In the first stage of voting in Chattisgarh, voters are casting their ballots in 39 of 90 constituencies. In the Konta and Narayanpur areas in the state's Bastar region where the rebels have a strong presence, Maoists stopped polling officials travelling to the polling stations and stole electronic voting machines, the police said. Rebels have abducted polling officials in the Katekalyan area, the police added. There are reports of a landmine blast, set off by the rebels, in Konta area. No casualties have been reported yet. Correspondents say that key issues in the election include rising prices and security following a spate of bomb attacks blamed mostly on Islamist militants. Apart from Chattisgarh, the states that will go to the polls are Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Mizoram in the north-east and the western desert state of Rajasthan. For security reasons the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir will vote in seven phases over nearly as many weeks. If the governing Congress party does well, it may want to build on the results and call an early poll in February. ELECTION TIMETABLE 14 and 20 November: Chattisgarh 27 November: Madhya Pradesh 17 November to 24 December: Jammu and Kashmir 29 November: Delhi 2 December: Mizoram 4 December: Rajasthan However, a poor performance might prompt the government to delay the vote until May, the end of its five-year parliamentary term. Whichever party, Congress or the main opposition BJP, does better may find it easier to secure alliances with regional parties before the general election - of the utmost importance when building a post-election governing coalition. The BJP faces a tough challenge from Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan because incumbent administrations in Indian states often do badly in elections. Observers will also be closely watching the outcome of the vote in Indian-administered Kashmir, which during the summer was the scene of large anti-India protests. Many Indian cities, including Bangalore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and the capital, Delhi, have been hit by bomb blasts recently, with large losses of life. The BJP has been campaigning for a tougher anti-terror law in response to the bombings. Counting of votes will take place on 8 December, apart from in Indian-administered Kashmir where votes will be tallied on 28 December
