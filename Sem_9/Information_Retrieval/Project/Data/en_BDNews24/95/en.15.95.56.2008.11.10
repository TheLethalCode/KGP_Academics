 TOKYO, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman Japan says was kidnapped and taken to North Korea by Pyongyang agents in 1977 is alive, her brother said Monday, after new information about her came to light. Japan says Kyoko Matsumoto, who disappeared in western Japan on her way to a knitting class, was snatched by North Korea, but Pyongyang has said there was no evidence that she had ever entered the country. Tokyo has refused to normalize ties with Pyongyang or provide energy aid as part of a multilateral deal aimed at ending the North's nuclear programs until the feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s is resolved. "I think it is certain that she is alive," Hajime Matsumoto, older brother of Kyoko, told Reuters on the phone. "A day may come when we can rescue her. I just hope she can stay healthy." Pyongyang said in 2002 that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese to help train North Korean spies. Five returned to Japan that year, and Tokyo wants information about eight more who North Korea says are dead, as well as four others including Kyoko whom Japan suspects were also abducted. Kyodo news agency said a senior North Korean official was offering to set up a meeting between Kyoko, who would be 60 years old, and her family, with a Chinese man liaising with the family. Hajime said he met the man in Tokyo last month but could not reveal what was discussed out of fear publicity would lead to misunderstandings. A Japanese civic group dealing with possible abduction cases received information last month that a woman thought to be Kyoko had passed on a message asking about a former colleague. Asked if the information was true, Hajime said: "I think there is no doubt." Japan's top government spokesman, Takeo Kawamura, said he had heard about the new information from Hajime and the civic group. "We will continue to work with relevant ministries and gather and analyze information on this," he told a news conference. Japan's government faces considerable pressure over the issue at home, where North Korea's abductions still stoke anger. Its refusal to provide aid to North Korea until the abductions are resolved is at odds with other countries involved in talks on North Korea's nuclear ambitions. South Korea wants Tokyo to join with it, China, Russia and the United States in providing energy aid to North Korea when the communist state disables its nuclear facility at Yongbyon and declares its nuclear programs. The United States, which last month upset Japan by removing North Korea from its terrorism blacklist, has said other countries may offer the promised energy aid
