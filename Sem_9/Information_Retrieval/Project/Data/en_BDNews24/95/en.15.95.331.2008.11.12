 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth Commission will recommend that its working procedure, broken in time segments, is used as a model by other institutes for short, middle and long-term planning. "The Commission has completed 80 percent of its work as it draws out a plan before starting work," said member Asif Ali on Wednesday. He added that the work, after being planned out, is divided in weekly, monthly, quarterly and six monthly portions. "This way, the commission will complete all its work in the stipulated time." The chairman of the commission, Justice Habibur Rahman Khan also said by following the strategy, corruption in any organisation can be minimised. He also said that the Truth Commission, which has unmasked institutional corruption, will submit a report to the government at the end of its tenure. "There will be directives in the report about corrupt institutions on which the commission has worked." Manjur Rashid, another member of the mercy commission, said they came across substantial evidence of graft in Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited, formerly BTTB. "We also have proof that there were gross anomalies in the board formed within BTTB to investigate internal corruption," he observed. "The matter of internal irregularity will be referred to the Anticorruption Commission for a full investigation, dismissing calls for clemency." The mercy commission has received 389 applications; hearing on 259 cases has been completed and 105 have been pardoned, officials said. Around Tk 14 crore have been deposited to the state coffers. Under the Voluntary Information Disclosure Act, issued on June 8, anyone apart from those sentenced to two or more years in prison due to corruption can seek pardon by returning money earned through questionable means. bdne
