 KABUL, Tue Nov 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 100 convicted murderers, rapists and kidnappers are on death row in Afghanistan awaiting President Hamid Karzai to sign the orders for their execution, a a senior judge said on Tuesday.

"We have 125 people who have been sentenced by various courts to the death penalty and are to be executed after Karzai's approval," said a senior Supreme Court judge who declined to be named.
