 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League wants the planned meeting between party chief Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia broadcast live, a spokesman said on Thursday. "We don't want a closed-door meeting. The meeting should be broadcast live," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters at Hasina's Sudha Sadan home. "The nation ought to watch what the two leaders are discussing in the meeting," he said. The two former prime ministers, who have barely spoken to each other for the past 17 years, are ready to sit and talk political issues, their parties said on Wednesday. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Thursday that the government was ready to act as a catalyst in making the prospective meeting between the two top leaders happen. "We want to sit with a specific agenda. We are waiting for proposals," Ashraful said. "Continuing the antigraft drive, keeping the constitutional organisations beyond politics and pledging not to call strike if [BNP or AL] sits in the opposition might be the issues that can be be discussed." He asserted again that the general elections slated for Dec. 18 must be held. "If the election does not take place the nation will face an uncertain future." The government attempted to get the two leaders sit together a few months ago. The government would take the initiative to get the two top leaders meet and talk on political issues, adviser Hossain Zillur told reporters on Sept. 11 after Khaleda was released on bail from prison. "We hope they will not only respond to this move but also take initiatives on their own since the two leaders have contributed a lot to the country," he said. To make the move successful, the government sought help from Rafique-ul-Huq, the lawyer who represents both in court. He had contacted Hasina and said she had responded positively to the suggestion. Likewise, the commerce adviser had also said after meeting the BNP chief that her attitude towards a possible meeting had been positive. Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters on Wednesday: "Our president is ready for discussion. But that must have an agenda." Hours later, BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters: "Khaleda is ready to sit with Hasina 'for the sake of the nation'." bdnew
