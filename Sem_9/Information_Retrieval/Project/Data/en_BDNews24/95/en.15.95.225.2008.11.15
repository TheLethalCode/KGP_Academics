<TITLE> Iran wants OPEC to cut output </TITLE>

 TEHRAN, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran wants OPEC to cut oil output by a further 1 to 1.5 million barrels per day when it meets in Cairo later this month, the Islamic Republic's representative to the cartel was quoted on Saturday as saying. OPEC countries are calling for action to halt oil's slide as they face reduced revenues and a struggle to finance domestic projects. Oil prices have tumbled more than 60 percent from a record level of $147 per barrel in July. The website of state broadcaster IRIB said Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, would propose that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries lower its production at a meeting scheduled for November 29 in the Egyptian capital. Iran's OPEC governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi said the market remained oversupplied, despite a move by OPEC to reduce output by 1.5 million bpd last month. "It is better that, at the meeting in Cairo, it (OPEC) decides to cut output by another 1 to 1.5 million barrels so that there is ... balance between production and demand," IRIB's website quoted Khatibi as saying. "Of course this proposal is appropriate ... if the global economic crisis does not worsen and OPEC members stick to their commitments to cut quotas," he told IRIB. OPEC members agreed in October to reduce supplies by 1.5 million barrels per day, or about 5 percent, from November 1 but that measure has failed to stop oil prices declining. Iran, seen as a price hawk, has previously said OPEC could take action if oil prices fell more and an Iranian oil official said on Thursday that its members would meet in Cairo for "consultation" on the oil market. On Friday, U.S. crude fell $1.20 to $57.04. "The falling trend of oil prices and the rise in the (oil) storage of big industrial countries shows that there is oversupply," Khatibi said. Asked whether he believed all OPEC members would be able to implement commitments to reduce output, Khatibi said: "Because of the rise of global crude prices in the last 2 to 3 years, OPEC member countries have good money reserves and they can cut their production for a while." "OPEC member countries should know that for managing the global market they should be firm on their commitments, otherwise prices would fall further," Khatibi said.
