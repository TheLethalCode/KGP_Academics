 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has expressed qualms about the forthcoming polls, says her aide. "Our leader said intrigues have been on to frustrate the Dec 18 election," said Mahbubul Hoque Shakil, Hasina's deputy press secretary. The former prime minister shared her fears about the elections at a Jubo League meeting on Tuesday, he told reporters. "But [Hasina] told party workers to be patient in this situation," Shakil said. A Jubo League delegation, headed by chairman Jahangir Kabir Nanak and general secretary Mirza Azam, met the AL president to mark the organisation's 36th founding anniversary. Hasina lauded Jubo League for their continued support vigilance and hard work, overcoming all obstacles, the press aide said. "She said unemployed youth will be provided for once AL comes to power after winning the elections." "We hope the youth will come forward and lend a hand to uplift the country's image," Shakil said, quoting Hasina. bdnews24.c
