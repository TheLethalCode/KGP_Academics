<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has accused the government of interfering in court affairs in the name of emergency power rules. The four-party alliance would go to the polls if the emergency went, secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain said on Wednesday. "The government is interfering in court affairs, which is unwanted," he said at an alliance meeting in the evening. "Human rights are violated every day under the emergency power rules. We therefore demand lifting of the state of emergency under which the alliance will not take part in the elections." The four-party organised the meeting at the Diploma Engineers' Institution at Kakrail in the city to demand immediate release of BNP leader M Saifur Rahman, Jamaat-e-islami hief Matiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed who had been arrested in Barapukuria coalmine graft case. The BNP secretary general criticised the government for their apparent "blueprint" to hold a mock election. "None of our demands has been met and a level playing field for parties is not on sight," he said and added that "a party" was being favoured. "The ground is prepared for only one party, how can the other parties play?" Delwar questioned. He criticised the government for swooping on the meeting of Jamaat and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir. Jamaat's acting secretary general Momammed Kamaruzzaman demanded actions against the policemen responsible for "the attack". BNP leaders Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, MK Anwar, Selima Rahman and Kharul Kabir Khokan and Jamaat assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Molla, Khelafat Majlish chairman Mohammad Ishaque and several others also spoke. bdne
