<TITLE> BNP fears polls after its own misdeeds: AL's Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury says BNP is apprehensive of participating in the national elections as the party lost support through its own misdeeds in past terms. "BNP fears election because of its loss of popularity due to corruption and misrule," said the AL leader on Monday. "It is trying to play for time to remove the dirt from its own body. But the people will resist this," said Motia at a gathering of Jubo League to mark Shaheed Nur Hossain Day. Presiding over the function was Jubo League chairman Jahangir Kabir Nanak, the first time he came to surface after remaining in hiding for 19 months. Nanak faces five separate cases for illegal wealth, seige of the Secretariat in 2006, ransacking during hartal, burning vehicles and an attack on Sheikh Hasina's motorcade in 2004. The High Court on Sunday ordered no arrest or harassment of the Jubo League chief, but ordered him to surrender in the cases within 10 weeks. bdnews
