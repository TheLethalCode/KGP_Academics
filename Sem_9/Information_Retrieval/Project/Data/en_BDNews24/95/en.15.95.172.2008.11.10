 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - River Plate fought back from three goals down to draw 3-3 at home to Huracan in Diego Simeone's final match as coach on Sunday. At the other end of the Argentine Apertura table, Boca Juniors stayed level on points with leaders San Lorenzo after a stunning injury-time free kick by Juan Roman Riquelme gave them a 1-0 win at Arsenal. Simeone left defending champions River Plate with the team bottom of the table and having extended their winless domestic run to 12 games. But the former Argentina captain, who announced his resignation on Friday after River were knocked out of the Copa Sudamericana by Mexico's Guadalajara, was applauded into the tunnel after his side's rousing fight back. Simeone looked set to regret as his decision to take charge of the team on Sunday as two goals from Hernan Barcos and one from Hugo Barrientes put Huracan 3-0 ahead after only 35 minutes at a stunned Monumental stadium. Matias Abelairas began the fight back with a free kick six minutes after the re-start, Radamel Falcao Garcia scored from a controversial penalty and Eduardo Tuzzio headed the equaliser in the 77th minute. It was River's seventh draw in 14 games as they stayed bottom with 10 points, one behind Rosario Central. San Lorenzo, who have 29 points, stayed top on goal difference from Boca after struggling to a 2-1 win over Gimnasia-Jujuy. Paraguayan Aureliano Torres fired San Lorenzo ahead at the start of the second but Pablo Calandria levelled in the 73rd minute. Gonzalo Bergessio snatched the winner with six minutes left when he touched home Santiago Solari's cross. Boca, also struggling on a hot afternoon, stole the points at Arsenal when playmaker Riquelme floated a 25-metre free kick over the wall and into the top corner. Surprise package Tigre dropped two points behind the leading pair after drawing 2-2 at Colon on Saturday
