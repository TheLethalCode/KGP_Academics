 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) - Loan and bill defaulters wishing to contest in upcoming elections are getting until Thursday to pay their dues to qualify for candidacy, the Election Commission said Monday. "According to electoral law, candidacy can be ensured by payment of default loans and bills one week before the final date of submission of nominations," EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir told reporters. According to the new election schedule, the last date for submissions is Nov 20. An amendment to the Representation of the People Ordinance, approved by the cabinet Sunday, gives aspiring candidates for parliamentary and upazila polls up to Nov 13, or seven days before the last date of filing nominations, to pay arrears. This is the third amendment to the RPO this year relating to eligibility of loan and bill defaulters for elections. The first, on Aug 19, said loan defaulters must pay arrears six months ahead of submissions. Bill (gas, power, water and telephone) defaulters had to settle their dues three months ahead. In the next amendment, the deadline was drastically reduced to just 15 days before filing of nomination papers. On Sunday, the cabinet division brought the third change, reducing the deadline again to 7 days before the last day of submission. "Prospective candidates have been unable to settle the loan and bills due to lack of sufficient time," the EC secretary said. He stressed that the change in the RPO was not made under duress from political parties, but after considering the reality of the situation influencing candidacy. "As the deadline for submission of nomination papers has been extended, the registration of parties will also continue through this week," said Humayun Kabir. "The registration of 32 parties has been finalised," said the head of the registration scrutiny committee, EC joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan. Four parties have not invited any objection after the issuance of public notices of their registration; these are: Oikyaboddho Nagorik Andolon, Islamic Front Bangladesh, Bangladesh Jatiya Party and Kalyan Party. Public notices have also been issued on registration of six other parties: Progressive Democratic Party, Gano Forum, Bangladesh National People's Party, Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Islam Bangladesh, Muslim League and Gano Front. bdnews24.
