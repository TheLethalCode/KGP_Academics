 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed returned home on Friday after attending the BIMSTEC summit in New Delhi. Fakhruddin left for the Indian capital on Wednesday to attend the second summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). The top leaders from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand and Sri Lanka at the summit agreed to set up a SAARC-style regional food bank to face food deficit in any of the member countries. They identified terrorism as a threat to peace, stability and economic progress in the BIMSTEC region and stressed on the need for guaranteeing strong cooperation to combat all forms of terrorism and transnational crimes. The heads of state or government of the grouping recognised the adverse impact of climate change on the lives and livelihoods of people in the area. During his three-day stay, the chief adviser discussed bilateral issues in separate meetings on the sidelines of the summit with Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh and Myanmar prime minister Thein Sein. Fakhruddin and General Thein talked about the recent Bangladesh-Myanmar military face-off in the Bay of Bengal over Yangon's exploration of oil and gas in the disputed waters. The two leaders, according to the foreign ministry, agreed to boost bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Myanmar, a reclusive country run by military since 1962. Manmohan assured Fakhruddin of narrowing the huge trade deficit in favour of India. bd
