 FRANKFURT, Tue Nov 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rwandan President Paul Kagame criticized on Tuesday the arrest by German authorities of a senior Rwandan official, calling it a violation of sovereignty. Rose Kabuye, director general of state protocol in Rwanda, was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Sunday by German police who were acting on an international warrant issued by France in 2006 for her and eight other Kagame associates. She is accused of involvement in the 1994 shooting down of a plane that killed former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, leading to a campaign of genocidal killings in the central African nation, German prosecutors have said. Kabuye was in Frankfurt to prepare a visit by Kagame, who is touring European countries. Asked at a news conference whether the arrest could have an impact on cooperation between Rwanda and the European Union on resolving the crisis in Congo, Kagame said: "Certainly the arrest of Rose has some implications, foreseen or unforeseen, because in many ways it's a violation of the sovereignty of Rwanda." Kagame said the arrest would affect his country's relationship with France and Germany. "We will see how we can challenge such actions, which in my view are simply a question of being arrogant and people being a law unto themselves," he said after visiting Kabuye in prison. Kagame said he expected Germany to extradite her to France within days. Kabuye's lawyer has said she is willing to go before a French judge. Ties between France and Rwanda have been badly strained since the warrants were issued and on Monday hundreds of people, including Kabuye's husband, protested outside the German Embassy in Kigali, chanting "Free Rose, Free Rose." The German government has said it was obliged to act on the arrest warrant. Habyarimana's plane was hit by a missile in 1994 and his death ignited mass killings of Tutsis and some moderate Hutus. Kagame was then leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front which defeated the government's Hutu militias to end the genocide. In April, Kagame made a four-day state visit to Germany. According to media reports, Kabuye was on that trip but German law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation. When she was arrested on Sunday, Kabuye was not with the president, German prosecutors say, and thus not protected by diplomatic immunity. "Rose's visit to Germany was not private. It was official in that she was doing the work of the Rwandan president," Kagame said
