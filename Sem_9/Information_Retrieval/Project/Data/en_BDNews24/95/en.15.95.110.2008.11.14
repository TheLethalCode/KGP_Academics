 DHAKA, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh spinner Abdur Razzak is likely to miss the first test against South Africa in Bloemfontein on Nov. 19 because of a trip to Australia this weekend to have his bowling analysed. Razzak, who travels to Canberra on Saturday, will be assessed on Nov. 17 and is scheduled to return to Johannesburg on Nov. 18. However he will not be able to fly on to Bloemfontein immediately. The left-arm spinner's bowling action was reported as suspect during the two-test series won 1-0 by New Zealand last month. Umpires Daryl Harper and Asoka de Silva reported that they had concerns over the 26-year-old spinner's faster ball. Razzak has taken seven wickets in five test matches and claimed 110 victims in 79 one-day internationals. Bangladesh said on Thursday they had retained their 15-man one-day squad for the test series against South Africa. South Africa won the three-match ODI series 2-0 with the third and final game abandoned at Buffalo Park, East London due to rain on Wednesday. Squad - Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafe Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain jnr, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain, Mahbubul Alam, Roqibul Hassan, Imrul Kayes
