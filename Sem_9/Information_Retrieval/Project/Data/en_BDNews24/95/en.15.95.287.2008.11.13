 Dhaka, Nov 13(bdnews24.com)  Former Dhaka City ward commissioner and film actor Monowar Hossain Dipjol has been jailed for 13 years in prison for acquiring illegal assets. Judge Mohammad Sirajul Islam of the Special Judge's Court-7, set up in the parliament complex, handed down the sentence. According to the sentence, Dipjol, a BNP leader who has been fleeing justice, is to pay Tk 10 lakh in fine or serve another year in jail. The court also ordered confiscation of assets valued at around Tk 1.75 lakh. Earlier, he had been handed down a 32-year jail term in a tax evasion case and two arms case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec. 13 last year against Dipjol and his wife. But the High Court had stayed proceedings of the case against his wife. Dipjol faces at least 12 cases on charges of murders and extortions. He had been given 24 years in two arms cases earlier this current year and another eight years in a tax-doge case. bdnews24.c
