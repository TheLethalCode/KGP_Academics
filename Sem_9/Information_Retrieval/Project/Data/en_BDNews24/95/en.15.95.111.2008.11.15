Barristers Najmul Huda and Moudud Ahmed, Mirza Abbas and Wadud Bhuiyan were issued show-cause letters on Friday for violations of prison rules. The four prisoners are faced with charges of taking in food from outside, meeting relatives on a regular basis, talking on mobile phones and having meetings with party workers and leaders.
