 NEW DELHI, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's inspired 2-0 test series win over Australia has given the cricket-crazy country reason to believe it can once again challenge for top spot in the world rankings. The hosts drove home their superiority against a subdued Australia, winning the second test by a record 320 runs and the final test in Nagpur by 172 runs on Monday. All four of Australia's test defeats since their 2005 Ashes loss have come against India, and former skipper Ravi Shastri believes there could be a shake-up in the rankings. "I'm tempted to say that the old world order is over," he wrote in his newspaper column on Tuesday. The win lifted India to second in the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings, just ahead of South Africa and behind the world champions "Australia will not be feared any longer. India on the other hand have the future on their hands," he added. "They seem poised to be the leaders of the world ... India is the team to fear in the world arena." India have a tremendous home record, having lost just two series, against South Africa in 2000 and Australia in 2004, since defeat to traditional rivals Pakistan in 1987. Anil Kumble, who retired after the drawn third test, was the lynchpin for home wins from the early 1990s, his subtle variations and accuracy proving vital on crumbling pitches. 'HOME TIGERS' The addition of off spinner Harbhajan Singh in 2001 provided India with even more firepower, but they have struggled to shake off the tag of "home tigers". Recently, however, India have depended less on rank turners, encouraging young fast bowlers and their formidable batsmen to tune up for overseas campaigns. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who stood in for the injured Kumble in Mohali and took over after the spinner retired, outwitted his Australian counterpart Ricky Ponting on slow pitches that were still good for batting. Young paceman Ishant Sharma grabbed 15 wickets in the series to be named Player of the Series, showing that there was life after Kumble, the third-highest test wickettaker with 619. Ishant and left-arm Zaheer Khan troubled Australia's batsmen with reverse-swing using the old ball. "Our fast bowlers did the trick for us in the series," Dhoni said. "They bowled their hearts out and were backed by the spinners and part-time bowlers." India have also been improving abroad over the last four years, drawing 1-1 in Australia and claiming a maiden series win in Pakistan in 2004. They won their first test series in West Indies for 35 years in 2006, claimed at a first test win in South Africa and won a series in England last year after a 21-year drought. During a 2-1 series defeat in Australia early this year, India also became the first touring side to win at Perth for 11 years. GOLDEN GENERATION If India are to take on the challenge of unseating Australia at the top of the rankings they will have to do it with a golden generation of players in the twilight of their careers. Kumble and former skipper Saurav Ganguly have retired while premier batsmen Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Vangipurappu Laxman are well into their 30s. However, a fresh crop of players holds promise. Young opening batsman Gautam Gambhir hit two centuries against Australia and although he was banned for the final test, replacement Murali Vijay impressed on his debut. India hope batsmen Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina, both yet to play tests, as well as experienced Yuvraj Singh can step up while reserve pacers Munaf Patel and R.P.Singh have already played tests. Ganguly felt India can only improve under Dhoni. "He has done fantastically well and I know he has the abilities to take Indian cricket forward.
