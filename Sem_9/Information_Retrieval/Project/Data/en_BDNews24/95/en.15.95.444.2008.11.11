 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The establishment ministry on Tuesday formally published a gazette in line with presidential approval, appointing 3044 successful candidates in 27th BCS test. The gazette was available at the website www.moestad.gov.bd since morning. After long-drawn disputes over exam results, appointment letters have been issued to more than 3000 successful candidates of the 27th BCS examinations, a government official told bdnews24.com. The letters were sent out in the afternoon, said Sheikh Mohammad Shamim Iqbal, a deputy secretary at the establishment ministry's appointment section. "The appointed persons will have to join their respective cadres or the Ministry of Establishment by November 30," he said. Iqbal added: "If anybody does not join, their appointments will be cancelled, it will be interpreted as their unwillingness to join the cadres." Allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism marred the transparency of the BCS exams. The Public Service Commission posted an advertisement on June 28, 2005 for the 27th BCS exams, seeking applications for 1,776 vacant posts. As many as 1,36,105 people applied and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The authorities recalled 16,418 for vivas. The PSC declared 3,567 candidates successful after the oral tests, asking authorities to appoint them. However, the interim cabinet cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams on May 30, 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and establish transparency in the wake of several news reports over irregularities. On Nov. 1, the candidates, qualified in the firstly published results, began a fast-until-death programme at the entral Shaheed Minar premises, which has been continuing . bdnew
