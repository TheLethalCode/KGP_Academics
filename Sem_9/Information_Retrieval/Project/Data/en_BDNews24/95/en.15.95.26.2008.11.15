 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Three scalps each from Shahadat Hossain and Mehrab Hossain Jr helped Bangladesh to restrict the South African Airways Challenge XI to 256 all out on the first day of the two-day warm-up match at De Beers Diamond Oval, in Kimberley on Saturday. Bangladesh were 92 for two at stumps with Imrul Kayes and Mohammad Ashraful remaining unbeaten on 30 and 24 respectively. Mothokozibi Shezi removed both Tamim Iqbal (38) and Junaed Siddique (nought). Shahadat rattled the top-order to pave the way for left-arm spinner Mehrab, who wrecked the middle order before pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin cleaned up the tail. After opting to bat first, the hosts' opener Divan Van Wyke and Andre Seymore faced no trouble to put on a solid 170 runs for the opening stand before Shahdat Hossain brought the first breakthrough in the second session. After the dismissal of opener Seymore, the hosts could manage another 95 runs at the cost of the remaining nine wickets as the Bangladeshi bowlers found their line and length. Shahadat broke the 170-run opening stand having Seymore caught by Imrul Kayes for 75 off 115 balls studded with 13 boundaries. The tall pacer then struck again in his very next over, this time removing Wyk for 87 off 141 balls that included 14 fours, after which Airways Challenge XI lost their wickets at regular intervals the last four wickets going for just 19 runs. Shahadat finally returned three for 33 while third-change bowler Mehrab conceded 43 runs to return three wickets. Robin chipped in with two for 61. Apart from Seymore and Wyk, Whayelihle (25), Charl Pietersen (15 not out), Warren Swan (13) and Wendell Bossenger (10) were notable scorers. Bangladesh will take on South Africa in the opener of the two Test series from Nov 19 in Bloomberg. bdn
