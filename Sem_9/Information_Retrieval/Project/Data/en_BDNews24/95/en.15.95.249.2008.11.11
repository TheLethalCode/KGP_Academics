 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, reported for a suspect bowling action at home last month, will travel to Canberra from South Africa for an independent analysis of his action. Razzak, now touring South Africa with the national team, will leave for Australia on Nov. 15 after the ongoing ODI series ends. He will return to South Africa on Nov. 18 to rejoin the squad. The 26-year-old was reported for a specific delivery by Daryl Harper and Asoka de Silva during the second and final Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand in Dhaka in October and hence requested the ICC to review. Razzak would be assessed by Marc Portusa, a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) panel of human movement specialists at the Australian Institute of Sports on Nov. 17, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release on Tuesday. This is the second time Razzak has been reported in his career. He was reported during his second one-day international against Pakistan in Asia Cup in Colombo in July 2004. The Bangladesh team management earlier had thought of sending Razzak to a South African human movement specialist during the lone three-day warm-up in Kimberly, ahead of two Tests series against the hosts. But, the management was forced to send Razzak to Australia as the Cape Town-based South African specialist is now outside the country. The independent analysis report is to be sent to the ICC by Nov. 23 after the world cricket governing body sent Razzak's video footages to the BCB on Nov 2. b
