 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami turned out in countrywide protests at the arrest of party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, on Monday. A special court Monday ordered Nizami and Mojaheed, along with BNP veteran and former minister M Saifur Rahman, to jail after their surrender to a special court in the Barapukuria coalmine case. Leaders and supporters of Jamaat, and those of BNP in Saifur's home district of Sylhet, with one voice said they would not go to polls if their demands were not met. Holding protest rallies and processions, district Jamaat leaders alleged the government had jailed their leaders as part of a conspiracy to keep the BNP-led four-party alliance out of the next general election. Jamaat leaders and supporters rallied in large numbers in Dhaka, Sylhet and Pabna demanding release of Nizami and Mojaheed. Jamaat protests were also reported in Khulna, Jamalpur, Sunamganj, Bandarban, Rangpur and at Kushtia's Islamic University. JAMAAT BLOCKS CITY STREETS Jamaat supporters blocked one of Dhaka's major thoroughfares from Khamarbari to Bijoy Sarani in the capital Monday to protest the court order that sent their party chief and secretary general to jail. The Jamaat adherents, demanding the release of their leaders, took up positions on the road from morning causing severe obstructions to city traffic. "We do not consider this verdict fair. Those who have always respected the law have been sent to jail," Jamaat leader Delwar Hossain Saeedi told the rallying protestors. He claimed if the judiciary was truly independent then this would not have happened. "By imprisoning them the government is ruining any possibility of creating a proper electoral atmosphere," Saeedi said. The protestors said the four-party alliance would not go to the polls unless their seven-point demands were implemented. Normal service eventually esumed on the road in the afternoon. SYLHET SEES BNP PROTESTS Meanwhile, BNP's Sylhet city unit demonstrated in an evening procession protesting the detention of Saifur Rahman, who hails from the district. BNP would not go to polls if their seven-point demand was not met, Sylhet district BNP convenor M Ilyas Ali said. He said "If BNP does not go to polls the government will be held responsible in case of any untoward situation." The former lawmaker was speaking at a pre-procession rally in the city. Ilyas Ali said "The four party alliance's 7-point demand is rational; the government must realise it." The BNP leaders, led by Ilyas Ali, held a mass procession to press home their seven-point demand including withdrawal of cases against BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, her elder son Tarique Rahman and other national leaders. SYLHET, PABNA ALSO SEE JAMAAT RALLIES Sylhet Jamaat leaders also said the government has failed to create a favourable environment for election by sending Jamaat leaders to jail. The city unit's amir Ehsanul Mahbubur Jobair and secretary general Sirajul Islam Shaheen, addressing a rally at the party's Bandarbazar office, pressed too for the seven-point demands of the four-party alliance. In Pabna, Nizami's home district, Jamaat leaders rallied at the Town Hall. bdnews24.com/corr
