 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities have suspended 28 jail guards on charges of providing undue facilities to VIP prisoners in hospital prison cells, a senior prisons official said on Friday. The authorities also asked four VIP prisoners to explain why legal measures would not be taken against them for breaching jail codes. The prisoners are former BNP ministers Nazmul Huda, Moudud Ahmed and Mirza Abbas, and former BNP lawmaker Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan. Deputy inspector general, prisons, major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said the 26 jail guards were suspended on Friday for, among other reasons, arranging meeting between the VIP prisoners and relatives and providing food to them skirting the jail code. Twenty-six of the jail guards were suspended on Friday and the rest on Thursday, and all have been deployed in prison cells of the hospitals, Siddqui said. bdnews
