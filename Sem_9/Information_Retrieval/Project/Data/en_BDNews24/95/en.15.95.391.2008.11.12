<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday granted bail to former MP Naser Rahman in a case accusing him of having assets beyond declared income. The court also asked the government to say why the detention of former ministers Mirza Abbas and Lutfozzaman Babar in Khaleda's Zia cabinet were not unlawful. The bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir Hossain and Farid Ahmed granted the bail against a lower court verdict that gave Naser 13 years in jail. The same bench also awarded a three-month bail to the accused in an extortion case. Senior advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan submitted for Naser, son of former minister M Saifur Rahman, who is being prosecuted for graft charges. The bench of justices Tarik-ul Hakim and Farah Mahbub asked the government to explain in eight days why the detention of former housing and public works minister Abbas would not be cancelled. Another bench comprising justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Syed Kamrul Islam Siddiquee in a rule asked the government to explain in 10 days why the detention of former state minister for home Babar would not be declared illegal. Barrister Rafiqul Huq and advocate Ahsanul Karim pleaded for Abbas and Babar. bdne
