 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan has said the chief election commissioner and his colleagues should resign if they fail to hold elections by December. He made remarks, which are going to mount pressure on the Election Commission to get the country to the polls by the year-end, after a meeting of the Commission at the Jiban Bima Tower at Motijheel in the city on Tuesday. Akbar, a former caretaker government adviser, said the elections must take place in 90 days after the voter list is finalised. He argued it was the Election Commission's duty to quicken the process of holding the polls. "If the government hinders the holding of a free, fair and credible election by December 31 or does not cooperate on that the Election Commission should sue the government." Khan referred to one such case in India where former chief election commissioner TN Seshan took the government to court. "The Election Commission has nothing to do with which parties will take part in the polls and which others will not. Their duty is to hold a fair election and it is the government that should ensure proper election atmosphere." The major political parties should join the Dec. 18 election with minimal concessions, the RRC chairman suggested. Otherwise, he said, the parties would court disaster themselves. Asked if the current government was unconstitutional, the former adviser commented, "This government is undemocratic but would be unconstitutional if it fails its election deadline." bdnew
