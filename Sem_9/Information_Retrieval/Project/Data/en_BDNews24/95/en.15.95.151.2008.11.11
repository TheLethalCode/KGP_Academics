<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner on Tuesday urged the media not to publicise the elections results unofficially before the Election Commission does it officially. At the same time, ATM Shamsul Huda called upon all concerned to ensure that all political parties and contestants got equal and fair shares of publicity. "We are asking the mass media not to publicise the unofficial polls results because it might give rise to confusions before the returning officers announce the results at the field level," explained Huda at a ceremony at Biam auditorium while receiving a draft code of conduct for media coverage of elections from UNESCO. He said they would review the draft code of conduct in a week and were expected to finally determine the role of the mass media during the elections. In that time, they would invite the media's opinion on the proposed code. "There exists, however, no provision for taking any punitive action against any defaulter, as we believe in leaving the rest with the media houses and their ethics," reassured the CEC on the proposed code of conduct. "The Election Commission will assess later if it should seek the assistance of any press council or other professional bodies in this regard." Awami League had demanded of the Election Commission early this month to appoint neutral observers and provide a general code of conduct for the media. On appointing polls observers, the CEC said, "The Election Commission is attaching utmost importance to engaging both national and international observers. To ensure quality, the Election Commission has started registering such organisations adhering to some guidelines." He said only the eligible and befitting agencies would be registered as polls observers. Election commissioners Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain, and UNESCO Bangladesh resident representative Malama Meleisea were present. bdnews
