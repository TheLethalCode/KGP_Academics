 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court has sentenced fugitive Bangladesh ambassador to the United Arab Emirates ATM Najimullah Chowdhury, currently under suspension, to five years in prison for embezzling state funds. A Special Judge's Court handed down the verdict on Sunday, also fining the career diplomat Tk 21 lakh or another year in prison if the fine is not paid. He was found guilty of misappropriating government funds through the abuse of his office. The sentence will be effective from the date of Chowdhury's surrender or arrest. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on May 14, accusing the Chowdhury of misappropriating Tk 21 lakh while serving as the Bangladesh ambassador in Abu Dhabi. Among the unapproved expenses, Chowdhury was accused of spending 72,000 dirham to shift the ambassador's residence to a more expensive location and 34,000 dirham to engage two gardeners. ACC deputy director Abdullah Al Zahid, who filed the case, made a trip to the UAE in February to investigate allegations against the envoy and other embassy officials. The ambassador has not returned to Bangladesh since the case was filed. It is thought to be the first case of a career diplomat being convicted of corruption in Bangladesh. bdnews24.
