 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Dainik Prothom Alo faces contempt of court charges for publishing a report on the disposal of cases by the Supreme Court. The report bearing the headline "Rulings in 298 cases given in 315 minutes" was published in the newspaper on Sunday. Barrister Munshi Ahsan Karim filed a contempt petition with the High Court the same day against editor Matiur Rahman, publisher Mahfuz Anam and correspondent Mizanur Rahman Khan. The report alleged the High Court bench headed by Justice Sharif Uddin Chaklader "bailed out murder suspects" even after charges were pressed. The report also said that a prominent member of the legal profession, Dr Kamal Hossain wanted an investigation into the bench's rulings by the Supreme Judicial Council. It added that on Aug 28, rulings in a total of 434 cases were given by six benches, including 298 by Chaklader's bench, at an average rate of one ruling every 63 seconds. The five other benches mentioned were Bench Nos 11, 12, 15, 18, and 20. The bench of Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Kamrul Islam Siddiqui may hear the contempt petition on Tuesday. bdnews
