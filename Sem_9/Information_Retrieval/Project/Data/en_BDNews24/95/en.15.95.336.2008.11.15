<TITLE> Sajedul to replace Rasel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kimberley, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm pacer Sajedul Islam was called to South Africa on Saturday to join the national squad in place of injured paceman Syed Rasel ahead of the two Test series against the Proteas. Sajedul is expected to reach Johannesburg on Monday before joining the team in Bloemfontein, which will host the first Test on Nov 19-23. Left-arm pacer Rasel, who has been suffering from a back injury he sustained during the tour of England with the Bangladesh A team last year, is also due to fly out of Johannesburg on the same day. The team management had earlier decided to keep Rasel in South Africa to nurse him, but later changed their mind due to a similar worry over pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Mashrafee had also complained of back pain; although a scan report found no serious problem the team management did not want to risk keeping both injured pacers in South Africa. Mashrafee was also rested twice, for a one-day warm-up match and for the third and final one-day international against South Africa, though the match was washed out. bdnew
