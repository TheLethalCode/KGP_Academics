<TEXT>

A survey by pollsters IPR for the website of left-leaning La Repubblica newspaper said support for Berlusconi and for his center-right government as a whole slipped 4 percentage points over the past month to 58 and 50 percent respectively.

Italy, despite having one of the worst-performing economies in Europe, even seemed to miss the worst of the global financial crisis due to its banks' conservative lending practices. But polls suggest the tide is turning, with the economy now in recession, Alitalia's rescue faltering and pilots striking, students protesting at education reforms and Berlusconi chided for saying U.S. President-elect Obama had a nice "suntan."
