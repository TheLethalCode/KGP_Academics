Akmal smashed pacer Jerome Taylor for successive sixes and took a three off a misfield to settle the issue as Pakistan overhauled their target of 294. Chris Gayle hit 113, his 17th ODI hundred, in a total of 294 for nine but it was overshadowed as allrounder Fawad Alam (26) and wicketkeeper Akmal (24), who came together with 33 required from 17 balls, got Pakistan home. Debutant fast bowler Lionel Baker took three wickets for West Indies but the hosts were boosted by half-centuries from Khurrum Manzoor (69), Younis Khan (56) and captain Shoaib Malik (66).
