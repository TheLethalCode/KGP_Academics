 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  A ten to twelve day delay in elections to ensure participation of all parties is acceptable, says Bikalpadhara Bangladesh chief AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury. 'The participation of all parties will make the election meaningful," the former president said. His party was ready to participate, nevertheless, if the polls were held as scheduled on Dec 18, he added. Mentioning that the 1/11 changeover occurred due in equal measure to the failure of the two major political parties, he said: "This time there are 33 per cent young and new voters and they will decide the future of Bangladesh." Prof B Chowdhury said that his party would declare an electoral front comprising six to seven political parties within the next few days. Dismissing the possibility of having the Ershad-led Jatiya Party in the alliance, he said: oil and water cannot mix. bdnew
