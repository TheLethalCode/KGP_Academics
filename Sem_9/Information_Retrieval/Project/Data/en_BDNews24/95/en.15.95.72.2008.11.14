<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has agreed to talk to BNP chief Khaleda Zia risking wrath of her supporters, an aide said. "Our leader is ready to sit with Khaleda Zia for the sake of the country, though the Awami League leaders and workers have reservations about the move," the AL chief's special assistant Hasan Mahmud on Friday. "Our leaders and workers, however, are opposed to such meetings, as they hold BNP responsible for the August 21 grenade attack, BNP chief's birthday revelries on August 15, killing 21,000 AL leaders-workers-supporters and persecuting the minority communities after the 2001 polls." In any case, he said, the Hasina-Khaleda talks cannot take place if the prospects for polls shrivel. "But our chief is ready to sit with the BNP chief for the sake of our people. The talks, of course, have to be broadcast directly." "If their are no agendas drawn before the talks or in case the polls are thwarted eventually, the proposed 'summit' will be rendered useless," he said. The AL and BNP leaders told reporters on Wednesday that their chiefs were willing to sit together and talk. Taking cue, education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Thursday that the government was also prepared to facilitate the 'dialogue to take place.' The AL on Thursday said the dialogue between the two former prime ministers should be beamed live from the venue, to which BNP said 'no'. BNP, however, was interested in the meeting, party spokesperson Nazrul Islam Khan said. Iranian ambassador Hasan Farha Jandeh met with Hasina on Friday morning at her Sudha Sadan residence. Their one-hour meeting ended at 11am. The envoy later told reporters, "This was a courtesy visit, where we generally discussed the current political events and the upcoming national polls." Jandeh expressed hope that the elections would be held on schedule. Mahmud, the aide, said, "The meeting also discussed Iran's role in Bangladesh's development." Months back, the government raised the issue of seating the two top political leaders together and barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq, lawyer for both Hasina and Khaleda, said the same. The two leaders have seldom sat at a table in the past due to political rivalries. Soon after Khaleda's release from jail, Hossain Zillur on Sept. 11 had told reporters that in a bid to resolve the prevalent political crisis, efforts should be made to seat Hasina and Khaleda together. The government then approached barrister Huq to initiate the process, who after consulting the AL chief said, she had consented. Similarly, Zillur also met Khaleda to discuss the move and said she was agreeable too. Barrister Huq said at the bdnews24.com's anniversary celebrations on Thursday evening, "I'm trying to bring the two leaders together, the government is also actively pursuing the move." "I'm sure the state of affairs in our country will begin to stabilise as soon as the two leaders sit together and discuss the present crisis amicably." The anticipated meeting, however, depends now on BNP's decision about the election, he said. bdnews24.
