<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sun Nov 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's ruling Labour party scored mixed results from opinion polls on Sunday in the midst of a campaign by Prime Minister Gordon Brown to convince voters he is the right leader to tackle economic crisis. One survey in the Sunday Times newspaper said Labour had cut the opposition Conservatives' lead to the lowest level in any comparable survey all year. It put the Conservatives on 41 percent, down two points from last month, with Labour up three at 36 percent. That means the Conservatives' 10 point lead has halved in one month. Brown, who spent the weekend in the United States with other world leaders for talks on the global economy, has repeatedly talked up his economic experience in recent months. With Britain facing a recession, the former finance minister has tried to portray the opposition as "novices" who lack the experience needed to pull Britain through the turmoil. A second poll for the Independent on Sunday suggested Brown has yet to persuade all voters: it put the Conservatives on 43 percent, a three point rise from the previous month. Labour were up one point on 31 percent and the Liberal Democrats, Britain's third party, were down four on 12 percent. The research by ComRes said the majority of voters, 57 percent, thought Brown should not take "most of the blame" for a rise in unemployment. The number of people who think Labour will lose the next national election, due by 2010, has fallen to 54 percent from 68 percent in July, the ComRes poll said. Previous polls have suggested voters believe Brown will do a better job with the economy than the opposition. On Saturday, the Conservatives' economics affairs spokesman George Osborne said Brown's plans to boost public borrowing to help the ailing economy could lead to the collapse of the pound. Brown rejected Osborne's warning and accused him of being irresponsible. Finance Minister Alistair Darling will outline the government's economic plans in parliament on Nov. 24. Only two months ago, Brown's leadership was being openly questioned by members of his own party as Labour lost a string of by-elections and polls showed the Conservatives heading for a landslide general election victory
