 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Almost all the old faces among organisers were elected directors in the much-awaited election of Bangladesh Cricket Board on Tuesday with both panels fighting neck to neck. The polls saw an almost full turnout, with 167 of 168 councillors casting their votes for 23 directors in three categories  A, B, C -- amidst a festive mood at the National Sports Council. Many doubted whether such a committee would have been possible without election. Before the polls, many steps were taken to form a consensus committee, but all went in vain as the Ahmed Sajjul Alam Bobby-led Combined Parisad and Mahbub Anam-led Cricket Development Parisad failed to reach any agreement. "Those who have been elected are all experienced and cricket-related persons. So I am hopeful that the board will be successful," said Dewan Safiul Arefin Tutul, who bagged the highest 57 votes from Category A comprised of district and divisional councillors. Of 10 directors from Category A, nine backed by the District and Divisional Sports Associations' Forum were elected but Jainal Abedin lost his place to rival candidate Shamsul Huda. Both Jainal and Shamsul bagged equal votes of 33, and their fates were decided by a toss. In Category B, featuring councillors from Dhaka clubs, former general secretary Mahbub Anam bagged the highest 33 votes out of 52 while Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby bagged 29 votes to win. "I will say it is a good committee as tried and tested organisers have been elected," said Anam adding that they contested from separate panels, but they would work together in future. Bobby looked gloomy after losing his colleagues in the election. Former captain Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu bagged the highest 22 out of 46 votes to beat former captains Faruque Ahmed (18) and Roqibul Hassan (3) from Category C. In line with the new constitution, Category A comprises district and divisional councillors, Category B features councillors from clubs of Dhaka and Category C consists of former cricketers, educational boards, universities and the cricket welfare association. Apart from elected directors, the board president will be nominated by the government while a director will be chosen by National Sports council, the country's highest sports body. Those who have been elected directors are as follows: Category A (10 posts): Dewan Shafiul Arefin Tutul, Abdullah Al Fuad, Mahmud Jamal, Sirajuddin Mohammad Alamgir, Moeenuddin Chowdhury Qumrul, Syed Jahid Hossain, Shahidul Islam, Shamsul Huda, Asaduzzaman Khashru and Imran Chowdhury. Category B (12 posts): Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby, Shafiqur Rahman Munna, GS Hasan Tamim, Enayet Hossain Siraj, Golam Dastogir, Jalal Younus, Mahbub Anam, Iqbal Hossain, Aziz Al Kaiser Titu, Salman Ispahani, Mizanur Rahman, Aminul Haq Moni. Category C (1 post): Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu. bdnews24.c
