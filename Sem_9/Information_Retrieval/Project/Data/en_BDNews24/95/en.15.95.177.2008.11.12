 MADRID, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Third-tier team Real Union knocked Primera Liga champions Real Madrid out of the King's Cup on away goals after a last-ditch strike secured a 6-6 aggregate draw on Tuesday. The Basque club had won the first leg of the last-32 tie 3-2 in Irun and were trailing 4-2 at the Bernabeu when Eneko Romo buried a header past keeper Jerzy Dudek in the 90th minute to oust the home team. "There was no problem with our attitude," said Madrid coach Bernd Schuster after fielding a team weakened by injuries. "The problem in recent games is our opponents have had very few chances but have scored from them. The team is producing comebacks but you can't do it every time. It's worrying. "I am not worried (about my position) but I understand others are and they have doubts over the team and my work." The 17-times Cup winners made a lethargic start and were soon behind after striker Abasolo was left unmarked to fire past Dudek. LOOPING HEADER Raul equalised with a looping header before the break and scored again just after the restart. He tapped in from Javier Saviola's pass a minute after Salcedo had sprinted clear to put Union back in front 2-1. Madrid substitute Alberto Bueno swept in a glorious 25-metre shot to level the tie on aggregate and Raul looked to have sealed the win when he completed his hat-trick, his cross sailing past everyone and into the net with four minutes to go. But Madrid's defence, who leaked three goals at home to promoted Malaga in the league on Saturday, were caught out again at the end when Romo struck. On Wednesday, 13 more matches will be played with Villarreal trying to overturn a 5-0 first-leg deficit at home to third tier Poli Ejido. The last two ties take place on Thursday when 2007 winners Sevilla seek to come back from 1-0 down at home to third tier Ponferradina
