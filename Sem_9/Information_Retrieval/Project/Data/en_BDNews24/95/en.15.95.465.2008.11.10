<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)The government expects BNP to play "a responsible role", an adviser said Monday, with the party yet to give a decision as to their participation in the upcoming elections. "Everyone has to be responsible and come forward with a rational approach," Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters after a meeting of four advisers entrusted with ensuring a 'constructive settlement'. AF Hassan Ariff, Ghulam Qader and Anwarul Iqbal were the other three advisers at Monday's meeting held at the works ministry "We want to settle all disputes through dialogue and for that we expect assistance from all quarters," said Hossain Zillur. "The government is evaluating the overall situation and moving towards a solution." Election officials announced changes to the election schedule, on Sunday, "at the request of returning officers and candidates" to extend the period for submissions in particular. The deadline for nomination filing, for both Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila elections, was extended from Nov 13 to Nov 20. The dates for scrutiny and withdrawal of nomination papers were also changed. BNP, however, did not welcome the move, with party general secretary Khandakar Delwar Hossain terming the "juggling of dates" a farce. bdnew
