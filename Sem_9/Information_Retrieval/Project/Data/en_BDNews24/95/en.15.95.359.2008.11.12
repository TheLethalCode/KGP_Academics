<TITLE> Coal policy unlikely on lack of time: Tamim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Chances of the interim government finalising a coal policy and production-sharing contract on offshore mineral explorations are remote, the chief adviser's special assistant on power, energy and minerals has said. "But renewable energy policy may be finalised," M Tamim said at a discussion meeting titled 'Road to Energy Efficient Dhaka'. "The first proposal for approval of the coal policy and PSC was not successful. But the coal policy is almost final," he said and added that due to lack of time the PSC might not be approved. "People do not reduce waste on items that are inexpensive and, so, the price of fuels needs to be consistent. The present government is going to formulate a renewable fuel policy and commercial power plant policy." He also said a central watchdog, Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA), and a steering committee were being formed to monitor fuel preservation and usage of renewable energy. The committee has taken the initiative to introduce rules to increase the capacity of boilers, distribute CFL bulbs among 20,000 subscribers and produce written material. "In Dhaka, 500 mw of electricity is used for lights and 400 mw of power is used for other electrical appliances," said Dr Izaz Hossain. "The main problem is with supply. For load-shedding, under-capacity conductor is also responsible along with production deficit," said Dr Hossain. He added the power problem of the capital could be tackled through increased capacity of transformers, efficient power management and improved lines. The programme was moderated by Farid Hossain, bureau chief of Associated Press. Multimode director Tabith M Awal, Dr. Shahidul islam Khan of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, among others, also spoke. bdnew
