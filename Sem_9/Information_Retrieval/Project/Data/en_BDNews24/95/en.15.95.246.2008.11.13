 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  A judicial inquiry into the death of popular film actor Aslam Takulder Manna has unearthed neglect by doctors to treat him. The one-member judicial committee of Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Mohammad Saifur Rahman Siddique submitted the report to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's (CMM) Court, Dhaka on Thursday. The inquiry was ordered on Sept. 18 following a case filed by Manna's brother-in-law Reza Kader against six doctors of United Hospital on charges of negligence to provide proper treatment to the popular actor. The lawyer for the plaintiff, barrister Khandker Mohammad Mushfiqul Huda told reporters that the committee found proof of doctors' negligence in discharging professional duties. The committee interviewed four people, Huda said, adding the CMM's Court will formally accept the report on Sunday. Manna had gone to the hospital with chest pain at 4:00am on Feb. 17 and died at 2:00pm. The doctors came to the hospital at 9:00 in the morning, according to reports. Reza had alleged that Manna had been writhing in pain in the hospital without treatment for over five hours. The accused are Mohammad Enayet Hossain Sheikh, Momenuzzaman, Khandaker Mahbub Hussain, Fathima, Maimul Islam Majumder and Zahiruddin. bdnews24.com/
