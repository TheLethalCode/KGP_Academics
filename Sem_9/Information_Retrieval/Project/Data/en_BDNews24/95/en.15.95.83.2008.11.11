 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government has warned that election rallies and procession before Nov. 27 would be in breach of the emergency powers rules and ordered police to take action against the violators. Election rules bar publicity earlier than three weeks ahead of the general election slated for Dec. 18. The order came from a meeting of the cabinet committee on law and order, with chairman home adviser MA Matin presiding over. Home secretary Abdul Karim later briefed journalists on the meeting decisions. "As per the latest amendment to the EPR ban on publicity, rallies and procession have been withdrawn from 21 days ahead of the voting. As a result, publicity for parliamentary election can be carried out from November 27." The secretary said the rallies and meetings held before that date would be in clear violation of the emergency powers rules and in that case, the police would act. The government scrapped section 5 and 6 of the Emergency Powers Rules 2007 on Nov. 3 after the schedule for the national and Upazila elections were announced a day earlier. With the repeal, the restrictions on the election campaigning and the media were lifted. Decisions to arrest the violators, intensify illegal arms recovery drive and take deposit of the legal arms to stop violence over election were taken in the meeting. The meeting decided that owners of all types of firearms would deposit them to police stations from Nov. 20 to Dec. 3. The arms would be kept until Jan. 5, 2009, Karim said. "After depositing the arms carrying arms will remain banned till January 5. Apart from law enforcing agency personnel the security workers of financial institutions including banks can carry arms if necessary." The secretary said no new arms licence would be issued to any individual until the elections were over. "The sale of all types of firearms and ammunition has also been banned until further notice." Law-enforcement agencies would be deployed in line with the demand of the Election Commission, Karim said. The home secretary was happy about the law and order situation in the country. "The law and order situation was comparatively better last month. I don't see any possibility of its deterioration ahead of the election." Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, inspector general of police Nur Mohammad, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandker and high officials of the ministry were also present. bdnews2
