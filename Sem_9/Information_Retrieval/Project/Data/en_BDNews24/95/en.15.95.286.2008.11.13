 MADRID, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid's embarrassing exit from the King's Cup at the hands of Segunda B (third tier) Real Union has set alarm bells ringing at the Bernabeu. The Primera Liga champions, who have won the cup 17 times, fell at the last-32 stage on away goals on Tuesday following a 6-6 aggregate draw.

"It's a very painful defeat for the team and the fans and there is no justification," Raul told reporters. The home fans have been critical of the side's play in recent games, as have local media, who speculated that another poor showing away to Valladolid in the league on Saturday could see the coach's position under serious threat. "I am not worried (about my position) but I understand others are and they have doubts over the team and my work," Schuster said. He refused to explain who 'the others' were. Real Union have won the Cup three times before, in the early decades of the last century, but were euphoric after Tuesday's heroics. "I think I'm still dreaming," coach Inaki Alonso said. "We knew it would be difficult but we always believed we had a chance
