 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh look to roll into semifinals of the Grand Royal Challenge Cup by beating Indonesia in their final group match on Wednesday at Thuawana Youth Training Football ground in Myanmar capital Yangon. After a goalless draw against hosts Myanmar on Tuesday, Bangladesh need to win against the southeast Asian nation, who are 59 places higher than Bangladesh's 181 in FIFA ranking. The statistics also put Indonesia ahead of Bangladesh, who won just two in 10 matches they had played and drew twice. Bangladesh, however, might take heart from the 2007 Mardeka Cup campaign where a second-string team went down by just one goal against the Indonesia national team. "We haven't played Indonesia recently, but we must have to win to qualify for the semifinals," said coach Shafiqul Islam Manik, according to a message received here. "I can't tell right now whether we will win, but I think the boys are motivated to play better after holding Myanmar to a goalless draw." Manik said he had no idea about the strength of the opponents. Manik has problems off the pitch as his key players are doubtful for the crucial tie. Striker Jahid Hasan Emily and playmaker Arman Aziz have been suffering from minor injuries while an ankle injury has ruled defender Ariful Islam out of Thursday's match. The former national defender, however, said his side would play positive and better football. Captain Matiur Munna was also looking forward to make it to the semifinals as all players are confident after playing a tough game against Myanmar. "We left Dhaka for Myanmar with a commitment of playing semifinals and we must go for a win tomorrow," said goalkeeper Aminul Islam, who made a string of saves Tuesday to keep Myanmar at bay. Indonesian coach Banny Dole said they were only thinking about victory in their tournament opener. "We will definitely play for a win against Bangladesh, who worked hard in the first match against Myanmar. We know it well that a win throws us into semifinals," said Dole, a former left back of Pelita Jaya Club. Indonesia also had little time to get prepared for the tournament and had five days to train. b
