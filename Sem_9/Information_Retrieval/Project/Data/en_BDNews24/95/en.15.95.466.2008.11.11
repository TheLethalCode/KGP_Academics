<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will miss pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza in the third and final day-night encounter against South Africa at Buffalo Park in East London on Wednesday. The match, an academic affair after the hosts sealed the series, will be telecast by the state-run television BTV at 6:30pm (BdST). South Africa bundled Bangladesh out for 230 after racking up 358/4 in the second match that ensured their series in Benoni. Pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin might make his one-day debut as he has been drafted in 13-man squad along with pace trio Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain and Shahadat Hossain. With four fast bowlers in the 13 there is a possibility that Bangladesh might field three pacers for the first time in the series. Roqibul had scored a first-ball duck and four in the first two matches to get left out of the team, paving the way for the middle order batsman Mehrab Hossain Junior. The absence of strike bowler Mashrafee means Bangladesh will have to face the Proteas with a depleted attack. Buffalo Park, regarded as the smallest cricket ground in South Africa, has hosted 19 ODIs since 1992, the last of which was in September 2006. The wicket here is usually slow paced and good for batting. Bangladesh has the distinction of playing the only Test ever held here when they toured in 2002. Mashrafee, who had batted in the second match with a runner, was feeling discomfort from a sore back. He, however, had practice on Tuesday, but did not bowl. "Every international match we play helps our cricket development. For the players it is another opportunity to show what they are capable of and when you perform against top quality sides the confidence level goes up a notch," said Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful. Ashraful declined to comment on his opposite number Graeme Smith's reported opinion that Bangladesh played negative cricket at Benoni while chasing 359. "We don't spend time thinking about what other people are saying. Our job is to try and play to the best of our ability and that's where our focus is. We know that when we manage to do that in every department we become quite competitive against any team anywhere in the world." South Africa will name their playing XI in the morning and local boy Monde Zondeki, the fast bowler, might get his first game of the series. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Nazmul Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Shahadat Hossain. bdne
