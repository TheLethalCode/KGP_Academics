 Kishoreganj, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  A 'listed' criminal Badal Miah died early Wednesday in a gun-battle between 'miscreants' and the police in Korshakoriail village under Kishoreganj sadar upazila, police said. Badal Miah (30), a criminal on the 'wanted' list of the police was nabbed only Tuesday. After arresting Badal, police quizzed him and then moved to recover arms following the tips extracted from the arrestee. Taking Badal along, as the police reached near Nakdora railway bridge in Korshakoriail at around 4:30 am, Badal's cohorts opened fire at the police and the police retaliated, Kishoreganj sadar police chief Tapan Chandra Saha told reporters. Badal attempted to flee the scene, when he received bullets in the midst of the chaos and died. The gangsters, however, ran away, Saha said. Three of the police constables Ghiasuddin, Taposh and Murad were also injured during the battle. They were admitted to Kishoreganj sadar hospital. The police retrieved two revolvers, two short swords and one chopper from the spot. Badal and his companions had allegedly been pursuing criminal activities for the two preceding years in Kishoreganj sadar and Karimganj areas, Tapan Saha said. There are 15 murder, burglary, kidnapping and rape cases filed against him. According to the survey of the human rights organisation 'Odhikar', as many as 116 people died in confrontations with law enforcers through September of the current year. 'Odhikar' demanded of the authorities to stop these unjust activities and punish the high-handedness of the people responsible for such killings. bdnews24.c
