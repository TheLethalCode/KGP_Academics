<TITLE> HSBC may cut 600 jobs in Asia: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Asian arm of UK bank HSBC Holdings may cut 600 more staff as economic conditions worsen, Hong Kong's Standard newspaper reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. HSBC spokesman Gareth Hewett declined to comment. In September, the bank said it was cutting 1,100 jobs in its investment banking operation, or 4 percent of the unit's total, including about 100 in Hong Kong, where the bank's Asian unit is based. HSBC was scheduled later on Monday to release its interim management statement and third-quarter results for its U.S. business.
