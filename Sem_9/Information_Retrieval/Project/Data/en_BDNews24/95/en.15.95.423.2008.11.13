<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  A court has been petitioned to declare Jamaat-e-Islami's former chief Ghulam Azam, incumbent chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed and 33 others "war criminals" and bar them from running elections, a lawyer said. The petition appealed the Dhaka District Judge's Court on Thursday to issue an injunction, barring them from filing nomination for the polls, K Mohibul Hasan Apel, the lawyer, said. The deadline for filing nomination to teh Election Commission is Nov. 20. The plaintiffs are advocates Liton Mia, Md Safayet Hosain Sajib and Rajib Ahmed. The court will hear the petition on Sunday, Apel said. Jamaat's assistant secretary general Md Quamaruzzaman, Delwar Hossain Saidee and Moulana AKM Yusuf, BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury and his late father Fazlul Quader Chowdhury are also among the people whom the petition wants barred. The petition made the chief election commissioner, the secretary at the Election Commission Secretariat and the deputy commissioner of Dhaka district as litigants. A good number of political and socio-cultural bodies have been demanding to the EC to declare a number of Jamaat leaders "war criminals" and stop them from contesting the next general elections. They also urged the EC not to register Jamaat-e-Islami as a political party. On Nov 4, the Sectors Commanders' Forum, a forum comprising the sector commanders during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, unveiled an "initial" list of 50 war criminals, most of them from Jamaat. The forum had also demanded an election ban on them and their trial fro alleged war crimes. But the EC registered the party.
