<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme has been left out of the squad for next week's friendly in Scotland, their first game under new coach Diego Maradona. Riquelme was not among the three home-based players named on Tuesday for the match in Glasgow on Nov. 19. The Argentina Football Association (AFA) said on its website (www.afa.org.ar) that Daniel Montenegro (Independiente), Emiliano Papa (Velez Sarsfield) and Cristian Villagra (River Plate) had been added to the foreign-based players named last week. Riquelme's absence followed an appeal to the AFA from his club Boca Juniors, who are level on points with Argentine championship leaders San Lorenzo with five games each to play. Maradona also declined to call up any players from San Lorenzo or Argentinos Juniors and Estudiantes, who have reached the Copa Sudamericana semi-finals
