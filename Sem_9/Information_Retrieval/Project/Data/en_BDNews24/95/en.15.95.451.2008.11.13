 Bangkok, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb thrown at a rally of Thai market vendors protesting over new rental contracts in Bangkok wounded 13 people, police and witnesses said on Thursday. The incident had nothing to do with an anti-government movement whose supporters have been occupying the official compound of the prime minister since August, police said.
