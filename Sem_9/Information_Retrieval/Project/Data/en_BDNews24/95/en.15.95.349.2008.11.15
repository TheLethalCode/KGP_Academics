 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League has said that the party is ready for the Dec 18 elections having almost finalised nominations and continuing discussions with allies on seat distribution. "We hope the election will be held on time and all parties will participate," party spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam said on Saturday. The AL general secretary was briefing reporters after AL president Sheikh Hasina met with Pakistan's high commissioner Alamgir Babar at her Sudha Sadan home. It was a farewell and courtesy call by the Pakistan envoy, he said. Ashraf told reporters: "Our president has said that the party is ready for the Dec 18 elections. The nominations are almost finalised. We are also discussing seats with alliance members." "Our leader believes the election is the only way forward from the current crisis," he said. On the prospective meeting between the two former prime ministers, Ashraf said only that the party was now busy with the election and nominations. Earlier the Pakistan envoy told reporters that the AL chief was hopeful about the upcoming elections. The election was an internal affair of Bangladesh, he said. If it was acceptable to the people it would also be acceptable to his country. BNP chief Khaleda Zia had a similar meeting with the high commissioner on Friday. bdnews
