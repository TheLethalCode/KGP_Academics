<TITLE> Global crisis may hit export, remittance: IMF </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The snowballing global financial crisis could cut through Bangladesh's export earnings and wage-earners' remittances, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The IMF has advised bridling the credit flow in the private sector to contain the inflation rate to a tolerable limit. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed met a three-member IMF team headed by Thomas Rampaugh, IMF's Asia Pacific regional adviser, before he revealed the warning to reporters on Wednesday. "After reviewing our overall economic status, the visiting IMF team opined that the global credit crunch might affect our overseas remittance flow and export earnings," said the central bank chief. The IMF team has also asked Bangladesh to brace itself for any relevant crisis. As a result of a liberalised private sector credit policy, IMF fears, the average inflation rate might soar beyond nine percent this year, Ahmed said. "We assured the IMF team that measures have been taken to check the inflation," he said, adding the government had cut down the fuel prices in line with the fall in the international market. "The last Boro season yielded bumper harvest. Good output of Aman paddy is also predicted." All indices showed that inflation would remain fairly below nine percent this fiscal year, the top central banker argued. About the bulk of classified loans lying with the banks, as the IMF officials cited, the governor said, "We have been fighting with all our means to overcome the long-lasting problem." Big volumes of classified loans in the nationalised commercial banks are a stumbling block to the ongoing efforts, he added. Bangladesh Bank statistics shows that credit flow in FY 2007-8 rocketed 26.11 percent against 15.12 per cent in the preceding fiscal year. The first quarter of the current fiscal year (2008-9) has witnessed a 25 percent credit growth. This year's national budget estimated nine percent inflation. bdnews24
