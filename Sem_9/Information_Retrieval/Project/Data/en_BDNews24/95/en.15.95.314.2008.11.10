 LONDON, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan regained top spot in Serie A from AC Milan after they scored an injury-time winner and their city rivals conceded a late equaliser on Sunday. Barcelona emphatically retained their advantage in Spain after Samuel Eto'o scored four goals in a 6-0 win over Real Valladolid. Chelsea continue to lead on goal difference from Liverpool in England. ENGLAND The status quo remained the same at the top of the Premier League with Chelsea and Liverpool both enjoying comfortable victories. Robbie Keane scored his first league goals for Liverpool in Saturday's 3-0 defeat of West Bromwich Albion while Chelsea nosed back in front on goal difference on Sunday when Nicolas Anelka scored twice in a 2-0 win at Blackburn Rovers. Both sides have 29 points from 12 games. Samir Nasri also scored twice for Arsenal on Saturday in a 2-1 victory over Manchester United that put them above the champions into third place, six points behind the leaders. United are fourth with 21 points. Only three points seperate the bottom 11 clubs. Tottenham Hotspur moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 victory at Manchester City. West Brom are last, with Sunderland and Newcastle United also in the relegation zone. SPAIN Barcelona continue to lead the Primera Liga with 25 points from ten games as the top four all won their matches this weekend. Barca hammered Valladolid 6-0 at the Nou Camp on Saturday, with Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o netting four in the first half, to make it eight consecutive wins for Pep Guardiola's outfit. Unbeaten Villarreal are a point back in second after beating Almeria 2-1 at home on Sunday, when Valencia edged up to third on 23 points, ahead of Real Madrid on goal difference, with a 3-0 away win at Getafe. The champions came from behind three times to beat promoted Malaga 4-3 at home with ten-men on Saturday. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain netted all four. ITALY Inter Milan are the new leaders in Serie A after rivals AC Milan wasted the chance to stay top by conceding deep into injury time in a 1-1 draw at promoted Lecce. Ronaldinho slid home on 79 minutes after Milan had spurned a host of chances but it was ultimately not enough as Lecce's Andrea Esposito glanced in a free kick. Substitute Julio Cruz headed a stoppage-time winner for Inter at home to Udinese, who slip to fifth below Napoli, 2-0 winners over Sampdoria and Lazio, who overcame Siena 3-0. Juventus are level with Udinese after Alessandro Del Piero, on his 34th birthday, continued his purple patch by scoring a third free kick in three matches in a 2-0 win at struggling Chievo. FRANCE Olympique Lyon preserved their four-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Monaco on Saturday thanks to a goal by striker Fred. Lyon, who have not conceded a goal in their last five games, lead the standings with 30 points from 13 games ahead of Olympique Marseille, who kept up the pressure in second place by cruising to a 3-0 win at promoted Grenoble. Last season's runners-up Girondins Bordeaux are third on 24 points after a 2-0 win at home to Auxerre. GERMANY Bayer Leverkusen finished the weekend top despite throwing away a three-goal lead at Karlsruhe, but Bayern Munich were the big winners as they moved to within a point of the leaders after holding on for a 2-1 victory at Schalke 04. Leverkusen strolled into a 3-0 lead on Saturday before a lucky deflection sparked a Karlsruhe revival that earned them a 3-3 draw that few could have expected in the first half. It left Leverkusen trailing Hoffenheim on goals scored but in the end it proved enough as Ralf Rangnick's newcomers saw their five-match winning run come to an end with a 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin on Sunday, Andriy Voronin getting the goal. Bayern Munich took advantage by snatching victory away to Schalke thanks to goals from Luca Toni and the brilliant Franck Ribery. With 12 games played, Leverkusen and Hoffenheim have 25 points apiece, with Bayern second on 24. NETHERLANDS AZ Alkmaar retained top spot on goal difference from Ajax Amsterdam and NAC Breda after cruising to a 3-0 win over Steve McClaren's Twente Enschede with Brazilian Ari scoring twice. Ajax, who lost striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar to an ankle injury, recorded a 5-2 home win over Sparta Rotterdam while Breda were 2-0 winners at Graafschap Doetinchem on Friday. All three sides have 22 points, two clear of Gronigan and four ahead of champions PSV Eindhoven following their fourth league defeat of the season, a 1-0 loss at NEC Nijmegen. SCOTLAND Rangers prevented Celtic opening up a dangerous gap at the top of the Scottish Premier League on Sunday with a 4-0 rout of Kilmarnock. David Weir, Kris Boyd, Kenny Miller and Steven Whittaker were all on target. Celtic had gone five points clear on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Motherwell. The two Glasgow clubs have opened up a huge gap over the rest of the division already with third-placed Dundee United 10 points behind Rangers after a 2-1 defeat of Aberdeen. GREECE Olympiakos Piraeus stayed top of the Greek Super League after grinding out a dour goalless draw with arch-rivals Panathinaikos on Sunday. Their lead has been cut to just one point after PAOK beat Panionios 2-0 thanks to an early penalty from Vladan Ivic and a late strike from Bosnian striker Zlatan Muslimovic. Xanthi are third with 18 points after their 1-1 draw at home to AEK Athens. SWEDEN Kalmar won Sweden's premiership for the first time, securing the title after a 2-2 draw with Halmstad. Kalmar, from Sweden's south east, had built up a lead going into the final rounds before runners-up IF Elfsborg mounted a late challenge.
