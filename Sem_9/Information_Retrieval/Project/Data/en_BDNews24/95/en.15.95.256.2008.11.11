<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) - A high level of disparity prevails in secondary education countrywide, which in turn is widening social inequalities, finds a study that highlights the rural, urban gap and poor management in madrasa schools. With admission at secondary level being competitive, children of well-off families have the best chance of getting into good schools, contributing to a growing rich-poor divide, revealed the report titled 'Secondary Education: challenges in parity'. Based on Education Watch Review 2007 and conducted by Gano Sakkhorota Abhijan, a network of more than 1,000 organisations, the study was unveiled Monday by education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. "Quality of education must be ensured from primary level to the university level. Quality of education must be raised whatever the cost." He added that extra-curricular activities outside the classroom should also be given emphasis. The study found inequality among educational institutions prevailed according to their type and location. Institution-wise the students of government schools showed good performance, while the madrasa curriculum and text books are not well implemented at secondary level, said the report. Almost all government-run secondary schools are located in town areas and their physical infrastructure, quality of teachers and teaching facilities are better, the authors said. By the same yardstick, private schools in town areas come next in quality of education. Madrasas in town areas come in third position. Private schools and madrasas in rural areas fall in fourth and fifth places respectively. Madrasa students were not attaining the required efficiency in basic subjects like Bangla, English, mathematics and science, the study found. There was huge discrepancy between the general education system and madrasa system in distribution of marks, preparation of question papers and evaluating answer scripts, it said. Portraying this picture, the review found that a small minority of students in the country have the opportunity to attend good educational institutions. Lack of facilities for implementation of the educational curriculum was the major cause for poor quality education, the authors said. They also suggested some measures to solve the problems, the main ones being better strategy, planning and investment. The main should be elimination of disparity in teaching and facilities for students from Class VI to X in government and private and madrasa schools, they said. Education Watch chairperson Kazi Fazlur Rahman, acting secretary of the primary and mass education ministry Badrul Alam Tarafder, acting director of Gano Sakkhorota Abhijan Md Azizul Haq, convenor of Education Watch 2007 Dr AMR Chowdhury and researcher Samir Ranjan Nath spoke at the report launch. bdne
