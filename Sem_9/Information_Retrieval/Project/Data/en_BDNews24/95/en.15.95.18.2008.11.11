 ZURICH, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea are unlikely to bolster their squad in the January transfer window, chief executive Peter Kenyon said on Monday. "It's not high on the agenda," Peter Kenyon told the International Football Arena at FIFA headquarters when asked if coach Luiz Felipe Scolari would be allowed to buy players.

"I think that's good management and prudent in these conditions," he said in a a podium interview about the effect of the global financial crisis on football. Chelsea top the Premier League standings on goal difference from Liverpool after 12 games
