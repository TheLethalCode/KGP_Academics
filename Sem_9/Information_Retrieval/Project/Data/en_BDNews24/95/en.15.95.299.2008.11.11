 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League representatives Tuesday had a meeting with the Election Commission on ways to resolve complicacies in filling and filing nomination papers. "We have discussed the election, the code of conduct and aspects of filling in the nomination papers and we are happy with the EC's response that minor mistakes will be ignored," AL office secretary Advocate Abdul Mannan Khan said, after the hour-long meeting CEC ATM Shamsul Huda and fellow commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hossain were present at the meeting a four-member AL delegation. Abdul Mannan said they told the EC that the time span between the scheduled dates for the parliamentary and upazila elections was impractical. The AL representatives also told the EC that they considered the educational qualifications, accounts of assets, statements on cases and other conditions stipulated in the nomination papers "too complicated". "But the EC has assured us they wouldn't cancel the candidature for small slip-ups," Mannan said. bdnews
