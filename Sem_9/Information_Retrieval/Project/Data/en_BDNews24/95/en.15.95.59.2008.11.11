 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)Former health minister Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and former home minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, facing charges in the Barapukuria case, were released on bail on Tuesday. "They have been freed on bail at the order of the High Court," said deputy inspector general, prisons, major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui. The Supreme Court on Monday had upheld bail orders secured by the BNP leaders in the case. Member of the BNP standing committee, Mosharraf, charged with six counts, and former air force chief Altaf, charged with two cases, were arrested March 7 and May 28 last year by the joint forces. They were welcomed in front of the C-Block of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University by BNP supporters. Vice-president MK Anwar, former MP Monirul Huq howdhury and other party leaders were present. The Appellate Division rejected an appeal of the Anticorruption Commission to overturn a High Court order granting bail to the former BNP ministers and staying the proceedings of the Barapukuria coalmine case against them. Meanwhile, a special court on Monday ordered BNP leader M Saifur Rahman, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and former minister of state for energy Mosharraf Hossain to jail after their surrender in the same case. Another accused in the case, former energy minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain, was sent to jail on Sunday after surrendering to the special court. The ACC pressed charges in the case on Oct 5 against 16 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The commission filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the then government leaders of incurring losses of nearly Tk 158 crore to the state through irregularities in the handling of the coalmine. bdnews24.co
