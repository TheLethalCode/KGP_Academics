 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  It is the Election Commission itself that is fuelling popular doubts and fanning fears about the elections, the Awami League said on Monday. "We have been working hard to meet the Election Commission's announced time lines and now we find them backing out and deferring schedules," said spokesperson and joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. Ashraful spoke to reporters after the 90-minute meeting between party president Sheikh Hasina and Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakrabarti. Asked if the they had any apprehensions about the polls, he said, "The Election Commission itself is now making us doubtful." "We also hear that the polls dates also may be shifted. In case the polls are not held on December 18, I'm saying this again, the country will court disaster." Asked to clarify 'disaster', he explained: "The polls must be held within December, because the caretaker government too has to take leave towards the close of 2008. Will the country have no government in January?" The Indian envoy told reporters that they hadn't discussed politics and he only enquired into the former premier's health conditions and how she had gone about undergoing treatment abroad. Asked for comment on the ensuing parliamentary election, Chakravarty said, "Well, we hear that the polls will be held on December 18 and it should very well be." Asked if the envoy thought appropriate environment for the polls prevailed, he said, "Well, that has to be achieved and determined by the government, political parties and the Election Commission." Ashraful said, "It was only a courtesy call. The Indian envoy said Bangladesh should also have her elections, just like other nations." On what Hasina said during the meeting, he said, "Our president said the polls must be held on December 18, because an elected government only can attract foreign investment, control commodity prices and create employment." bdnew
