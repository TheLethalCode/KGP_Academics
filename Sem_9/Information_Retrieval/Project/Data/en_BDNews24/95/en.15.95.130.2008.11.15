 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe officially fell into recession on Friday and the U.S. economy suffered thousands more layoffs and the biggest retail sales dip on record as world leaders met in Washington to address the worst financial crisis in 80 years. Leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies said they were working on plans to counter the growing economic threat and prevent future crises, but big breakthroughs were not expected at their meeting in the U.S. capital, given the absence of U.S. President-elect Barack Obama, whose involvement will be key to any global initiatives. The financial crisis continues to wreak havoc on the world's major economies, with official data showing the 15-nation euro zone economy had shrunk by 0.2 percent for the second quarter in a row, meaning it is technically in recession. The United States is probably already in recession, most economists agree, but official data showing that will not come out until January. "Frankly, we at Dow are looking at an '09 that looks like a pretty protracted global recession, probably going into 2010," Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical Co, the largest U.S. chemical maker, told Reuters. Signs for the U.S. economy worsened on Friday. Retail sales fell 2.8 percent in October, according to government data, the biggest decline since comparable numbers were first collected in 1992. Citigroup Inc, one of the hardest-hit financial companies, will soon announce job cuts of up to 10 percent of its staff, according to a source familiar with the matter. That could affect more than 30,000 employees. Sun Microsystems Inc said it would slash up to 6,000 jobs, or 18 percent of its workforce, as it looks to save money while demand wanes for its high-end business computers. Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest mutual fund company, told employees it will cut a further 1,700 jobs on top of 1,300 already announced. Freddie Mac, the second-largest provider of U.S. home loan financing, reported a $25 billion quarterly loss as the housing slump worsened, forcing it to draw on a $100 billion Treasury Department lifeline. Meanwhile, approval of a bailout for the big U.S. automakers was in doubt, increasing the possibility of a wave of mass layoffs at General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC. The U.S. Senate plans on Monday to take up a bill that would provide emergency aid to automakers, but it remained unclear if there was enough support for it to pass. The only glimmer of optimism was that U.S. consumer sentiment rose slightly, helped by lower gasoline prices. Confidence might be raised further by moves to reduce skyrocketing home foreclosures by modifying borrowers' loans, but a proposal along those lines by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp met opposition from the U.S. Treasury and the White House.
