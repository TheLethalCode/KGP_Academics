<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The communications ministry has pledged to go public with a report in its efforts to purge the organisations under its wings of deep-rooted corruption, a top official said. "We are finding out the sources of corruption in the organisations under communications ministry. We will make them public by Dec. 10," roads and railway division secretary Iqbal Mahmud said on Thursday. He made the comments at the Secretariat after a meeting with Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury. Corruption in all other sectors would be identified gradually and measures would be taken accordingly, he said. "We want to bring change. Once the situation was such that many thought they would be safe. But now the scenario is different," Mahmud said. On whether the ministry would open any cell for these operations, he said: "The ministry is opening a pilot scheme, for now and may form a cell in future if required." The ACC chairman welcomed the initiative of the communications ministry. "Such a pledge will be treated as a model in future. We hope all other ministries will follow the suit," he said. "If each ministry makes such a move it will be much easier to stop corruption," Hasan Mashhud said. Asked if the commission's antigraft drives would lose way due to these moves, he said: "The past drives will not be lost." b
