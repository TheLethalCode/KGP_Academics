 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bndews24.com)  The havoc wrought by Cyclone Sidr, which raged across the low-lying coast of southern Bangladesh, packing winds of over 230 km/h in the early hours of Nov. 15, 2007, was so severe that millions of survivors are still reliving the nightmare  one year on. The deadliest storm to hit the country in more than a decade, it ravaged large swathes of the country, ended thousands of lives and wrecked millions more. It swept away countless mud and thatch homes, downed trees, devastating the Sundarbans, sent mobile telephone towers crashing, and knocked out power lines. Government estimates put the death toll at over 3,300 and injuries at 55,282, although unofficial figures counted deaths at 15,000. Over a million people are struggling without proper homes and at greater risk of disease than before, one year after cyclone Sidr hit, Oxfam said on Wednesday. Although, in terms of loss of human lives, Sidr may not be considered as deadly as the cyclones of 1970, when an estimated 500,000 died, or of 1991, with 138,000 dead, in terms of loss to the national economy, it might appear to be the worst of its kind. The rivers in the fragile delta regions of the Bay of Bengal  Barguna, Bagerhat, Patuakhali, Pirojpur and another eight districts  had swelled so high that water punched through mud embankments. They washed away paddy and vegetable fields, ruining the year's earnings for farmers who live off those lands. Millions who were affected by the cyclone are still struggling to rebuild their homes, recover their incomes and return to a normal life. Many of them, who saw the waves crash into their village and spent hours clinging to trees to survive, remain deeply traumatised. According to official estimates, nearly two million households and 8.7 million people were affected, 1.5 million houses damaged, 4.1 million trees destroyed, and crops on one million hectares of land lost. The cyclone brought an extra burden to the country's riddled economy, which had been facing a tough time due to repeated floods and price hikes of petroleum products on the international market. The cyclone hit at a time the country was just yet to recover from twin floods during July-August that caused damage of about Tk 2,700 crore. That time Aman rice crop, the predominant source of staple food in the area, was also about to be harvested. The agricultural ministry had initially estimated that Sidr had caused a loss of at least 600,000 metric tons of Aman crops in the coastal areas. The world's biggest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans also took the full brunt of Sidr, with a quarter of the flora of the world heritage site totally destroyed while animals in their thousands perished, according to a primary assessment of the forest department. The government, World Bank and a number of local and international NGOs came up with both short and long-term rehabilitation programmes in Sidr's aftermath. The government's two major rehabilitation programmes involved Tk 7,595 crore to make up for the cyclone losses. Bangladesh  trapped between the Bay of Bengal and the Himalayas, and with 17 million people living less than one metre above sea level  has always suffered more than its share of natural disasters. But last year's cyclone is only part of worsening climatic instability that is threatening ordinary people's ability to survive. bdnews24.com
