 KINSHASA, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said on Saturday his efforts to end fighting in Congo were going fairly well and that President Joseph Kabila had not given conditions for talks with the rebels. Kabila's army is battling dissident Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda's rebels and Obasanjo has been tasked by the United Nations with stopping the violence escalating into a re-run of the 1998-2003 conflict that sucked in six African nations. "(I) am trying to draw together the strands that we need... for us to be able to move forward. That has gone fairly well so far," Obasanjo told reporters in Kinshasa after meeting Kabila. He was due to fly to eastern Congo later on Saturday. Obasanjo, named last week by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as his special envoy, met Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda before flying to Democratic Republic of Congo, and has already spoken to Nkunda by telephone. He also met Congolese members of parliament and foreign diplomats in the capital Kinshasa. Nkunda began his rebellion in 2004 saying he was fighting to defend fellow Tutsis in eastern Congo, particularly from attacks by Rwandan Hutu rebels operating there. But after seizing swathes of territory in battles last month, Nkunda threatened to take his rebellion all the way to the distant capital Kinshasa unless Kabila negotiated with him. "NO CONDITIONS" Asked if Kabila was ready to talk to Nkunda, Obasanjo said: "He did not give anything that I would call conditions but we are at the exploratory stage now." The United Nations says the fighting has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe. On Friday, aid workers began feeding tens of thousands of refugees in rebel-held areas. There are fears the violence could escalate into a repeat of a 1998-2003 war that killed some 5.4 million people, mostly through hunger and disease. Rights groups say rebels and rival pro-government militias killed dozens of civilians last week. Kabila accuses neighboring Rwanda of supporting Nkunda, while southern African states led by Angola have said they are considering sending troops to back the Congolese army, or to bolster an over-stretched 17,000-strong U.N. force in Congo. The conflict's origins trace back to Rwanda's 1994 genocide of Tutsis by Hutus, which helped trigger the 1998-2003 war. Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of backing Nkunda, who says he is defending Congolese Tutsis from attacks by FDLR Rwandan Hutu rebels that he and Kigali say fight with the Congolese army. On Friday, Rwanda and Congo agreed to send Rwandan intelligence officers to the east to fight Hutu rebels, whom Rwanda sees as the root cause of the conflict. "We shall send our elite troops to flush out the FDLR," Congolese Foreign Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba was quoted as saying in the English-language New Times newspaper in Kigali.
