 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has termed the eagerness of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to sit together 'positive' for the country. "We have heard that the two leaders have agreed to sit for discussion. If it is held it will be good for the country and very positive for the upcoming election," election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Thursday that the government was ready to act as a catalyst in making the prospective meeting between the two top leaders happen. The two former prime ministers, who have barely spoken to each other for the past 17 years, are ready to sit and talk political issues, their parties said on Wednesday. Fellow commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said the election would be held according to the date declared. "The commission is determined to hold the national election on Dec. 18 and Upazila polls on Dec 28 in line with the schedule," he told bdnews24.com. On speculations that the election can be pushed back, Sakhawat said the commission was not aware of the matter. bdnew
