Noor Hossain was shot dead by police near Zero Point in Dhaka, on Nov 10 1987, during demonstrations against the regime of the then military ruler Hussain Muhammed Ershad. The 26 year-old took to the streets with the slogan 'Down with autocracy, free democracy' inscribed on his chest and back.

The son of a rickshaw-puller, later an Awami League activist, Noor was born in 1961 in the city's Narinda area. AL president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia issued separate messages to mark the day.
