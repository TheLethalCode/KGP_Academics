<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League asked the Election Commission to allot 'boat' as the election symbol for all its allies. Office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan said they had submitted an application to the EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir on Thursday to allow the AL and its election partners to contest the polls using the same 'boat' symbol that has traditionally been known as AL's party symbol. "The Awami League has requested the Election Commission to allow any or all of the AL's election allies to use the election symbol of 'boat' through the ninth [parliamentary] polls to be held on December 18," said the office secretary. "A top-level AL delegation had earlier discussed the matter with the Election Commission and the letter submitted Thursday was a follow-up to that. We've also urged the government not to shift the election dates in any case." An eight-member team of AL representatives met with the EC on Nov. 5, Khan said. Replying to a query, he said, "The contestants aspiring to run the elections are frantically looking for printouts or CDs of the voter lists for their constituencies. Therefore, the Election Commission secretary has been requested to make such lists available in the constituencies." "[He] told the AL delegates that nomination papers must clearly mention in case any candidate desires to use the 'boat' symbol in the elections along with AL's official consent or 'no objection' in this regard," Khan said. The AL delegates included deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haque, assistant secretaries Subhash Sinha Roy and Riazul Kabir Kaiser. bdnews
