 NAGPUR, India, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India sealed their first test series victory over Australia in seven years on Monday after Amit Mishra and Harbhajan Singh spun the hosts to a resounding 172-run win in the fourth and final test. Leg-spinner Mishra and off-spinner Harbhajan shared seven wickets to bowl out Australia for 209 in their second innings with almost a session to spare on the last day, wrapping up the four-match series 2-0. Fast bowler Ishant Sharma provided the early breakthrough with the dismissals of first-innings centurion Simon Katich (16) and Michael Clarke (22) after India had set the tourists an imposing target of 382 for a series-squaring victory. India last beat Australia at home in 2001 and drew one of three subsequent series. This was Australia's first series defeat since the 2005 Ashes tour of England. Harbhajan took four wickets and Mishra three, as well as running out Ricky Ponting, as the tourists dramatically lost their last seven wickets for 59 runs. Matthew Hayden had given Australia hope by scoring 77 at a healthy rate but he fell to Harbhajan lbw after Mishra had Michael Hussey (19) caught by Rahul Dravid at slip to trigger the collapse. PICK AND THROW Hayden had put on 45 for the third wicket with Clarke and 68 for the next with Hussey to force India onto the defensive before Harbhajan struck to regain control of the match. India stuck to their successful first innings ploy of bowling accurately to a packed off-side field in the first hour to frustrate the visitors. The tactic paid dividends when Katich top-edged Sharma and was caught behind by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Ponting, who edged pacer Zaheer Khan dangerously to slip early, took off late after playing the left-armer to mid-off where Mishra brought off a remarkable pick and throw on the run. Clarke, playing with a runner, hit a couple of streaky boundaries off Zaheer before Sharma dismissed him caught behind for the second time in the match pushing tentatively at the ball. Harbhajan had all-rounder Shane Watson caught behind for nine and Brett Lee (0) caught at short-leg after Mishra had Jason Krejza stumped for four. Australia spinner Krejza, who took 12 wickets in his debut test, was named man of the match and Sharma the man of the series
