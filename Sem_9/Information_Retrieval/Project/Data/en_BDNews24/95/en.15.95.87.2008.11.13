<TITLE> Japan to offer funding for IMF as gloom deepens </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong/Tokyo, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan will offer up to $100 billion to the International Monetary Fund for emerging economies in a new effort to come to grips with the fast-moving financial crisis that threatens to tip the world into a deep and long recession. Markets tumbled anyway in Asia, spooked by worries that massive capital injections and emergency regulatory measures have failed to halt a freefall in markets and damage to the real economy. Washington, which hosts a meeting of the G20 leaders at the weekend on the crisis, backed away on Wednesday from using a $700 billion bailout fund to cleanse bank balance sheets of bad mortgage debt. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he preferred instead to focus on buying stakes in banks to encourage them to increase lending. Bank of Japan policy board member Seiji Nakamura warned of difficult times ahead, saying Japan may be on the brink of a drawn-out adjustment phase as the global financial crisis could slow the world economy. "Japanese banks' lending attitude is turning cautious due to concern over the economy and the earnings outlook, suggesting a change in easy monetary conditions," Nakamura said in a speech. Japan reported a sharp drop-off in wholesale inflation for October, with slowing demand for goods spurring fear that deflation stalks a global economy that as recently as mid-year was menaced by surging prices. China, which unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package over the weekend, was also increasingly showing the ill effects of a global slowdown, with annual industrial output growth slumping to 8.2 percent in October, its weakest showing since October 2001. "It's a horrible-looking figure. It's a shock figure," said Ben Simpfendorfer, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. Mizuho Financial Group was considering raising $3.2 billion to shore up its capital, according to a media report, in the latest sign that Japan's huge banks may have avoided big subprime losses but can't hide from the weaker overall economy and heavy exposure to stocks. Markets in Asia were broadly lower on Thursday following a Wall Street sell-off that sent the Nasdaq to a 5-year low. Tokyo shares were off by 5.5 percent and stocks elsewhere in the region lost 6 percent. The price of oil fell to a 22-month low at $55 a barrel on worries that a recession will curb demand. In a bid to bolster stocks, Australia moved to impose a permanent ban on so-called naked short-selling, the practice whereby hedge funds sell shares they neither own nor have borrowed in the hope of quickly buying them back at a discount. Japan was prepared to offer foreign reserves worth up to $100 billion to the IMF if the Washington-based lender needs extra funds to help emerging economies, a government source said on Thursday. Prime Minister Taro Aso will make the proposal at the global financial summit of 20 industrialized and emerging nations starting Friday night in Washington, the source told Reuters, confirming a media report. "Investors are now looking to the G20 Summit this weekend, with hopes of some further policy action," Patrick Bennett, Asia FX and rates strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note. PAULSON DEFENDS CHANGE In Washington, Paulson defended a change in plans for the bailout package. "I will never apologize for changing an approach or strategy when the facts change." Paulson's announcement drew criticism and added to worries stoked by dismal employment data from Britain and a World Bank warning Tuesday that global trade may contract in 2009. "It is shocking to see the U.S. government deciding not to use any of the $700 billion on buying mortgage-related assets," Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at CFC Seymour in Hong Kong, said in a morning note. "Declining house prices and falling values of mortgage-related securities are the primary reason for the current crisis, and abandonment of attempts to tackle these problems head-on will prolong the recession," he wrote. The combination of tight credit conditions and a global downturn has set off what economists say has become the worst financial and economic crisis in 80 years and left investors bracing for more interest rate cuts. The crisis also continued to take a toll on companies, with top U.S. electronics retailer Best Buy reporting it had cut its full-year growth outlook, boosting fear about the impact of slower consumer spending on the U.S. economy. Paulson said that nonfinancial firms as well as banks may need more cash infusions but that he saw "implementation difficulties" aiding companies not federally regulated.
