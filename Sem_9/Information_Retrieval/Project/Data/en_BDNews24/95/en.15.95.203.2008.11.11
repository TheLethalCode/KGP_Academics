 Washington, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin suggested in an interview broadcast on Monday that she might run for higher office in 2012 if the right opportunity presents itself. Even before the Republican loss in last Tuesday's election in which Palin was the running mate of Republican presidential candidate John McCain, there was talk of the 44-year-old first-term Alaska governor running for president in 2012. "Show me where the open door is. Even if it's cracked up a little bit, maybe I'll plow right on through that and maybe prematurely plow through it, but don't let me miss an open door," Palin said in an interview on Fox News' "On The Record" program. She did not specify which office she might be interested in seeking. Palin, whose term as governor ends in two years, said she could not predict the future. But she said it would be "very exciting" to have an opportunity to serve in a greater capacity. "If there is an open door in '12 or four years later, and if it is something that is going to be good for my family, for my state, for my nation, an opportunity for me, then I'll plow through that door," Palin said. As McCain's surprise pick in a hard-fought campaign against Democrat Barack Obama, Palin attracted controversy but also a strong following in the Republican Party's conservative base.
