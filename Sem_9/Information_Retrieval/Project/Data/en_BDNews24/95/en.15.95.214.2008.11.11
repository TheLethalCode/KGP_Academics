 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The much-awaited election of the Bangladesh Cricket Board will be held on Wednesday at the National Sports Council with 23 directors to be elected in three categories. In line with the new constitution, the 23 directors will be split in three categories  Category A comprising the District and Divisional councilors, Category B filled with only Dhaka Clubs' councillors, and Category C consisting of former cricketers, educational boards, universities, cricket welfare association etc. The board president will be nominated by the government while a director will be chosen by the National Sports council, country's highest sports body. Of the then 31-member elected committee, some 17 members including general secretary Mahbub Anam on July 24 last year resigned apparently under pressure from the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led government which had vowed to purge the country's wealthiest sporting body of politicisation. Later, the NSC appointed a 10-member ad-hoc committee to run the most affluent sports federation and it remained in power for 15 months and drafted a new constitution that was passed at an extra-ordinary meeting last month. In the election, two panels Mahbub Anam-led cricket development parisad and Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby-led combined parisad  are apparently set to fight for 23 posts, though initially some steps were taken to form a consensus committee. A total of 18 candidates will compete for 10 director posts from Category A  two each from Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna divisions and one each from Barisal and Sylhet divisions  with some 69 coucillors casting their votes. All six divisional sports associations had earlier selected their respective candidates, but later rival aspirants submitted their nominations to challenge those 10 nominated candidates. As many as 24 candidates will contest for Category B-listed 12 posts with 52 councillors from clubs choosing their directors. In Category C, four candidates  former national captains ASM Roqibul Hassan, Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu and Faruque Ahmed and Abdul Qayyum Chowdhury from Sylhet  will vie the lone post as some 47 councillors will cast their votes. bd
