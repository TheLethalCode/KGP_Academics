<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  AKTEL, one of the country's leading mobile phone operators, is planning to launch new "high-tech products" for customers with their new Japanese shareholder NTT DoCoMo on board. CEO and managing director of AKTEL, Jefri Ahmed Tambi told benews24.com Saturday: "With DoCoMo the company will bring a new dimension to the telecoms trade." Japan's largest wireless operator paid $350 million earlier this year to buy AK Khan & Co's 30 percent stake in mobile-phone carrier TM International (Bangladesh) that operates AKTEL DoCoMo will sit in its first board meeting with TM International next month. Tambi, speaking after a press conference to mark the telco's 11th year in operation, said: "We are planning to launch innovative high-tech products at the eleventh anniversary celebrations taking place in coming weeks." "We are going to offer customers simplicity, affordability, quality and flexibility. We want to take things forward," he added. Chief commercial officer Bidyut Kumar Basu said: "We provide innovative and useful products and services to cater to our customers' demands." "Over the last 11 years AKTEL introduced PSTN incoming on mobiles, prepaid standard connection, accidental death insurance, 10 second pulse on prepaid and 1 second pulse on post paid and easy load  all firsts in Bangladesh." AKTEL's partnership with NTT DoCoMo to make it a multinational operator would boost its strengths in serviceability and technology and strengthen its bond with its customers, he hoped. Questioned by reporters about the decline in AKTEL's customer baseline, CEO Tambi said the "strategy of profit rather than customers" in the past had been partly to blame. bdnews
