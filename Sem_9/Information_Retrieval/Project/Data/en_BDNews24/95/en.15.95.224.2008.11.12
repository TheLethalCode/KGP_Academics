 LA PAZ, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivian champions Aurora have apologised after their players were involved in a brawl with riot police during a game on Sunday in which their goalkeeper Silvio Dulcich used a corner flag as weapon. "We have presented a public apology to the commander-in-chief for the attitude of our players," the club's general manager Manuel Perez said in an interview with the daily newspaper La Razon on Tuesday. The fight broke out during the derby against local rivals Wilstermann in Cochabamba when police tried to hurry Aurora's Eduardo Zenteno from the field after he had been sent off. Aurora players aimed karate kicks at the police who responded by using pepper spray. Aurora won the match 1-0. Bolivia suffered more violence on Monday night when the Oriente Petrolero-Blooming derby in Santa Cruz was held up for eight minutes by a brawl sparked by a player imitating a chicken during a goal celebration. Oriente forward Marcelo Aguirre flapped his arms after converting a penalty to put Oriente 3-1 up, leading to a fight involving players, officials and police. Aguirre was sent off along with Blooming goalkeeper Jose Fernandez and coach Gustavo Quinteros. Blooming fought back to draw 3-3
