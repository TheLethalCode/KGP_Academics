 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivian champions Aurora fought with riot police during a game on Sunday with their goalkeeper using a corner flag as a weapon. Cerro Porteno beat arch-rivals Olimpia 3-1 in a fiery meeting of Paraguay's biggest clubs in which two players, both coaches and a ball boy were sent off. BOLIVIA Aurora beat local rivals Wilstermann 1-0 in a Cochabamba derby which ended in uproar after the winners had Eduardo Zenteno sent off late in the game. Centeno dallied over leaving the field and around one dozen police came on to hurry him up. Other Aurora players leapt to Centeno's defence and aimed karate kicks at the police, who responded by using pepper spray. At one point, Aurura goalkeeper Silvio Dulcich picked up a corner flag to use as a weapon against the officials. The referee appeared to abandon the game at one stage but changed his mind after Wilstermann protested. Dulcich was sent off, the game was re-started and Aurora held on for a win. The match was part of an end-of-season tournament to decide Bolivia's final representatives in next year's Libertadores Cup, Aurora won the Clausura tournament, their first major title, last week. PARAGUAY Olimpia had two players sent off before halftime as they lost a stormy derby 3-1 to bitter rivals Cerro Porteno. Cesar Ramirez gave Cerro a fourth-minute lead and tempers flared when Marco Lazaga equalised just after the half hour and appeared to provoke the Cerro bench with his celebration. The incident sparked a brawl involving players and officials from both sides, which held up play for seven minutes and ended with Olimpia coach Ever Almeida and his Cerro counterpart Pedro Troglio being sent off along with several other members of the respective benches. Olimpia then had Edison Gimenez and Lazaga sent off in quick succession, both for second yellow cards. Paraguayan media said a ball boy was also sent off in the second half and another fight broke out in the players' tunnel after the game. Second half goals from Erwin Avalos and Celso Ortiz gave Cerro their sixth win in eight meetings against their old rivals. Sol de America, who beat Silvio Pettirossi 3-1, lead the Apertura championship on goal difference from Libertad, who were held 2-2 by 12 de Octubre. COLOMBIA Defending champions Boyaca Chico missed out on the last eight of the Clausura championship when they lost 1-0 at home to Atletico Nacional, Luis Alberto Perea scoring the only goal. Chico are six points behind eighth-placed La Equidad with one match to play. Leaders Tolima, who won 1-0 at Envigado, and second-placed Medellin, who beat La Equidad 2-1, have already qualified. ECUADOR Deportivo Quito stayed three points clear of Barcelona in the championship's final stage after the two sides drew 1-1. Pablo Palacios gave Barcelona an eighth-minute lead with his 16th goal of the competition and Martin Andrizzi equalised early in the second half when his attempted cross flew into the net. Quito have 13 points from five gamesincluding three bonus points carried through from earlier stages of the tournamentin the six-team table. El Nacional joined Barcelona on 10 points after beating Macara 1-0. URUGUAY Danubio beat defending champions Defensor Sporting 1-0 despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after Javier Delgado was sent off in the 45th minute. Matias Perez scored in the 76th minute to keep Danubio second in the championship's first stage, one point behind leaders Nacional who beat Rampla Juniors 2-0 with first-half goals from Oscar Morales and Alexander Medina. PERU Sport Boys, one of the country's most popular clubs, were condemned to relegation after losing 3-1 at Melgar. The defeat completed a miserable year for the Callao-based team, who have been beset by financial problems with players complaining they have not been paid for five months. Deportivo San Martin, leaders of the championship's second stage, stayed six points clear with a 1-0 win over struggling Alianza Lima, who had Henry Quinteros sent off after only 10 minutes for a foul on Pedro Garcia. Ronald Quinteros scored San Martin's winner early in the second half. CHILE Universidad Catolica sneaked into the Clausura championship quarter-finals with a 2-0 win at Nublense on the final day of the qualifying stage. Catolica finished second in Group Two after overtaking La Serena, who lost 3-2 at Santiago Morning. Universidad de Chile, Colo Colo, Rangers, Palestino, O'Higgins and Huachipato also qualified while Cobreloa and defending champions Everton will take part in a playoff to decide the final spot under the tournament's complex rules
