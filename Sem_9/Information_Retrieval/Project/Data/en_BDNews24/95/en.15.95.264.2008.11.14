<TITLE> It's only 1-0, Pietersen reminds battered England </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RAJKOT, India, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Kevin Pietersen took his hat off to India's batsmen after they had demolished England's bowling on Friday before reminding his beaten team that there were still six matches in the one-day series to go. Yuvraj Singh (138 not out) struck the second fastest one-day century by an Indian as the hosts posted a massive 387 for five before England folded for 229 in the first one-day international. "One game down, yes we are 1-nil down," Pietersen told a news conference. "But there's still six games left in the series and we are going to have to be mentally strong to try and come back in to hit India hard on Monday at Indore. "There is always concern when you lose. You just have to bounce back, the boys are pretty tight as a unit and I want the guys to get back and fire on all cylinders on Monday." Opener Virender Sehwag made a dashing 85 and set the pace with a 127-run opening wicket stand with Gautam Gambhir (51) before Yuvraj's blitz. "When you get Yuvraj Singh playing like that, Gambhir and Sehwag starting the innings off like that, I mean, you are behind it," said Pietersen, who top-scored with 63 in his team's total. "After 30-40 overs, then Yuvraj spends 10 overs slogging to all parts. He batted absolutely, fantastically well. "There is a lot more positives to talk about theirs, and ours we just have to look at stuff, speak about it and then hopefully get things right from Monday." England's poor batting form continued following the Stanford Twenty20 Challenge humiliation in the Caribbean where they were bowled out for 99, but Pietersen did not want to blame the defeat on the team's preparation. "We are not going to moan, not going to complain, we are not going to cry about it. We are going to keep our heads up, chins up, and make sure that we give it a good go on Monday because there are six games left." Pietersen stood by his decision to bowl first on a batting pitch. "I was speaking to (India captain Mahendra Singh) Dhoni after the game and we said that probably if anything was to happen it would have happened the first thing this morning. Unfortunately it only happened for three balls.
