<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Saturday rejected an adviser's statement about a "free election environment" as misleading. "Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman is misguiding the people," Delwar told reporters after a meeting of the four-party alliance at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. Delwar also reiterated BNP's seven-point charter of demands previously submitted to the government. Hossain Zillur had said earlier in the day that the national elections would be held in "a free environment", hinting at an environment free of the state of emergency. "The government will consider fully lifting the state of emergency (in phases) if the election environment develops smoothly," he told reporters at a press briefing at the Chief Adviser's Office. "If the government accepts the demands why is it not implementing them?" was Delwar's immediate reaction to the adviser's statement. He later told reporters in Gulshan: "Not one demand among the seven-point charter has yet to be implemented." "We want to go to polls. The alliance will give its announcement as soon as the government meets our demands." Regarding the adviser's statement about lifting of emergency "in phases", Delwar said: "It will not be acceptable if the emergency starts to be lifted by phases after submission of nomination papers." "We have many eligible candidates in jail. The emergency has been put in place to debar them from elections." Criticising the commerce adviser, he said: "He is leading people astray with his words." "The government is showing its generosity to a particular party, but it is showing a discriminatory attitude to us. It is not a sign of a neutral government." Delwar, warning the government, said: "Don't create an atmosphere in which the four party alliance will not be able to participate." "People will not accept that. We want an elected government and a parliament. For that, we want to go to polls." Delwar was speaking to reporters after a four-party meeting attended by BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, acting secretary general of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami M Quamruzzaman and Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Barrister Andalib Rahman, among others. bdnews24.com/sm/
