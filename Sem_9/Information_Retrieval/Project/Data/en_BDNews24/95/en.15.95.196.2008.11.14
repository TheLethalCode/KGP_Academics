<TITLE> Ex-PMs talks depend on BNP's polls decision: lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  Barrister Rafiqul Huq, lawyer for BNP chief Khaleda Zia and her Awami League counterpart Sheikh Hasina, has said the much-speculated talks between them will depend on Khaleda's election announcement. "If Khaleda doesn't make an announcement on the election how can Hasina sit for talks?" he asked. "If they do not sit together they will invite disaster for themselves, and for us too," barrister Huq said to reporters at an anniversary event of bdnews24.com at Radisson Water Garden Hotel on Thursday. He said the situation would calm down if the two leaders talked to each other. "Awami League now says the government must give the agenda for talks." The lawyer feared that since Khaleda had not yet enrolled as a voter and "was not ready for the election" the situation could turn worse. He also said, "I myself have been trying to get the two former prime ministers to the table for talks, so has the government." If they meet and talk the country will pull through an uneasy situation, Rafiq hoped. bdnews24.
