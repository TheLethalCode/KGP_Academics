 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain has said that his party will go to elections if the government starts implementing their seven-point demands. "If the government accepts the demands why is it not implementing them?" the BNP leader said Saturday in a reaction to a statement by commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Hinting the national election would be held in an environment free of the state of emergency, the adviser said earlier in the day: "The government will consider fully lifting the state of emergency if the election environment develops smoothly." With BNP continuing to press its demand for a total withdrawal of emergency as a condition to joining the election, and Awami League declaring it is "all set" for parliamentary polls on Dec 18, the adviser's statement signals continued attempts to smooth an accord with the two major parties. Delwar said: "We want the implementation of all our demands. Then we will go to elections." Reiterating the demand for full withdrawal of the state of emergency, the BNP leader said: "The state of emergency should be lifted for the sake of a proper election." "The voters will not be able to cast their ballots independently and uninterruptedly under emergency." "BNP is a pro-polls party and the party has gone to power through people's votes," Delwar pointed out. "We have placed the seven-point demands in order to go to elections," he added. The seven-point charter of demands include: withdrawal of the state of emergency, deferring the upazila elections, cancellation of the amended People Representation Ordinance (RPO), rescinding the redrawing of constituencies, cancelling all 'false' cases against Khaleda Zia, release of all detained BNP leaders and workers and creating an environment 'conducive to elections'. bdnews24
