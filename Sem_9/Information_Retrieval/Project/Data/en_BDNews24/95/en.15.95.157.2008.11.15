<TITLE> Beaten Federer says he and Nadal still the main men </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SHANGHAI, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer said he and Rafael Nadal were still the main men in world tennis even though the Swiss lost to Andy Murray for the third time this year at the Masters Cup on Friday. The defending champion, who was suffering the effects of a back injury and a stomach bug, lost his final group match 4-6 7-6 7-5 in a titanic three-hour encounter with Murray that ended Federer's hopes of a record-equalling fifth Masters Cup title. Murray's victory made the Briton only the third player to beat Federer three times in one season after Argentine David Nalbandian and Spain's world number one Nadal, who has done it twice. Despite the 21-year-old Scot now holding a 4-2 advantage in their career head-to-head, world number two Federer said his main rival would continue to be Nadal, absent this week because of injury. "At the moment it's Rafa and myself," said the Swiss, who beat Murray in the U.S. Open final. "I really still feel it's that way because  we've played big events on so many occasions. I mean, we still have to play a few more grand slam finals. If that's the case, I'm very happy from my side." Federer told reporters he was happy just to have come close to reaching the semi-finals this week given his physical condition coming into the season finale. "Of course I'm disappointed. I wish I could have played the matches I played here under better circumstances," said the 27-year-old, who also lost his opening match to Gilles Simon of France. VERY HAPPY "But I tried. I almost made a miracle happen. I can't believe how close I got, to be honest. So I'm actually very happy." Federer said his back had stood up quite well but compensating for it had taken its toll. "I play four hours in slams, it's not a problem," said the 13-times grand slam winner. "Here I play two hours, in the morning I can hardly wake up. On top of that, I got sick. All those things just made it really difficult this week." Federer made 64 unforced errors in the match, the result, he said, of his physical condition weakening his serve and dictating his approach. "When you play on the offensive it's you who decide how you move, where you put the ball," he said. "When you're on the defensive this is where you can't control what you're going to do. "Obviously you always have to pick the offensive game plan. That then has a lot to do with a lot of errors. Sometimes you look like an idiot but you don't have an option sometimes.
