<TITLE> BNP bent on 7 points, not mock election: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Any "mock election" without BNP will fetch grave consequences, warned the party's secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Tuesday. "We will join the elections only after our seven-point charter of demands are met and any election without BNP will bring about ominous consequences," Delwar said at a 'Solidarity Day' discussion at the National Press Club. "People won't accept a mock election," he said, maintaining that an equal opportunity for all parties was not being created. The BNP leader pointed his finger at "a party", which the government was trying to put in power, he alleged. He called upon the authorities to reinstate 'Solidarity Day' on Nov 7 as an official holiday along with May 30 to mark former president Ziaur Rahman's death anniversary. The discussion was organised by Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal and attended by former energy adviser Mahmudur Rahman, BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, and Jubo Dal and Mohila Dal leaders among others. bdnew
