 MUMBAI, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England seam bowler Ryan Sidebottom has been ruled out of Friday's opening one-day international against India at Rajkot with an Achilles injury, a team spokesman said on Wednesday. India fast bowler Ishant Sharma will also miss the match after picking up an ankle injury during the test series against Australia, the Indian board said in a statement. Sidebottom is yet to recover from the Achilles problem that has dogged him since the start of the Stanford Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean last month. The tourists also have concerns over fast bowler Stuart Broad who missed Tuesday's warm-up match with a sore knee after suffering the problem in the first warm-up game on Sunday where he bowled only four overs. England team spokesman Andrew Walpole said the swelling in Broad's knee had been injected and was being monitored closely. "At the moment we are hopeful that he'll be fit for the first match," he said. "The plan for him is to bowl at nets tomorrow morning and see if there is any reaction to it." India will miss Sharma, who took 15 wickets in their 2-0 test series victory over Australia and was adjudged man of the series. "Ishant Sharma has got a mild ankle sprain and he has been advised to rest for five days," the Indian board said in a statement. "He is undergoing his rehabilitation at present and is making good progress. Hence he would not be available for the first ODI against England.
