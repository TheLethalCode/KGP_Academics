 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Monday the withdrawal of Daewoo's oil rig and Myanmar vessels from the disputed waters of the Bay was a "win-win" result for both countries. "This happy conclusion in the Bay has been a win-win situation for both Bangladesh and Myanmar," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com Monday. "Peace leads to benefits for everyone". The adviser said Bangladesh had always wanted maintain close neighbourly ties with Myanmar. "We want very friendly relations with Myanmar and our policy will be directed towards that end," said the foreign adviser. Bangladesh and its southeastern neighbour came to an impasse over Yangon's unilateral decision to carry out oil and gas exploration activities in an area which both countries claim as their maritime territory. To counter the move by South Korean industrial giant Daewoo and Myanmar vessels, Bangladesh sent a navy patrol to the disputed waters, some 60 nautical miles south of Saint Martin's Island in the Bay of Bengal,. At previous maritime border talks, the two countries had agreed that neither would go for exploration until their mutual sea boundaries were demarcated. Bangladesh's diplomatic efforts caused Daewoo to withdraw its rig from the area on Sunday. Myanmar vessels also left the waters. bdn
