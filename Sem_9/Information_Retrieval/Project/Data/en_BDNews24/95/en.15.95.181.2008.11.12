 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday granted a two-month bail to former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Matiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed in the Barapukuria coalmine graft case. It also ordered suspension of the trial of the case during the bail period. Senior BNP leader Saifur Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed were sent to jail after they surrendered to the trial court on Nov. 10. The High Court also asked the government tom explain why the case should not be dismissed. "The High Court granted bail to Saifur Rahman on medical grounds," Saifur's lawyer barrister Rafiqul Islam Mia told bdnews24.com after the ruling. "The case cannot run as there aren't any substantial allegations against Saifur who is also critically ill." Barrister Abdur Razzaque pleaded for the jailed Jamaat leaders. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against 16 persons including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 10 of her cabinet members on Feb. 26 this year. The charge-sheet in the case was submitted to court on Oct. 5. The case stated that due to the production, management and maintenance deal of the Barapukuria coal mine with the Chinese organisation, Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export, the government incurred losses worth Tk 158.71 crore. bdnews24.c
