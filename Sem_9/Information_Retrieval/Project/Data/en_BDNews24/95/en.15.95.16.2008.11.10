<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks and commodity prices climbed on Monday after China unveiled a nearly $600 billion economic stimulus plan, one of many steps countries are taking to limit the economic fallout from the financial crisis. Japanese government bonds and U.S. Treasuries retreated as funds flowed back into riskier assets on hopes for stimulus measures by other major economies, with U.S. President-elect Barack Obama pushing for urgent passage of more fiscal spending in the world's largest economy. The positive tone seen in Asian equity markets was expected to spill over into Europe, with European shares set to rise 3 percent or more, according to financial bookmakers. The yen fell as investors embraced the high-yielding Australian dollar after China's announcement and as financial officials from the Group of 20 economic powers, which include major developing countries, ironed out ways to stimulate growth at a weekend meeting. Glenn Maguire, Asia chief economist at Societe Generale, said interest rate cuts, bigger government spending globally and a likely recovery in corporate investment next year should sow the seeds for an economic rebound. "Economic activity can only accelerate. Beware of the doom merchants," Maguire said. The damage inflicted by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was highlighted by data on Friday showing the U.S. jobless rate hitting a 14-year high and Japanese data on Monday showing machinery orders suffered the biggest quarterly fall in a decade. Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 rose 5.8 percent as market players covered short positions and as hopes for a pick-up in demand from China boosted shares of machinery makers such as Komatsu Ltd (6301.T: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz). The Shanghai Composite .SSEC index jumped 5.5 percent, helping lift the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside of Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS 2.5 percent. Equity strategists at Citigroup said in a report that this year's outflows from Asia ex-Japan shares already total $20.2 billion, or 37 percent of the money that flowed in between 2003 to 2007 -- a similar percentage to the amount withdrawn during the 1997-98 Asia crisis. "If current outflows are no worse than the one in 1997/98, we should see redemptions close to an end," they said. South Korea's KOSPI index .KS11 rose 1.6 percent after initially struggling to hold gains as Hyundai Motor (005380.KS: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) fell on worries about the impact of any U.S. support for its hard-hit automakers. Taiwan's benchmark TAIEX .TWII was flat, struggling even after the country's central bank delivered a surprise interest rate cut at the weekend, the fourth reduction in a little more than a month to shield the export-dependent economy. STIMULUS ABOUNDS Economists at Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that Obama's sweeping election last week meant that another U.S. stimulus package would top its initial estimate of $200 billion. The dollar gained 0.7 percent to 98.94 yen, holding off a 13-year low near 91 yen stuck last month during the height of the turmoil in global markets. Financial markets have gradually started to settle down from October's historic sell-off when many investors rushed to raise cash, hedge funds confronted big redemptions and portfolio managers grappled with the deteriorating economic outlook. The Australian dollar, a bellwether of carry trades where the low-yielding yen is used as a cheap source of funds to buy higher-yielding currencies, rose 2.1 percent to $0.6860. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 .ASJO was up 1.4 percent, led by shares of top miners BHP Billiton (BHP.AX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Rio Tinto (RIO.AX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), even as the country's central bank cut its growth forecast. London-traded copper futures jumped nearly 8 percent to $4,040. U.S. crude oil prices rose $2.39 a barrel to $63.43, rebounding from a 1-1/2-year low hit on Friday below $60. Japanese government bonds dipped, with the benchmark 10-year JGB yield up 2 basis points to 1.530 percent. U.S. Treasuries fell on the gains in stocks and as dealers prepared to absorb a whopping $55 billion in new supply during the regular quarterly refunding auctions. Treasury futures lost 16/32 in price to 114-18/32 as S&P 500 futures were up 15 points, or 1.6 percent, in electronic trade, pointing to further gains on Wall Street later in the day. bdn
