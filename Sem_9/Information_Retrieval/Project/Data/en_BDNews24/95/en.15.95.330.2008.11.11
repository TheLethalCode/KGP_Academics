 Chittagong, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has again expressed indignation at not being allowed to return to office. "I am the elected mayor of Chittagong City Corporation," he said, speaking at a function to mark the 36th founding anniversary of Jubo League Tuesday. "I am being stopped through conspiracy from discharging my responsibility," Mohiuddin claimed. "By not allowing me to take up my duties, the constitutional rights of the citizens of the city corporation are being hampered," he said. Chittagong City Jubo League organised the function at the Muslim Institute in the city, also bringing out a procession. Mohiuddinsaid at a separate function Tuesday that "new leadership should come forward to take the reigns of the party". Causing some controversy, Chittagong Awami League has nominated the mayor to run the general elections from three out of the four city constituencies along with several other nominees. Mohiuddin, also city AL president, announcing the nominees on Sunday revealed that the grassroots leaders had nominated him as the first candidate from each of three electorates. bdnew
