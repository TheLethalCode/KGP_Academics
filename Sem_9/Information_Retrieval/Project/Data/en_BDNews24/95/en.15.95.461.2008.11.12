 LONDON, Wed Nov 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More international troops are needed in the south of Afghanistan, the country's foreign minister said on Wednesday, and they must be ready to engage in active fighting against insurgents. Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta, who is visiting Britain this week with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, said international efforts to train the Afghan military to handle security by itself remained vital for the long-term, but in the meantime more foreign fighting troops were needed. "For the short-term strategy ... we need more forces in the south, and the south east ... to control cross-border terrorist activities," Spanta told BBC radio. "But these troops have to be fighter troops, to be active in this part, to respond to terrorist activities." US President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to send more troops to Afghanistan, where the United States already has more than 30,000 military personnel and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has not ruled out sending more troops to add to the 8,000 British soldiers already serving there. But Brown stressed on Tuesday that NATO allies should do more to share the burden. Despite the presence of some 71,000 foreign troops and more than 130,000 in Afghan security forces, Afghanistan's Taliban, who were driven from power by U.S.-led forces after the Sept. 11 2001 attacks, have extended the scale and scope of their insurgency. This year has been the bloodiest so far in Afghanistan with 2,500 people killed in the first six months alone, 1,000 of them civilians. Western diplomats admit there is no purely military solution to the conflict, a view echoed by Spanta. "The military option is not the only option -- but it is still, in the south part of Afghanistan, the relevant option to fight terrorism," he said. He added it was vital "to destroy the sanctuaries of terrorists and cross-border terrorist activities in this part of the world". "The problem of terrorism is not only a national problem ... it is mainly a regional problem affecting Afghanistan's security, the security of Pakistan and of this part of the world.
