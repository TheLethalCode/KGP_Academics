<TITLE> Russian MPs support longer presidency </TITLE>

 MOSCOW, Fri Nov 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly on Friday during a first reading to support President Dmitry Medvedev's plan to extend the presidency to six years from four years. Medvedev's initiative to extend the term of the presidency has been interpreted by many analysts as part of a legal loophole for powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who stepped down as president in May, to make a comeback. The chamber, dominated by the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, also voted to extend its own term to five years from four years. Both amendments were backed by 388 deputies of the 450-seat house. The amendments need to pass through two more readings to change the constitution. To be cemented into the constitution, the changes need to voted for by two thirds of State Duma deputies and three quarters of the upper Federation Council house. Putin said earlier this week he backed a longer term for the next president but said it was too early to say who that might be. The Kremlin said the constitutional change will not apply to the term Medvedev is serving now
