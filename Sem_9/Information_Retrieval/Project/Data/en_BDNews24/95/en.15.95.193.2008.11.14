 GAZA, Fri Nov 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli military aircraft fired a missile at gunmen in the Gaza Strip on Friday, wounding two of them, after a rocket and a mortar were fired at Israel, Palestinian medical workers said. An Israeli military spokesman confirmed there had been an air strike after the firing from Gaza at Israel on Friday. There were no reported casualties from the Palestinian fire at Israel. Medics in Gaza said they evacuated two gunmen to hospital after an Israeli air strike in northern Gaza, where gunmen often shoot rockets at Israel. Rocket attacks from Gaza have increased since Israel stepped up raids against gunmen, killing 10 in two separate incidents since November 4, in a flare-up that threatens a 5-month-old truce along the Israeli-Gaza frontier. Israel has also shut border crossings with the coastal territory, blocking food and fuel supplies, and United Nations aid agencies said Thursday they were running out of food supplies for some 750,000 Palestinians
