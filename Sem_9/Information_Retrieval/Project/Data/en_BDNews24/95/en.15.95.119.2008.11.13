Referring to rumours that the arch-rival BNP might boycott the election, she asked, "Won't the election take place on schedule? If the election is not held, then what sort of government will assume power?" "Some might have quite a good number of ambitions, but the people of the country will not allow anything but elections," the former prime minister said at the rally at Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in the city. Hasina, who went to the US for treatment a day after being freed on parole on June. 11, returned home on Nov. 6. She had been detained for nearly 11 months since her arrest on July 16 last year. She lauded the activities of the Jubo League during her detention. She promised a self-reliant, happy Bangladesh if the Awami League is voted to power. "We don't believe in the politics of confrontation. We don't want terrorism and militancy in the country."
