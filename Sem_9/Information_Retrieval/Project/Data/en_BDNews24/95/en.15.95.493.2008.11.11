<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)The secondary schools curriculum will be revised to build an efficient, hard-working nation with high moral values, education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Tuesday. "It's a demand of the times to make our education modern and practical and, to move along with the advancing world, there is not alternative to this," he said, speaking at a seminar on education at the BIAM auditorium Tuesday. He said a high powered taskforce will soon be formed to propose changes to the curriculum. The adviser also emphasised the importance of mathematics and science in the curriculum, and combining physical exercise with academic pursuits. The adviser expressed hope that these "pro-people reforms" would be carried on by future administrations. A report released Monday, meanwhile, found that a high level of disparity prevails in secondary education countrywide, which in turn is contributing to a growing rich-poor divide, say the authors. Based on the Education Watch Review 2007, the report titled 'Secondary Education: challenges in parity' highlights the rural, urban gap and poor management in madrasa schools. Tuesday's seminar, organised by the Secondary Education Sector Development Project (SESDP) of the education ministry, was chaired by acting director general of secondary and higher education, Prof Habibur Rahman Khan. Chairman of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board Prof Md Machhir Uddin, educationists Prof Moniruzzaman Miah, Prof Abdullah Abu Sayeed and Dr Hafiz GA Siddiqui and SESDP director Atiar Rahman also spoke. bdnews24
