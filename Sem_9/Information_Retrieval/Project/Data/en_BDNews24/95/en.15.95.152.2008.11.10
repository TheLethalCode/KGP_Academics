<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has directed the government to test samples of all brands of powdered milk on the shelves in the laboratories of Dhaka University, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission and BSTI, and submit the reports to the court. The court also directed the government to publish the reports in the media to enable the people to make an informed decision on buying powdered milk. The bench of justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and justice Kamrul Islam Siddiqui after hearing all sides Monday gave the order on an petition by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights organisation. The court ordered the health ministry to test for presence of melamine contamination in eight powdered milk brands, namely Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashli-1, Yashli-2, Sweet Baby, Nido and Enline, and submit reports to court in 21 days. The government has been ordered to collect samples from market in presence of representatives of the DU chemistry department, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute and the owners. The court, however, has withdrawn ban on sale of Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Nido and Enline pending the reports. The court asked the government to seek the opinion of UN's World Health Organization on whether the presence of melamine is harmful to health by the time and present it before the court. The court also ordered authorities to submit the report of tests on other brands as soon as possible. The court directed the government to publish the reports in the media so that people can make an informed decision about buying powdered milk. On Nov. 6, it summoned test reports on presence of melamine in the powdered milk brands and the government submitted the report to the High Court the next day. In the hearing barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud participated on behalf of Nestl, Advocate Mahmudul Islam for Diploma and Red Cow, and barrister Tania Amir for Dano. The counsels of the milk powder brands appealed for withdrawal of the court order that banned the sale of the brands. Advocate Manjil Morshed, representing the writ petitioner, appealed for fresh test on the milk powder brands. Deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil represented the state in the hearing. On Oct. 23, the High Court ordered the government to stop sale and display of eight milk powder brands  Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashili-1, Yashili-2, Sweet baby, Nido and Enlene  which had been sent to Thailand for test. The government on Sunday disclosed to the court that Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission had detected high concentration of melamine contamination in seven of the eight brands of powdered milk tested. The disclosure prompted the media and the consumers to raise questions about the government's sincerity about ensuring public health. It did not go public with the finds and sat on the test results for a week, instead. The interim administration on Nov. 3 declared that only Chinese brands Yashili 1, Yashili 2, and Sweet Baby-2 had tested positive for melamine in a Thai and two local laboratories. By the time, the government had the BAEC test results in hand but preferred not to undisclose them. The makers also did not pull the items from shop shelves neither was there any recalls, raising the fear that the toxic substance may be deeply entrenched in the food chain, especially in children. The amounts of melamine detected by BAEC are 175.2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) in Yashli-1, 172 mg/kg in Yashli-2, 330.4 mg/kg in Sweet Baby-2, 171.3 mg/kg in Nido Fortified Instant, 478.3 mg/kg in Enlene, 287.4 mg/kg in Diploma, and 7.4 mg/kg in Dano Full Cream Milk. However, BAEC did not detect any trace of melamine in Red Cow, which was found to be contaminated in the DU test. Melamine is rich in nitrogen, and relatively cheap. Adding it to watered-down milk makes their protein levels appear higher. Standard quality tests estimate protein levels by measuring nitrogen content. The melamine saga saw six infants die in China, and at the peak of the crisis in late September, up to 22,000 infants were in hospital on any given day, Chinese health officials say, according to Reuters. More than 99 percent of the sick are under 3 years old. Infants who depend solely on milk are most vulnerable. So, what are the long-term health effects? Little scientific information exists about the compound's effects on humans. Melamine can cause kidney stones and the chemical can crystallise in small kidney tubes resulting in kidney damage or even renal failure, health experts say. bdne
