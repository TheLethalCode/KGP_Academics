 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) Voting in the long-awaited election of 23 directors in three categories to Bangladesh Cricket Board closed Wednesday at National Sports Council. The voting began at around 10am and ended at 3pm. bdnews24.com sports correspondent Anisur Rahman reports from the venue that vote counting is underway. In line with the new constitution, the 23 directors will be split in three categories  category A comprising the district and divisional councilors, category B filled with only Dhaka clubs' councillors, and category C consisting of former cricketers, educational boards, universities and cricket welfare association. The board president will be nominated by the government while a director will be chosen by National Sports council, the country's highest sports body. Of the then 31-member elected committee, some 17 members including general secretary Mahbub Anam on July 24 last year resigned apparently under pressure from the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led government which had vowed to purge the country's wealthiest sporting body of politicisation. Later, the NSC appointed a 10-member ad-hoc committee to run the most affluent sports federation. It remained in power for 15 months and drafted a new constitution that was passed at an extra-ordinary meeting last month. In the election, two panels Mahbub Anam-led Cricket Development Parisad and Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby-led Combined Parisad  are apparently set to battle it out for 23 posts, though initially some steps were taken to form a consensus committee. As many as 18 candidates will compete for 10 director posts from Category A  two each from Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna divisions and one each from Barisal and Sylhet divisions  with some 69 coucillors casting their votes. All six divisional sports associations had earlier selected their respective candidates, but later rival aspirants submitted their nominations to challenge those 10 nominated candidates. As many as 24 candidates will contest for Category B-listed 12 posts with 52 councillors from clubs choosing their directors. In Category C, four candidates  former national captains ASM Roqibul Hassan, Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu and Faruque Ahmed and Abdul Qayyum Chowdhury from Sylhet  will vie for the lone post as some 47 councillors will cast their votes. bdnews24
