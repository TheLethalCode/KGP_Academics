<TITLE> Govt, parties must decide on convicts in polls: Moriarty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The government and the political parties will have to decide whether those convicted for corruption can run the elections, the US envoy has said. Ambassador US ambassador James F Moriarty spoke his mind on the raging issue after a one-hour meeting with the Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury on Monday. Moriarty said after the incoming government would have to assure the people that the ACC was working independently, that they were working against the accused politicians, businessmen and others. At the same time, he asserted, the administration has to be made neutral. "I think the constitution of some political parties say that the accused persons could not be placed in important positions. This is a sensitive issue," he told journalists at the ACC headquarters in the city. "I think the Anticorruption Commission is doing an important work. It is working as a watchdog against corruption. The US has full support to it. We have helped the ACC in different ways in different times. This cooperation will continue in future." The ACC chairman also spoke to reporters on the issue of convicts contesting the polls. "It is a legal process. The government would take a decision. The task of the Anticorruption Commission is to investigate the allegations and take it to the verdict stage." He also said the ACC drives would continue although its nature and direction might change once a new government takes over. Chowdhury said a list of the convicts has been sent to the Cabinet Division. bdne
