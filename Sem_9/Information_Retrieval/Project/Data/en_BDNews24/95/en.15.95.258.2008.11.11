 LONDON, Tue Nov 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's handling of the economic downturn provided another boost to his Labour Party's fortunes on Tuesday with an opinion poll putting him only six points behind the opposition Conservatives. The Populus poll for The Times put Labour at 35 percent, up 5 points from the previous month, while David Cameron's Conservatives were down 4 points at 41 percent and the Liberal Democrats up one point at 16 percent.

However, 42 percent of respondents felt Cameron was still the best man to lead Britain after the next general election -- which must be called by 2010 -- with Brown on 35 percent.

Only two months ago, Brown's leadership was being openly questioned by members of his own party as Labour lost a string of by-elections and polls showed Cameron heading for a landslide general election victory. But his handling of the global financial crisis has lifted his standing within his party, and with voters, despite economists' warnings that Britain is on the brink of recession. Cameron on Tuesday will present his own package of measures which are expected to focus on helping small business retain employees by diverting cash from the benefits system.
