 Bold Beginnings bdnews24.com is now Bangladesh's first and leading source of Bangladesh's news, delivered in both Bangla and English on an interactive, integrated multimedia platform for relevance and timeliness. It is a born-again organisation, with new management, new ideas, new outlook, new visions for new generations of news-hungry cyberphiles. It had started out in early 2005 as the country's first web-based news agency. The agency's original architects held out the promise to deliver news fast and accurate. But living up to that promise proved tough. The business of news and the business of doing business turned out to be something beyond them. New Lease on Life The opportunity to go back to the drawing board came in the form of a friendly take-over in mid-2006 with boardroom changes at Bangladesh News 24 Hours Ltd, the owning company of bdnews24.com. Toufique Imrose Khalidi, journalist and former BBC broadcaster, took over as Managing Director of the company, and the organisation remerged as bdnews24.com. As Chief Editor, he also headed a new-look team of experienced, talented, tech-savvy, multi-tasking, high-energy staff gathered from across the profession to build a faster-moving newsroom. Online and Making a Splash! Our second incarnation came as an online newspaper. The idea was conceived just ahead of a five-day public holiday in late October 2006. Facing the challenge to deliver news to the people, who would be without newspapers during the holiday, we opened our stories to all for free for the period. And born at that momentfrom the early hours of October 23, 2006was Bangladesh's first online newspaper!
