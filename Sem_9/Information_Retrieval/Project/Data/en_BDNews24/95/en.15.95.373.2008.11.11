<TITLE> Bangladesh draw with Myanmar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  A string of saves from goalkeeper Aminul Haque kept Bangladesh's hope of playing the semifinals alive with a goalless draw against hosts Myanmar in the opening match of the 3rd Grand Royal Challenge Cup on Tuesday. Last edition's runners-up Bangladesh, who left here for the tournament with only three-day preparation, were at bay in the first half before showing some skills in the second to hold the hosts at the Thuwunna Youth Training Center Sports ground. Coach Shafiqul Islam Manik played with his usual five defenders, preferring lone striker Jahid Hasan Emily to the attack, but the Abahani striker had hardly any impact on the rival backline. However, Manik was forced to take off defender Ariful Islam, who sustained an ankle injury in the 36th minute, to pave the way for another striker Mohammad Robin, resulting in good show in the second half for Bangladesh. Bangladesh, who went one goal down to the same rivals in the Mardeka Cup in Malaysia last month, might have gone down in the very third minute, but Aminul thwarted the one-on-one situation to save the visitors. Winger Jahid Hossain whipped a nice cross, but striker Jahid Hasan Emily could not collect it in the 22nd minute, according to a message received here. After resumption, Bangladesh came close to scoring, but Emily saw his header off a Sharif cross thwarted by Myanmar goalkeeper Aung Aung Oo. Myanmar yielded three clear chances in the second half, but the Bangladesh goalkeeper denied all three efforts. "We had only three days' practice before coming here and I think the boys played well in the second half compared to the first half," said Manik after the match. Myanmar Brazilian coach Marcus Antonio Falopa said, "We got many chances, but could not have those and hope they will play better in the next match." bd
