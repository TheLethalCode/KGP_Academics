 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  The four-party alliance has announced nationwide demonstrations over the arrest of BNP leader M Saifur Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Matiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed. The alliance headed by the BNP also asked authorities to meet their seven-point charter of demands. BNP chief Khaleda Zia presided an alliance meeting on Monday evening before the BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain announced the programme. "The alliance wants to go to the polls but only after its demands are met. And the people will not accept the conspiracy to hold the election without the four-party alliance taking part in it." The meeting condemned the arrest of the leaders accused in the Barapukuria coalmine graft case. A special court ordered Jamaat chief Nizami and secretary general Mojaheed and former finance minister Saifur into jail. "The court could not function properly and the judges could not do justice under the emergency law," Delwar alleged. "This is the reason why we demand lifting of emergency under which fair elections also won't be possible." He also accused the Election Commission of bias. "Fair polls under this Election Commission are impossible," Delwar. The BNP secretary general also criticised the appointments of new vice-chancellor, pro-VC and treasurer at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Present at the meeting, among others, were BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, Jamaat leaders M Kamaruzzaman, Abdul Kader Molla, ATM Azharul Islam and Rafiqul Islam Khan, Islami Oikyo Jote leader Abdul latif Nezami, Khelafat Majlish chairman Maulana Muhammad Ishaque, Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Andalib Rahman and secretary general Shameem Al Mamun. Earlier in the day, Jamaat-e-Islami on Monday announced a nationwide five-day programme from Tuesday demanding release of its chief and secretary general. The programme includes nationwide protest rallies and submission of memorandums to the chief adviser and deputy commissioners on Nov. 16. Announcing the programme at party's central office at Moghbazar, acting secretary general Mohammad Quamaruzzaman bridled at the "inhuman" arrest of ailing Saifur. He said the government was sympathetic to "one party" and adopted hostile attitudes towards the BNP-led four-party alliance. "Now its clear that the government wants to set that party in power," he added. Quamaruzzaman said despite a petition pending with the High Court, the bail of the alliance leaders was not considered by the special court, which indicates the government's lack of willingness in arranging the election by creating a favourable environment. By Monday's arrests "the government added another point to the alliance's already announced seven-point demand", which the government had pledged to meet, the acting secretary general said. The government conspiracy against the four-party becomes clear when, Quamaruzzaman said  referring indirectly to Awami League president Sheikh Hasina  "one leader" was cleared of charges in final report but the government managed to press charges against the alliance leaders by "changing law". bdnews24.com/mr
