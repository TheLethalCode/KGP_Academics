 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government is ready to act as a catalyst for the meeting between Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the commerce adviser said on Thursday, a day after the two leaders expressed their eagerness to meet. "The government is ready to reciprocate positively in this regard as the two political leaders have shown eagerness," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters after attending a workshop at BRAC Centre in the morning. "We will take any initiative for the sake of the countrymen," he said. The two former prime ministers have barely spoken to each other in the past 17 years. "The government will take the initiative to get the two top leaders meet and talk with a view to helping the nation overcome the current political stalemate through restoration of constructive political practices," Hossain Zillur told reporters on Sept 11 after Khaleda was released on bail from prison. "We hope they will not only respond to this move but also take initiatives on their own since the two leaders have contributed a lot to the country," he said. To make the move successful, the government sought help from the two leaders' counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, when he had contacted Sheikh Hasina and assured all that she had responded positively. Likewise, the commerce adviser had also said after meeting the BNP chief that her attitude was also positive. Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters on Wednesday: "Our president is ready for discussion. But that must have an agenda." Hours later, BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters: "Khaleda is ready to sit with Hasina 'for the sake of the nation'." bdnew
