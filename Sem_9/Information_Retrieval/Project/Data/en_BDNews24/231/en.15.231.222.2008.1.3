 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Mirpur garments workers finally unblocked Rokeya Sarani Wednesday evening after a nine-hour shutdown of traffic on the road. A huge traffic snarl-up had clogged the roads in the area because of a protest by wokers during the morning rush hours. More than 1,000 garment workers took their anger to the streets at about 8.30am Wednesday in the city's Sheorapara to protest against sudden closure of a factory without any notice, police and witnesses said. The protesters blocked Rokeya Sarani that runs through Sheorapara in the morning because of the closure of SQ Garments, Kafrul police chief Akram Hossain said. The workers refused to clear the thoroughfare despite intervention by security officials, though Akram said they were trying to persuade them into clearing the street. bdnews24.com senior correspondent Liton Haider reported from the scene that office-goers from Mirpur 10 throughout Agargaon area suffered as the workers blocked the bustling road. BGMEA officials arrived at the scene and sat in a meeting with the factory owners at 10:30am, but to no avail. Senior officials of the labour ministry, including the joint secretary Azizur Rahman, rushed to the scene at 1:00 pm. The joint secretary said, "We have contacted the owners. They have said they will have to sit to decide on the demands of the workers. It is not possible for both the parties (owners and workers) to sit before Thursday." He asked the workers to withdraw the roadblock and barricades. However, the workers said they would not agree to withdraw the barricades until the owners apologised and accept their demands. They also announced they would hold a further sit-in Thursday. An initial agitation erupted on Monday. According to garments worker Humayun Kabir, a machine operator Salma fell sick Sunday night and wanted to go home. But factory officials did not allow her to go and she was forced to work an overnight shift. Returning home Monday Salma succumbed to death. The workers demanded an investigation into Salma's death and action against the officials responsible. They also demanded that lay-offs be halted and dismissed workers be given their jobs back. "We have been talking to the factory owners for the last two days. We haven't carried out any procession or demonstration till now. As they closed the factory all of a sudden we had no alternative but to take to streets," Humayun said. None of the factory owners were available for comment. bdnews24.com/lh/al
