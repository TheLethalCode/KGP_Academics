 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The implementation of annual development programme hit a record low in the July-October period, according to the planning ministry's statistics. Only 11 percent of the total ADP outlay worth Tk 26,500 crore has been spent in the first four months of the current fiscal year. The implementation rate was 14 percent for the same period of fiscal 2006-07, 15 percent in 2005-06 and 20 percent in 2004-05, the statistics show. "The implementation rate has started increasing now, compared to the first three months," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters Monday after an Ecnec meeting at the National Economic Council. Azizul said he had strengthened the monitoring of ADP implementation. "The time-consuming tender process has also been relaxed to speed up implementation," he said. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council Monday approved Tk 3,909 crore, including a foreign component of Tk 2,365 crore, for seven projects. Chief adviser and Ecnec chairman Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting, also attended by Mirza Azizul, other advisers and senior officials. The approved projects included Tk 2,446 crore for the rural infrastructure development project (phase II) and Tk 1,150 crore for Dhaka-Chittagong railway development project. The meeting also gave the green light to the Tk 97 crore project on reconstruction of primary schools damaged by natural disasters and Tk 43 crore for the benefit of nongovernmental schools. A Tk 37 crore project on the fast rehabilitation of flood victims has also been approved. bd
