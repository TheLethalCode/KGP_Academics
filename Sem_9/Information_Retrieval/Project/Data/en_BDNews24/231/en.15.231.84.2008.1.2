 Singapore, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares started the new year on a cautious note on Wednesday, pressured by losses on Wall Street and worries about a slowing global economy, but oil and gold were within sight of record highs. Oil climbed above $96 a barrel as fresh violence in major oil exporter Nigeria revived supply concerns while tensions in Pakistan continued to trigger a flight to less risky assets. A recent spate of disappointing economic indicators and geopolitical unrest that followed the assassination of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto have made investors cautious. As trading resumed after the New Year holidays, mining stocks such as BHP Billiton Ltd helped buoy Australian shares. Tokyo, the region's largest market, remained shut for the New Year holidays. "The miners are supporting the market's turnaround," said Macquarie Equities division director Lucinda Chan. "This year a flight to quality is where people are going to. Investors are looking for strong earnings growth and these companies operate where demand is strong from those emerging economies." MSCI's broadest index of shares excluding Japan was up a mere 0.1 percent by 0245 GMT. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index gained 0.5 percent to 6,368.5 while stock markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea were down between 0.1 and O.7 percent. Exporters were mostly flat to weaker following South Korea's smaller-than-expected annual rise in exports in December and its forecasts for slower growth in overseas shipments this year. Singapore's share market also got off to a weak start after a surprising fall in fourth-quarter GDP. Its economy, which relies heavily on exports, shrank at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the weakest performance since the second quarter of 2003. "This signals we are going to see some slowing in growth across the region, which is in line with all the turmoil in financial markets," said David Cohen, economist at Action Economics. In Australia, Centro Properties Group jumped 15.8 percent to A$1.17 as it invited expressions of interest from outside investors as part of a strategic review, after it had trouble refinancing A$1.3 billion ($1.1 billion) of debt. OIL CLIMBS, DOLLAR SUBDUED The dollar held steady as recent volatility made investors wary of taking positions ahead of key US economic data. The US Institute for Supply Management index for December and the Federal Reserve's minutes of its Dec. 11 policy meeting are due later on Wednesday. On Thursday, figures will be released on US auto sales for December, a key barometer of consumer demand, while Friday sees the release of the December payrolls report. In Asian trading, the euro was buying $1.4619 having recovered a little of Monday's fall to $1.4590. The euro had got as high as $1.4747 on Monday before the dollar bounced when figures on US existing home sales proved not nearly as weak as bears expected. The dollar had fared less well on the yen as widespread risk aversion weighed against carry trades -- where investors borrow yen at low rates to buy higher-yielding currencies. It hovered at 111.70 yen having finished at 111.52 in New York on Monday after falling from a 114.65 peak in just three trading sessions. Elsewhere, oil was bolstered by expectations of cooler temperatures in northwest Europe and in the US northeast later this week, and tight US crude inventories. US light crude for February delivery rose 47 cents to $96.45 a barrel by 0222 GMT, on expectations government data would show crude stocks falling for the seventh consecutive week. Spot gold rose to $838.00/838.80 an ounce from $832.70/833.50 an ounce in New York on Monday, when it dropped more than $5 after hitting its best level in seven weeks at $843.20 -- not far from a record high of $850 hit in 1980
