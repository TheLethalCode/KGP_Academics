 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday relaxed a rule to facilitate the offloading of 119,857 government shares of IFIC Bank. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters at his office that the rule did not allow sponsors or directors of a bank to sell or buy shares until the board approved the accounts after the year-end closing. "The SEC has decided to relax the rule for two years only to facilitate the government to offload its stakes in the IFIC Bank and other upcoming share offloading as well," he said. The official also said they had approved a prospectus of Delta BRAC Housing Limited (DBHL) to float shares on the capital market and an increase in the paid-up capital of Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB). "DBHL has been cleared to float 5 lakh shares; each valued at Tk 210 including a premium of Tk 110," Farhad said. The company's authorised and paid-up capital are Tk 50 crore and Tk 12 crore and it earned Tk13.42 crore in net profit in 2007, according to the executive director of the market regulator.
