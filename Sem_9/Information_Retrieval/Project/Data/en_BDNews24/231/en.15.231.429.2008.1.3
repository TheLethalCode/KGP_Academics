 Des Moines, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards barnstormed through 36 straight hours of campaigning on Wednesday to dramatize the urgency of his fight for middle America and capitalize on a jump in the polls. With Iowa's crucial party caucuses set for Thursday, Edwards drove hundreds of miles as part of a 16-stop, 36-hour "marathon for the middle class" tour. Along the way he delivered his speech to audiences of campaign volunteers, supporters in town offices, a union hall, coffee bars and even private homes in the dead of a freezing night. The tour, which started at 11 a.m. (1700 GMT) on Tuesday ended on Wednesday night at a rally in Des Moines with rock singer John Mellencamp, who played solo for an audience organizers estimated at up to 3,000 before Edwards spoke. "Corporate greed is robbing our children of the promise of America and it is time for us to fight back," Edwards said. "I will fight for you .... I will stand up for you." Edwards had told an audience of several dozen supporters who crowded into a home in Centerville at 5:15 a.m. CST (1115 GMT) that he was "running on adrenaline" and propping his eyes open with toothpicks after about an hour of sleep, adding that he felt good about the campaign. The nonstop campaigning was intended to demonstrate the intense work ethic the former North Carolina senator says he would bring to the presidency. It echoed Republican nominee Bob Dole's 96-hour campaign marathon in 1996. Edwards was forced to switch buses during the night after his main vehicle, with its "America belongs to us" logo, developed an electrical problem at Council Bluffs. CORPORATE GREED In his speeches, Edwards focused almost exclusively on fighting "entrenched, moneyed interests," which he said prevented ordinary Americans from achieving their aspirations. "I don't believe you can sit at a table and negotiate with drug companies, insurance companies and oil companies and hope that they will voluntarily give their power away. They will give their power away when we take their power away," he said to applause. Edwards also pressed the theme in an opinion piece Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal, saying that if elected, he would cap untaxed chief executive pay, require companies to enroll employees in retirement plans and force firms to honor pension promises to workers, even in bankruptcy. Some recent polls have shown Edwards closing the gap in Iowa on Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, his two main rivals for the Democratic nomination in the November presidential election. Potential caucus participants asked Edwards about subjects including health care, Iraq, immigration and education and he responded by drawing the audience back to his central theme of fighting corporate greed. "John is the first person to come out with proposals on health care and how to stop the (Iraq) war. The others followed," said John Wasko, 82, who heard Edwards in Ottumwa. The Midwestern state is the first step on the long road toward the Democratic presidential nomination and Iowa caucus participants are renowned for their serious approach to the nomination process
