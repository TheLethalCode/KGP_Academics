 NICOSIA, Dec 31 (bndnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus formally adopts the euro at midnight on Monday, the last step to European integration after its admission to the European Union in 2004. "We are absolutely ready, and everything is exactly where we wanted it to be," Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said. The Finance Ministry, normally a staid affair for number crunchers of the state, will throw open its doors for an all-night party ringing in the New Year and the European single currency. The island of just under 1 million residents represents 0.2 percent of the euro zone economy. Its pound, legal tender introduced by the British in 1878, will be replaced by euros at a rate of one euro worth 0.585274 pounds. Effectively merging its economy with that of 14 other countries is a groundshift for Cyprus, insular in the not too distant past. Less than a decade ago it had ceilings on interest rates in a throwback to World War Two, curbs on investment and exchange control laws which forced islanders to come up with ingenious ways to get money out of the country. "The euro has huge benefits for us," Sarris said. But not everyone is enthusiastic about the change. "I think that some people, particularly the elderly in the villages, will have real problems adjusting," said shopkeeper Nicolas Tsolakis, 25. Polls suggest about two-thirds of Cypriots are wary of price hikes from the switch. "It's a big change for everyone," said economist Stelios Platis. "(Most) Cypriots are well travelled and versed in different currencies, but not everyone is, and euros are perceived by some a bit like Monopoly money, play money," he told Reuters. The Finance Ministry says some scepticism and unease is to be expected for such a major change. "This is a pound which has served us well, but we are going from a good currency to a better currency," said Sarris. Pounds and euros will be in dual circulation for one month. In adopting the euro Cyprus will attract more investment particularly in the real estate sector, but could also expose some of the island's weaknesses, Platis said. Euro zone entry will be applicable only in the Greek Cypriot south of Cyprus, run by the internationally recognised government representing Cyprus in the European Union. The north of the island is a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised by Ankara, where Turkish lira will continue to be official tend
