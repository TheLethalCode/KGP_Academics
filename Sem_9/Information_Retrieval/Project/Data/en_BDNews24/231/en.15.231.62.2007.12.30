 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  The government is likely to make a final decision in a couple of days on using the optical fibre cable of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh for an alternative connection to Dhaka from the submarine cable landing station in Cox's Bazar, an official said Sunday. Gazi Mizanur Rahman, joint secretary of the telecommunication ministry, told bdnews24.com that a decision on the BTTB proposal for an agreement to use the PGCB optical fibre line might be finalised in a couple of days. Other officials with the ministry said the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board sent a proposal to the ministry in mid-Nov for establishing an alternative transmission link between Dhaka and Cox's Bazar. The officials would not comment on the delay in making the decision. The BTTB is unhappy with the indecision of the ministry as the state telecom operator's own submarine cable transmission line suffered 'cuts' several times. "Two separate proposals have been made for using the PGCB cable or Banglaphone cable as an alternative transmission cable. The Banglaphone cable can be used through capacity swap but the permission of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Board would be required," a high official of the BTTB said to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. "Banglaphone has set up an optical fibre cable using poles of Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board. But the lines run at a low altitude and could be snapped easily." "On the other hand, the PGCB has taken its optical fibre cable lines through a high-tension line. The Banglaphone cable would be less expensive but the PGCB cable would be more sustainable," the official said. At least three months would be needed after a final decision was made to get the connection. Tenders would have to be floated for buying equipment, he added. The BTTB's 437-kilometre optical fibre cable has snapped 23 times since its lunch on May 11, 2006. The BTTB said it was snapped eight times because of subversive activities. bdnews
