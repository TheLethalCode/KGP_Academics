 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court will give a ruling on Jan 10 on whether the Anticorruption Commission can appeal against a High Court stay order on a wealth submission notice served on Sheikh Hasina. An Appellate Division full bench, led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, set the date Wednesday after hearing a petition seeking "leave to appeal" filed by the ACC against the HC order. On Nov 21, the High Court had declared illegal the ACC notice served on the former prime minister. The Appellate Division had stayed the HC order on Dec 3 until Jan 2, allowing the ACC to file a petition for "leave to appeal" against the High Court ruling. However, it later extended the HC stay order until Jan 10. Attorney general Fida M Kamal, acting for the ACC, said in court: "The ACC sent the notice to Hasina in line with the law." Hasina's lawyer barrister Rafique-ul-Huq however refuted this, saying: "The ACC sent the notice disobeying the law." "The ACC without any investigation and filing any case alleged that Hasina possessed illegal wealth," he argued. "But by law nobody can be accused without filing any case." Barrister Fida M Kamal said an investigation took place after filing of the case. The ACC served notice on Hasina July 17, a day after she was arrested. She filed a writ petition challenging the legality of the notice on Aug 5. bdnews24
