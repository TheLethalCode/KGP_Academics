 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Tuesday restructured the 11 benches of the High Court Division, officials said. The move comes a day before the Supreme Court opens Wednesday, ending a 19-day winter vacation. The court is expected to buzz with the proceedings of high-profile cases. This week, the Appellate Division will hear an appeal against the High Court order that declared illegal the Anticorruption Commission's notice on former prime minister Sheikh Hasina for a wealth statement. The Appellate Division will also hear another government appeal against a High Court ruling that it has the jurisdiction of issuing emergency-time bail orders for convicts. The appeals court is set to hear an appeal seeking a stay order on the bail to former minister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda. HC BENCHES RESTRUCTURED The CJ shifted justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury from the bench of justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman. Justice Shahidul Islam joined Mominur Rahman's bench, with its jurisdiction of hearing writ motions unchanged. Justice Sikder Mokbul Huq will run a two-member bench with justice Md Fazlur Rahman. Both have been assigned to hear appeals in criminal cases. Also, justice Md Arayas Uddin and justice Mashuq Hossain Ahmed have been tasked with handling appeals in the criminal cases.
