<TITLE> Pakistan tries to allay Australian fears over tour </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan is confident Australia's cricket tour in March and April can go ahead despite security fears, officials said on Tuesday. "As far as we are concerned the tour is very much on," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Nasim Ashraf told Reuters. In Sydney, Australia captain Ricky Ponting told reporters his players held grave concerns about touring Pakistan following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto last week, which has plunged the country into violence. All-rounder Andrew Symonds has already indicated he would skip the tour if he considered it unsafe and Ponting said other players were also worried. "No doubt sitting back and watching the events of last week in the changing rooms probably did create some grave concerns," he said. Ponting said the decision on whether the team would proceed with the tour would be left to Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) after an inspection tour next month. "We are always going to be guided by the experts on the ground here in Australia and on the ground in Pakistan to let us know how the safety and security issues are in Pakistan. "It looks like now that Cricket Australia and the ACA will be sending a group over in early February to check things out." In Karachi, Ashraf said he expected the security situation to calm down. "The tour is still two months away and obviously the situation will improve after the general elections are held in Pakistan," he said. Pakistani electoral officials are due to announce on Wednesday whether a poll will go ahead on Jan. 8 or be postponed. NEUTRAL VENUE "The PCB is well aware of its responsibilities as a host nation and firmly believes the Australian tour can be held on schedule with the required security provided for their players," Ashraf added. Australia's last scheduled tour of Pakistan in 2002 was switched to Colombo and Sharjah because of security concerns and Ponting said he would hope the series could be played elsewhere if Pakistan was considered unsafe. "We haven't played a lot of test cricket against Pakistan in the last few years," he said. "It would be nice if that happened (neutral venue). I'd rather be playing cricket than not playing cricket." However, Ashraf said logistical and economic aspects of the series made it impossible for the board to think about using a neutral venue but it was willing to accommodate the visitors on the choice of venues within Pakistan. "We are willing to listen to their point of view as far as venues in Pakistan are concerned. I think it is premature to talk about cancellation at so early a stage," he added. Australia are due to reach Pakistan on March 10 to play three tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match
