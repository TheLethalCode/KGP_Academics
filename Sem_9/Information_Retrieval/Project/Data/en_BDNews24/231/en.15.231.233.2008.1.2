 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  The government Wednesday decided to launch a series of programmes including open market sales of rice from next week as soaring prices hit the local market. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Food, Planning and Monitoring Committee, chaired by food adviser Tapan Chowdhury at the planning ministry. The programme also includes the selling of rice by Bangladesh Rifles at subsidised prices. Another 5,000 tonnes of rice will be provided for workers at closed mills in Khulna. "People are suffering. We are trying to do something for them," Tapan Chowdhury told reporters after the meeting. The prices of rice have been increasing for the last couple of weeks, with the prices of coarse rice reaching Tk 30 to Tk 32 per kg. India has recently increased the prices of rice by $75 a tonne. BDR, which will be given 15,000 tonnes of rice at Tk 24 a kg, will sell at Tk 25 a kg. Committee members AB Mirza Azizul Islam and LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal were present among others at the meeting. bd
