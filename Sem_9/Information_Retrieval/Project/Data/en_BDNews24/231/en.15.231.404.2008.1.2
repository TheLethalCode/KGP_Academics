 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Rice traders of Bangladesh and India foresee a further rise in the prices which is set to put additional strains on the purse of consumers. Traders say the price in the Indian market went up by up to $90 a tonne in last few days and the hike would affect Bangladesh since it imported the bulk of the staple from India. Importer Haji Mohammad Golam Mowla said rice available now in the market was imported before Eid. Mowla, also general secretary of the traders' association of wholesale market in Moulvibazar, said the Indian government Sunday hiked prices by $80 to $90 per tonne. He said the price might shoot up by over Tk 5 per kg in the local market if it increased by $80 per tonne on the global market. He feared local traders might charge prices higher than they should even though the rice they were selling now were imported before Eid. The prices should not rise too much if the traders did not play foul this time, he added. "Prices will hardly go up if traders sell rice imported before Eid at the previous rate instead of selling them at higher prices. But the question is whether they will do that. Usually businessmen do not miss chances to make quick profit," Mowla said. Indian rice exporter Mohammad Nurul Huda, who owns Nazim Enterprise at Mohdipur in Maldah district in India, told bdnews24.com by phone that rice production in India dropped this year and the Indian government was unwilling to export. "That's why the price has increased," he said. Huda said a tonne of rice was sold out at $430 Thursday and at $510 Sunday. Despite soaring prices, up to 150 rice-carrying trucks enter Bangladesh through Sona Masjid border every day, he said. A kg of low-quality coarse rice costs Tk 30 and high-quality Najirshail variety up to Tk 44 and Miniket Tk 40 in Dhaka. Before Eid, a kg of coarse rice sold at Tk 27 and Najirshail rice would cost Tk 40. Importer Mowla said floods and cyclone Sidr caused a steep fall in rice production in the country. He said the demand far exceeded the supply and the imbalance was responsible for the hike in prices. He said importers expecting massive food aid after Sidr had cut down on import, but since Bangladesh did not get the expected aid, it has caused a vacuum. In the meantime, the Indian government hiked the price, he said. Majority of the imported rice comes from India this year while other exporters such as Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam saw a fall in rice production as well. Bellal Hossain, manager of Chatkhil Rice Agency in Karwan Bazar, said the prices did not fall although new rice from the recent harvest entered the market. "We'd heard that the price would fall after Eid. But we have been forced to sell rice at higher prices due to the high wholesale prices," Bellal said. Abul Quashem of Comilla Traders in Karwan Bazar echoed Bellal. Swarna and Pari rice were selling at Tk 30 and Paijam at Tk 31 per kg Tuesday. Before Eid, these varieties sold at Tk 27. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, the government's trading wing, said the price of rice rose 11.6 percent in last one month. A month ago, the prices of medium-quality Najirshail and Miniket were between Tk 32 and 35 and those of high-quality Najirshail and Miniket between Tk 33 and Tk 37. Now they are selling between Tk 35 and 42, the TCB said. According to the TCB list Tuesday, the prices of medium-quality Paijam and Lata were Tk 29-30 while high-quality Paijam and Lata Tk 30-32. Swarna and China Irri were selling at up to Tk 30 from Tk 26 a month ago. bdnews24
