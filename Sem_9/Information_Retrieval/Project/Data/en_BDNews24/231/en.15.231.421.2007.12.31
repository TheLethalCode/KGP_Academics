<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Unwarranted influence and pressure from outside has set back the freedom of police administration, a top police officer said Monday. The main cause of harassment by police is the decades-old irregularity and a lack of rules for which the police are not responsible, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Naim Ahmed said in his speech to a workshop on police reform. The workshop and training programme, which aimed at motivating police personnel to stop harassing people, started Monday. About 2,000 Dhaka metropolitan police personnelfrom superintendent to constablejoined the workshop. Replying to a question, the commissioner said the police failed to discharge their responsibility properly due to pressure from politicians and "sometimes even from the same department". In the keynote paper, Naim said that one of the main causes of harassment by police is appointment of inefficient people to the police department. "Professional inefficiency and lack of knowledge make things worse," he said. The police commissioner mentioned that the police sometimes arrest people without involvement in crimes, intimidate innocent people with arrest and abuse Section 54 and DMP ordinance. There is not necessarily a link between a name in the FIR and the arrest of a person, Naim said. "The plaintiff might have filed false cases. It has to be examined if the person accused was really involved in crimes. And a decision on arrest should be taken after much evaluation and examining witnesses," he said. Naim alleged that many try to benefit from filing false cases. "If the case is proved false after an investigation, legal action should be taken against the plaintiff." bdnew
