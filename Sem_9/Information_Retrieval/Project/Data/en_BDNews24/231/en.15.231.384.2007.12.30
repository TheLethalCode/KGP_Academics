 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Title hopefuls Rajshahi Sunday shot leaders Khulna down with a 29-run defeat in the penultimate round four-dayer of the National Cricket League at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Barisal recorded their third four-dayer win by handing an innings and 34-run defeat to lowly Sylhet at Shaheed Chandu Stadium. Chittagong denied Dhaka with a creditable draw at Birshreshthho Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Rajshahi, having earned 11 points from the match, were just one point shy of leaders Khulna, who have 96 points after conceding the first defeat in nine matches. The ninth-round outcomes mean the title of the four-day competition will be decided in the tenth and final round, beginning Jan 4. Dhaka toppled Chittagong to regain the third place with 87 points. Chittagong slipped to the fourth place with 83 points after earning six points from the game. Barisal raised their point tally to 75, gaining maximum 16 points from this round while Sylhet remained at the bottom on 54 from nine games. Rajshahi vs Khulna Despite two fine knocks from Jamal Babu (86) and Mostafizur Rahman (56), Khulna folded up on 292 all out in their second innings, 30 away from the winning target. Spinner Saqline Sajib grabbed six wickets for 101 to give Rajshahi their fifth triumph in nine matches. Babu and Mostafizur together took Khulna to 146 for four from 61 for three, but Khulna slipped to 167 for six following the dismissal of Mostafiz. Afterwards, Babu paired with Fariduddin (41) and put on 67 runs for the seventh wicket to raise hope, but Saqline removed Babu to leave Khulna at 234 for seven. Khulna once again collapsed to 237 for nine before Farid and Salman (27) contributed 55 runs for last wicket, but the effort was not enough to avert the first defeat in the league. Barisal vs Sylhet Barisal's medium pacer Arafat Salahuddin claimed five wickets for 44 as Sylhet collapsed to 166 all out, conceding the fifth defeat in nine matches. Sylhet, who needed 196 runs to avert an innings defeat, once again fell in trouble as they lost Nabil Samad (6) and Alok Kapali (3) on the morning of the final day. They resumed the day on four for two. Opener Imtiaz Hossain and Golam Mabud, however, denied further damage producing identical scores of 57 before Sylhet went down shortly. The dismissal of Imtiaz and Golam triggered a rapid slump in the tail as last five Sylhet batsmen together could manage just 35 runs. Dhaka vs Chittagong Chasing 219 for win, Dhaka were 130 for four in 21.4 overs in their second innings when the bails were drawn for the final day. Earlier, Chittagong resumed Day 4 on 259 for four and added another 177 runs to finish the innings on 436 all out as Chittagong skipper Ehsanul Haq converted his overnight 50 to 117. Overnight partner Masumuddowla fell on 118 after resuming on 100 while wicketkeeper Dhiman Gosh contributed a 60-ball 43 to help the port city outfit to keep the Dhaka bowlers at bay for over two sessions. b
