<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Wednesday said the government would consider sending Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia abroad for better treatment if it got such proposals from their parties. "If there are such (formal) proposals, legal aspects would be examined on the matter," Mainul told reporters in his Bangladesh Secretariat office. "But we are yet to get any such proposal," he said. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Tuesday demanded that the caretaker administration send the detained party chief abroad for better treatment. The adviser said there were options, including release on parole but would not elaborate. Asked if the government would be sitting with the political parties soon, Mainul said the government did not have any right now. bdnews24
