 LONDON, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of revellers saw in the New Year at a huge fireworks display by the River Thames, with millions more raising a glass at parties across the country. An estimated 700,000 people packed the capital's streets to watch the display at the London Eye observation wheel after Big Ben's chimes heralded the start of 2008. "With the equivalent of one in ten Londoners enjoying the fireworks in central London alone, it shows a city seeing in the New Year in style," said London mayor Ken Livingstone. Police made 51 arrests but said the crowds were good-humoured with no major issues reported. "The nature of New Year's Eve in central London has changed," said Superintendent Andy Tarrant. "From what used to be a relatively low-key spontaneous night is now a world-class event that attracts thousands and thousands of people." Scotland Yard said 3,600 officers were on duty to help cope with New Year's Eve crowds that have doubled over the last three years in London. In Scotland, up to 100,000 people packed the streets of Edinburgh for the city's Hogmanay street party. In Cardiff, circus performers, acrobats and fireworks entertained the crowds at an event in the grounds of the Welsh capital's castle.
