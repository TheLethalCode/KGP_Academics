 LONDON, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities rose on Monday in thin trade but key markets stayed closed, with the region notching a slender gain of 1.6 percent for 2007, its worst performance since 2002 as a credit crunch whacked stocks. By 1345 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent at a provisional 1,507.4. The year's gains paled with a 16 percent jump recorded in 2006. The DJ STOXX basic resources index took pole position this year with a 28 percent rally while banks were the worst performers, down 16.8 percent, in a sector littered with losses linked to the crisis in credit markets. Fund managers said the outlook for equities was uncertain. "The key question is the knock-on effect the subprime problem has in terms of slowing growth, consumer lending and the overall impact that has in the wider market," said Andrea Williams, head of European equities at Royal London Asset Management. "It still has to be resolved really." UK and French markets ended weaker in a shortened trading session ahead of the New Year's Day holiday while German, Italian and Spanish markets remained closed. On the year, the FTSE 100 index rose 3.8 percent versus an 11 percent rise last year and France's CAC 40 edged up 1.3 percent versus a 17.5 percent rally in 2006. Germany's DAX index was a star performer, up 22 percent, matching last year's gains and Spain's IBEX index added 7 percent versus a 32 percent surge last year. After notching up impressive gains of 8 percent in the first half of this year, European equities were badly bruised by credit market seizures in August folowing a crisis of confidence over the market value of battered risky U.S. subprime mortgages. The S&P 500 index is up 4 percent so far this year while the benchmark MSCI emerging markets index has jumped nearly 40 percent. UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK "There's been a lot of uncertainty and a lot challenges and they are not going away in the near term," said Williams. She said recently hit financials were likely to be attractive at some point next year but timing was key. Williams also fancied industrials. The dollar fell versus a basket of major currencies on Monday, keeping it on track for its worst annual performance in four years, on speculation that 2008 could bring slower US economic growth and lower interest rates. The dollar has declined 11.5 percent against the euro so far in 2007, matching last year's losses. In UK equities, Friends Provident was a standout gainer on the day, up nearly 3 percent as the Sunday Times newspaper said the life insurer is putting the finishing touches to a strategic review, which is likely to lead to a sale of all or part of the company. In Amsterdam, shares in Dutch office goods supplier Corporate Express were a standout gainer, up nearly 8 percent after U.S. asset management firm AllianceBernstein raised its stake in the embattled company, seen as a target for activist hedge funds.
