 LONDON, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman police officer was shot in the leg responding to a suspected armed robbery on a pub near Preston in Lancashire on Monday, her force said. The female dog handler, who has yet not been named, was amongst officers despatched to the Hospital Inn in Bamber Bridge following reports of intruders. The officers came across a man who was leaving the premises wearing a balaclava and brandishing a gun, believed to be a shotgun. The dog handler told him to drop his weapon, but instead he opened fire, hitting her in the top of the leg. She was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital with minor injuries. A man who worked at the pub was also taken to hospital but had not been shot. Armed officers were sent to the incident and police said they had arrested a man near the scene but believed at least one more suspect could still be at large. "This is an incredibly serious situation where a police officer has been shot at and, whilst we have arrested one man we may still have an offender in the area," said Lancashire's Acting Assistant Chief Constable Jerry Graham. Officers have cordoned off the area while further searches go on. The woman is the latest female officer to have been shot while on duty. In November 2005, Sharon Beshenivsky, 38, was shot dead as she tried to stop an armed robbery on a travel agency in Bradford. Three months later, trainee officer Rachael Bown needed emergency surgery but survived after being shot in the abdomen attempting to apprehend a suspected burglar in Nottingh
