<TITLE> Castro sends Cubans New Year message </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Havana, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Convalescing Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Monday sent a New Year's message telling Cubans to celebrate the anniversary of his 1959 revolution nearly 17 months after illness forced him to hand power to his brother. Castro, one of the few surviving Cold War enemies of the United States, has only appeared in taped videos and photographs since undergoing emergency stomach surgery in July 2006 and with his full condition a state secret it is unclear whether the 81-year-old will resume office. "In the morning, 49 years of the revolution will be behind us and the 50th year will symbolize half a century of heroic resistance," Castro said in a statement read on television. "We proclaim our pride in this record to the world." Cuba's National Assembly may decide on Castro's post as head of state when it approves members of the executive Council of State in March. But his brother Raul's call for more open debate over problems has fueled speculation about the political and economic future of the island. His brother says Castro is lucid, consulted on major policy decisions and has recovered sufficient strength that party delegates support his nomination to run for a National Assembly seat, a requirement for the presidency. But Fidel Castro has hinted twice in recent statements he will not cling on to power or his formal posts, suggesting he will instead contribute with ideas drawn from his experience. Castro has been nominated for the assembly but if he is too ill, the assembly may formally appoint a successor. Fidel Castro holds posts of president of the Council of State and Council of Ministers and first secretary of the ruling Communist Party. Cuba watchers say a smooth transition of power already has taken place under Raul Castro, who some believe is a more practical manager who has begun talking about an open approach to handling the economic problems, including more foreign investment in the agriculture sector
