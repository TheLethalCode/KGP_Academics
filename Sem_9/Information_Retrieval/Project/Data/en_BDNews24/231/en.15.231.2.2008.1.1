<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)A medical board will be formed for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in a day or two, if necessary, a senior prisons official said Tuesday. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said Hasina had refused to go to hospital for health checkups, which made it all but necessary to form a medical board. Hasina was brought back to the special jail Monday after she fell sick during the court proceedings of a case against her. She was given immediate treatment after a doctor examined her. Hasina could not be taken to the court Tuesday for the hearing of the Tk 3 crore extortion case, as she was sick. Siddiqui told reporters at Dhaka Central Jail: "I visited her (Hasina) Tuesday morning and asked her about her physical condition. She told me that she was very sick." The former prime minister was treated by four physicians of her choice: ENT specialist Dr Pran Gopal Dutta, eye specialist Dr Modasser Ali, gynaecologist Dr Shahela Khatun and medicine specialist Dr ABM Abdullah, he said. "For further treatmentas the doctors adviseddifferent medical tests are necessary, but she was reluctant to get those tests done," Siddiqui said. "She was also asked whether she would like to go to any clinic of her choice, but she said she would let me know," he said. Inspector general (prisons) brigadier general Md Zakir Hassan also requested Hasina in this regard, but she did not agree, Siddiqui said. The authorities will wait another couple of days and try to convince Hasina's relatives and doctors to talk her into consenting to health checkups, he said. "If she doesn't agree, a medical board comprising specialists will treat her. Any refusal by her won't be taken into account," Siddiqui said. Hasina is suffering from ear and eye problems and a fluctuating blood pressure, Siddiqui said. "Apart from these, she doesn't have a major disease," he said. bdnew
