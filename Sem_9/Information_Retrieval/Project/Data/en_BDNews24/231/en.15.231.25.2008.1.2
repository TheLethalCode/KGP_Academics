 LONDON, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A London cancer hospital was evacuated on Wednesday after a major blaze broke out, a fire brigade spokesman said. The entire top floor of the Royal Marsden Hospital was gutted as patients were taken to nearby areas. The spokesman described the blaze, which started at lunchtime in the west London hospital, as "a very big fire". He said there were 15 fire engines and 75 firefighters tackling the blaze. "We are currently evacuating the hospital," he added. "At this stage I can't say how many people this will involve but it looks like it could be the whole hospital." There were no immediate reports of casualties or the cause of the blaze.
