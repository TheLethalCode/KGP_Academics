<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Twenty-five workers, who had allegedly been swindled by a Bangladeshi recruiting agency, Monday threatened to go fasting unto death next week if their money was not returned by the weekend. "Recruiting agency Kabir Enterprise promised us jobs on IH Technology, a company which doesn't exist in Malaysia," Minhaz Ahmed, who returned from Kuala Lumpurempty-handed, told reporters at a press conference in Dhaka. Minhaz along with 24 other returnees alleged that the workers went to the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, but officials there did not "pay heed to their woes" and backed the company instead. Dulal, a broker for Kabir Enterprise in Malaysia, "sold" 100 Bangladeshi workers to a different company, Sizati Pati, where they had worked for six months, said Md Mozammel Haq Sazzad, one of the returnees from Kuala Lumpur. Rafiqul Islam, whose son and son-in-law were among the workers, said Kabir Enterprise promised that the Malaysian company would pay 800 Malaysian ringits to each worker, but gave only 200-250 ringits a month. "If the government doesn't take necessary measures to return our money (paid to Kabir Enterprise) by the end of this week, we will stage a fast-unto-death strike next week," Rafiqul said. Another returnee, Nazmul Hossain Khan, said each worker paid up to Tk 2 lakh to go to Malaysia for work. Almost all workers, who attended the press conference, told reporters that most of the time they passed their days without food in Malaysia. "The agents and brokers for the company used to beat us," Md Shahjahan. Minhaz said he managed to return home after his wife sent money out of Bangladesh by selling her ornaments. "We are all happy that we returned home safely," he said. bdn
