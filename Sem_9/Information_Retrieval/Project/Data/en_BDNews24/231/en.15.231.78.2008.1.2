<TITLE> Cheapest and most expensive mortgages of 2007 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Banking giant HSBC retained its top spot as the cheapest mortgage provider last year, closely followed by two building societies -- Skipton and Nationwide -- a league table shows. Financial services research company Defaqto said borrowers with HSBC paid 3,361.99 pounds on a 50,000 pound interest-only mortgage last year, 532.39 pounds cheaper than the most expensive deal. Also making up the top 10 of cheapest providers were online bank Intelligent Finance, Direct Line, Britannia, the One Account, Standard Life Bank, Yorkshire Building Society and Principality Building Society. The Bank of Scotland was found to be the most expensive, followed by the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank. Britain's largest mortgage lender, Halifax, was 17th-cheapest out of a total of 29 lenders, while Northern Rock, Britain's fifth largest lender and the main casualty of the credit crunch, came in 22nd place. The survey looks at standard variable rate mortgages or their equivalent for existing borrowers, and does not include specialist providers or loyalty rates. David Black, principal consultant for banking at Defaqto, said: "In 2007 there were three increases in bank base rates and one decrease, so it is not surprising that the average cost of servicing a standard variable rate mortgage for the largest lenders rose last year by 14 percent over the cost in 2006. "While it is acknowledged that standard variable rate mortgages are only one type of mortgage, their importance may be increasing due to the knock-on effects of the credit crunch, making it more difficult to obtain attractive alternative deals." A total 1.4 million people will see their fixed rate mortgage deal end in the early part of the year, and each will be forced to pay an estimated average of 200 pounds per month more to meet the cost of servicing their home loans.
