<TITLE> India nudges Myanmar to hasten political reform </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India urged Myanmar on Wednesday to expedite political reform and national reconciliation but reaffirmed its desire to build on their strong relationship despite pressure from the West. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told visiting Myanmar Foreign Minister Nyan Win that there was a "greater urgency in bringing about political reform and national reconciliation", Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said. "This process had to be broadbased to include all sections of society including Aung San Suu Kyi and various ethnic groups in Myanmar," he told reporters. India, and to a greater extent China, are among Myanmar's few allies and trading partners and are seen as Asian powers who could pressure the military junta to reform following massive anti-government protests there last year. But like Beijing, New Delhi has baulked at taking a tougher line against the former Burma and opposed sanctions. India says its concerns as a neighbour are different than those of distant Western nations and prefers dialogue to strong-arm tactics. It is also trying to counter Chinese influence in Myanmar and is competing for its gas resources in what some critics say is a mockery of India's democratic ideals. The Myanmar foreign minister began a three-day visit on Wednesday and also held talks with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee. Last year, pro-democracy protesters led by Buddhist monks staged Myanmar's largest anti-government demonstrations in nearly 20 years. The official death toll from the junta's resulting crackdown is 31, but some Western diplomats say the figure is much higher.
