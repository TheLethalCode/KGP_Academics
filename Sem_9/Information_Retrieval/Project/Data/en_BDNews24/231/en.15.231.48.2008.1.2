<TITLE> Taiwan plans Latin America trip to ward off China </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Taipei, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian or an envoy will visit Latin American allies this month to bolster ties, an official said on Wednesday, as China pressures them to break with an island Beijing insists is a renegade province. China has claimed Taiwan as its territory since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and pledged to bring the island back under its rule, by force if necessary. Taiwan looks to its 24 diplomatic allies worldwide for political legitimacy as China, which has about 170 allies, pressures those mostly small, impoverished nations to break ties. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh confirmed that a trip was in the works, although details, including who would go, were still being worked out. "We're seeing a lot of pressure from China," she said. "If Chen can go himself, it will be especially good for bilateral relations." The president could opt to stay at home, however, to help his party campaign for tough legislative elections later in January. Either he or his envoy will travel to Guatemala for the inauguration of left-leaning president Alvaro Colom, who could re-examine ties with Taiwan. He will go on to Saint Lucia, where Beijing has been courting the Caribbean island's strong opposition party. Chen, who has made standing up to China a top priority since taking office in 2000, must step down in May on expiry of his second four-year term
