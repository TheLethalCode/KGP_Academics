 CAPE TOWN, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa have added batsman Neil McKenzie to their squad for the second test against West Indies in Cape Town starting on Wednesday. West Indies won the first test by 128 runs in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. McKenzie, who has scored 501 runs at an average of 41.75 in 12 innings in South Africa's domestic first-class competition, will play his 42nd test if he makes the XI. "We've talked about what happened in Port Elizabeth long and hard and there is no reason to panic," South African coach Mickey Arthur told a news conference on Monday. "All we've decided to do is to strengthen our top-order batting." McKenzie is likely to replace struggling opener Herschelle Gibbs, who failed to score any runs in the first test. Squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Ashwell Prince, Neil McKenzie, Andre Nel, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini
