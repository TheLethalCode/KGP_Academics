 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday stressed the need for boosting productivity, export competitiveness and diversification to sustain in the global market after the removal of EU import restrictions on Chinese clothes. "We've to develop our skills, competitiveness and productivity to face competition and tap opportunities in new markets," Fakhruddin told the launch of the 13th Dhaka International Trade Fair 2008 at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. He asked ministries, divisions and the private sector to work together in this regard. The European Union removed import restrictions on Chinese clothes Tuesday, raising fears that countries like Bangladesh would lose out to China. Earlier the EU had put in place the temporary limits on specific clothing categories after a massive rise in Chinese imports after the end of textile quotas in January 2005. Fakhruddin feared that Bangladesh might lose the export market if it did not enhance productivity, competitiveness and the quality of products. Sahab Ullah, vice-chairman of the Export Promotion Bureau, chaired the function attended, also by finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed and FBCCI administrator Manzur Elahi. The chief adviser said the country earned $12.1 billion from exports in fiscal 2006-07. Readymade garments accounted for about 76 percent of the total, which Fakhruddin said was not a good sign for a sustainable market. He said product diversification is important to cut dependence on a few export items. "The target could be achieved by using modern technology, easing the process of getting credits and export-import trade and improving the quality of products," said Fakhruddin, a former central bank governor and a senior World Bank official. Fakhruddin asked the business forums and research organisations to do more to tap the opportunities available at different multilateral and regional forums, including the World Trade Organisation. The CA said the caretaker government took steps to remove the barriers in the business sector. "The Regulatory Reforms Commission and Better Business Forum have been formed to boost confidence and ease the regulatory bottlenecks," he added. Azizul Islam said the government has been trying hard to remove infrastructure constraints for boosting trade and commerce. At the end of the opening ceremony, the chief adviser opened the 13th DITF. Some 395 stalls from local enterprises and 15 from seven other countries will display their goods at the month-long trade fair. bd
