 BAGHDAD, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up at a funeral in Baghdad on Tuesday, killing at least 30 people and wounding 38 in one of the deadliest attacks in the capital in months, police said. Police said two women were among the dead. The funeral in Zayouna district in eastern Baghdad was being held for a man killed in a bomb attack three days earlier. Iraq has seen a steep drop in overall violence since June, but US military statistics show the number of suicide bomb attacks has risen slightly since reaching a low in October. US commanders say militants are still dispatching suicide bombers in an effort to cause mass-casualty "spectacular" attacks.
