 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government could not confirm Tuesday if Malaysia has imposed a permanent embargo on import of Bangladeshi workers, as media reports suggest. "I have not received any official letter," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com in his foreign ministry office. He, however, did not make it clear if the Malaysian government had slapped a permanent ban on Bangladesh workers. According to a report by India's state-run PTI news agency from Malaysia, the Malaysian deputy minister for human resources Sunday said, "At the moment, there are some 2.6 million foreign workers in Malaysia. The number is sufficient. There should be a halt to the intake of foreign workers." Iftekhar said the Malaysian government often imposed curbs on import of foreign workers as it did not need an "unlimited number" of foreign workers. "Very often Malaysian government says so (banning import of foreign workers). The labour demand in Malaysia is not unlimited," the foreign affairs adviser said. "Our flow [of labour export] is continuing uninterrupted as the high commission (in Kuala Lumpur) has reported to me." The adviser said the Malaysian government could be taking a cautious approach to allowing in foreign workers as human traffic rule came into force from Jan 1. "Malaysia has enforced the rule with a view to reducing labour exploitation there," the adviser said. The Southeast Asian state imposed a temporary ban on further import of manpower from Bangladesh in September as some cheated workers staged demonstrations on the premises of Bangladesh mission in Kuala Lumpur. The temporary ban has not been withdrawn. The foreign affairs adviser had then told bdnews24.com that the ban would be lifted "soon". Last week, more than 200 Bangladeshi workers again took refuge at the Bangladesh high commission protesting alleged "exploitation and non-payment" by some companies. Earlier, Malaysia approved import of 2.5 lakh workers from Bangladesh. Bangladesh high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur Khairuzzaman Saturday night told bdnews24.com by telephone that the workers who had got clearance from Malaysian government were coming from Bangladesh. "Every day 500 to 600 workers are coming to Malaysia," he said. bdn
