 BAGHDAD, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqis were out all day on New Year's Eve buying cakes, balloons, party decorations and new clothes to celebrate the holiday in the hope of a more peaceful 2008. Many Baghdad residents said they planned to celebrate New Year's Eve properly for the first time in years as violence subsides in the capital after years of sectarian war. "My girlfriends, a cousin and I decided to gather in my house to celebrate," said Baraa, a 30-year-old woman carrying a big box of cake from the al-Tahouna pastry shop in central Baghdad's Karrada shopping district. "Last year we also tried to gather but my cousin was killed on New Year's Eve. God willing, this year things will go well." Like many Iraqis she said she will miss absent family like her brother, one of about 2 million Iraqis who have fled abroad.

Some shops decorated their front windows with cotton wool, writing: "Welcome 2008" or "Happy New Year". Others had Santa Claus decorations and Christmas trees. In a flower shop Iyad Issa, 42, was buying a New Year's Eve bouquet for his wife. "Since we see things are getting better, I am trying to make my family happy. I decided to bring my wife flowers for New Year's Eve to bring happiness and renewal," he said while browsing among the blossoms. In another street, Abu Wisam, 42, was buying party hats from a street vendor: "I wish the best to all Iraqis," he said. A group of women in a nearby boutique were out shopping together for outfits to see in the New Year. "Tonight I am invited to a wedding party. Then I will go with my husband to our friend's house to celebrate," said Azhar, 35, who was looking for a new dress suit. "I wish peace to prevail, and nothing els
