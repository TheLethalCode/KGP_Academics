<TEXT>
 Nairobi, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shanty-towns blazed, ethnic gangs fought and the opposition planned further protests as President Mwai Kibaki began a second term in office on Monday after a disputed election that has convulsed Kenya. Kibaki, 76, showed a steely core by swearing himself in within an hour of being pronounced victor in an election denounced as fraudulent by opposition challenger Raila Odinga and questioned by international and Kenyan observers. Odinga's supporters said he would be declared president at a rival ceremony on Monday, but police banned the event. "This is the saddest day in the history of democracy in this country. It is a coup d'etat," said Koki Muli, head of respected local watchdog, the Institute of Education in Democracy. Kibaki now faces the momentous task of reuniting a country split pretty much down the middle by an election that has brought several dozen deaths, first during campaign rallies and then in an explosion of violence over the results. The turmoil threatens to deter investors from east Africa's largest economy and damage Kenya's reputation as an oasis of relative stability in a volatile and war-scarred region. "With the elections behind us now ... I urge all of us to set aside the passions that were excited," Kibaki pleaded. Jubilant supporters danced in the streets and burned tyres in celebration in his highland hometown of Othaya -- a sharp contrast to the angry fires in his rival's strongholds. "We have been blessed!" said 60-year-old teacher Kiruki Wanjima in Nyamari village, where Kibaki has a tea farm. And while Britain and the European Union expressed concerns, Washington sent its congratulations to Kibaki, a key ally in its war against al Qaeda in east Africa. "We are in for a period of violence and turbulence, without doubt," said Nairobi-based businessman and analyst Robert Shaw. So controversial was the final result that the head of the electoral board, Samuel Kivuitu, had to abandon his public announcement, escorted by military police, after the podium was stormed by heckling opposition supporters. Within the hour, he was joking at Kibaki's side during a swearing-in on the lawn of Nairobi's State House. "NO PEACE" From there, smoke could be seen rising from protests in the Mathare, Kibera and Kawangware slums, where pro-opposition ethnic Luos and Luhyas went on the rampage in fury at what they perceived to be a stolen election. About a dozen people were killed during the day, witnesses said, as rioting spread across the country, particularly in the western town of Kisumu, an opposition stronghold. In Nairobi's pro-opposition Kibera slum -- one of Africa's largest -- police fired teargas and shot into the air to disperse crowds at night. Sporadic violence continued all over town, with occasional gun shots audible, witnesses said. In the early morning hours, scores of paramilitary police armed with guns, riot shields and batons could be seen patrolling central Nairobi's otherwise silent, deserted streets. Security forces have so far been restrained but Kenyans fear a bloodbath if they crack down by shooting at rioters. Having led every opinion poll bar one since September, then taken a strong lead in early results, the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) was dismayed to see Kibaki pip it. Kibaki took 4.58 million votes to Odinga's 4.35 million -- but the results were marred by accusations from both sides of multiple voting, disappeared returning officers and "doctoring." Opposition supporters saw the result as a plot by Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's largest, to keep power by any means. "It's not that we don't like Kikuyus -- it's because they think they have a right to rule this country forever, even if it means stealing votes," said businessman Samuel Abua. Odinga, hoping to fulfil the dream that eluded his father -- nationalist hero Jaramogi Oginga Odinga -- wiped tears away at a post-results news conference. His party issued a defiant statement: "We are inviting Kenyans to Uhuru Park, Monday the 31st of December, 2007, at 2 p.m., for the presentation to the nation of the People's President, elected Honourable Raila Amolo Odinga." Police said they would crack down on such an "illegal" gathering, in Nairobi's park for 'Freedom' in Swahili
