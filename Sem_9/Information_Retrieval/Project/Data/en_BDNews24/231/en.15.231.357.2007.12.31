 Washington, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States congratulated Mwai Kibaki as the winner of Kenya's presidential election and urged calm in the African nation disrupted by rioting, said a State Department spokesman on Sunday. Kibaki was sworn into office for a second five-year term shortly after Kenya's electoral commission declared him the victor on Sunday. Political rival Raila Odinga called the vote rigged and announced an alternative inauguration for Monday. "The United States congratulates the winners and is calling for calm, and for Kenyans to abide by the results declared by the election commission. We support the commission's decision," said spokesman Robert McInturff. He reiterated a State Department statement from Saturday that asked Kenyans "to reject violence and respect the rule of law." "Regardless of the eventual winners of this election, we call on Kenyans across the political spectrum to work together to advance democracy and national development," said the earlier statement, issued before the results were announced. The disputed election victory triggered deadly riots by tens of thousands of opposition supporters
