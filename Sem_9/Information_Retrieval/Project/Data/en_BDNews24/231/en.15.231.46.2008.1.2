 Gaza, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel launched an attack in Gaza City on Wednesday, killing at least four Hamas militants and wounding two, Palestinian medical staff and the Islamist Hamas group said. An Israeli army spokeswoman said the attack was mounted from the air and ground after gunmen fired several anti-tank missiles at Israeli troops operating in the area.
