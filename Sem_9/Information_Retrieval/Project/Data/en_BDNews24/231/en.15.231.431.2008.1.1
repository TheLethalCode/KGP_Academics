 COLOMBO, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops have killed 25 Tamil Tiger rebels and three soldiers have died in the fighting in the north of the country, the military said on Tuesday, as the long-running civil war flares again. Clashes in the northern Jaffna peninsula, northern district of Vavuniya and northern Welioya area were the latest engagements in the renewed civil war which has brought near daily air raids, bombings and land and sea battles. "Troops killed 24 LTTE terrorists in clashes in Vavuiniya, Jaffna and Welioya on Monday," said a spokesman at the Media Centre for National Security, asking not to be named in line with standard policy. The military also said three soldiers were killed in the fighting. Another Tamil Tiger rebel was killed on Tuesday in Jaffna peninsula. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are seeking to carve out an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment on the fighting. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened. Analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. The military has vowed to wipe out the Tigers militarily, and is seeking to drive the rebels out of the north western district of Mannar after evicting them from vast swathes of jungle terrain they controlled in the east. More than 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the LTTE fighters since early 2006 alone, taking the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,000. Military analysts say there is no clear winner on the horizon, and fear the war could grind on for years.
