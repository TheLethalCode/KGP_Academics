<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)The council of advisers Sunday did not approve the antiterrorism ordinance as it said "terrorism" was not clearly defined in the draft law, a government spokesman said. The law ministry has been directed to place the ordinance again after clearly defining terrorism and reviewing other related issues, which were discussed at a cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, chaired by interim leader Fakhruddin Ahmed. Of the five proposals which were on Sunday's agenda, two were approved in principle and the related ministries were asked to present the rest later. After the meeting, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters that the draft Antiterrorism Ordinance 2007 did not define terrorism clearly. "So the proposal has been sent back," he said. An initiative was taken in 2006 to make an antiterrorism law, but it did not get through. On Feb 4, the home ministry sent a letter to the Chief Adviser's Office to finalise the ordinance. The press secretary said the revised draft has 45 sections, whereas the earlier draft had 68. Different countries including India and Pakistan passed such laws. Bangladesh has also signed such convention at the international level. "The law is important for Bangladesh," Munaim said, adding that the meeting discussed international financial transactionsan issue which requires a clear definition. "The draft did not make the issue clear. The advisers discussed whether financial transactions would be included in the laws on money laundering or terrorist activities," Munaim said. The draft was not specific about banned outfits. An article said if a person claims himself to be the member of a banned organisation he would be sentenced to a maximum of six months in prison. The draft included some important points including filing cases, trial, and punishment of the guilty. The press secretary said the Bangladesh Television Authorities Ordinance, Plant Varieties Protection and Farmers Rights Ordinance and a proposal on extending the Open Sky Policy were also presented at the meeting. The council of advisers approved in principle the Open Sky Policy and Plant Varieties Protection and Farmers Rights Ordinance. bdnews24.c
