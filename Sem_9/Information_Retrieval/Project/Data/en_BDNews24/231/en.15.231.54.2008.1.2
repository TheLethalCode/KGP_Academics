 NAIROBI, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mwai Kibaki's government accused rival Raila Odinga's party of unleashing "genocide" in Kenya on Wednesday as the death toll from tribal violence over a disputed election passed 300. "It is becoming clear that these well-organised acts of genocide and ethnic-cleansing were well-planned, financed and rehearsed by Orange Democratic Movement leaders prior to the general elections," the statement read by Lands Minister Kivutha Kibwana on behalf of his colleagues said. ODM had no immediate reaction to the accusation. Odinga's supporters, drawn mainly from his Luo tribe, have blamed the violence on Kibaki for "stealing" the Dec. 27 presidential vote. Many clashes have pitted the Luo against Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe. In an apparent olive branch to ODM, Kibaki invited all members of the new opposition-dominated parliament to a meeting at State House in Nairobi on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how many opposition legislators would attend. The use of the word genocide will horrify Kenyans, used to being viewed by the world as a stable democracy, investment and tourist destination and oasis of peace in an otherwise volatile region scarred by like the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Kenya is an important ally of the West in its counter-terrorism efforts, takes growing money-flows from China, and is used to being the peacemaker -- rather than the conflict focus -- in African hot-spots like Somalia and Sudan. Since independence from Britain in 1963, the president's Kikuyu tribe has dominated political and business life in what is now East Africa's biggest and fastest-growing economy. Western powers have called for calm and urged international institutions like the African Union and Commonwealth to try to reconcile Kibaki and Odinga. Both parties accuse the other of vote-rigging and Odinga plans a mass rally for Thursday. "There are independent reports of serious irregularities in the counting process," said British Foreign Minister David Miliband and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a joint statement. They called for an end to violence and "an intensive political and legal process" to end the crisis. As young men armed with machetes manned roadblocks in rural areas, a trickle of office workers in the capital Nairobi made it through police cordons to begin the new working year. "They call this democracy," said a central bank worker, delayed by police as he tried to get to work. A local and an international rights group gave a death-toll of "more than 300" and accused Kenyan security forces of having "bloodily repressed" protests by opposition supporters. "As a reaction, some protesters are responsible for the assassination of Kikuyus,"added the Kenya Human Rights Commission and the International Federation for Human Rights.. And in a chilling chain reaction, there were growing examples on Wednesday of revenge killings by Kikuyu militants, including the notorious Mungiki gang, on members of pro-opposition tribes. The turmoil caused confusion in local markets. Currency trading was delayed then muted, while stocks went lower, and tea and coffee auctions were postponed. "If some normality comes back, we will resuscitate the business," a tea broker told Reuters. On Tuesday, about 30 Kikuyus died when a mob set fire to a church where they had taken sanctuary in the western town of Eldoret -- reviving memories of the slaughter in churches of hundreds of thousands in Rwanda's 1994 genocide. The Eldoret attack was one the worst episodes of violence that has uprooted nearly 100,000 Kenyans, some of them fleeing across the border to Uganda. Adding to the chaos, Kenya's electoral commission head Samuel Kivuitu said: "I do not know" when asked if Kibaki won the vote. The comment by Kivuitu, who pronounced Kibaki victor on Sunday, stunned Kenya and cast further doubt on the result. Western powers have warned their citizens against visiting the country, whose tourism sector was its top earner at about $800 million a year. African Union chairman John Kufuor was planning to fly to Kenya and start mediation, while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was on the phone to both sides. "There are elections in other parts of Africa over the next 18 months, in Angola, in Ghana, in Malawi. Kenya is very, very important in itself and is important for what it says about the rest of Africa and its approach to democracy," Miliband said. A Reuters reporter flying over Eldoret saw plumes of white smoke billowing blazing homesteads. Youths with machetes, rocks and bows and arrows could be seen manning crude checkpoints. There was early calm in Nairobi slums on Wednesday but residents said Mungiki, a gang with roots in traditional Kikuyu rites including circumcision, dropped leaflets warning of reprisals against Luos. In Naivasha town in Kenya's Rift Valley, scores of people were injured in revenge attacks for the church killings, and about 300 terrified locals spent the night camped at a police station and prison for safety. "We had to seek refuge in the only safe place we know," said Agnes Alouch, in the prison hall. Kibaki was sworn in on Sunday after official election results showed he had narrowly beaten Odinga. The EU's observer mission said the poll had "fallen short of key international and regional standards for democratic elections". In comments broadcast on local TV, Kivuitu said he was pressured by Odinga and Kibaki's party colleagues to announce the poll results immediately. Four members of Kivuitu's team have said they would call for a judicial revi
