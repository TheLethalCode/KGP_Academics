 LONDON, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 20-year-old man has been found fatally shot in the head on a housing estate in south London, police said on Sunday. Police believe the man, who has yet to be formally identified, had been dead for more than 24 hours before his body was discovered on Thursday evening. It was found in a communal garden on the Aylesbury estate in Southwark. The man, who was wearing a grey hooded top and black trousers, is thought to have been shot at around 4 p.m. on Boxing Day. Police said a man wearing a hooded top had fired at the victim and a friend after they entered a stairwell on the estate. The pair fled but became separated. The dead man's friend reported him missing in the early hours of Thursday. The incident is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police's Trident unit, which deals with crime within the capital's black community. Police appealed for any witnesses to come forward. "At this early stage we need to establish what happened to the victim, who may have seen him and where did he go and what did he do before he was killed," said Detective Inspector Andy Barton.
