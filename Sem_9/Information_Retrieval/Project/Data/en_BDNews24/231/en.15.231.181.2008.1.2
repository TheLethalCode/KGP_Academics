 Dhaka, Jan 02 (bdnews24.com)  Global food, commodity and energy prices and a series of natural disasters reignited inflationary pressures through 2007. Taking into account the price hike trend, government and analysts anticipate inflation will edge upwards in 2008. Inflation, measured by overall consumers' price index, crossed double digits for a second time in 2007 standing at 10.06 percent on a point-to-point basis in October, from 9.60 percent in September 2007. It first reached double digits at 10.10 percent in July and 10.12 percent in August because of price escalation in both food and non-food items. The rate of inflation on food items reached 11.73 percent on a point-to-point basis in October, 2007 from 11.10 percent in September. "I see no possibility of reducing prices of essentials in 2008," Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said Monday. Food adviser Tapan Chowdhury has echoed the same concern, saying the government can do little to rein in soaring rice prices in particular. The outgoing calendar year saw the greatest price-hikes in the recent economic history of Bangladesh. Over the year, there was a huge escalation in the price of food itemsincluding rice, wheat flour, milk, vegetables and cooking oilcompared to the previous year. According to statistics of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, the government market-monitoring arm, the price of coarse rice rose throughout the year and reached Tk 28 in December 2007 from the previous year's Tk 18. The latest episode of price hikes in the last week of December pushed the price to Tk 30 a kg for coarse rice and up to Tk 40-42 for quality grains. The price of flour reached as high as Tk 38 during the last quarter of 2007. Middle and low-income earners are experiencing intolerable economic pressure from the soaring prices of flour after coarse rice. Edible oil is now being sold between Tk 86 and Tk 92 a kg from last year's Tk 60. The price of a kilo of milk powder is now selling at Tk 515, which was Tk 330 last year. The price of mutton has risen by 38.10 percent over the year, while the price of beef rose by 19.35 percent, according to TCB statistics. Prices of other essential commodities like potatoes, onions and lentils also rose significantly in 2007. President of Bangladesh Economic Association Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad said floods and Cyclone Sidr have caused damage to rice crops totalling at least 20 lakh tonnes, with the government forced to import this amount at a higher price. "I see no grounds for a price decline of essentials in 2008," Ahmad told bdnews24.com. "Increase agricultural production or pay more," he suggested. He also suggested the government to provide special economic packages for the poorest of the poor and for flood and cyclone victims so they could gain employment immediately. bdn
