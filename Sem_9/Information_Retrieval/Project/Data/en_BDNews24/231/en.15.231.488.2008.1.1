 Rohan Ziad Business Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  The year 2007 ended with a buoyant capital market although the runaway prices of commodities put strains on the economy. The country's prime bourse saw a whopping 139 percent rise in market capitalisation and a 91 percent increase in the index. The indicators of the Dhaka Stock Exchange set some new records. The benchmark DGEN or general index rose to an all time high of 3093.54 on Nov 19. Turnover also hit a new peak with a total transaction of Tk 3.168 billion on Oct 22. Sixteen initial public offerings (IPO) worth Tk 5.82 billion, also a record, hit the marketing 2007. All the IPOs were oversubscribed, which analysts see as an expression of the investors' confidence in the capital market. A good number of state-owned companies listed on the bourse and the market was upbeat on the news of the mobile phone operators going for public listing in 2008. The Dhaka Stock Exchange looks to the future in high spirits. The prime bourse pinned hopes on market diversification, helped by the expansion of the bond market, futures market and internet-based trade. The year 2007 has been a bumpy ride, though, for investors whose expectations of bumper returns on their money crashed several times on interference by the market regulators. At the beginning of the year the market saw a buoyant trend on easing political instability. But the government's anticorruption drive sent chills down the spine of the investors. The restrictions imposed on merchant bank lending, commonly known as margin loans, by the Securities and Exchange Commission prompted the investors to take to the streets. The protests forced the regulator to retreat. Huge inflows of liquidity and entry of new investors drove the market in 2007, but the hype did not echo the economy's overall performance and corporate earnings. "Parts of access liquidity in trading sectors and banks contributed to the huge liquidity inflow. Every indicators of the market went up this year, but the corporate earnings and the economy did not act accordingly. This type of contradiction might not augur well for the economy," said Abu Ahmed, who teaches economics at Dhaka University. The year also saw increased participations of institutional investors such as banks, non-banking financial institutions, merchant banks and mutual funds. "Institutional investors also directed a good amount of funds into the market," said Ahmed. The regulator was also seen seemingly hyperactive. "But the SEC was only keen on overseeing the market with their readjusting of margin loans and sorts of things; more should have been done to increase availability of stocks in the market," said Ahmed. He criticised the policymakers for not doing enough to make the private sector, especially foreign entities such as multinational banks, corporations and mobile phone companies, to enter the capital market. Ahmed said not tasking the secretaries to the government to take the initiative to bring the firms to the market was one of the major policy flaws. "Why do we have to act like inferiors to the multinationals? Why can't the government bodies put pressure on them? We have been hearing about a negotiation with Unilever for a long time, but we are yet to see any results. "The central bank is also doing nothing to make the multinational banks come to the market except renewing their licences every year," he said. Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, termed the year 2007 a good year for the market bar the overheating of some share prices at the end of the year. Speaking of several interventions the regulator had made throughout the year, the SEC chief admitted that an ideal market should not see such interferences. "However some measures had to be taken to take care of the market's volatility," he added. Siddiqi said in the upcoming year they would try to find the reasons for private sector's reluctance to come to the market and take initiatives to introduce book-building process for new IPOs. Dhaka Stock Exchange's chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed said the demand for more securities increased but the supply was not creating pressure on the share prices accordingly. Foreign portfolio investment also doubled this year, with the total portfolio turnover touching Tk 11 billion, he added. Both the SEC and DSE chiefs thanked the government for the decision to offload stakes of some state-owned entities. Market analyst and chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh, Yaweer Sayeed, saw the past year as a foundation for a good year despite the turbulences. "The indicators went up with some all-time high records set and record number of IPOs entering the market. A lot of good things happened which could be seen as prerequisites for a vibrant capital market next year," he added. Sayeed stressed increased initiatives to tailor policies to meet the demands of investors. bdn
