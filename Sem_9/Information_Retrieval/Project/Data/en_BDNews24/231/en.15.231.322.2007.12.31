 NAIROBI, Mon Dec 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police battled protesters in blazing slums on Monday as President Mwai Kibaki began a second term after a disputed vote that has hurt Kenya's democratic credentials and brought a death toll rising into the dozens. Riots convulsed the nation, from opposition strongholds in the west near the Uganda border to Nairobi's shanty-towns and the port of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean Coast. In the western town of Kisumu, a hotbed of opposition support, 21 bodies lay in and around a hospital mortuary, brought in overnight and in the morning, witnesses said. Most had gunshot wounds. In Nairobi's Mathare slum, police told residents to remain in their homes under threat of being shot, witnesses said. "Police are saying on loudspeakers from trucks that anyone found outside will be shot dead," said taxi driver Argwings Odera. The turmoil threatens to deter investors from east Africa's largest economy and damage Kenya's reputation as an oasis of relative stability in a volatile and war-scarred region. Much of the fighting pitched Luos, who support opposition leader Raila Odinga, against Kibaki's ethnic Kikuyu group. "No Raila, No Peace!" chanted youths in Nairobi's Kibera slum -- one of Africa's largest. They lit bonfires in the road and torched a petrol station before police moved in to fire teargas and bullets in the air. Several bodies lay in the dirt alleys. In Korogocho slum, rocked by clashes between protesters and police, a witness reported seeing 15 bodies. Witnesses and local media reported about 30 more deaths, bringing the death toll to around 65 since Thursday's vote. Trying to defuse one of the most volatile moments in Kenya since 1963 independence, the government kept a ban on live TV broadcasts and flooded the streets with security forces. Siren-blaring ambulances and armored cars with water cannon rushed through the streets of Nairobi in the direction of Kibera, Mathare and Kawangware slums, where smoke could be seen rising. Helicopters flew overhead. "We are in an undeclared state of emergency," said a statement from civil society groups. "The consequences of a stolen election must be clear to all Kenyans." Both sides alleged rigging. With a reputation as a mild-mannered, old-school gentleman, Kibaki, 76, showed a steely core by swearing himself in within an hour of being pronounced victor in an election denounced as fraudulent by Odinga and questioned by international observers. "The tallying process lacks credibility," chief European Union monitor Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told Reuters. Former colonial ruler Britain also expressed concern although the United States sent congratulations to Kibaki. MEDIA BAN Odinga's supporters said he would be declared the "people's president" at a rival ceremony on Monday in Nairobi's Uhuru (Freedom) Park -- but police banned the event. As supporters celebrated in his highland homeland, Kibaki urged Kenyans to "set aside the passions" from a vote he won by a narrow margin of 230,000 votes in the nation of 36 million. So controversial was the final result that the electoral board's chairman had to abandon his public announcement on Sunday when heckling opposition supporters stormed the podium. Within the hour, he was joking at Kibaki's side during a snap swearing-in on the lawn of Nairobi's State House. Kibaki now faces the momentous task of reuniting a country split along ethnic lines by an election that, taking into account campaign violence, has brought several dozen deaths. Affectionately known by fans as "Mzee", a term for addressing a respected elder, Kibaki turned round a dire economy under his strongman predecessor Daniel arap Moi into average 5 percent growth since 2002. A ban on live media broadcasts, within minutes of Kibaki's swearing-in, was criticized by activists as an attack on press freedom in a country usually described as one of the continent's most vibrant democracies. Scores of paramilitary police armed with guns, riot shields and batons patrolled the streets and guarded shopping centers to head off looters. Nairobi's large expatriate community cowered in their homes, while tourists were bewildered. Having led every opinion poll bar one since September, then taken a strong lead in early results, the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) was dismayed to see Kibaki pip it. Kibaki took 4.58 million votes to Odinga's 4.35 million -- but the results were marred by accusations of multiple voting, disappeared returning officers and "doctorin
