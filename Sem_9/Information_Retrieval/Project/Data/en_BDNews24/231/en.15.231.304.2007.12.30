<TITLE> Facts on Benazir's widower </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Benazir Bhutto's party appointed her son Bilawal and her husband Asif Ali Zardari to succeed the slain Pakistani opposition leader on Sunday. Here are some facts about her widower: As Bhutto's widower and a former minister in one of her governments, Zardari has the most experience and on paper is an obvious choice as political heir. But he is a divisive figure who wrestled with allegations of corruption for a decade. Even some Bhutto supporters regard him as a flawed character whose taste for power and the high life undermined her legacy. Zardari, who spent eight years in jail on corruption and drug-smuggling charges, denied any wrongdoing, accusing Bhutto's political opponents of concocting the allegations to ruin them. Zardari married Bhutto in an arranged union brokered by their mothers in 1987, a year before Bhutto was elected to her first term as prime minister. The son of a politician from Bhutto's own party, Zardari had the right political pedigree, but it was an uneven match in terms of family wealth and status. Zardari's family owned some farm land and a cinema in Karachi and indulged his passion for polo, but the Bhutto family was one of Pakistan's feudal landowners, an elite that has traditionally dominated Pakistani business and party politics. Within months of Benazir Bhutto's first election victory in 1988, allegations of suspicious deals involving state money and Zardari started to surface in newspapers. The president dismissed her government for corruption and misrule in 1990, but it was not until the end of her second term, in 1996, that international inquiries began to rake over state deals and bank transfers. Zardari, who became known as "Mr 10 Percent", accused Bhutto's successor as premier and her old foe, Nawaz Sharif, of trumping up allegations he had siphoned off state funds and taken multi-million-dollar kickbacks on plane and submarine deals. For some Pakistanis, though, Zardari showed genuine strength of character during his time in jail, which took a toll on his health.
