 LONDON, Dec 31 (bdnews2.com/Reuters) - The Police Federation has offered an "olive branch" to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, asking her to reconsider a decision over pay that has angered hundreds of thousands of officers, media reported on Monday. Earlier this month the Federation, which represents 140,000 officers in England and Wales, called on Smith to resign and said it would ballot its members on whether they should overturn a ban preventing them from taking strike action.

Police are currently banned from striking under laws introduced in the 1990s. They have been backed by a number of Chief Constables while Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair, the country's most senior officer, has said he could not understand why the government had decided to "pick a fight" with the poli
