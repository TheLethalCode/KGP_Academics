 LONDON, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil and gold prices stayed close to record highs on Monday, while global stock indices slipped as political instability mounted in nuclear-armed Pakistan and trading volume stayed thin on the last day of 2007. Markets in Japan, South Korea, China, Germany and Italy were closed while London and Paris have a shortened trading day but shares in Pakistan slid almost 5 percent to a three-week low in their first reaction to the killing of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, whose death last week plunged the country into crisis. The index is not allowed to move more than 5 percent in a session. The Pakistani rupee fell to a six-year low against the dollar. Bhutto was killed on Thursday ahead of Jan. 8 elections, throwing into doubt a smooth transition to civilian-led democracy after almost a decade of military rule. The turmoil has helped trigger a flight to safer assets like bonds precious metals while the yen is benefiting from investors' reluectance to hold risky positions over the holiday. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was marginally weaker while Britain's FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 eased about 0.3 percent. The pan-European index looks set to end the year with gains of about 1.5 percent versus 16 percent in 2006 -- its worst annual performance since 2002. Japan's Nikkei. "The outlook for 2008 is uncertain, as it has been for some time... We haven't yet bid farewell to the credit issues." The year has been a rollercoaster one marked by fears of a U.S. recession on back of a housing slump and a credit crunch caused by banks' exposure to subprime mortgage securities. But emerging equities have outperformed, the benchmark MSCI index ending 7 percent off the intra-year record high but having risen over 40 percent for the year. This compares with gains of 9 percent for its global peer. "It's fair to say we did have a kind of safe-haven effect, as money moved out of G7 credit and other categories into emerging markets," said Beat Siegenthaler, chief strategist at TD Securities in London. "People's view of emerging markets as being less risky has been changing for a long time but this year it became a mainstream view as many of these markets are standing more on their own feet in terms of economic growth," he said. Oil prices held over $96 a barrel heading for the biggest annual gain this decade as geo-politics and dwindling stocks in consumer nations outweighed the risk of a slower U.S. economy. Prices are up almost 58 percent this year. Similarly, gold rallied to a 7-week high and close to a record level of $850 on speculative buying driven by the weak dollar and Pakistan. The metal has risen more than 30 percent this year -- the biggest annual gain since 1979. "Investors continue to be attracted by (gold's) safe-haven qualities following the summer's sub-prime/credit turmoil and the recent spike in geo-political tensions. (This is) is a theme we believe will continue through 2008," said James Moore, analyst at TheBullionDesk.com. DOLLAR BLUES Gold's gain has been the dollar's loss. The dollar tumbled to 3-week lows, capping a bad year as it has fallen 11.5 percent against the euro, 16 percent versus the Canadian dollar and 5.9 percent to the yen. Weak U.S. housing data, heralding further rate cuts, is weighing on the dollar. The euro eased a touch off the three-week high around $1.4744. The yen gained half a percent against both the dollar and the euro, while the greenback languished at a three-week low against a currency basket. U.S. Treasuries firmed further after yields eased to one-week lows late on Friday after the weak housing numbers, with yields on the 10-year note at 4.07 percent. "We expect to see another Fed rate cut in January, and in March," said David Mann, strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore. "Evidence of a housing slowdown is unquestionable, more important is how much this will hit consumer spending." Investors are hoping for a clearer picture of the extent of interbank lending stress as 2008 gets underway and funding pressures due to banks' year-end book squaring dissipa
