 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  A heated argument between state counsel ABM Sharfuddin Ahmed Khan and Sheikh Hasina's defence lawyers halted the special court proceedings of an extortion case against Hasina for 20 minutes Monday. bdnews24.com Correspondents Sumon Mahbub and Prodip Kumar Chowdhury witnessed the incident at the special court on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises during the hearing of the case filed by Azam J Chowdhury against the former prime minister. The argument began after Hasina standing in the dock asked Sharfuddin Ahmed Khan why the courtroom was not made larger to prevent overcrowding. Khan replied by asking: "Why did not you do it when you were in power?" Hasina said: "We did not want to turn our sacred parliament into a court." Khan's reply angered Hasina's lawyers, who shouted for an apology from Khan and asked him to take back his words. Some of the defence lawyers called Khan "insolent" and an "agent of Ershad". At one stage, judge Md Azizul Haque also asked Khan to withdraw his words, and the court returned to calm after the state counsel withdrew his comment. The argument took place shortly before Hasina fell ill and was taken back to special jail during the court proceedings. bdnews24.
