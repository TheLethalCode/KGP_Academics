<TITLE> Media hype over Madhuri Dixit sank 'Aaja Nachle' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Prithwish Ganguly MUMBAI, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "Aaja Nachle" turned out to be a resounding failure and its director holds the media responsible - for harping on Madhuri Dixit's comeback but ignoring the film's theme. Even the film's reviews dealt only with the superstar's acting prowess and dancing skills, said Anil Mehta. "Madhuri was surely the face of the film and with she making a comeback all eyes was bound to be on her," the filmmaker said. "But I'm disappointed that media completely neglected the point 'Aaja Nachle' had tried to convey." Mehta feels the film's twin themes of women as breadwinners and the importance of art were overshadowed by the media's obsession with Dixit's comeback. But not without reason. In her prime, Dixit was the undisputed queen of Bollywood and when she decided to return after a six-year break that saw her getting married and having two children, anticipation was bound to be high. Her much-hyped role saw the 42-year-old actress play a divorced New York-based choreographer who returns to India to save a theatre from demolition. "The film wanted to show how art is important for reviving our soul that is trapped in consumerist existence where people are only existing and not living their lives," said Mehta. But the Dixit magic wasn't enough to pull the film through and "Aaja Nachle" sank at the box-office. "I thought I had made a good enjoyable film but sadly there were not many takers for it."
