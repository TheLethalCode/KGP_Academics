 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation of World Bank Group Lars H Thunell will arrive in Dhaka in February to discuss ways to scale up its activities here with the private sector, a senior government official said Wednesday. "IFC is keen to boost its activities in Bangladesh after WB president Zoellick's recent visit," Shaheedul Haque, additional secretary of the Economic Relations Division, told bdnews24.com. IFC's involvement is not significant so far, he added. IFC provided $22.5 million from its own account and a syndicated loan of $29 million to Khulna Power Plant to build, own and operate the first independent power company in Bangladesh in 1999, according to IFC's Dhaka office. In 2000, it provided $16.7 million loan and an equity investment of $1.57 million to Grameen Phone to help build a nationwide cellular telecoms network. The corporation approved a $13 million guarantee to establish a two-year $52 million guarantee facility designed to benefit private sector importers and exporters. It also provided a financial package of $60 million to Lafarge Surma Cement in 2002. The ERD official said Thunell will discuss with the chief adviser, finance adviser and the private sector people. Thunell will also visit Dhaka-based garment factories. "We're working on it," Haque said. bd
