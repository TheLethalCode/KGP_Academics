<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki underwent medical tests in a London hospital on Sunday and his office described the results as "reassuring". "The results of the examinations were good and very reassuring, he will have additional examinations tomorrow, God willing," Maliki's office said in a statement. "We assure the sons of Iraq there is nothing to worry about concerning the health of the prime minister," it added. Maliki, 57, told state television on Saturday that he was going for a routine medical checkup. An official in his office said he was seeking treatment for mild exhaustion. Aides to Maliki said he had planned the trip for more than a month but decided not to leave until after the Islamic Eid al-Adha festival was over. He has been under pressure from Washington to speed up the passage of laws seen as crucial to reconciling Iraq's warring sects.
