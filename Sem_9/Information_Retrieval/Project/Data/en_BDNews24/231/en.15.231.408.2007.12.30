 KARACHI, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif's party is likely to abandon plans to boycott an upcoming general election, a party spokesman said on Sunday. It said it was reviewing its boycott decision after slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's party declared it would contest the election, currently scheduled for Jan 8. "It is likely that the party will take part...," said Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League, said. "If they don't mind contesting elections after Benazir Bhutto's assassination, then there is no point in our boycotting general elections," he added. Sharif had announced his party would boycott the vote after his rival Bhutto was assassinated in a suicide attack on Thursday. Officials however have suggested the general election could be delayed for several weeks.
