<TEXT>
 Derry, N.H., Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Hampshire teenager Bjarna O'Brien has been attending political events since she was five, but she says she only started to understand what was going on when she was seven. "I used to hate it when I was little but not any more, I like going now," the 14-year-old said after meeting Republican presidential hopeful John McCain at a diner in the town of Derry with her mother and 6-year-old sister Abigail. "When I was little I just went for cookies and snacks," O'Brien said. "I spent a lot of time listening and ended up starting to understand. But most of the time I didn't know what was going on, until I was, like, seven." By now, O'Brien has developed opinions which she says are only partly shaped by her mother, who home schools the two sisters. She says McCain is not tough enough on illegal immigration and that abortion is "worse than murder." New Hampshire and Iowa have historically been the first states to make their choice in the state-by-state battle to pick presidential candidates in November's election. Iowa voters decide on Thursday and New Hampshire next Tuesday. Kids may not be able to vote but every politician knows the value of a picture with a cute baby. And in New Hampshire, many parents seem determined to get their children involved. John Kelly, an 11-year-old who met McCain by chance at another New Hampshire diner on Tuesday, talks fluently about the need to do more for the middle class and about Republican hopeful Mitt Romney's record of raising taxes. "The main point is people need to stick up for the middle class because the last couple of years it's been for the higher class," he said, adding that he opposes the Iraq war and believes there should be laws to make cars fuel-efficient. UNDERSTANDING EARLY Eight-year-old Thomas Perkins was driven through a snowstorm on Tuesday to a New Hampshire town hall meeting. He couldn't remember which politician visited his school recently, though his mother Sandra tried to remind him. "I don't want him to grow up not really understanding that people have a say," she said. "I want him to understand that people vote and we have a say." New Hampshire children may get a lot of politics, but their political immersion is nothing to that of Democratic contender John Edwards' children, Jack, 9, and Emma-Clarie, 7. Aides say the children are under no pressure to participate, but they form an important part of the narrative Edwards wants voters to hear, showing his family's closeness despite personal circumstances exacerbated by his wife Elizabeth Edwards' fight against cancer. When they do participate, the Edwards children sit on stage during the introduction before retiring to the campaign bus. At an event in Ames, Iowa, on Tuesday Elizabeth asked Jack if he wanted to address the crowd. She handed him the microphone, but he wouldn't speak. Democrat Barack Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha (9 and 6), rarely appear in public but they did join him at a New Year's day rally in Des Moines, Iowa. The two girls looked embarrassed as they stood on the stage before about 750 cheering, sign-waving supporters
