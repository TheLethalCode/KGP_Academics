<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan Finance Minister Amos Kimunya said on Wednesday the shilling currency was `within control' following a disputed presidential election that sparked ethnic clashes and threatens to drive away foreign investment. "(The central bank) has not raised any alarm. (The shilling) is within control," Kimunya said, urging foreign investors to remain engaged in east Africa's biggest economy. "People will be on a wait and see attitude so there will be little trading. We still have a good comfort zone, so we are not panicking on that," he told a news conference. Post-election turmoil muted foreign currency trade and pushed stocks lower on Wednesday as Kenya's tea and coffee auctions were postponed. The shilling opened after a two-hour delay to the start of trade at 63.70/80 -- the level it closed at on Dec. 24, before Christmas holidays and the Dec. 27 general election. The delay was designed to give commercial banks time to talk to clients and determine the level of supply and demand for the U.S. currency. But no trade was reported for hours. "We've not traded. It's a wait and see attitude," said Chris Muthoka, a Citibank bank. "It's best for us to calm down before we see panic buying. It's very difficult for anyone right now to put a value on the shilling." Dealers expect the local unit, which strengthened gradually throughout 2007, to depreciate sharply against the dollar due to the post-election violence that has killed some 250 people. "The shilling will definitely weaken and it is expected to weaken sharply," said Anthony Kirui, head of market making at Barclays Bank. Stock brokers said prices had dipped by 7-8 percent on some counters on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. "There is a slight drop in prices virtually on all counters," said Bernard Kung'u, a dealer with Ashbhu Securities. "Under the circumstances, we were expecting less activity." He said turnover at 0910 GMT was 97 million shillings ($1.53 million), compared with 505 million shillings on Dec. 24, the last day of trade. The bourse's main NSE 20-share index closed trading at 5,444.83 points on Dec. 24, compared with an all-time high of 6,161.46 points hit on Jan. 12, 2007. TEA, COFFEE Elsewhere, Kenya's leading commodities sectors postponed their weekly auctions. A tea broker said the weekly tea auction scheduled to resume on Wednesday after the New Year break had been postponed until some "normality" resumed. "We are watching the situation: if some normality comes back, we will resuscitate the business," he told Reuters. The weekly coffee auction, scheduled to resume on Jan. 8, was pushed back by a week, an auction official said. Business leaders said trade across all sectors would be hurt if the turmoil persisted. The unrest has uprooted tens of thousands of people and squeezed fuel and food supplies. The country's business community said on Sunday that the government was losing 2 billion shillings ($31.35 million) a day in tax revenues for every day they had to stay closed because of the ethnic clashes and looting. Kenya, East Africa's largest economy, depends largely on tourism and agriculture to earn its foreign exchange and is also a manufacturing and financial services hub in the regi
