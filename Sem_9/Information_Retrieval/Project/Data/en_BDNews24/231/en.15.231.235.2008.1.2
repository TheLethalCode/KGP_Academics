<TITLE> BFF to finalise EGM date on Thursday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to finalise a date for the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in order to amend the BFF constitution. "It (EGM) should be held earlier," said acting president Monir Ahmed Wednesday. "The EGM will discuss the football associations (FAs) at the district and divisional levels and we will try to amend the BFF constitution with the inclusion of FAs in place of district sports associations (DSAs)," said Ahmed. The BFF executive committee, whose tenure expired in April last, had a dilemma to hold an EGM to discuss the FAs despite continual appeals from the ex-footballers and the organisers across the country. Senior vice president Monir Ahmed took over the responsibility on Dec 30 following SA Sultan's unwillingness to run the federation. Ahmed also had a meeting with sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury the next day to make the relation warm between the federation and the government, especially after outgoing president Sultan was involved in a battle of words with the sports adviser in early December.
