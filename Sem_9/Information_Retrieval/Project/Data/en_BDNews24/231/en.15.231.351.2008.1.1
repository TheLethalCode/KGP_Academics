 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com) Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was not taken to court Tuesday for the hearing of an extortion case, because of her illness. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque informed lawyers of both sides about the physical condition of Hasina, quoting jail authorities. Shamsul Haque Tuku, a lawyer for Hasina, told bdnews24.com that Hasina had not been produced before the court. The hearing into the charges started at 9:32am. Minutes later, the judge returned to his chamber. Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, co-accused with Hasina in the case, was taken to court at 9:00am. The former premier fell sick during the proceedings of the case Monday. Her lawyers had appealed to the court seeking permission for her to return to the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex, where she has been detained since July 16. The charges involve an alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury when Hasina was in office during 1996-2001. Azam filed the case on June 13 accusing Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana, now in London, and their cousin Selim. The Awami League denied the charges, saying the case was aimed at preventing Hasina contesting the polls, expected by 2008. The High Court halted the proceedings of the case on Dec 9 for three months and stayed the relocation of the courtroom to the Sangsad Bhaban premises after Hasina's lawyers moved a writ petition. But the Supreme Court on Dec 13 overruled the HC order after the state sought intervention to go ahead with the hearing. The law ministry on Nov 26 issued a gazette for relocating the courtroom to the Sangsad Bhaban area from Johnson Road in Old Dhaka for security reasons. But Hasina's lawyers had earlier argued that the government could not do so through such an order following the separation of the judiciary from the executive. The trial of Hasina started on Dec 3. Security officials arrested Hasina on July 16 at her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. Hours after the arrest, she was sent to the jail, pending trial. bdnews24.
