<TITLE> Lure of matching record excites Australians </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's players were struggling to contain their excitement at the prospect of equalling the world record for the most consecutive test wins, captain Ricky Ponting said. Australia have won their last 15 matches and can equal their own record if they win the second test against India, starting at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. Ponting said he did not want his players to become too distracted by the looming milestone but could not resist using it as a motivational tool at Tuesday's team meeting. "I don't want to be taking anything away from that or the team, which is why I did mention it to the team this morning," he told a news conference. "I wanted them to have a little bit of a taste of that, digest it, get away, prepare and come and play well. "I'm sure there will be a bit more excitement if we happen to win this test." The Australians go into the match as overwhelming favourites after crushing India by 337 runs in last week's first test in Melbourne. As expected, the selectors retained the same team that won the series opener and Ponting said the pressure was now on the Indians to raise their game. The tourists struggled against the Australian bowlers in Melbourne, failing to make 200 in either innings as the match ended in less than four days. "I think the Indian batsmen have got some concerns just because of how well we bowled last game," Ponting said. The Australian skipper also missed out on a big score in the series opener but said he was confident of making amends at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where he has scored 1,226 runs at an average of 81.73. "If I get in and get away here it will be a different story. Hopefully it's my turn," he said. "I'm training hard, I'm batting well, so I think it's only a matter of time before I get some runs. "There are lots of good feelings about being here and playing here... so hopefully that can be the case again this week.
