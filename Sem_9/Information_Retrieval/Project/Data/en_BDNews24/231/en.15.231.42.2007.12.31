<TITLE> Oil, gold buoyed by Pakistan turmoil </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Singapore, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices held above $96 a barrel and gold rallied close to a record high on Monday, lifted by mounting political instability in nuclear-armed Pakistan after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. Asian shares mostly steadied in holiday-shortened sessions with markets in Japan, South Korea and China closed, but shares in Pakistan slid in their first reaction to the killing of Bhutto whose death last week plunged the country into crisis. Turmoil in Pakistan continued to trigger a flight to less risky assets such as bonds and precious metals. Financial bookmakers in London expected Britain's FTSE 100 index to open between 2 and 4 points higher, and the French CAC 40 down 21 points to up 4 points. The dollar skidded to new lows as expectations of more US interest rate cuts enhanced the euro's yield advantage, while the yen gained from a reluctance to hold risky positions over the year-end holidays. Gold rallied to a 7-week high and close to a record level of $850 on speculative buying driven by the weak dollar and uncertainty in Pakistan. "There's still a potential for further unrest in Pakistan following Bhutto's assassination. I guess there's a potential for us to push higher and test the highs around $847 at least," said Darren Heathcote of Investec Australia in Sydney. Gold has risen more than 30 percent this year -- the biggest annual gain since 1979 -- as a number of factors, including a weak U.S. dollar, record-high crude prices, credit market turmoil and falling U.S. rates, boosted its safe-haven appeal. Bhutto was assassinated on Thursday ahead of elections scheduled for Jan. 8, throwing into doubt a smooth transition to civilian-led democracy after almost a decade of military-backed government under President Pervez Musharraf. In early trade, the benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 4.3 percent, close to the market's limit of 5 percent. The market was shut on Friday because of the assassination. Under market rules designed to prevent panic selling, the index cannot move by more than 5 percent in a day. Hong Kong shares ended 1.6 percent higher and were up 39 percent for the year, their best yearly gain since 1999. Taiwan's TAIEX and Singapore's Straits Times Index closed more than 1 percent up. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed down just 0.1 point at 6,339.8, but finished up 11.8 percent for the year despite recent volatility. U.S. stocks ended flat on Friday as sales of new homes fell in November to their lowest rate since 1995, reinforcing concerns that the housing and mortgage markets may be far from a recovery. Most financial markets globally will be closed on Tuesday for the New Year's Day holiday. OIL STEADY, DOLLAR STUMBLES But in spite of the risk of a softening US economy, oil headed for its biggest annual gain this decade on growing geopolitical concerns and dwindling consumer nation stockpiles. US light crude for February delivery stood 29 cents higher at $96.29 a barrel by 0512 GMT. Weak US housing data weighed on the dollar, which was further bogged down by a report in Britain's Observer newspaper which said Merrill Lynch needed more capital and was in talks with Chinese and Middle Eastern sovereign funds to sell more of itself. "This Merrill report is doing the rounds and having a depressing effect on the dollar, especially with the market so illiquid," said one trader at a local bank. Just last week, Merrill announced a $6.2 billion capital infusion from Singapore's state investment firm Temasek and money manager Davis Selected Advisers. In Asian trading, the euro was buying $1.4744 compared with $1.4714 late in New York on Friday and an early three-week high of $1.4747. The dollar also skidded to 111.96 yen from 112.63 late on Friday. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar eased 0.11 percent to 75.994, leaving it down more than 9 percent for the year as a whole. "We expect to see another Fed rate cut in January, and in March," said David Mann, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore. "Evidence of a housing slowdown is unquestionable, more important is how much this will hit consumer spending." That outlook drove two-year US Treasury yields down to 3.11 percent, far below comparable Euro yields of 4.0 percent
