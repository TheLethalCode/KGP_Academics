<TITLE> Committee submits Rangs report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  A special committee has recommended the demolition of the "whole" Rangs Building in what it said was the reverse process of construction, the government said in a statement Monday. The government opened a probe into the Dec 8 collapse of some floors of the 22-storey building, which killed 11 workers. In a report submitted to public works adviser Mainul Hosein, the committee cited "concrete shear failure" as the cause of the collapse. "The whole building needs to be demolished. Perhaps the best method would have been to demolish (the building) by explosives," the statement said. "Expertise for demolishing such a tall building within the congested area is unavailable," the statement said, adding that the demolition methodology should be the "reverse process of construction". The committee said it had based its recommendation on advice from BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology). Authorities had ordered the demolition of the structure because its construction violated rules. The city development authorities, Rajuk, chose to demolish the building by hand rather than with explosives. The report said the floors had come crashing down on heavy vibration from hammering during demolition work. "I told them (committee members) that I don't want to see any more dead from Rangs Building. If necessary, we will bring in experts from abroad," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. Rajuk started the demolition work on Aug 3, a day after it won a long-running legal battle in the Supreme Court. bdn
