 JERUSALEM, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defence Minister Ehud Barak said on Wednesday Israel would watch closely whether the Palestinian Authority fulfilled a promise to prosecute two suspects in the killing of two off-duty Israeli soldiers.

Palestinian security forces in Hebron arrested the two surviving gunmen the day after the attack, a Palestinian security official said. Palestinian Information Minister Riyad al-Malki said that if found guilty, the men would pay for their crimes in the West Bank. "The investigation is still going on. They will be tried and once there is a verdict they will stay in prison until they finish their sentence," said Malki, who also serves as foreign minister. Israel has argued in the past that the Palestinians have paid lip service to security, quickly freeing militants from jail in what it has termed a "revolving door" policy. Abbas's government has deployed hundreds of security men in chaotic West Bank towns as part of a Western-backed crackdown on gangsters and militants, and are at pains to prove they are exerting control in the territory following the takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas Islamists in Ju
