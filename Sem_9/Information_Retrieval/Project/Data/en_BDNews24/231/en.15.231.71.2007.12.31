 Mogadishu, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mortar strike in Somalia killed eight members of a family at a refugee camp on Sunday in the latest bloodshed of fighting between Islamist-led rebels and country's interim government, witnesses said. "My wife, five children and two of my relatives were killed by the blast," said Madey Sufi Moalim, who was buying supplies when the shell landed on the camp north of Mogadishu. "They were cut to pieces. My wife was pregnant and my children were aged two to eight. I'm being helped by neighbours who are helping me collect the pieces of my dead family."
