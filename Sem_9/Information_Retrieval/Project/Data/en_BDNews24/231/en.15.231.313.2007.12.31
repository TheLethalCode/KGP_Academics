<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troubled Brazilian striker Adriano, who joined Sao Paulo on loan from Inter Milan earlier this month, was involved in a car crash in the early hours of Monday morning, Brazilian media reported. The 25-year-old, already courting controversy after being photographed holding a beer can at a pop concert 10 days ago, escaped unscathed from the incident in Rio de Janeiro, where he is on holiday. Adriano's car was in collision with three other vehicles but nobody was hurt or arrested, reports said. Police could not immediately be reached for comment. Adriano, once one of Serie A's most feared strikers, moved to Sao Paulo after barely featuring for Inter in the last two seasons, which have seen him battling fitness and reported alcohol problems. His international career has also taken a turn for the worse and he has played only once for Brazil since the 2006 World Cup. On arriving at Sao Paulo, he promised to turn over a new leaf but only two days later was photographed at a pop concert in Rio with a beer can in his hand. He later complained that photographers were not respecting his privacy and promised he would be fit and ready for the new Brazilian season which starts in mid-January
