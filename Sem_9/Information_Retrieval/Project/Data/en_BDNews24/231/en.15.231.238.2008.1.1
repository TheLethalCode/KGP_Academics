<TITLE> Tense state election heats up new year in Germany </TITLE>

 BERLIN, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A battle over whether Germany should introduce a minimum wage will be the focal point of a regional election campaign with national implications that kicks off in the prosperous state of Hesse on Wednesday. The fight between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats ahead of Hesse's Jan. 27 vote threatens to put fresh strains on the government in Berlin, where the two parties share power in a loveless coalition. The SPD leader in Hesse, Andrea Ypsilanti, will launch a petition to raise her campaign's profile by collecting signatures for a minimum wage, which polls show most Germans want. CDU state premier Roland Koch and his party reject it. Germany is one of five European Union nations without a minimum wage. The SPD, badly trailing Merkel's CDU in polls for two years, has latched onto the minimum wage issue in hopes it will help narrow the gap ahead of a parliamentary vote in 2009. The Hesse election is one of four regional ballots in 2008 in states controlled by Merkel's conservatives. SPD leaders have said they would consider it a victory to take power in one of the four and identified the CDU in Hesse as most vulnerable. Koch, once a rising star but now struggling as polls show him in danger of losing his absolute majority and possibly even his office, tried to pre-empt the SPD's minimum wage campaign with a hard-line broadside against crime caused by foreigners. "We have too many criminal foreigner juveniles in Germany," Koch said. "In the name of multi-cultural tolerance, we've been blinded to accept behaviour that can lead to dangerous aggression. We've got to put an end to the grand delusion." Koch's comments, which followed a beating of a German pensioner by a Greek and a Turk youth at a Munich rail station, came just before the long New Year's Eve holiday weekend. Vice Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier and other SPD leaders hit back, accusing Koch of inflaming anti-foreigner sentiment -- a sensitive issue for German politicians. He said it also showed Koch "was nervous" about losing his job. "That's just brutal populism," Steinmeier said. "Herr Koch, why don't you come up with some concrete ideas on integration instead of whipping the people up against each other." Ypsilanti told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: "He's leading a dirty campaign again ... That's his style." Other CDU leaders jumped to Koch's defence, some suggesting deporting delinquents or sending them to private "boot camps". "Juvenile criminals don't need multi-culture cuddling but a shot across the bow," said another CDU leader, Volker Kauder. The SPD rejected CDU proposals for boot camps for foreigners or increased use of deportations. "Koch has pulled out his old bag of anti-foreigner tricks," said SPD deputy parliamentary leader Ludwig Stiegler. Koch won office in 1999 after campaigning against a federal government plan to boost integration by allowing dual citizenship. Even though Hesse is shaping up into the pivotal battle, there is also an election on Jan. 27 in Lower-Saxony as well as elections in Hamburg on Feb. 24 and Bavaria on Sept. 28.
