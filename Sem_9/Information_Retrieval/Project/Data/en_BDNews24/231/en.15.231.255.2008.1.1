The duty officer of Keraniganj Police Station, sub inspector Nurjahan Begum, confirmed the news to bdnews24.com Tuesday evening by phone. Muzaffar Ahmed, Muktijoddha unit commander of Dhaka district, filed the case with the court of judicial magistrate Ashikul Khabir on Dec 17. The court instructed the police to record the case.
