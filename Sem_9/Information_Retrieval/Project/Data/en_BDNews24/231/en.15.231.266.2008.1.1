 NICOSIA, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus swapped its pound for the euro at midnight on Tuesday, with fireworks and champagne marking the euro zone's expansion to 15 countries as Mediterranean counterpart Malta also adopted the currency. Both islands joined the European Union in 2004. It was the first currency change in Cyprus since its British former colonial rulers introduced the Cyprus pound in 1878. Cypriot officials said the transition was seamless, although with most businesses shut for the New Year's holiday, any problems are unlikely to be apparent until Wednesday. "The transition has been very smooth, beyond our expectations," said Andreas Charalambous, a senior official at Cyprus's Ministry of Finance. "The only problem we had to face was the reluctance of some enterprises to front load in euros, but they did that at the end of December," he told Reuters. Officials hope joining the euro zone will help bring together the economies of the divided island, split along ethnic lines since a Turkish invasion in 1974 that was triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. "The foundation is laid for a unified economy with a common currency," President Tassos Papadopoulos said. Use of the euro applies only to the southern part of Cyprus controlled by the island's internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government. The north, a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara, will continue to use Turkish lira. Cypriots, many of whom still describe their coins as shillings even though that denomination was phased out in 1955, will have to familiarise themselves quickly with the euro. The pound will cease to be legal tender in cash transactions at the end of January, with businesses obliged to use euros from midnight. "I can only work with a calculator in my hand .. I still haven't learnt the prices in euros," said Georgios Savva, 42, a newsagent in the Cypriot capital Nicosia. Some worried the dual circulation of pounds and euros could cause complications. "I haven't had any difficulties yet but it will cause delays in servicing customers if they pay in pounds and I have to give change in euros," said shopkeeper Takis Loizides, 62. Cyprus joined the euro zone at a rate of one euro for 0.585274 pounds. Authorities hope most Cyprus notes will be withdrawn from circulation within 15 days. Adopting the single currency will boost investment, authorities said, although the primary market for its important tourism sector, Britain, is not in the euro zone. Cyprus, an island of just under one million inhabitants, represents 0.2 percent of the euro zone's GDP. To qualify for euro zone admission, Papadopoulos's administration successfully wrestled down budget deficits and tackled burgeoning public debt. Tuesday's changeover applies to two pockets of sovereign territory London has retained on the island since granting Cyprus independence in 1960. Inhabitants of the British-administered Sovereign Base Areas (SBA), including some 4,000 troops and 7,000 dependents, will use the euro in transactio
