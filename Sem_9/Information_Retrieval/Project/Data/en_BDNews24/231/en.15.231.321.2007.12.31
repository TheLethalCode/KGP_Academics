 Sydney, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Australians were killed in a bushfire after becoming trapped in their trucks as they tried to flee the outback inferno in the goldfields of western Australia, police said on Monday. The bodies of the two adults and a child were recovered from two burnt out trucks in a national park between the towns of Southern Cross and Coolgardie in Western Australia state about midnight on Sunday, said a police spokesman told Reuters. One truck contained an adult body and the other truck contained an adult and what appeared to be the body of the child, but the bodies have not yet been recovered due to the bushfire and intense heat in the area, police said. "We haven't been able to conduct any examination because of the heat," said Inspector George Putland. "There's only been a cursory glance and then police have had to leave because of the heat." A bushfire in the area has been burning since Friday, scorching more than 7,500 hectares (18,532 acres), downing power lines and closing a major Western Australian state highway
