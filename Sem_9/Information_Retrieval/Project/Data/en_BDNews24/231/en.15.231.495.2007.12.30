 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  The government has planned a timeline for power cuts in different areas of the country to cope with rising demand for electricity during the irrigation season, an adviser said Sunday. Power adviser Tapan Chowdhury called on people in urban areas to make sacrifices to enable authorities to supply power for irrigation. The Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and Power Cell will prepare a schedule of power cuts, the adviser said at a news conference at Dhaka Electric Supply Authority. He said 2.5 lakh irrigation pumps would be used this season with the number of the pumps rising by 11 percent this year. An additional 1000 megawatts power would be needed to meet their demand that would lead to 650 megawatts of outages, he added. Government irrigation projects and the private projects covering relatively wider areas would get priority in case of providing new power connection, the adviser said. Tapan said necessary steps have been taken to ensure power supply for the irrigation pumps. DESA and DESCO would take steps to remove the problems with voltage. To keep two power plants in Barapukuria on, mine authorities will take necessary steps to extract coal for a second time in addition to the 70,000 tonnes of coal in stock. He asked people to cut down on use and save on power. Tapan hoped up to 250 megawatts power would be added to the national grid by April. Power division secretary M Faozul Kabir Khan said, "We will try to keep power production between 3600 megawatts and 3800 megawatts during irrigation season." During the period, Meghnaghat 450-megawatt power plant would be overhauled, but some units would return to production soon, he added. Khan said the investigation committee on power grid collapse in November made a number of recommendations and those recommendations that do not involve much cost will be implemented soon. He blamed the lack of machine and manpower for the collapse and said they decided to employ a manager at the load despatch centre. bdnew
