<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean President-elect Lee Myung-bak, who has pledged to act tough with North Korea, will ask the communist neighbour to send a representative to his inauguration in February, a Seoul news report said on Tuesday. North Korean media have made no mention of Lee, the conservative former mayor of Seoul who once ran the giant Hyundai conglomerate's construction arm, since he won the presidency on Dec. 19. A member of Lee's advance team told the Yonhap news agency Lee planned to send an envoy to North Korea to deliver an invitation to attend his Feb. 25 inauguration. "(The South) should send a special envoy to North Korea in January so that an official at least from the deputy premier level or higher can attend the presidential inauguration ceremony in February," Korea University Professor Nam Sung-wook, a senior aide on North Korea policy, said in an interview. Lee has pledged to review the North Korea policy of outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun, criticised for being too soft on the communist state whose government has continued to develop nuclear weapons and maintained a dismal human rights record. "There's no change in my belief that (the new government) should offer dialogue with North Korea," Nam said. In his first news conference after the election, Lee called on the North to give up its nuclear weapons and improve the way it treats its citizens. North Korea bristles at any criticism of its rights record, widely seen as among the worst in the world. In the days following his election victory five years ago, Roh apparently angered Pyongyang by mentioning its human rights abuses
