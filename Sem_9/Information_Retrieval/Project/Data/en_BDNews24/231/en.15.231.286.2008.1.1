 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Energy Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  An expert panel has recommended hiking the fuel oil price or withdrawing fuel subsidy in phases to stop escalation of inflation. The panel in an economic review says inflation will surge if the government continues with the fuel subsidy or suddenly raises the price. It recommends that the government withdraw subsidy in three phases spread over one and a half years, and gradually stop subsidising fuel oil. It also suggests an increase or partial subsidy to fuel oil price in March-April. Former deputy energy secretary Siddique Jobaer and macroeconomic expert of the finance ministry Dr Nasir Uddin prepared the economic review. The review titled, "Oil price rise and its macroeconomic effect: Bangladesh perspective", would be presented at the energy ministry Thursday. Joint secretary of the finance ministry Arastu Khan told bdnews24.com they discussed the review at a meeting If the energy price were not increased the government would have to borrow from banks through the state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the review reasons. The government, being the guarantor, would have to repay the loan with interests from the budget. But since there is no surplus in the budget, inflation would spiral. It means if the energy price is increased inflation would rise and if the subsidy were continued inflation would go up as well. The review recommends total recall of more than Tk 5000 crore government subsidy to the energy sector in two fiscal years in three phases with six-month intervals. The government can implement the first phase in January-June period and withdraw Tk 2000 crore subsidies. The analysis reviews impact of oil price hike in four parametersimpact on the GDP growth, impact on price hike, balance in budget and impact on current account balance. It says even if the price rise does not adversely impact the GDP and current account balance it will have negative impact on the budget. The policymakers would have to take initiative from now to bring cut down on the impact of oil price rise. The analysis recommends withdrawal of subsidy to diesel and kerosene but speaks of a few alternatives considering the impact the hike of diesel and kerosene prices would have on the poor. Heavily subsidised kerosene can be sold to the poor people through cards. A hike in the diesel price would hit farming hard, it says. In such case, the plan prepared by the agriculture ministry would have to be implemented. The review emphasises a cut in conversion tax to encourage more vehicles to run on CNG and increase in the capacity of the Eastern Refinery Ltd and efficiency of BPC and preservation of energy. bdnew
