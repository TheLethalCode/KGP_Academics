<TEXT>
 Pabna, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)The flow of water in the Padma river is suffering a shortage of 40,000 cusecs this winter, compared with the previous year. Because of the reduction in water flow, the Padma's tributaries are running almost dry. The Bangladesh-India joint water observation group measured the flow of the Padma river near the Hardinge Bridge on Wednesday. The observation group included Naoshad Ali, executive engineer of the hydrology department of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, and ERR Ajagesan, executive engineer of the Indian Water Commission. Another member of the group, sub-divisional engineer Daulutuzzaman, told bdnews24.com: "The condition of the Padma is very serious. Water flow is almost nil in the river." On Wednesday, the water flow was measured at 80,000 cusecs, he said, while it measured about 110,000 cusecs in the same period last year. The members of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission began observing the water flow Tuesday at Hardinge Bridge over the Padma in Bangladesh and at Farakka Point in India. Of the 15 pillars, eleven pillars of the historic Hardinge Bridge lay in sands, and members of the commission found that people have been cultivating boro, wheat, maize and other crops under the Hardinge and the Lalan Shah bridges. Due to the reduced flow of the Padma, it is feared that about 125,000 hectares of land under the Ganga-Kopotakha Irrigation Project may face a serious threat. bdnews24/prati
