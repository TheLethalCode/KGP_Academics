<TITLE> Prices unlikely to come down in 2008: BB governor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed has said he does not see any possibility of reducing prices of daily essentials in the coming year. Speaking to reporters in his office Monday, he stressed the importance of enhancing purchase power of people to cope with the situation. The governor conceded that the income of people had not increased in line with the rising prices of essentials. Moreover, natural disasters in 2007 had caused a fall in production of domestic crops. The governor said he could see no way of reducing domestic prices as global prices of many essentials were continuing to rise in international markets. On whether local prices would rise further in 2008, he said: "I don't know if prices will increase, but there is hardly any possibility that they will fall." Salehuddin emphasised the need to maintain a normal supply system to keep prices at a tolerable level. The central bank governor said the overall economic condition in 2007 was not bad, adding: "Nor was it very good. But reserve of foreign currency and remittance sent off by expatriates were very satisfactory." He said floods and Cyclone Sidr threw challenges to the economy in 2007. bdnews
