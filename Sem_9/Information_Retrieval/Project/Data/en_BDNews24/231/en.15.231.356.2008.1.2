 ABIDJAN, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A grenade blast killed seven children at a school in Ivory Coast after a pupil found the device nearby and removed the pin while playing, local authorities said on Wednesday. The boy, who was killed instantly, and a friend had found two grenades near the Koranic school in the northeastern town of Bondoukou, local health worker Clement Assi said. The other boy had taken the second device home to his father, who handed it in to the police, he said. "The age of the children killed is between around 4 and 15 years. Among the injured, two were seriously hurt and five only slightly," Assi said. Local police confirmed the incident and said an inquiry was under way. The West African state has been divided since rebels seized the northern half of the country in a 2002-2003 civil war. Bondoukou is 460 km (290 miles) from the economic capital Abidjan in the south and was close to the front line of combat. Fighting was brief in the world's top cocoa grower and a peace deal in March last year between rebel and government sides has made some progress towards reunification and organisation of long-delayed elections, although some tensions persist. "We're in a zone which isn't far from the front line. With the war, weapons were moved around but we don't know how these grenades got here," said Richard Secre, chairman of Bondoukou's local council.
