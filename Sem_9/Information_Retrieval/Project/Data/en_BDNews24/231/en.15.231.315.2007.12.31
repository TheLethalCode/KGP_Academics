 ISLAMABAD, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani electoral officials will decide on Tuesday whether to go ahead with a January poll, with up to a two-month delay widely expected in a country plunged into crisis by opposition leader Benazir Bhutto's assassination. Bhutto's killing in a suicide attack on Thursday has stoked bloodshed across the country and rage against President Pervez Musharraf, casting doubts on nuclear-armed Pakistan's stability and its transition to civilian rule. Pakistani shares fell 4.7 percent on Monday, their steepest dive in 18 months, and the rupee hit a six-year low as investors worried political instability could damage the $145 billion economy. The markets had been closed for three days of mourning. "There are no buyers in the market, only sellers," said Shuja Rizvi, director of broking at Capital One Equities. "Every stock on my screen is limit-down." A promising investment story less than a year ago, Pakistan, a key U.S. ally against terrorism, is now gripped by fears of capital flight if security worsens. The death toll from violence since Bhutto's killing has reached 47. Sporadic violence flared again on Monday, with protesters firing into the air in the southern city of Hyderabad and throwing stones at police and shops, Storefronts were damaged in the nearby town of Nawabshah, where Bhutto's widower hails from. Storekeepers also shuttered their facades in parts of the southern financial hub of Karachi. Hundreds of lawyers marched in the southern city of Multan chanting slogans against the president that included "Musharraf, you killer". A former ruling party official said the election was likely to be delayed for up to two months. NO DELAY, SAYS PPP But Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) vowed to take part, and the opposition party led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif would too, said its chairman, Raja Zafar-ul-Haq. "We don't want any delay," said PPP spokeswoman Farzana Raja, adding that a postponement would help the party's opponents. Election Commission secretary Kanwar Dilshad said provincial governments and election commissioners had been told to submit reports on the situation by Monday evening. A decision on whether to postpone the parliamentary election aiming to shift Pakistan from military to civilian rule would be taken on Tuesday, Dilshad said. The commission said on Saturday its offices in many districts of Sindh province in the south of the country had been burnt and voting material including electoral rolls destroyed. Security fears in two northwestern regions also raised doubts about voting there, it said. "Despite this dangerous situation, we will go for elections, according to her will and thinking," said Bhutto widower Asif Ali Zardari, who was made co-chairman of the PPP on Sunday alongside the couple's teenage son, Bilawal. Bhutto had hoped to win power for a third time in the January vote though analysts expected a three-way split between her, Nawaz Sharif's party and the party that backs Musharraf. "SITUATION SHAKY" Major Pakistani cities stirred back to life on Monday for the first time since Bhutto's assassination, emerging from the unrest that had paralysed trade and commerce. Karachi, a virtual ghost town at the weekend after rioters burnt shops, banks and cars, began to get back to work. Banks and shops raised shutters, cars and motorcycles were back on the streets and some petrol pumps opened for business. But there were none of the usual traffic jams in the bustling city of 14 million people, where schools were still closed and many workers remained at home four days after Bhutto was slain. Zardari said he would not run in the election and would not be a candidate for prime minister but mentioned PPP vice chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim as a possible candidate. Washington had encouraged Bhutto, relatively liberal by Pakistan's standards and an opponent of Islamic militancy. She returned home from self-imposed exile in October, narrowly escaping a suicide blast that struck her motorcade hours after her arrival. About 140 people died in that attack. Her death wrecked US hopes of a power-sharing deal between her and Musharraf, who took power in a military coup in 1999 but left the army last month to become a civilian preside
