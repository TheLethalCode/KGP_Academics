 ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said on Wednesday he had asked British police for help in the investigation into the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. "I am grateful to Prime Minister Brown that ... he accepted my request," Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation, referring to British Prime Minster Gordon Brown. "This team will come immediately and will assist our team in the investigation ... I hope these investigations would be done properly with Scotland Yard and remove all doubts," he said.
