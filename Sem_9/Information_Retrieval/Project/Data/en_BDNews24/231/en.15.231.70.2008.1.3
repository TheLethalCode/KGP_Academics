<TITLE> US recession fears prompt flight to safety </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks slumped on Thursday after weak US manufacturing data and record oil prices renewed fears that the world's top economy was heading into recession, sending investors towards the safety of gold. US crude oil futures eased in Asia after briefly touching a record $100 a barrel on Wednesday, while gold steadied below an all-time high of $861 an ounce hit in the previous session. Asian companies face the prospect of higher energy costs just as data on Wednesday showed a key US manufacturing index shrank in December for the first time in nearly a year, darkening the outlook for Asia's top export market. "People are showing concern about the overall global growth outlook. Oil is an underlying cost that a lot of companies face," said White Funds Management portfolio manager Angus Gluskie. "It also represents an increase in inflation that central banks around the world will have to deal with." Some analysts are even voicing the fears of US stagflation as minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting shows it grappling with a credit crunch that may require more interest rate cuts to prevent worsening an economic slowdown. The Fed has cut rates by 100 basis points since September, with its latest action on Dec. 11 when it eased by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan dropped 1.2 percent by 0222 GMT after hitting earlier its lowest since Dec. 24. Tokyo markets remained closed for the new year holidays, and will re-open on Friday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index slumped 1.4 percent, while markets in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong also dropped by more than 1 percent. Asian companies that rely on US exports, such as South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor, slumped, while commodities firms such as Australian miner Rio Tinto dropped nearly 2 percent on worries about cooling global demand. The falls came after the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index showed US factory production dropped to 47.7 last month, its weakest since April 2003. Centro Properties Group surged 5.8 percent on a media report that Blackstone Group and Citadel Investment may be in talks to take a stake in the Australian firm, which is the fifth-largest shopping mall owner in the United States. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that Citadel was eyeing part of Centro. Gold producers such as Zijin Mining also rose as some investors bet gold would hit new peaks in coming weeks. DOLLAR OFF LOWS The dollar gained ground against the euro and the Japanese yen after easing overnight, although the weak US economic outlook, record oil prices and expectations for more Fed rate cuts kept it on a weak footing. The US currency was quoted at 109.5 yen after hitting its lowest level in more than a month at 109.21 yen on Wednesday, but trading was thinner due to the Japanese holidays. US light crude for February delivery fell to $99.21 a barrel, after hitting $100 on Wednesday. Oil prices surged 58 percent in 2007, the biggest annual gain this decade. Analysts noted a new-year rush of investor demand for oil, fuelled by expectations of thinning US stockpiles, the falling US dollar and geopolitical risks in countries such as Nigeria. "We still have our maximum quota on oil and we don't see any reason to lighten our position since all the risks are still to the upside," said Justin Wilkes, fund manager at Global Commodities in Australia. "Our appetite for oil hasn't waned at all." The uncertainty of the health of the global economy and surging oil prices has prompted a rush to gold, which hit a record $861.10 an ounce on Wednesday, beating its previous peak of $850 set in January 1980. The price of gold rose more than 30 percent last year, its biggest annual gain since 1979. Spot gold eased to $855.10/855.90 in Asia on Thursday
