 Islamabad, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani electoral officials will decide on Tuesday whether to go ahead with a Jan. 8 poll, with expectations it will be delayed by up to two months after Benazir Bhutto's killing. The opposition leader's assassination on Thursday has triggered bloodshed across the nation and rage against President Pervez Musharraf, casting doubts on nuclear-armed Pakistan's stability and its transition to democratic rule. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party said it would take part in the elections despite the loss of its leader. A spokeswoman said any postponement would help the PPP's opponents. Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, who now shares the party leadership with his 19-year-old son, said in an interview with CNN: "Of course I believe that the elections should go on." The other main opposition party said it would also take part despite earlier threats of a boycott. A former ruling party official said the election was likely to be delayed by up to two months but Musharraf opponents said postponement would deliver a political advantage to his supporters. Pakistan, a US ally against terrorism, is gripped by fears of capital flight if security worsens. Shares on Tuesday were down three percent in early trade. In violence on Monday, protesters fired into the air in the southern city of Hyderabad and threw stones at police and shops. Storefronts were damaged in nearby Nawabshah, Zardari's home town. "The loss to public property and infrastructure has been colossal," the caretaker government said in a statement after a cabinet meeting in Islamabad. The death toll from violence since Bhutto's killing had reached 47 by Monday. ELECTION DELAY UNWELCOME - SHARIF Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, leader of the other main opposition party, said on Monday it was dropping a plan to boycott the vote and would take part after the PPP decided to participate. He said the government was trying to delay the election for the benefit of Musharraf's allies and called on the president to resign: "Pervez Musharraf and Pakistan cannot go together." Provincial governments and election commissioners were told to submit reports on the situation by Monday evening as the Election Commission prepared to make its decision on the date. The commission said on Saturday its offices in many districts of Sindh province in the south of the country had been burnt and voting material including electoral rolls destroyed. "SITUATION SHAKY" US State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said if the election could be held in safety "then that's probably what should happen". "The key here is that there be a date certain for elections in Pakistan. We would certainly have concerns about some sort of indefinite postponement," Casey said. "Looking at the law and order situation, which is quite (difficult), I don't know if an election could be held or not," Nadeem Saeed, who works in sales and marketing for a multinational company, told Reuters as he walked to work in Karachi on Tuesday. However, he said: "If elections are not held on Jan. 8, then another rally of violence will take place." Bhutto, relatively liberal by Pakistan's standards and an opponent of Islamic militancy, returned home from self-imposed exile in October, narrowly escaping a suicide blast that struck her motorcade hours after her arrival. About 140 people died in that attack. Her death wrecked US hopes of a power-sharing deal between her and Musharraf, who took power in a military coup in 1999 but left the army in November to become a civilian president. The PPP has suggested Musharraf's government is trying to cover up the truth about Bhutto's killing and bears at least some of the responsibility. "I think whoever has to gain from her death and definitely the sitting government has to gain ... they should be held responsible," Bhutto's widower Zardari told CNN
