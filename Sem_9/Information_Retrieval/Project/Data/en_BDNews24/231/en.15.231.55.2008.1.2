 ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani authorities published on Wednesday photographs of a severed human head and two men standing in a crowd moments before Benazir Bhutto was killed and offered a reward for their identification. Opposition leader and former prime minister Bhutto was killed in a gun and suicide-bomb attack as she left a rally in the city of Rawalpindi last Thursday. One of the pictures, published in a notice in Pakistan's biggest Urdu-language newspaper, shows two men standing in the crowd outside the Bhutto rally moments before she came out and was killed.

But many Pakistanis believe others from among Bhutto's old enemies, perhaps from within the powerful security agencies, were involved. A spokesman for Mehsud denied involvement. Apart from the question of who was behind the attack, controversy has been raging over the exact cause of Bhutto's death. The government says Bhutto was killed when she fractured her skull on the lever on a sunroof of her car during the attack. Bhutto's supporters say she was shot. Video footage shows the clean-cut young man firing at least three shots at Bhutto from a distance of about 10 feet (3 metres), her white shawl appearing to move, perhaps as a bullet struck, and her dropping back into her armoured veh
