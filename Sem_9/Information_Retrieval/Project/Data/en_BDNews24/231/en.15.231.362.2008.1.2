<TITLE> Australia rethinks migrant citizenship test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Canberra, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A high failure rate among migrants sitting a citizenship exam introduced by Australia's former conservative government has prompted a re-think of the controversial test, criticised by some as racist. The test, introduced last year by the government of former prime minister John Howard, asks hopeful Australians a series of questions on national history and values, including their understanding of national values such as "mateship". But one-in-five of the 10,636 people who have sat the test since its introduction in October last year failed to reach the 60 percent pass required, the West Australian newspaper reported. New centre-left Labor Immigration Minister Chris Evans said the exam would be reviewed. "The citizenship test should be about increasing awareness of citizens' responsibilities and, of course, of the Australian way of life," Evans told the paper. "The government will review the scheme in the new year and assess the process." The test can be taken any number of times as a citizenship requirement after migrants have lived four years in Australia. Howard said the test would make Australia, a nation of migrants, with nearly one-in-four of the country's 21 million people born overseas, more united after debate about the pace and impact of immigration involving Muslims and African refugees. He denied the tests had racist overtones and marked a return to the kind of exams used until the 1950s that excluded mainly-Asian migrants under the "White Australia" policy. New South Wales state's Anti-Discrimination Board President Stepan Kerkyasharian said on Wednesday that the test should be refined to be a test of knowledge rather than culture. "I'd like to see a citizenship test which is easy to administer, easy to take part in, not sort of couched in high-level English terms, and a test about the political system in Australia and what everyday life in Australia is about, not about what happened 20 years ago in some cricket match," he said. Sam Afra, the chairman of the Ethnic Communities' Council of Victoria state, said the high failure rate confirmed accusations at the time of its introduction that it was discriminatory. "The news that 20 percent of applicants are failing the test confirms our fears that the test would exclude people who would otherwise make a tremendous contribution to Australia," he said
