<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkmenistan has stopped its natural gas exports to Iran, blaming technical and operational problems, causing shortages in some parts of its neighbour, Iranian officials and media said on Monday. Turkmenistan supplies 5 percent of Iran's gas consumption with 20-23 million cubic metres per day, said Ebadollah Ghanbari, who heads the public relations unit of the National Iranian Gas Company. Another official from the gas company, speaking to news agency ISNA on Sunday, suggested Turkmenistan had cut back exports because it wanted to raise the price, but Ghanbari made no reference to this. Turkmen officials were unavailable for comment on Monday. Turkmen media have said an Iranian delegation visited Ashgabat on Dec 26-27 to discuss gas prices for next year. "Two days ago Turkmenistan cut in half its gas exports (to Iran) and it reached 10 million cubic metres," Ghanbari said. "And in an official letter they said it was due to technical problems." "Since yesterday evening Turkmenistan has completely cut its gas exports to Iran," he was quoted as saying by the state broadcaster IRIB. Despite its massive gas reserves, Iran has been a net importer of gas since 2002. The supply cuts caused difficulties in parts of northern Iran and gas was turned off to some government offices in Golestan province in order to make more available for households, media reported. "Because of the sharp decrease in the pressure of natural gas many restaurants and motels in the central towns of Mazandaran province are completely or partially closed," state radio said. The state gas company urged Iranians to use less energy. Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Turkmenistan was working to sort things out. "There are a certain number of technical problems and they are trying to solve the problems over there in Turkmenistan," he told a news conference. Iran sits on the world's second largest gas reserves after Russia. But sanctions, politics and construction delays have slowed gas development, and analysts say it is unlikely to become a major exporter for a decade. Competition between the West, China and Russia for access to Turkmen gas has intensified since the death of Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov in December 20
