 SYDNEY, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The prospect of equalling their own world record for consecutive test wins has given Australia's cricketers an added incentive heading into the second test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground this week. Initial hopes of a competitive series were shattered by the ridiculous ease of Australia's 337-run win in last week's first test in Melbourne but the stakes remain as high as ever. Unbeaten since August 2005, the Australians have their sights set on matching their record of 16 consecutive wins set under Steve Waugh's leadership between 1999 and 2001. Ricky Ponting's current group of players have won 15 games in a row and seem certain to set a new mark in the four-match series against India unless there is a dramatic turnaround. The Indians have vowed to play better in Sydney and believe they have an advantage on the spin-friendly pitch, but the odds are still heavily stacked against them. The Australians have lost just one test in the last decade at Sydney and their only defeat to India in Sydney was 30 years ago. India's batsmen compiled a record innings total of 705-7 on their last visit to Sydney four years ago to draw the match and the series, but failed to make at least 200 in either innings in Melbourne. BAD DREAM The Indian team manager, Chetan Chauhan, told reporters on Monday he was confident the batsmen would be better on the slower Sydney pitch. "Let me promise you the bad thing is over," he said. "It was a bad dream that is over and we have left it behind, the team is determined .... we will bounce back in the series." Neither team has finalised their lineup for the match, although the short turnaround between games means there are unlikely to be many changes. The most likely change for the Indians is the return of opener Virender Sehwag, possibly for Yuvraj Singh, which would allow makeshift opener Rahul Dravid to drop back to his preferred spot at number three. The Australians are almost certain to stick with the same combination that won in Melbourne with spinner Brad Hogg doing enough to retain his place. While some predicted Australia's domination of world cricket would come to a halt after the emotional test retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer at Sydney 12 months ago, nothing could have been further from the truth. Instead Australia have gone from strength to strength, winning every match they played in 2007, and can celebrate the anniversary of their departure with a record. The batting is as powerful as ever with Phil Jaques seamlessly taking over as Matthew Hayden's and Michael Clarke cementing his spot in the middle order. The bowling has also held strong with Brett Lee, Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson leading the pace attack. It will be some time before Australia finds a permanent replacement for Warne but Stuart MacGill and Hogg have provided adequate temporary relief, although none for the opposition
