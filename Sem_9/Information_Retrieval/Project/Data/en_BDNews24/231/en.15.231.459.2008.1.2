 ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Pervez Musharraf will announce he is seeking international help in an investigation into the assassination of Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, a close aide said on Wednesday. Musharraf, in a televised address to the nation due at 8 p.m. (1500 GMT), would also appeal for calm ahead of an election that was due on Jan. 8 but will be delayed for several weeks.

"How can we expect this wave of sympathy to pass in just a few weeks?" he said. While the government has made al Qaeda and its Pakistani cohorts its prime suspects, the country is awash with conspiracy theories suggesting Bhutto could have been killed by political enemies with friends in the intelligence agenci
