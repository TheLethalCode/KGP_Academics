 Zeeshan Haider ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan pushed back its general election by 6 weeks to Feb 18 on Wednesday following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, against the objections of the main opposition parties who fear a delay will work against them. Full Story "In all the four provinces, for some days this election process came to a complete halt," Chief Election Commissioner Qazi Mohammad Farooq told a news conference. "Polling will now be held on Feb. 18 instead of Jan. 8." The killing of the charismatic opposition leader has fuelled doubts about stability and the transition to democratic rule in nuclear-armed Pakistan, a crucial U.S. ally in its anti-terrorism efforts. Pakistan would deploy army troops and paramilitary soldiers to ensure security in the election, President Pervez Musharraf said on Wednesday. "The army and the rangers will be fully deployed to ensure law and order across the country and for holding elections peacefully," Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation. Rangers are a paramilitary force. Farooq said election offices in 11 districts of Sindh, Bhutto's home province, were burned down in the disturbances, destroying transparent ballot boxes, voters screens, voters lists and other election materials. Supporters of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and the other main opposition party, led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, had wanted the election to go ahead as planned, fearing a delay would work to Musharraf's advantage. "Whatever reasons they give are such lame-duck excuses, because the electoral papers and lists were burnt in the districts but they have those lists in the central office," said Farzana Raja, a spokeswoman for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP). "We reject their baseless excuses. We're ready to fight the election." Bhutto's party would expect to reap a considerable sympathy vote following her assassination in a gun and bomb attack as she left a rally in Rawalpindi on Thursday. Nearly 60 people were killed in the ensuing violence and, while the situation has now calmed, it remains tense and analysts said a postponement could lead to further rioting. Markets are gripped by fears of capital flight if security worsens. AL QAEDA BLAMED In a televised address, Musharraf said he was certain allies of the al Qaeda militant group were behind Bhutto's killing. Musharraf said al Qaeda-linked militants were involved in all attacks in Pakistan, including recent attacks on the security forces and politicians. "I want to say it with certainty, that these people martyred ... Benazir Bhutto," Musharraf said. Bhutto was seen as a U.S. ally and was one of the strongest moderate voices seeking to wrest back influence in the Islamic world from Osama bin Laden and his ilk. However, the killing has spawned a host of conspiracy theories, with some Pakistanis believing she was killed by rogue elements in the establishment. Musharraf said he had asked British police for help in the investigation into the assassination. Pakistani shares slid 2.3 percent on Wednesday as nerves returned to the market ahead of the Musharraf address. The main index has fallen nearly 10 percent since Bhutto's killing. "The market was expecting a delay and has already discounted the news. The issue now is what reaction the political parties will have and that might affect the market," said Ahsan Mehanti, chief executive of Shehzad Chamdia Securities, after the announcement of the poll delay. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) said opposition parties should unite around a common platform demanding the resignation of Musharraf and the election commission. "General Musharraf has failed to ensure law and order and the election commission has failed to hold elections on schedule," said spokesman Ahsan Iqbal. "Under these circumstances, both must resign and we should have a neutral national unity government and an independent election commission."
