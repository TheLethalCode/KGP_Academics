 Gaza, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least one Palestinian was killed and four others were wounded by gunfire while crossing from Israel into the Gaza Strip on Sunday after completing the annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca, Palestinian medics said. The medical workers said the pilgrims had been hit by Israeli gunfire at the Erez border crossing. Witnesses said soldiers first fired into the air and then at the crowd of pilgrims. An Israeli army spokeswoman said the army was not aware of any shooting in the area. Palestinian officials said about 700 pilgrims had crossed back into Gaza on Sunday, having returned from Saudi Arabia via Jordan. A separate group of more than 2,000 returning Palestinian pilgrims were stranded in Egypt, unable to return to Gaza because Israel was insisting that they go through Israeli border checks
