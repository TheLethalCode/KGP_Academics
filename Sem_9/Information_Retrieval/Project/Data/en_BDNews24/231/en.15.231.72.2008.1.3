<TITLE> Huckabee takes a detour from Iowa to Leno show </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Burbank, California, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican Mike Huckabee took a quick detour to TV host Jay Leno's studio on Wednesday for a blast of national media exposure on the eve of Iowa political caucuses that kick off the presidential selection process. The former Arkansas governor and Southern Baptist minister flew from the snowy Midwest to sunny California to appear on the first new broadcast of NBC's "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" since the Hollywood writers' strike forced the program into reruns on Nov. 5. Huckabee found himself caught in the awkward position of crossing picket lines to make his appearance on Leno while expressing support for striking writers, whose contract talks with major studios collapsed in acrimony last month. Campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Fedewa said Huckabee "would only agree to join Jay, an active member of the Writers Guild, for the taping after he was assured that no replacement writers were being used in the show's production." She added: "Governor Huckabee believes that the writers deserve to be fairly compensated for the sale of their work" and was glad Leno had put his production crew back to work. However, Huckabee said earlier that he did not think he would be crossing picket lines to appear on the show because he understood the writers had agreed to allow broadcasts of the late night TV talk shows. The Writers Guild of America, which represents the strikers, issued a statement saying it was "disappointed" in Huckabee's move and asking him to "respect our picket lines in the future and urge the media conglomerates to return to the bargaining table ..." While Leno was expected to draw a large national TV audience, Huckabee's detour to California was an unusual move in the final hours before the important caucuses. He denied that it reflected overconfidence, despite polls showing him leading the Republican field in Iowa. "I've been up since 4 this morning. I'll be campaigning to early afternoon. I fly to California. I'm back here tonight. I'll be up again at 4 in the morning. We'll still be campaigning. In the meantime more people will see me -- in Iowa -- on Jay Leno tonight," he said. Polls show a close race between Huckabee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has pumped much effort and millions of dollars into the state. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Wednesday showed Huckabee's lead over Romney sliced to 2 points, 28 percent to 26 percent, within the statistical margin of error. Some analysts thought the exposure of appearing on Leno may pay big dividends. "Leno is offering him a tremendous opportunity for a national audience," said Dennis Goldford, a professor of politics at Drake University in Des Moines. "Unless the bottom drops out, his work in Iowa is done and I don't see much risk in it. But the potential benefits are huge," he said, also noting Huckabee could reach more Iowans on the television than he could out on the hustings. The exposure could also raise Huckabee's profile in upcoming contests in New Hampshire and South Carolina and reach well beyond his evangelical Christian base. Huckabee stirred controversy Monday when he decided at the last minute not to run a television ad critical of Romney -- then showed it to reporters, ensuring its got a wide airing. Huckabee defended the heavily criticized move, saying he had decided to keep the campaign positive despite Romney's negative commercials aimed at his record
