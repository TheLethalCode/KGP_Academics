 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was taken back to special jail from court Monday, during the hearing of an extortion case, against her, bdnews24.com Correspondents Sumon Mahbub and Prodip Kumar Chowdhury reported. Hasina fell sick during the court proceedings, reporters and witnesses said. Her cousin and co-accused in the case Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim first noticed that Hasina was feeling ill and informed the court, saying Hasina was suffering from "high blood pressure and a fever". Hasina's lawyers appealed to the court, which granted permission for her to return to the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. She was taken out of court at 12.17 pm, while the proceedings continued in the courtroom also situated within the Sangsad Bhaban premises. The court dealing with charges of extortion had resumed hearing Monday morning of the case filed against Hasina by Azam J Chowdhury. DIG (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddique told bdnews24.com that Hasina was taken to court at 9 am. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque had set today's date after a hearing on Dec 26, aimed at framing charges against the former premier. Hasina's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman told bdnews24.com Sunday: "We will take part in the hearing tomorrow (Monday) after viewing the files the government thinks of to place as evidence." Prior to the Eid holiday, the judge had set Dec 26 for the hearing to resume in the case that also involves Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. The charges involve the alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam J Chowdhury when Hasina was in office during 1996-2001. Chowdhury filed the case on June 13, alleging that he had paid the money to the accused as they threatened to cancel a power plant project. Hasina, Selim and the Awami League have denied the charges, saying the case is aimed at preventing Hasina from contesting the next polls. Rehana, who lives in London, expressed her surprise on learning of the case and said the charges were false. The High Court on Dec 9 had halted the proceedings of the case for three months and stayed the relocation of the courtroom to the Sangsad Bhaban premises after Hasina's lawyers moved a writ petition. But the Supreme Court on Dec 13 overruled the HC order after the state sought intervention to go ahead with the hearing. Acting law secretary on Nov 26 enacted a gazette for relocating the courtroom to the Sangsad Bhaban area from Johnson Road on security grounds. But Hasina's lawyers had earlier argued that the government could not do so through such an order following the separation of the judiciary from the executive at the start of November. The trial started Dec 3 at the special courtroom on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Security officials arrested Hasina on July 16 at her husband's Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. Hours after the arrest, she was sent to the jail, pending trial. bdnew
