 Barguna, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Voter registration and photographing for national identity cards began in Barguna Tuesday. The naval chief, vice admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam, launched the activities and visited Barguna Zila School to oversee the process. "It is the responsibility of every citizen to register his name in the voter list. I hope everybody will get registered out of his individual sense of responsibility," Nizam said. He asked the media to play an active role in making people aware of the process of registration. The naval chief expressed his satisfaction over the progress of the work in the district of Barguna, though its start had been delayed as the southern district was struck hard by Cyclone Sidr. The collecting of data for the preparation of voter lists began in Barguna municipality Dec 17, and registration will continue to Jan 6, the district election office said. Nizam distributed money to a number of affected families at Banshbuniya village. He also distributed books among 91 SSC candidates of the Sidr-hit area. bdnews24.co
