 GUWAHATI, India, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in India's restive northeast imposed a curfew and called out the army in a remote district on Wednesday after four Muslim protesters were shot dead by police and dozens wounded in clashes. The trouble in Goalpara district of Assam state began after hundreds of people, mostly Muslims settlers originally from Bangladesh, attacked a police station protesting against a government decision not to hold village council elections. The area is part of an autonomous council of tribal people and Muslim settlers fear the tribals could corner most opportunities in the absence of an elected village council. The mob also burned several vehicles on a local highway and damaged shops in the market, police said. "The situation is tense. We are afraid it might take a communal turn," a senior police officer, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters by phone from Goalpara.
