 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)About 1,000 students gathered on the Dhaka University campus to celebrate the New Year as the clock struck the zero hour. Major hotels including Radisson, Sheraton, Sonargaon and The Westin in Dhaka organised overnight parties for revellers. Clubbers flocked to Dhaka Club, Gulshan Club and Uttara Club to spend their busiest night. The state of emergency and strict security measures muted the New Year's street celebrations in Dhaka. City roads were relatively quiet. Gulshan and Banani, once hotspots of street celebrations on the New Year's Day, were free from revellers, bdnews24.com correspondents reported from the scene Monday night. Many celebrated the New Year partying with friends and relatives at home. About 200 police personnel have been deployed to the DU campus, Shahbagh police chief Shahidul Islam told bdnews24.com. The police set up four security checkpoints on the roads to the campus. Nobody without ID cards was allowed in, Islam said. The students carried colourful banners on New Year greetingssome with calls for freeing the country of "war criminals". bdn
