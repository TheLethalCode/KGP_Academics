 MADRID, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's governing Socialists have a narrow opinion poll lead over the conservative opposition, although not necessarily enough to ensure victory in a March 9 election, according to two polls published on Wednesday. The Socialists lead the Popular Party by 41.9 percent of voter preferences to 39.4 percent, according to a Sigma Dos poll in the right-leaning newspaper El Mundo, which showed a slight decline for the government's advantage from a month earlier. Due to Spain's voting system giving more seats to less-populated provinces, these results might not translate into more seats in parliament for the Socialists than for the PP, according to Sigma Dos. The poll, which produced similar results to another survey in Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia, comes after signs Spanish voters are beginning to worry more about the economy as a decade-long housing boom comes to a halt. Government ministers also committed two notable gaffes in December, with one recommending Spaniards avoid inflation by eating rabbit at Christmas time, and another blaming price rises on ignorant consumers. But Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero approaches the parliamentary election in March with a much better image with voters than opposition leader Mariano Rajoy, polls show. The opposition has in recent months switched its focus to the economy, but Rajoy earlier irritated many centrist voters by his constant attacks on the government over its policies for dealing with Spain's regions and Basque rebels. Zapatero's advantage over Rajoy is most pronounced among voters from 18-34 years old, according to the Instituto Noxa poll in La Vanguardia, which showed overall 42.5 percent support for the Socialists and 39.7 percent for the PP. It was younger voters who gave the Socialists a surprise victory in the 2004 elections, after the then PP government bungled its response to Islamist train bombings in Madrid. But Socialist officials admit in private to fears many younger voters might abstain or vote for smaller parties this time round. Salaries for young people have failed to keep pace with Spain's booming economy, and house prices have risen beyond reach of most. It is very unlikely that any party will obtain an absolute majority, so Spain's next government, whatever its political complexion, will need to negotiate support of smaller parties. The Sigma Dos poll was based on 10,400 interviews from Dec. 14-26, while Noxa spoke to 2,000 people of voting age from Nov. 28-Dec.
