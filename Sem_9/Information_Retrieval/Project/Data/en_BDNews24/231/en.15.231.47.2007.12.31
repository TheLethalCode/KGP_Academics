 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com) -- The taka appreciated by 0.7 percent in 2007, breaking free of depreciation against the dollar in the past few years. The taka depreciated by 2.76 percent in 2004 against the dollar, and a massive 9.0 percent in 2005. The pace of deprecation slowed to 4.4 percent in 2006. "The year 2007 was a turnaround for the taka," Citibank NA in its annual (2007) market analysis said. Despite a downward move in the first quarter, Bangladesh saw the taka's value increase by 0.7 percent against the greenback. "Thanks to increased remittance inflows, reasonably strong growth in exports and reduced service payment demand, the taka strengthened," Mamun Rashid, managing director and country officer of Citibank NA told bdnews24.com Sunday. Though exports slowed in the second half of 2007, foreign exchange remittances saw a 24.5 percent growth in fiscal 2006-07 ending June 30 2007. In the first five months to November of fiscal 2007-2008, remittance growth was 21.7 percent, according to Bangladesh Bank. The country has also seen a major growth in foreign exchange reserves in 2007. As per the latest report, forex reserves increased to $5.16 billion from last year's $3.88 billion, an increase of 33 percent in national reserves. Inter-bank transactions of USD and BDT were also stable in 2007 compared to the previous three years. In 2006, the dollar traded within a 6.75 taka range (66.20  72.95). A similar scenario was observed in 2005 (61.50  67.0) and 2004 (59.01  62.50). This year only a 1.92 taka difference between the yearly high (70.40) and low (68.48) in USD/BDT rates was seen, a thin range compared to previous years. A significant trend in 2007 was a shift of volume from third currency-based cross-currency transactions to USD/BDT inter-bank transactions. "We need to encourage the trend of taka appreciation against the dollar in 2008," economist Dr Atiur Rahman told bdnews24.com. But he said the situation was different in 2007 with Bangladesh's other major importing countries, including India and Thailand. "The taka has weakened against the rupee of India from where we import almost a fifth of our total imports," Rahman said. "The taka weakened against the Thai baht also." Last year, most of the inter-bank transactions were routed through third currency trades. But as the USD/BDT exchange rates became relatively stable, market participants increased their trades to more the simple USD/BDT channel. The inter-bank call money market largely ran a surplus most of the time due to a slowdown of credit growth in 2007. "The government sector contributed most to the slowdown of credit growth. Banks and financial institutions with excess funds were seen to invest their funds in the Reverse Repo window of Bangladesh Bank," the Citibank analysis revealed. Reverse Repo rates of Bangladesh Bank remained at 6.50 percent throughout the year. As the market was mostly liquid most of the time, call rates traded around the benchmark Reverse Repo rate. However, call rates were seen moving upward a couple of times in 2007. Due to pre-Eid-ul-Fitr cash withdrawals, call rates went up to 8.50 percent in October. However, within a week after Eid holidays call rates came back to 6.5 percent. Again in December, the market experienced tightness in liquidity due to pre-Eid-ul-Azha cash withdrawals. However, this time call rates traded as high as 17 percent. The market had to wait 19 months to see call rates trading in double digit numbers. The USD/BDT swap market was also soft in 2007 due to stable interest rates all through the year. Most of the market participants were seen investing and generating funds through the conventional overnight and term-market conduit. The Government Treasury Bill yield curve flattened in 2007, as long-term yields came down and short-term yields rose throughout the year. Bangladesh Bank introduced longer term bonds (15 years and 20 years) from July 2007. Introductory yields of the longer term bonds were 13.97 percent and 15.95 percent for 15 years and 20 years respectively. However, Bangladesh Bank in its monetary policy statement in July 2007 indicated a flattening of the yield curve (a gradual rise in short term rates and drop in long term rates). In the following few months, Treasury Bill yields adjusted accordingly. Rates of long term bonds went down. 20 years, 15 years, 10 years and 5 years bond yields dropped by 246, 108, 80 and 25 basis points respectively. bdn
