 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)The securities market will remember 2007 as a "vintage year" that generated strong enthusiasm among investors in 2007, officials of the Dhaka Stock Exchange said Tuesday. At a New Year press briefing organised by the DSE, the officials highlighted events and advances of 2007. DSE president Md Abdullah Bokhari delivered the maiden speech to the occasion and termed the year 2007 a foundation of an "upcoming good year" for the capital market. Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, CEO of the prime bourse, termed the year 2007 a 'milestone year' for the capital market. "The number of investors increased significantly in 2007 and investors are now tempted to make investments. The DSE tried to expand the capital market by setting up 100 branches across the country," he said. Salahuddin presented a comparison of the indices on the DSE for 2006 and 2007, which showed a 91 percent increase in the general index, a 396.12 percent surge in turnover and a 253.82 percent rise in the volume. "The number of initial public offerings, the sizes of issues and public subscriptions doubled last year, which shows strong investor confidence in the capital market," he said. Ahmad Rashid, senior vice president of DSE, chalked out the bourse's plan for 2008 and said the year would be a challenge to the economy and the capital market. "The year will bring challenges as a number of government entities in telecoms and energy sectors are coming to the capital market," he said. Rashid disclosed the news of DSE's negotiations with power companies in the private sector to talk them into listing on the capital market. Speaking of the market outlook for 2008, the DSE official said that they would introduce a book building system to ease the IPO process, organise trainings and diversify the market through corporate bond market expansion, futures market operations and internet-based trade. He also disclosed a plan to set up a National Security Clearing Company Ltd (NSCCL) to strengthen market operations. "It will clear the transactions nationally. We are also considering it (NSCCL) to link with the clearinghouse of the central bank," Rashid added. Rashid said the DSE drafted a "pragmatic policy" to introduce derivatives in the market. "But I assume it may take another year or two to introduce derivatives to the market." bdnews2
