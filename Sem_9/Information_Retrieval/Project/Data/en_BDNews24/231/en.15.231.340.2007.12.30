 LONDON, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain said on Sunday it hoped a landmark exhibition of Russian art would go ahead in London after the government provided a legal guarantee, demanded by Moscow, that the works would not be confiscated. Russia said this month it was scrapping plans to loan artworks by Van Gogh and Matisse to Britain for the exhibition at London's Royal Academy of Arts, adding a new irritant in fraught diplomatic relations between Moscow and London. Roskultura, the state culture agency, said it was concerned the artworks could be seized by courts acting for descendants of people who owned the paintings before they were confiscated after the 1917 Russian revolution. British Culture Secretary James Purnell has made an order bringing new "immunity from seizure" legislation into force from Monday, the government said. Britain had originally said existing legislation provided sufficient safeguards. "I hope that bringing forward this further legislation will see the great works in the 'From Russia' exhibition open at the Royal Academy this January," Purnell said in a statement. However, a spokesman for Britain's Culture Department said he could not say "with 100 percent certainty" that the exhibition would go ahead. The new legislation, passed last year and originally due to be implemented in late February or March 2008, provides immunity from seizure for cultural objects lent from abroad for exhibitions in Britain. Charles Saumarez Smith, the Royal Academy's chief executive, said he expected the Russian culture agency to approve the loans when it reopens on January 8, in time for the works to be shipped to London from Duesseldorf in Germany where they are now displayed. Russian officials were not immediately available for comment. Relations between London and Moscow have deteriorated sharply since the poisoning murder in London last year of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko and some diplomats have said privately the problems with the exhibition could be linked to this dispute. Russia is due to send 120 artworks to London for the "From Russia: French and Russian Art Masterpieces of 1870-1925" exhibition scheduled to open on Jan. 26. It is the second row over cultural relations between London and Moscow this month. Russia on Dec. 12 ordered the British government's cultural arm, the British Council, to halt its work in two Russian cities, citing problems with their legal status. Britain reacted angrily and refused to close the offices.
