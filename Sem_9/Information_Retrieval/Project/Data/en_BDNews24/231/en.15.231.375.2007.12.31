 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Monday recorded an exciting one-run win over Chittagong in the ninth round one-dayer of National Cricket League to keep them in the race for the runner-up title. Khulna were also in the race for the second position, handing a massive eight-wicket defeat to Rajshahi, who have already clinched the one-day title. Sylhet recorded their fourth victory in the league when they defeated Barisal by 12 runs at Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra. After the ninth round, Rajshahi remained on 14 points while Dhaka and Khulna shared the second position with 10 points. Sylhet joined Barisal, who have eight points from nine outings. Chittagong remained at the bottom on four points. Dhaka vs Chittagong Hosts Chittagong were 247 for nine in 50 overs in reply to Dhaka's 248 for eight in 50 overs at Birshreshtho Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Chittagong's tail failed to cash in on the feat of the top order only to see their innings one run short of the target with one wicket in hand. Faisal Hossain Dickens struck a fine 86 while Nazimuddin and Masumuddowla hit 53 and 42 respectively, but all went in vain. Dhaka pacer Mohammad Sharif returned four for 46 while Nadif Chowdhury, Arafat Sunny and Mahbubul Alam Robin grabbed one wicket each. Dhaka had earlier posted a fighting total after being asked to bat first as Mosharraf Rubel and Anwar Hossain smashed 51 and 45. Khulna vs Rajshahi Khulna, who tasted first four-dayer defeat to Rajshahi Sunday, raced to 80 for four in 22 overs in reply to Rajshahi's paltry total of 79 all out in 20.5 overs Robiul Islam (4/7) and Ziaur Rahman (4/39) wrecked up the Rajshahi innings sharing eight wickets as only Jahirul Islam (11) and Mahbub Karim (19) crossed the double-digit figures in face of fierce spells of pacers Robiul, Ziaur and Monjurul (2/32). Mostafizur Rahman (28), Imrul Kayes (16) and Sahagir Hossain (15) were notable scorers for Khulna. Sylhet vs Barisal Put in to bat first, Sylhet scored a modest 207 all out in 44.3 overs with Alok Kapali scoring the highest 80. Talha Jubair (3/38) and Arafa Salahuddin (3/58) shared six wickets while Sumon chipped in with two for 38. In reply, Barisal, who handed an innings defeat to Sylhet in four-dayer this round, were bundled out for 195 in 49.2 overs as Sylhet bowlers bowled superbly. Rokibul Hasan (78) and Arafat Salahuddin (57) struck fifties but their efforts were not enough for Barisal to avert the fifth defeat in nine matches.
