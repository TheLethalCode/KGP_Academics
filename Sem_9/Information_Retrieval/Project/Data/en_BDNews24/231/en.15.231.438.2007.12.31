 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Javed Omar, pacer Nazmul Hossain, and middle order batsmen Mehrab Hossain Junior and Tushar Imran will return home Wednesday from New Zealand. After the third and final one-day international against the Kiwis, the Bangladesh team management decided to send back four batsmen as opener Shahriar Nafees, Habibul Bashar and spinner Enamul Haq Junior joined the Tigers Monday for two Tests series. Tushar Imran played the last two one-dayers while Mehrab Hossain played the series opener, but both failed to prove their potential. Both Javed and Nazmul sat out in the three one-day internationals series against hosts New Zealand. Javed, however, played a Twenty20 match against the New Zealand XI. The first Test will start on January 4 at Dunedin. Test squad: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Abdur Razzak, Farhad Reza, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shahadat Hossain, Rajin Saleh, Shahriar Nafees, Habibul Bashar and Enamul Haq Junior.
