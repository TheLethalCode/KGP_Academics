 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and M Manzur Alam will face off in an open debate on Tuesday. The debate between the major contestants in the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation elections will be aired by the BBC Bengali Service in collaboration with the Election Commission. Former mayor Mohiuddin is backed by ruling Awami League and its allies and Manzur has opposition BNP's support behind him. Jatiya Party-backed candidate Solayman Sheth was also supposed to join the debate but withdrew from the polls race on Saturday in favour of Mohiuddin. On Monday, the other five candidates of the polls will debate each other. The candidates will answer the voters' questions during the session, producer of the programme Waliur Rahman Miraj told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Miraj said Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar will broadcast the 70-minute programme live from 8:30pm which will be similar in format to the BBC Bangladesh Sanglap (Dialogue). Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said, "The candidates had answered the voters in the past election. This time the candidates will be allowed to debate among themselves. So, it is being called an 'electoral debate' of the mayoral candidates." The first 'electoral debate' was held on July 2008 with the mayor candidates of four Sylhet, Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal city corporations. The programme will be held in Theatre Institute Conference Centre at KC Dey Road of the port city. At least 150 voters will get the chance to be present there to question them. Sakhawat, BTV director general Abu Jafar and head of BBC Bengali Service Sabir Mostafa will be present at the programme, which will be moderated by BBC's Mithila Farjana. bdnews24
