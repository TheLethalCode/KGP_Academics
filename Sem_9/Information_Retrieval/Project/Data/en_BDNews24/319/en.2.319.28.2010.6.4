 Chittagong, June 04 (bdnews24.com)--The apparent rift in Chittagong Awami League has been resolved over supporting ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, the ruling party-backed candidate for the mayoral post in June 17 Chittagong City Corporation polls. The local AL leaders, believed to be against Mohiuddin and loyal to MP Nurul Islam BSc, on Friday announced that they would work jointly to make sure that he wins the race. AL Chittagong city unit vice-presidents Mahtabuddin Chowdhury and Nayeemuddin Chowdhury and organising secretary Rezaul Karim Chowdhury made the announcement at a meeting in presence of central joint general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif. Nagorik (Citizens) Committee, under whose banner Mohiuddin is contesting in the polls, organised the meeting. Three anti-Mohiuddin ward councillors Jalaluddin Iqbal, Tareq Solaiman Selim and Giasuddin were also present. MP Nurul, who had a long-term dispute with Mohiuddin, however, did not turn up. Rezaul Karim had submitted nomination paper for mayoral post but later withdrew his candidature at the behest of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, also AL president. Addressing the meeting, Hanif said: "The anti-liberation BNP candidate has to be defeated at any cost." "By ensuring Mohiuddin's win, we have to prove that there is no place for anti-liberation forces in the country," he added. bdn
