<TITLE> Ashraf urges BNP against boycott </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam has urged the main opposition BNP to do away with the practice of boycotting parliament. Also general secretary of the ruling Awami League, Syed Ashraf was evidently referring to the opposition's two walkouts on the first day of the budget session when he was speaking to reporters in his office at the Secretariat. The second day's session began on Thursday with the opposition absent in the parliament. Walking out of the parliament and boycotting its sessions have become part of Bangladesh's political culture. The opposition can choose to walk out in protest or to press for their demands. But its use should be reasonable and within the parliamentary practice. Ashraf had just come from a meeting of his ministry's monthly ADP review. He had asked the Dhaka MPs to help the government reclaim the canals of the city. Asked about the closure of Daily Amar Desh and the arrest of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman, the Awami League spokesperson said that the government had not taken any measures against the media. The closure was a result of the newspaper's publisher filing a fraud case against his acting editor. The district administration took the necessary measures. There is no scope for anyone to blame the government about this. Referring to a Jamaat-e-Islami leaders commenting that the war crimes trial would vanish into thin air, Syed Ashraf said their comments would not be able to derail or obstruct the trial process. The trial will start exactly when it is supposed to.
