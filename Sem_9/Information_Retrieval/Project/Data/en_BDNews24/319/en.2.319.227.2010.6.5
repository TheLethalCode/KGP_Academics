 Dhaka, Jun 5 (bdnews24.com)  A special team of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) has declared the Concord Grand building at Shantinagar 'not risky'. This ended almost seven hours of suspense over the building as panicked residents had evacuated the building earlier in the day when the crack was discovered. The building residents were told they could return. The two-member BUET team, led by civil engineering department chairman Fakhrul Amin, told reporters that the building was "not risky". "Residents now can return to the building," he added. The BUET experts also asked the building authority to submit soil reports and the design. Housing and public works minister Abdul Mannan Khan has urged the media to ease the panic by informing people that there was no danger anymore. A five-member probe committee, headed by a joint secreatry, has also been formed by the public works ministry. Unconfirmed reports according to bdnews24.com's correspondent say that the crack had formed on the surface. Another team of fire service, led by fire brigade and civil defence director Maj Md Shahjalal, examined the wall plaster. Earlier, the city development authority Rajdhani Unnayan Kaitripakkha's designated official Mohammad Kamruzzaman said there were signs of cracks in the ground floor. "We are examining whether the crack developed because of a fault in construction or it is merely in the plaster," he said. Fire service director general Brig Gen Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah went to the spot. Earlier Rashed Khan Menon MP visited the scene and said the authorities were looking into the matter. "The dwellers have been asked to leave the building." Tension runs high in the city following two incidents from last week. Saturday's incident comes after a seven-storey building in Begunbari was seen on Friday to be tilting, days after an unauthorised building toppled in the same area claiming 25 lives. It occurred around midday, with people inside the building saying it seemed as though the building had tilted. Paltan police chief Shahidul Haque said they had seen cracks in the lower portion of the Concord Grand building at 169/1, Shantinagar, opposite to Eastern Plus Market. Fire fighters and police rushed to the spot and identified a crack near several pillars of the building's lower portion. Traffic from Shantinagar through to Rajarbagh police lines crossing remains suspended. Additional policemen have been deployed in the area. bdnews24.co
