 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)--Forty-seven people who lost lives in the worst fire disaster in Bangladesh history were laid to rest at Azimpur graveyard. Funerals were held on Friday afternoon. Lalbagh police chief Mohammed Ali told bdnews24.com that 83 graves had been dug but 47 had been buried until 8pm. The rest of the bodies had been taken elsewhere for burial by the family members, he said. Corpses covered in white shrouds began to stream into the graveyard soon after the Juma prayers on Friday. The death toll from Old Dhaka's Nimtoli blaze had swollen to almost 120 by the time people got down to burying them as the rain let up. Thousands joined the relatives as they brought in the bodies through Nazimuddin Street to the Azimpur graveyard. The heavy rains pouring down in Dhaka impeded the burials and bodies were covered with tarpaulin. It is feared that the death toll may rise as the patients in critical burns condition die of their injuries. Bangladesh is set to hold national mourning on Saturday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina announced the mourning Friday morning. She made the announcement when she went to visit the victims undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital's burns unit on Friday. The fire brigade officials said that the fire broke out on Thursday at about 9pm after the electrical transformer at Nawab Katra in Nimtali in Dhaka City Corporation's ward 69 burst into flames. Subsequently the fire raced through several apartment complexes, feeding on highly flammable chemicals, plastic goods and a string of small shops that lined the street. Locals said that the transformer explosion was caused by a plastic factory's chemicals catching fire. The plastic factory had caught fire accidentally from a stove pit adjacent to it where people were cooking meals for a wedding engagement that would be held on the roof the building that housed the plastic factory. The drums of chemicals exploded and shot out flames. The transformers, right next to the five-storey building  43/1 Agamasi Lane, Kayettuli  were one of the first to be hit by one of those shooting fireballs. The exploding transformer then spread the fire into several adjacent buildings within a few minutes. No one of the five-storey building survived. Most of the casualties who died were trapped inside the crowded blocks. Dhaka deputy commissioner Mahibul Haque on Thursday night told journalists that all the arrangements were in place for the burial. bdnews24.com/si
