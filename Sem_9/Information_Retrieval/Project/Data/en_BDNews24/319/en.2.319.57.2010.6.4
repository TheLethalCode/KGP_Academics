 Dhaka, June 04 (bdnews24.com)--A policeman and three people were wounded on Friday when hurled a bomb at the police at Gendaria in the capital. The police said the injured were police constable Mohammad Waliur and three passers-by who could not be immediately identified, Wari region deputy police commissioner Toufiq Mahmud told bdnews24.com. The passers-by were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Waliur was under treatment at Rajarbagh Police Lines Hospital, he said. He added that 'Saikat, 25, who made the attack, had been arrested. The police challenged Saikat at Doyaganj police check post at about 6pm and he tried to escape by throwing bombs at them. They recovered five improvised grenades and some gunpowder from the bag that he had been carrying. The bombs match those used in a attack at Jurain, making Saikat a suspected militant. He is being questioned, Mahmud said. The police, when raiding a militants' hideout at a house on May 23, came under a bomb attack in which seven policemen were injured. On that night, a bomb disposal unit deactivated the bombs at a field in Gendaria
