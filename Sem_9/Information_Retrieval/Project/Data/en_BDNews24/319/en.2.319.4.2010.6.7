 WASHINGTON, June 07 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Monday called on world governments to work with the United Nations to improve women's and children's health by the UN-set target date of 2015. "I am here today with a clear message: if we act now, and act together, we can deliver for women," Ban said in the keynote speech to open the Women Deliver conference on health. "We must fight for women?s health with all our resources, all the time. When we work together, we succeed," Ban said, unveiling an action plan that would unite the United Nations and world governments in an effort to "deliver for mothers and children." "Our joint action plan demands that all women and children should benefit from the relatively simple, proven health practices and known technologies that save lives," Ban said. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a videotaped speech delivered to a packed auditorium at the Washington Convention Center that women will only reach their full potential if maternal health care is improved. The United States has pledged 63 billion dollars for a proposal that would help countries to strengthen their health systems, "with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children," Clinton said. Women's and children's health will feature high on the agenda at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Canada, she added. The UN set a target date of 2015 for achieving a set of Millennium Development Goals, which aim to meet specific targets in fighting hunger and poverty, and improving health care and education. Improving maternal health, promoting gender equality and empowering women are among the Millennium Development Goals. "We must address discrimination of all kinds. Gender inequality is a danger to women's health" as was the "worldwide epidemic of violence against women," Ban told the conference. "Women can never fulfil their potential or participate fully in society when they live in fear -- fear of rape as a weapon of war, fear of domestic violence, fear of being trafficked for sex," he said. Melinda Gates, wife of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, was due later Monday to announce major funding for women's and children's health initiatives from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Some 3,500 men and women from 140 countries are expected to attend the three-day conference. On the opening day, participants' national costumes created a swirl of color in the halls and meeting rooms of the convention center. Other participants at the conference include the former presidents of Chile and Ireland, Michele Bachelet and Mary Robinson, as well as actress and women's advocate Ashley Judd. They will call on governments and private donors to commit at least 12 billion dollars to address maternal, reproductive, and newborn health around the worl
