 Chandpur, June 6 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami's Paltan Thana chief Shafiqul Islam has secured bail in a case alleging that he and four other party leaders had hurt Islamic sentiment. Chief judicial magistrate of Chandpur district Mohammed Mozammel Haque on Sunday granted him bail as he surrendered to court in line with a previous court order. Islam also had to sign a Tk 20,000 bond. Nazir Ahmed, senior vice president of Chandpur unit of Bangladesh Islamic Front, had filed the case on March 23 with the chief judicial magistrate, accusing Islam and four other Jamaat leaders of an offence by claiming that they were involved in making statements which suggested that Nizami was suffering in the same way as prophet Muhammad. The other accused in the case - Jamaat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, central executive member Delwar Hossain Sayeedi and the party's Dhaka City chief Rafiqul Islam did not appear in court although they had also been summoned. Jamaat-backed lawyer Saleh Ahmed told reporters that they did not appear in court as the summons order had not reached them. He said Rafiqul attended the court as he had known about the order through newspapers. bd
