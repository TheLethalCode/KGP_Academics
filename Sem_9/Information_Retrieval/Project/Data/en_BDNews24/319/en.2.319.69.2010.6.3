 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)--The trial of a murder case had to be delayed by five days as Dhaka Central Jail authorities could not find the man accused of shooting the victim. In response to a 'show cause' notice, the jail superintendent on Thursday told judge Mohammed Rezaul of the Speedy Trial Tribunal-4 that on Sunday, when the trial was supposed to start, suspect Humayun Kabir had mistakenly been returned to jail. On Sunday, special public prosecutor Rafiqul Islam and the plaintiff had accused the jail authorities of not bringing Humayun to court to shield him from trial. The jail authorities were unable to provide any reason for his absence. Humayon is accused of shooting Asaduzzaman Sanju, a security worker at Shahjalal International Airtport, in front of Kaola Welfare Market of Uttara on 6 Mar, 2009. Two other men, Julhas and Fajlu Mia-- both on bail--are also accused of involvement in the case but were present in court on Sunday. In the presence of all three suspects, the judge started the trial on Thursday morning by taking the statement of the plaintiff Mohammad Ali, Sanju's father. He told the court that his son had told him the names of the murderers before he died. According to the charge sheet, submitted by inspector of Airport Police Station M Samsuddin Saleh Ahmed Chowdhury, the suspects were business partners with Sanju and together leased the pond of the civil aviation authority. On the day of the incident, it was alleged that whilst gossiping around 11pm, Sanju had a heated argument with Humayun, who suddenly drew a pistol and shot Sanju. After being taken to Crescent Hospital, he was transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where he died the next morning The case was transferred to the Speedy Trial Tribunal-4 for faster trial by order of the home ministry. On Sunday, the scheduled date of hearing, the judge could not take the statement as the main suspect was absent. The court has set Monday for questioning the plaintiff by the defendants.
