 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--Twenty-one people accused of running illegal Voice over Internet Protocol business have secured bail from a Dhaka court. A total of 23 people, including Anisur Rahman Sinha and Mohammad Jahangir, a retired major and the chairman-cum-managing director of the private land-phone operator National Phone, had all earlier been charged with the offence. Acting metropolitan sessions judge Ismail Hossain approved the bail on Sunday after the suspects surrendered to the court and appealed for bail. Two other suspects, the company's director Rebeka Jahangir and Rabeya Zaman, had earlier secured bail. Supreme Court's lawyer Anisul Huq argued for the defendants at the hearing. Shahinur Islam, another lawyer for the suspects, told bdnews24.com that the court had granted the bail after each of the suspects signed Tk 10,000 bond. The case records state that on March 23, a team of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission visited the private operator's 82 Mohakhali Tower office and collected data from their switch room. The BTRC team then sought specialist's opinion on the data which confirmed that National Phone had been involved in exchanging illegal international calls. The organisation was claimed to have been robbing the government of a huge amount of revenue. On March 25, BTRC assistant director Maidul Islam filed a case with Gulshan police against the 23 staff. bdnews2
