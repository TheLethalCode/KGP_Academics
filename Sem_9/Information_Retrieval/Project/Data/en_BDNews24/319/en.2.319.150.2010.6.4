 Manchester, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shafiul Islam justified his recall to the Bangladesh team by dismissing Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott to help reduce England to 92 for three at lunch on day one of the second Test here on Friday. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, one of two team changes along with Shafiul, claimed the third wicket 10 minutes before lunch by having opener Alastair Cook (29) caught by Junaid Siddique at slip with his first ball.

Then Trott, following his 226 at Lord's, was bowled for three after an inside edge on to his pad. The wickets brought Pietersen to the crease and immediately Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan introduced his own left-arm spin.

Typically, the belligerent Pietersen advanced down the pitch and drove Shakib through mid-on for four while still in single figures. England earlier handed a Test debut to pace bowler Ajmal Shahzad for the injured Tim Bresnan.
