 London, June 7 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons insists his side can one day develop into a unit capable of challenging the world's top sides despite their dispiriting defeat against England in the second Test at Old Trafford. The Tigers suffered a 2-0 series defeat after being dismissed for 123 to surrender the second Test in Manchester by an innings and 80 runs.

Siddons added: "We've got some improvements to make. I'd hate to come back here and put that performance up next year.
