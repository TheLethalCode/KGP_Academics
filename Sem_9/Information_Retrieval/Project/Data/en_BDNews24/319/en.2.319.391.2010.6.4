 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)The house of businessman Mohammed Gulzar was tastefully decorated with different colour lights. Invited guests were waiting for the would-be bride and groom to arrive. The families of both Runa Akter, the future bride, and the would-be groom Jamil Uddin were savouring the delicacies on offer at the engagement programme. Runa's 50-year-old father Gulzar was overseeing people serving beverages to guests. The daughter went with her elder sister to put the finishing touches to her look at a local beauty salon. Then there came this loud explosion. The five-storey building was quickly covered by fire. Everyone at the party tried to flee the fire, but that was not to be. The blaze had already covered the gate. Thirteen partying people including the mothers of both the would-be bride and groom died, trapped. Runa and her would-be groom were spared. A few are still unaccounted for. Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, fire service and civil defence chief, told reporters that most of the bodies were recovered from this house 43/1 at Nawab Katra . The entire ground floor of the house was a chemical warehouse which easily caught fire and exploded immediately, Shahidullah added. Guests had started crowding the house from Thursday evening. The would-be groom's mother Shahjadi Begum, brother Shimul and his son Kumail, aunties Najnin and Habiba and some other relatives came to the bride's from their house18/10 on Shia road. The would-be bride's younger brother Faisal Ahmed was waiting for the guests at the gate. "Suddenly I heard the sound of a dreadful explosion. There were only blazing flames surrounding me. The fire spread throughout the house in an instant," Faisal told bdnews24.com. "I was forced to move away as it was not possible to enter the house due to the extreme heat. Then I heard people crying from inside the house," Faisal said, breaking into tears. Hearing about the fire, both Runa and Jamil ran to the scene--but they could only be onlookers as the flames spread throughout the area. When the fire was partially doused, fire workers were able to recover the bodies of 13 members belonging to one or other of the families. When the bdnews24.com correspondent spoke to Jamil on Friday morning, he simply said to him, "Tell me what I will do now?" bdnews24.c
