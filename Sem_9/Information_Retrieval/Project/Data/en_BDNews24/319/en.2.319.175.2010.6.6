<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Disaster management minister Abdur Razzaque said in parliament on Sunday that the government will rehabilitate the families of the fire victims after an assessment of the extent of losses in the Old Dhaka inferno. The assessment of loss is being conducted by deputy commissioner Mohibul Haque and local MP Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, he said. At the beginning of his speech, Razzaque quoted what local people and witnesses had said and pointed out the likely causes behind the inferno. He said that the building, where the fire originated, had flammable chemicals stored in a warehouse on the ground floor. A marriage ceremony was ongoing on the second floor and the fire originated from its cooking. The fire fell onto a drum of flammable chemicals on the ground floor and within seconds, set fire to two electric transformers. Local residents, however, were unaware of the storage, he said. Fire service vehicles from all nearby stations rushed to Nimtali on hearing about the fire. However, they failed to reach the scene because of the narrow alleys. Even sufficient water to douse the fire was unavailable and had to be supplied from a pond adjoining Dhaka University's Shahidullah Hall, half a kilometer away from the site. The minister said that the total death toll had reached 117  of which 96 people have so far been identified.. Twenty-five people wounded from the fire are under treatment at government hospitals. Another 25 are undergoing treatment at the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka city following the prime minister's orders. One other fire victim is undergoing treatment under personal supervision. The minister went on to say that every fire-affected family had been given Tk 20,000. The injured are being treated at the government's expense. In addition, he said, each injured person has also been given Tk 10,000 to cover additional expenses. bdne
