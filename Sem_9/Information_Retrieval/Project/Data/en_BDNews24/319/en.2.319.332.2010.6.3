 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka University students damaged four buses in front of the Institute of Fine Arts on Thursday evening protesting running of public transports on the campus. Witnesses said students swooped on the buses as some public transports took short-cuts through university's streets to avoid gridlock on the High Court-Shahbagh route. Public transports using the campus streets is blamed for death of many students in road crashes. Two of the vandalised buses were of Chiriakhana Express and one of City Service while the other could not be unidentified. The students chanted slogans against public transports' use of campus roads. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com drivers of the buses left the scene with their bus following the incident. Dhaka University's security officer Sheikh Mohammed Kamrul Hasan said the campus streets are out of bounds to heavy public transports. He, however, admitted that public buses often entered the campus because of lax watch at the accesses. A Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology fresher, Khandaker Khanjahan Samrat, was run over and killed by a bus in the city's Azimpur area on May 27. The death triggered violent protests by students who had also damaged and set buses on fire. bdnews
