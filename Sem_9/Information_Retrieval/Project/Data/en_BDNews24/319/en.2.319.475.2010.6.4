 Gaibandha, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested two members of the banned Islamist outfit 'Allah'r Dal'. A father and his son, both Allah'r Dal members were at 9.30pm on Thursday, from Sadullahpur, Gaibandha. The arrestees were identified as Mohammad Jul Hossain, 55 and Mohammad Zakir Hossain Angur, 22. They were sent to jail on Friday. Sadullahpur OC Hasan Imam told bdnews24.com that Moksedul Hasan (Mukul Mondol), 43 and Mohammad Hazrat Ali, 26, had been previously arrested at Kishamat Bagchi with Hiali villagers' help. On that basis, Allah'r Dal members kept threatening two villagers of Hiali over mobile phone on May 28. Angry at the villagers, the radical Islamists threatened to obliterate two villages, which had cooperated with the police, with bombs. The scared villagers brought out a procession and sent a memorandum to the upazila nirbahi officer and the local police station. From then on, other members of the banned outfit went into hiding. Receiving secret information, the police arrested Angur from Sadullahpur Bazar and Jul Hossain from his house on Thursday night. bdn
