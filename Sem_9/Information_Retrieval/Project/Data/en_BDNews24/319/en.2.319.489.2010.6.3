 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  Seven employees of the Chittagong Port got back their jobs after a long hiatus of eight years. They were reinstated in line with a shipping ministry order signed by deputy secretary Nasir Arif Mahmud on Thursday. Assistant director Tariqul Islam, gate sergeant Abdul Gani, assistant sub-inspector Abdul Kader and security guards Nurul Absar, Fazlul Quader, Kamal Uddin and Jahangir Arafat were fired in 2003. Of them, Kamal Uddin passed away, Tariqul told bdnews24.com. He said 25 employees had been transferred at the same time on Feb 25, 2003. 12 of them were fired as they protested the transfer order, he said. Five of those employees had filed a case against the order but lost the legal battle. They also appealed to the court in 2008 which is still underway. Later a request was sent to shipping ministry on Oct 11 in favour of the seven, who did not file a case, for reconsidering the termination order. The reinstatement order was issued on Thursday following a government decision. The remaining five could not be reinstated as the case was underway, ministry sources said. bdnew
