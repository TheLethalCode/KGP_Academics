<TITLE> Naoto Kan voted in as Japan PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 04 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Japan's lower house of parliament on Friday voted in former finance minister Naoto Kan as prime minister, replacing Yukio Hatoyama who resigned for mishandling a dispute over a US base. Kan was supported by 313 lawmakers in an election with 477 valid votes. Lower house speaker Takahiro Yokomichi then said: "As a result, this house has decided to appoint Mr Naoto Kan as prime minister." The upper house confirmed Kan as premier with 123 out 237 votes. Kan, a 63-year-old former civic activist, was also deputy prime minister in the centre-left government that came to power last year in a landslide election that ended half a century of almost non-stop conservative rule. "My first job is to rebuild the country, and to create a party in which all members can stand up together and say with confidence, 'we can do it!'" a smiling Kan said in brief comments immediately after the party vote. Kan said his priorities would be to revive the lacklustre economy, restore confidence in his party and root out money politics after the scandals that hit Hatoyama, who received undeclared funds from his millionaire mother. Later Friday, the new premier may announce his cabinet which pundits expect will retain many of Hatoyama's ministers, including Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, a potential rival who in the end backed Kan's candidacy. Kan, the son of a factory manager and a graduate of applied sciences from a top university, campaigned in the 1970s for pacifist and environmental causes and entered parliament with a leftist party in 1980. His party disbanded, and he later co-founded the DPJ with Hatoyama, gaining popularity in the mid-1990s when as health minister he admitted government culpability in a scandal over HIV-tainted blood products. He took a central role when the DPJ took power last September, becoming deputy premier and heading a new National Strategy Bureau, tasked with wresting power from Japan's entrenched and secretive state bureaucracy. In January Kan, although not a trained economist, took over as finance minister. In the post he has advocated a weaker yen and badgered the central bank to do more to help Japan recover from its worst post-war recession. He has also pushed for fiscal austerity and tax rises to reduce a ballooning public deficit that is nearing 200 percent of gross domestic product -- the highest level in the industrialised world. Kan's only rival in the DPJ leadership election was Osaka lawmaker Tarutoko, 50, chairman of the party's environment committee. Public broadcaster NHK reported that Tarutoko had received the backing of lawmakers close to Ichiro Ozawa, a veteran backroom fixer dubbed the "Shadow Shogun" who resigned as the DPJ's secretary general as Hatoyama stepped down. Ozawa's faction includes about 150 of the party's 423 lawmakers, and Kan will have to balance competing interests as he tries to revive Japan's economic fortunes. With only weeks to go before an upper house election expected on July 11, the new leader must quickly rebuild trust in a government whose approval rating has now slumped below 20 percent. "Together with you, I want to build a serious government with an upper house election victory, to realise what Prime Minister Hatoyama wanted to do," Kan told DPJ lawmakers. Hatoyama's support plummeted after he backtracked on an election promise to move an unpopular US air base off the island of Okinawa, enraging locals as well as the pacifist Social Democrats, who quit the ruling coalition. The row badly damaged Tokyo's relations with Washington, which has been Japan's bedrock security ally since World War
