 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)-- A writ petition has been filed with the High Court seeking a rule on the legality of the June 27 general strike called by the opposition BNP. The petition was filed in the bench of Justice Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Naima Haider on Monday. The petitioners are Journalists' Society for Human Rights and Welfare general secretary Azizul Haque Patwari, advocate Mujahidul Islam and Mahbubul Alam Chowdhury. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, the party's secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the government's home and law secretaries and the inspector general of police have been made respondents. Hearing on the petition may be held on Tuesday, Azizul told reporters after filing the petition. Advocate ABM Kamal Uddin will represent the petitioners at the hearing. Khaleda called the countrywide dawn-to-dusk general strike on June 27 at a huge rally at Paltan on May 19. On May 26, the three men sent a legal notice to the BNP chief and the other respondents requesting her to withdraw the strike. They said they would file a writ petition with the High Court if the strike was not withdrawn within seven days of receiving the notice. bdne
