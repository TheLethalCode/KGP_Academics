 Chittagong, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Free movement within the Chittagong city will be restricted just ahead of the city corporation polls scheduled on June 17. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain termed the ban from midnight June 16 to midnight June 17 a "mini-curfew". Speaking at a meeting with law enforcers at the city's circuit house auditorium, the election commissioner said, "Not even a policeman is needed for polls in countries like Britain. But we have to take harsh security measures including such bans." He continued, "No automobiles will be allowed on city roads without permission. Other than this, law enforcers will take immediate measures if they see suspicious movement." The Election Commission's letter to deputy commissioners said that movements of taxi cabs, baby taxis, auto-rickshaws, jeeps, pick-up, car, bus, trucks, tempo, microbus, motor vans within the city corporation area will be completely stopped during the mini-curfew. It also mentioned a ban on motorcycle movement from midnight June 14 to midnight June 17 in the same area. However, vehicles approved by related authorities and employed in various duties including transporting foreign and native poll observers, journalists, poll officials, law enforcers, EC observers, contenders, polling agents and ambulances will not fall under the ban. bd
