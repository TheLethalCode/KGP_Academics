 ANKARA, June 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Turkey was stabbed to death at his home on Thursday, raising concern over attacks against Christians in this mainly Muslim country. Bishop Luigi Padovese, Vicar Apostolic of Anatolia, was attacked in the garden of his summer house in the seaside town of Karaagac, near Iskenderun in Hatay province, the Anatolia news agency and the NTV news channel said. The 63-year-old bishop, an Italian national who has led the Roman Catholic Church in Turkey since 2004, died on the way to hospital, according to the reports. An Italian diplomat, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the murder and a local official said police had detained the murder suspect, the bishop's driver. The governor of Hatay province, home to an ancient tiny Christian community, said the suspected assailant had been apprehended with the murder weapon. "According to our initial findings, the incident is not political," Celalettin Lekesiz told Anatolia. "We learnt that the suspect, who had been Padovese's driver for four-and-a-half years, had psychological problems and was undergoing treatment. The murder looks like a personal matter. A detailed investigation is underway," he added. Lekesiz identified the assailant only as Murat A. NTV said he was a convert to Christianity. The network reported that Padovese's throat had been slit in the attack and broadcast a picture from the crime scene showing a body under a black cover lying next to a pool of blood. The Vatican said it was "dismayed " at the murder. "It is a terrible... incredible" killing, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told the Italian news agency ANSA, adding: "We are dismayed." The Italian embassy in Turkey will send a diplomat to the region to take care of funeral arrangements, the Italian diplomat said. There have been a spate of attacks in recent years against the tiny Christian minority in Turkey, fuelling fears of rising nationalism and hostility against non-Muslims in the country vying for European Union membership. Three Protestants -- a German and two Turks -- were murdered at a Christian publishing house in the eastern city of Malatya in April 2007. Nine people are on trial for the killings. In February 2006, 61-year-old Italian Catholic priest Andrea Santoro was shot dead in the Black Sea port city of Trabzon. The murderer, who was 16 at the time, shouted "Allahu Akhbar" (God Is Great) after committing the crime. The teenager was later sentenced to 18 years and 10 months in jail. Padovese had presided over the memorial service for Santoro whose murder had coincided with uproar in the Muslim world over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed published in European newspapers. In July 2006, another Catholic cleric, French national Pierre Brunissen, survived after being stabbed by a man described as mentally disturbed in Samsun, another Black Sea port city. In December 2007, a young man stabbed Father Adriano Franchini, a 65-year-old Italian, after attending Sunday mass at a church in the western city of Izmir. Franchini also survived The attacker was initially sentenced to five years in jail, which was reduced to four years and two months on account of his good behaviour during the tr
