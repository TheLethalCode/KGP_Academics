 LUXEMBOURG, June 07 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Euro finance chiefs began fixing bumper emergency funds for debt-burdened governments on Monday amid a dizzying fall in the single currency and growing anxiety over Hungary's finances. As world stocks plummeted on fears of a Greece-style meltdown in non-euro Budapest, ministers from the full 27-nation European Union were also to address the heated issue of how far to join up cross-border 'economic government'. Yet talks between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were abruptly postponed, underscoring frequent clashes over bailouts for eurozone strugglers, and a Paris drive to beef up cross-border economic policy. Merkel on Monday unveiled deep government spending cuts intended to shore up the finances of Europe's top economy. Her finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said the exchange rate "evolution shows that we have to work to bring into being what we have started to put in place," referring to a 440-billion-euro eurozone bailout fund. "The markets want to see not only explanations, but also action," he underlined. The EU's economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn admitted that the speed of the euro's fall was a worry, although Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker insisted he was not concerned. Rehn stressed simply: "We need to reinforce confidence in the European economy." On Tuesday, the EU will endorse an offer to make Estonia the 17th eurozone country from January 1, 2011. The euro dipped below 1.19 dollars in Asian trading for the first time since March 2006, briefly changing hands at 1.1882 dollars in Tokyo before clawing back some ground. It also plunged to 108.47 yen, the lowest level in more than eight years. Neil McKinnon of VTB Capital said worries about a "double-dip" recession were rising. International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn insisted that Hungary's financial situation provided "no special reason for concern." In Washington, the IMF warned eurozone countries they must move to "complete the project of monetary union," to tackle the most severe crisis in the euro's history. Leading Hungarian government figures have said the country is in a "state comparable to that of Greece" and that "the bankruptcy of the state is close," leading to a sharp rise in its bond yield. The claim that "the inherited deficit is bigger than expected and that they are on the brink of default (was) a crazy statement for domestic consumption, but utterly irresponsible in the present market environment," said Goldman Sachs chief economist Erik Nielsen. Austrian finance minister Josef Proll, whose banks are said to be heavily exposed in their neighbouring land, stressed: "We have absolutely no reason to be worried now that we have decided on a 750-billion-euro umbrella. "We have opened the umbrella, it works," he maintained. Juncker said beforehand that agreement on how to underwrite guarantees, one month on from announcing its trillion-dollar, joint-IMF bailout fund amid great fanfare, had been reached, overcoming German resistance to collective solidarity. However, Europe's leaders have yet to overcome anxieties that the debt crisis could tip the continent back into recession and rip it apart politically, even though a fall of the euro should help eurozone exporters. Juncker wants eurozone governments to vet each other's national budget plans -- a proposal backed by France but not by Germany. While ministers will debate ideas for strengthening budgetary discipline ahead of a summit of EU leaders next week, firm opposition from Britain to sanctions being applicable outside the 16 countries that share the euro means EU president Herman Van Rompuy's flagship project is already running into problems. One diplomat in Luxembourg added that "the Germans are quite happy to have the British as another counterpoint" to the French. While some are pushing for "automatic and progressive sanctions," disagreements over how far or quickly they should be applied suggest little will be decided any time soo
