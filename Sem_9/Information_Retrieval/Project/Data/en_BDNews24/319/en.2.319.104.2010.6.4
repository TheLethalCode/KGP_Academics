 Europe's debt woes bring up bad 2008 flashbacks Photo 3:51pm IST WASHINGTON/PARIS, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe's festering debt troubles are giving Americans bad flashbacks to 2008 when fears over what lurked on banks' balance sheets paralyzed lending and nearly triggered a global depression. US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wants more disclosure about the health of financial firms. Several Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday they were keeping a wary eye on Europe's problems to ensure they do not obstruct the lending vital to sustaining the recovery. Some Wall Street analysts worry that Europe is not doing enough to prevent another credit catastrophe. Money deposited overnight at the European Central Bank rose to a record high of 320 billion euros on Thursday, evidence that European banks are reluctant to lend even though the central bank has offered virtually unlimited short-term cash. This all sounds a little too familiar to Bob Eisenbeis, chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, New Jersey, and a former Fed researcher. "We fear that European policymakers may be about to make the same mistake US policymakers made in 2008," he said. As the Fed did when US banks balked at lending in 2008, the ECB is flooding markets with liquidity to try to drive down borrowing costs. Eisenbeis said the ECB should ask one critical question first: "Who is paying those higher rates and why?" At issue is whether European banks are suffering from liquidity or solvency problems. Is it merely that volatile financial markets are blocking banks from normal funding channels, or are firms so overloaded with potentially bad debts that no one is willing to lend to them? "When unlimited liquidity provisions are not enough, then it is a solvency crisis," said Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon in London. The United States answered the liquidity-or-solvency question by subjecting its largest banks to "stress tests" to determine whether they could withstand a worsening recession. Many economists have urged Europe to fully disclose results of its own stress testing. The worry is if large capital holes are revealed, there won't be money to fill them. HALF THE PROBLEM Spotting the difference between liquidity and solvency problems isn't easy, and one can beget the other. When creditors question a firm's solvency, they refuse to lend, which can trigger a short-term cash access problem. Likewise, a bank facing a liquidity problem might be forced into fire sales to raise quick cash, driving down the value of its assets and making it insolvent. The lesson learned from 2008 is that policymakers must attack both problems at once, with speed and force. For the United States, that meant the Fed launched a series of emergency short-term lending programs, while Congress approved a $700 billion fund that was used to inject capital into the largest banks in hopes of spurring lending. The second part was a political headache for then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. The banks remained reluctant to lend, prompting howls of protest that Washington was bailing out fat-cat bankers while credit-starved Main Street suffered. Raising a similar war chest in Europe could be even more difficult. Germany's objections to bailing out its neighbors led to months of wrangling to secure European approval for a nearly $1 trillion euro stabilization fund. Asking for a bank bailout fund on top of that would be a nonstarter because most European countries face an electorate "that just does not want to hear of further bailouts," Tullett Prebon's Komileva said. While such a fund does not appear to be a pressing need, it could quickly become one if Europe's debt troubles worsen. Brendan Brown, London-based chief economist at Mitsubishi (UFJ) Securities International, put an 80 percent probability on a banking crisis in Spain, Greece and Portugal within the next six to 12 months. Keywords: EUROZONE/BANKS To be sure, the nearly $1 trillion stability fund is designed to address such concerns and ensure Greece and other at-risk sovereign debt issuers can safely borrow without being at the mercy of unpredictable markets. "We continue to think that the euro area's political and economic leadership will do what is needed to resolve the wider euro crisis," Deutsche Bank economist Peter Hooper wrote in a note to clients. PRICE OF UNCERTAINTY On the surface, banks' bad debt numbers look more manageable now than they did in 2008. The questionable loans currently causing concern were made to governments -- in particular, the fiscally strained foursome of Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland -- rather than overly indebted U.S. homeowners who can more easily default. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said French and German banks were most exposed to Greek debt, although the total amounts were relatively modest. If debt problems engulfed Portugal and Spain, "the impact on the capital of French and German banks could be more challenging." Jim Bianco, president of research firm Bianco Research in Chicago, estimated European banks could face write-downs in the range of $300 billion to $350 billion on sovereign debt. That is a small fraction of the $2.3 trillion in global write-downs wrought by the financial crisis, according to International Monetary Fund estimates. However, doubts persist, and that can be dangerous. Eisenbeis, the former Fed researcher, said investors were not convinced European banks had fully recognized losses stemming from the financial crisis, let alone have sufficient capital cushion to absorb any new sovereign debt losses. "Uncertainty will rule the day until policymakers face the reality that markets need to know," Eisenbeis said. Geithner said European leaders understood that and shared his desire for greater clarity. "Uncertainty has a price, and you can reduce uncertainty if you increase transparency and disclosure," he told reporters before departing for a Group of 20 finance leaders meeting in South Korea, where Europe's troubles are a hot topic. STRESS TESTING Geithner said last year's stress tests were crucial for restoring investor confidence in American banks. As soon as those results were made public, firms were able to raise tens of billions of dollars in private money, meaning they no longer had to rely on taxpayers for survival. Geithner said that put U.S. banks in a stronger position. Europe conducted a round of stress tests last year and is in the process of another, but some analysts have expressed concern that the tests were not uniform across countries, and detailed results have yet to be publicly disclosed. The nightmare scenario would be that Europe divulges that information, but can't come up with the money to plug the gaps. The result would be a run on weak banks that would topple them into a disorderly collapse, much like Lehman Brothers. Ironically, it was severe risk aversion after Lehman's collapse that encouraged banks to load up on seemingly safe government bonds. Mitsubishi's Brown said banks should have been more aware that sovereign debt can be risky, too. "There has been so much discussion about limiting the risk-taking of the too-big-to-fail banking groups but precious little or zero consideration as to why they are amassing government debt portfolios and the systemic dangers which may stem from this," he said. Until investors are convinced there are no nasty surprises lurking on banks' balance sheets, markets will likely stay volatile and lending constrained, leaving the global economy vulnerable to setba
