<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com) - City development authority and real estate regulator Rajuk is set to knock down Nakhalpara's tilted five-storey building on Thursday. "The demolition of the building near West Nakhalpara Samity Bazar will begin around 10am," Shafiqul Islam, Rajuk's Mohakhali zone official, told bdnews24.com. He also said that Rajuk workers had joined the demolition work of the tilted building at Begunbari that began on Sunday. He said that 30 Rajuk workers along with those hired by the building's owner knocked down the building's top floor between 11am and 3pm. They were supervised by a number of Rajuk officials, he said. Islam revealed that the work will resume on Tuesday morning at around 10am and said, "We plan to take down 10-12 risky buildings in the area." Akbar Hossain, the building's caretaker, told bdnews24.com, "We continued our demolition work on Monday morning. Rajuk workers joined us after a while." On Saturday, Rajuk officials had said that they would begin demolition on Monday if the building's owner did not initiate the work by then. The seven-storey building leaned to its north on June 3 resulting in panic amongst the residents and locals as a five-storey building in the same area toppled and crushed 25 people living in tin-shed shanties adjacent to it. bdne
