 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)The government needs to keep fiscal provisions in the upcoming budget to accommodate the likely increases in subsidy for electricity, according to the research body The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). The government has recently unveiled its plan to generate additional 792 MW (megawatts) of electricity in 2010, 920 MW in 2011, 2,296 MW in 2012, 1,675 MW in 2013, 1,170 MW in 2014 and 2,600 MW in 2015. The CPD says the government will have to provide between Tk 3,775 crore and Tk 5,000 crore in subsidies in the next five fiscal years, if the tariff rate of Tk 3.66 per kilowatt hours stays the same. "The government's energy plan is expected to require an increase in the power subsidy of the government and the upcoming budget should have provision to handle that pressure," CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman told the media on Sunday. The private research think-tank launched its report 'State of the Bangladesh Economy in FY2009-10'. If the tariff rate rises by 5.75 percent, the average increase in the last three years, the levels of subsidy would be between Tk 3,200 crore and Tk 4,500 crore, the report says. The CPD feels that as a result, there is a need to increase the power tariff in phases over the next five years. "The hike should be made keeping in mind fiscal absorption capacity, consumers' interest and demand management," added the CPD executive director. On the government's intent on switching to coal-based power, Rahman said investment to this effect should start "immediately" in 2010. According to the report, growth in electricity capacity in the following five fiscal years needs to be in the range of 12.5 to 14.5 percent to meet the targets of GDP growth projected in the Sixth 5-Year Plan. The CPD also stressed reducing systems loss by technical upgrading and curbing illegal operations through strengthening enforcement mechanisms. "A reduction of a mere 5 percent in the existing level of system loss, would save Bangladesh about 202MW of power every day leading to a saving of Tk 1,355 crore annually," Rahman told the news conference. The CPD notes that over the last four years, GDP growth performance has been consistently lower than the targets set in respective budgets. Touching on the outlook for inflation, the report warns that containing food inflation will be critical to bringing down overall inflation. It also said that the rise in farm output appears to have had "no visible impact on prices" as inflation is largely determined by import prices and Bangladesh has to import wheat at global prices. "Rising commodity price trends on the global market in the near future could lead to inflationary pressure in the country's domestic market," said the CPD executive director. Given the high level of crop harvest, it said that it found the overall agriculture scenario satisfactory "If the trend keeps on then it would be possible for us to achieve self sufficiency," Rahman said. However, the 50 percent spending of the revised ADP allocation on water and drainage projects until April this year has been identified as a major downside. The research body stressed increased allocation for the targeted safety net and employment generation programmes to ensure food security. The CPD finds that policy implementation and delivery capacity of the government should be significantly improved along with adopting prudent fiscal management practices to face the challenges in the upcoming fiscal year. It also focused on the need for substantial development in economic governance. "Follow-up actions aligned to the planned activities to stimulate regional cooperation would be another major area the government needs to look on," added the CPD executive director
