 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)A large number of candidates contesting in the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation polls are borrowers, a citizen's watchdog body claims. Of them, two out of eight mayoral candidates have an outstanding loan of over Tk 10 crore, while a total of 59 general councilor candidates owe money to the banks; ten of the councilor candidates owe between Tk 1 crore and Tk 10 crore. Of the general candidates, each of ten general councillor candidates each have a loan amounting up to Tk 10 crore from Tk 1 crore. Sushashoner Janya Nagorik (Citizens for Good Governance) revealed the findings at a news conference held at Dhaka Reporters' Unity office on Friday. Sujon collected the information from the Election Commission. "We hope to build voters education culture through these kinds of efforts," Sujon president professor Muzaffar Ahmed told reporters. Sujon, however, did not make any evaluation, on which Ahmed said, "Voters will evaluate this, not us." The advocacy group also revealed that only half of the eight mayor candidates pay income tax. Ruling Awami League-backed ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury pays Tk 10,900 while main opposition BNP-backed M Manzur Alam pays the highest, about Tk 13,000. In terms of the candidates' assets, it revealed that two mayor candidates and five councilor candidates are billionaires. Sujon found that five mayor candidates and 189 councilor candidates are businessmen. However, 54.23 percent among female councilor candidates are housewives. On education status, the advocacy group revealed that 34.41 percent councilor candidates have no SSC certificates; so are the cases with 45.76 percent female councilor candidates. Shujon vice president Hafizuddin Khan and columnist Syed Abul Maksud, among others, were present at the press conference.
