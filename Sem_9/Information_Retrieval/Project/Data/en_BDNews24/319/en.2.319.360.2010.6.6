 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government's revenue target fell short by over 30 per cent in the first nine months due to low imports and land registration fees. Although the government reached 67.4 percent of its revenue target in three quarters of the current fiscal ending June 2010, non-tax revenues amounted to about 64 percent. Finance minister AMA Muhith told the parliament on Sunday that total revenue collection stood at Tk 535.34 billion till March 2010. "It is a 16.9 percent increase over the same period of the last fiscal." He was presenting the Budget 2009-10: Implementation Status and Macroeconomic Analysis report for the Third Quarter (July-March) in the parliament's budget session. The revenue collection target was fixed at Tk 794.81 billion in this year's budget. Of the revenues collected, NBR's tax revenue accounts for Tk 416.48 billion against a target of Tk 610 billion. Non-NBR tax revenue Tk 18.98 billion against Tk 29.56 billion. The National Board of Revenue has collected non-tax revenues worth Tk 99.88 billion against a target of Tk 155.25 billion. Clearly referring to the large gap, Muhith said the target had fallen short due to low collection from import duty and land registration. "However, in the wake of the recovery from global recession, it is expected that tax and import revenues will rise." The finance minister said that collection of Value Added Tax, supplementary duty and income tax was "satisfactory". "I hope that the revenue target will be achieved by the end of the fiscal." INFLATION STILL GOING HIGH Inflation, on a point-to-point basis, stands at 8.8 percent while average inflation stands at 6.9 percent in March 2010, said Muhith. Point-to-point and average inflation was at 5 percent and 8.5 percent respectively in March 2009. Inflation is increasing due to a rapid hike in prices of imported commodities including crude oil, according to Muhith. The government has taken steps to contain inflation and ease its impact on the people. The measures include raising farm output, ensuring supply of essential commodities, monitoring market systems, starting open market sales (OMS) of commodities, added the finance minister. "These measures and the improvement in the domestic investment scenario, I hope that average inflation can be contained within 6.5 percent by the end of the fiscal." REMITTANCE UP DESPITE RECESSION On remittance inflow and overseas employment, Muhith said the global financial crisis had left an adverse impact on the country's manpower export, especially in the Middle East and Malaysia. A total of 3.24 lakh workers have gone abroad in the first nine months of this fiscal. "The remittance inflow in the first three quarters stood at $8,255 million, growing by 17.4 percent over the same period of the last fiscal," Muhith told the parliament. Meanwhile, foreign reserve almost doubled in the July to March period of the current fiscal compared to the same period of the previous fiscal. Muhith told the parliament that foreign reserves stood at $10.142 billion whereas it was $5.953 billion during the same period last year
