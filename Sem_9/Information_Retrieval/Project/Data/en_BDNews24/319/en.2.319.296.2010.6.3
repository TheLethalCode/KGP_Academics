 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Mirza Abbas on Thursday expressed his concern that the country is edging towards a one-party rule. Abbas was also alarmed over the continuing extra-judicial killings. The standing committee member of the main opposition was speaking at a discussion organised by Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal at the National Press Club to mark Ziaur Rahman's 29th death anniversary. That government had also moved for introducing a virtually one-party system, popularly referred to as BKSAL. "The law minister said that no crossfire had taken place. But crossfires have become regular incidents. A similar situation was created between 1973 and 1975," Abbas said alluding to the last two years of the country's first Awami League government headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of the current prime minister. He sternly criticised the government for cancelling the declaration of the BNP-leaning Bengali daily, Amar Desh, and arresting its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman. "This government wants to take away the people's rights. No one can speak or write against them." The senior BNP leader admitted that some of his party members were involved in the army-backed government's takeover on Jan 11, 2007. Opposition whip Zainul Abdin Farroque said that the ruling party had turned the parliament into a place where the opposition leaders are not allowed to express their opinion. The also questioned the speaker's neutrality and said, "He always turns our mikes off whenever we have something to say." Juba Dal vice-president Abdus Salam Azad, Dhaka University teacher Mahbub Ullah and other Juba Dal leaders were also present at the meeting.
