<TITLE> High-rises on weak ground 'unsafe' </TITLE>

 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Many high rise buildings in Dhaka city are tilting because they were constructed on a weak ground base or on land developed by filling in water bodies, geologists and engineers say. Constructing buildings without complying with construction regulations or with engineering faults are also responsible for creating panic among Dhaka residents . These experts' views came following the latest incident of a building collapse at the city's Begunbari, the leaning of other buildings at Nakhalpara and the cracks discovered on a high-rise apartment at Shantinagar in the capital. Residents evacuated the tilting buildings in panic and others living in high-rises have been suffering significant uncertainty. However, eminent engineer Jamilur Reza Chowdhury asked the media not to spread panic if they see buildings tilt or cracks develop, without first examining the geotechnical engineering of the structures. Terming Dhaka as an unplanned city, the former BRAC University vice-chancellor asked the government to expedite detailed area plan of Dhaka City, proposed by Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkhothe capital development authority. A five-storey building at 18/B on Post Office alley at Begunbari toppled and crushed several tin-shed shanties by its side on June 1, claiming at least 25 lives. Another seven-storey building tilted on June 4 in the same area at Begunbari. There has been another five-storey building at Nakhalpara in Tejgaon industrial zone which reportedly tilted. THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL TECHNOLOGY Bangladesh Geological Survey Directorate's city engineering director ATM Asaduzzaman told bdnews24.com that the collapsed building was constructed unauthorized on weak ground on a dead canal at Begunbari. He warned that Dhaka would turn into a death trap if pubic awareness is not created against unplanned urbanization. Asaduzzaman said that three dimensional model technology has recently been introduced in the capital to save the high rises, constructed by filling in low-lying and marshy land, from probable disasters. A two-year project titled 'Building Ground Information System' (BGIS) for Dhaka city ended last year after examining 60 square kilometres (sqm) of land in Badda and 18 skm land at Kakrail. The programme will be extended to 1,000 skm land in the greater Dhaka, said Asaduzzaman, the project director. The new technology would help ease in the planning and implementation of building construction according to the ground condition. It would eventually also help reduce the risks of earthquake, landslides and other natural disasters, he said. The BGIS has already observed that construction of structures on land in Badda area, which has been developed by filling lowland area, was the most unsafe. Dhaka is one of the most environmentally risk-prone cities in the world, Asaduzzaman said, suggesting that the three dimensional model should be followed in urbanization of the metropolis. He warned that a moderate quake could devastate Dhaka city. He said that there was no alternative to this technology for structures. The technology allows the project team to look at the features of the surface 100 feet (30 metres) down. The information on the three dimensional models could be supplied for free to ordinary. people. By using the three dimensional data and recommendations one can determine which land areas are unsafe. UNSAFE BUILDINGS Rajuk planning department director Abdul Mannan said they were frequently receiving complaints of leaning or cracked buildings. "Such complaints are not new - it is just that people are getting frightened over the recent incidents." He said these buildings are among 5,000 buildings marked by Rajuk as faulty and risky buildings in the capital. Mannan said a 10-member committee has recently been formed with the chief engineer of Rajuk to make another list of highly risky buildings from the initial list. Prof Jamilur Reza Chowdhury, convener of the committee, said they had submitted the detailed area plan report to the government on April 12. Recommendations in the report include shifting the chemical factories from old Dhaka and stopping structure construction by filling in water bodies. bdnews2
