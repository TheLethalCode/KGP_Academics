 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  City development authority RAJUK began on Monday the demolition of the seven-storey building at Begunbari, Tejgaon, which has been tilting to one side since Friday . About 30 workers of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkho began knocking down the building at around 11am along with men employed by the building owner, said Shafiqul Islam, the officer in charge of RAJUK's Mohakhali zone. RAJUK officials are monitoring the work, he said. Earlier on Sunday workers of the owner started the dismantling work. The building (40/A/7 North Begunbari) was seen to have tilted on Friday scaring residents and local people into thinking that there might be an imminent collapse, particularly since three days earlier, a total of 25 people died when a five-storey building in the same area toppled over onto an adjacent slum Following an on-site visit on the Friday itself, RAJUK threatened to dismantle the building if the owner did not start demolition by Monday. It also hung a demolition notice on Saturday and the building's electricity connection was cut. All the residents of the building had moved out by then fearing collapse. Mizanur Rahman, assistant police commissioner of Tejgaon Industrial Zone, said on Sunday that police officials were deployed around the building at RAJUK's request to avoid any untoward incident. He also said that the building's owner Siraj Miah was in jail. bdne
