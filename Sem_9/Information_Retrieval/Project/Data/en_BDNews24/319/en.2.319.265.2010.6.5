 Chittagong, June 5 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party mayoral candidate Solayman Alam Sheth withdrew his candidature from the June 17 city corporation election in favour of Awami League-backed candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury on Saturday. The JP candidate, who made the declaration at a press conference three days after the stipulated time for withdrawal of candidature, launched his campaigns with the 'television' symbol. His name, however, will still be on the ballot paper. The city JP convener on June 1 declared that he would not withdraw his candidature for any excuse. Solayman told reporters that he would stop campaigning against Mohiuddin, who is contesting under the banner of Nagorik Committee. He said the opposition candidate might win the polls due to the separate candidature of the two allies of the Grand Alliance government. But even before he could complete his briefing, JP supporters started agitation following his declaration. They also vandalised furniture at the party office and chanted slogans against the candidature of Mohiuddin. The agitated supporters also blockaded the adjacent road. bdnew
