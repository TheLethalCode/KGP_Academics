 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Amar Desh acting editor's lawyer has expressed concern over the police bid to take his client into remand. Barrister Nasir Uddin Ashim, lawyer of Mahmudur Rahman, expressed this concern in a press conference on Saturday noon. Acting editor of a pro-BNP Bengali daily newspaper Mahmudur Rahman was an energy advisor to the BNP-led government and also headed the Board of Investment for the first few years of that government's tenure. Ashim pointed out that the police had interrogated his client on June 3 at the gate of the Dhaka Central Jail in line with the court directive. "Still the investigation officer appealed Mahmudur's remand that evening. This is alarming." The jail authority is not allowing him to sign the 'vakalatnama' which would authorise another individual to represent him in court. The lawyer also alleged that the Mahmudur was kept under inhuman conditions, which Ashim said he had learnt from his visits to the jail. He resented the fact that Mauhmudur had not been given division although he was an energy advisor with the status of a state minister before. According to the Warrant of Precedence of the home ministry, he should be given division-1, which would provide Mahmudur with some privileges compared to those of the common jail inmates. "But the jail authority is not following that." He is kept there like an ordinary prisoner, sleeping on the floor, said Ashim. Police arrested Mahmudur from his office at Karwan Bazar on June 2. Two cases were filed against him on fraud and obstructing police duty. The court ordered him to jail in case filed for obstructing police duty, although he got bail in the fraud case. Barrister Syed Ijaz Kabir and senior reporter of 'Amar Desh' Oliullah Noman were present among others in the conference. Earlier on June 1, the government closed down the opposition-leaning Bengali daily hours after its publisher Hashmat Ali sued acting editor Mahmudur Rahman for fraud.
