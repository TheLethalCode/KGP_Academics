"We have to find out those people responsible for this criminal offence," said Sengupta. "Someone will have to get punishment for this." He said the government had done enough after the tragedies. Jatiya Party MP Mujib-ul-Haque Chunnu supported him and urged MPs to contribute one day's allowances for the rehabilitation of the fire victims in Old Dhaka.
