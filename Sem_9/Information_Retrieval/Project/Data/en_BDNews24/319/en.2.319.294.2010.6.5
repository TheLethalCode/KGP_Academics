He issued the call on Saturday, when he visited those injured in the fire, now receiving treatment at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital's burns and plastic surgery unit. Rahman told reporters: "I am very shocked at the most tragic event in memory. I pray for the departed souls." He hoped the patients would soon recover with a concerted effort from society at large. He sympathised with the bereaved families. The president also thanked the prime minister for her immediate measures after the incident.

The death toll from the roaring blaze rose to 117 until Friday evening. The fire broke out on Thursday night at about 9pm after the electrical transformer at Nawab Katra in Nimtali in Dhaka City Corporation's ward 69 burst into flames. The fire raced through several apartment complexes, feeding on flammable chemicals and plastic goods in a string of small shops lining the street below, fire officials said.
