<TITLE> Strauss coy over Shahzad-Sidebottom choice </TITLE>

 Manchester, England, June 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- England captain Andrew Strauss gave little away about the composition of his side ahead of the the second and final Test against Bangladesh, which starts on Friday here at Old Trafford. Pace bowler Tim Bresnan suffered a stress fracture of his left foot during England's comprehensive eight-wicket victory at Lord's, concluded on Monday, and has been ruled out, meaning England must change a winning team. England have a preference for playing six batsmen and four bowlers, and Strauss indicated to reporters here on Thursday that uncapped Yorkshire seamer Ajmal Shahzad and left-arm quick Ryan Sidebottom, who has played in 22 Tests, were in a straight shoot-out for Bresnan's spot. "That looks like the likely scenario at the moment," Strauss said. "The balance of the side issue is something we look at on a case-by-case basis but this wicket should have a bit more in it for the bowlers. "Generally there's a bit more pace and bounce here, so we are probably leaning towards four bowlers. "With Ryan we know what we will get, he's a very experienced campaigner, very good in English conditions, and brings that different angle being a left-armer. "Ajmal we don't as much about at this stage but are very excited about what we've seen which is why he's been in the squad. He bowls with good pace, keeps running and can swing the ball both ways. "It's a choice between youth and experience and we have to decide what is the best way of winning this Test." Everything England do this home season in their two Tests with Bangladesh and four against Pakistan will be viewed through the prism of their upcoming tour of Australia. Although they hold the Ashes, it is 23 years since England won a Test series in Australia and opening batsman Strauss, asked about the balance between focusing on the present and planning ahead, said: "You have to look at a bit of both but primarily this game. "It's about winning and winning consistently then things will become clear as the summer goes on as to the personnel we need. "I'd like to say we've half an eye on it, but the more immediate concern is this game." Australia captain Ricky Ponting suggested his side would be a better, more hardened, team for their experience of losing the Ashes 2-1 in England last year but Strauss said: "Experience counts for a bit but not everything. "I'd rather have a youngster who is a world-class performer than an experienced player whose powers are on the wane. "A lot of the guys from the 2009 Ashes will be available to us in Australia and will have gained hugely from that experience because an Ashes series is different to any other series. "The bowling attack is still pretty fresh, but there's a nice mix between guys who have been there and those who are starting to kick on -- the likes of Ian Bell, Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott -- so I don't think experience is a massive is
