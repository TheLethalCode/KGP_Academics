 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court has given the CID another two months to investigate the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on a Awami League rally in Dhaka, which killed 24 people including Ivy Rahman, a senior party leader. Sheikh Hasina, then the opposition leader, was among those injured in the attack. Metropolitan sessions judge Ismail Hossain on Thursday fixed Aug 3 for submission of an investigation report on a time-extension motion filed by the Criminal Investigation Department. CID's Abdul Kahhar Akand, the investigation officer in this case, filed the petition seeking three more months. Public prosecutor Shah Alam Talukder told bdnews24.com that the judge granted the extension as the probe was still in progress. It is the fourth extension given since investigations were reopened into the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, he added. On August 3 last year, Md Masdar Hossain, the then judge of Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal 1, had initially directed further investigations after taking statements of some 61 witnesses. Two cases were originally filed in connection with the grenade attack, one for killings and the other for use of explosives. On October 14 last year, the cases were transferred to the metropolitan sessions judge's court and the CID was given another extension. Investigation into the case did not proceed due allegedly to the reluctance of the BNP government, which was in power. The Awami League accused the previous BNP administration of attempting to derail the case through different means including recording of false statements from witnesses. After BNP's tenure was over, new investigations were ordered and on June 11 last year police pressed charges against 22 people. BNP leader Nasiruddin Pintu and JMB leader Mufti Hannan were among the accused. BNP's former state minister for home, Lutfozzaman Babar, now in jail, was also recently shown arrested in connection with the grenade attack. bd
