 Chandpur, Jun 03 (bdnews24.com)  A court has granted the police one day to question ANM Ehsanul Haque Milan in a case alleging that he attempted to murder Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. The senior judicial magistrate court of Chandpur on Thursday also warned the police not to torture Milan or they would be held in contempt. Milan is currently in jail on a case, filed in May 2010 by Majibur Rahamn of Sachar area in Kacua Upazila, which alleges that he along with six other men vandalised the car of Alamgir, the Awami League MP from Kachua, and attempted to murder him. BNP leader Milan, the former state minister of education, lost to Alamgir in the parliamentary elections on Dec 29, 2008. On May 20, the police had applied to the court for Milan to be detained in police custody for 10 days. Kamrul Islam, Milan's lawyer, told reporters that the case alleged that Milan and his supporters had tried to kill Alamgir in Kachua bazar on Sep 14, 2001. It is further alleged that in Oct 2003, Milan had burnt down houses in the Sachar area. Kamrul claimed that the case is politically motivated and baseless. Earlier at around 2pm, hundreds of BNP activists brought out a procession and formed a human chain demanding Milan's release. As Milan was brought to the court, protesters started throwing brickbats at the police. This led to a chase and counter-chase. The OC of Chandpur Model Police Station Kazi Abdul Kaiyum said that 10 people were injured in the incident, but he could not name them. "16 BNP activists were arrested for their involvement. Legal action will be taken against them," said the OC. Out of the 16 arrested, seven were identified as  'Mamun' (30), 'Manir' (35), Jahirul Haque (38), 'Harun' (30), 'Habib' (30), Abul Kahir (22) and 'Sohel' (23). bdnews24
