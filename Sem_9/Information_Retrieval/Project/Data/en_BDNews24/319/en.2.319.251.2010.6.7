 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)Planning minister A K Khandker on Monday tabled a bill for amending the public procurement law for a second time under the Awami League-led government. The proposed "Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill 2010" will authorise the government to implement projects costing up to Tk 2 crore without calling tender. The amount was Tk 50 lakh when the government first brought an amendment to "Public Procurement Act-2006" last year. The amendment bill waived a provision that would allow only experienced contractors to get the job. Concerns were raised that it could open the floodgates to abuse and corruption by government and ruling party supporters and compromise the quality of public works. If the bill is passed, inexperienced local contractors will be able do work worth up to Tk 2 crore. It will also authorise the government departments to float "limited tenders" for internal procurement worth Tk 2 crore. Experts say the "limited tender" means that the departments will at best hang tender notices on notice boards of respective departments instead of publishing tender notices in widely published newspapers. Earlier, donors such as the World Bank raised objections about the 2009 amendment bill, saying such move may hamper transparency in public sector. The Bank objected to four specific provisions in the PPAa lottery system, no qualification/experience requirements, rejection of bids above or below 5 percent of estimate, and single stage two-envelope system for procurement of goods and works. But the government claims that the amendment bills will speed up implementation of government projects which sometimes are hindered by lengthy tendering process. The bill went to the parliamentary standing committee on planning ministry for further scrutiny. The committee has been given 30 days to finalise its recommendations on the bill
