<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has demanded an explanation from the government about why there should not be specific guidelines in the appointment of judges to ensure transparency. Also, it wants to know it why the guidelines should not be published in a gazette. The bench of justices Md Imman Ali and Obaidul Hasan gave the order on Sunday on a public interest petition filed by barrister Ragib Rauf Chowdhury on May 30. The bench also asked the law secretary to inform it within four weeks following what process the judges have been appointed so far. Chowdhury, the petitioner, alleged politicisation in the appointment of judges, sparking discontent among the parties. Many partisan and incompetent people have been appointment as judges because of the lack of transparency, he added. Referring to the historic verdict on judicial officer Masdar Hossain's case on an independent judiciary, the petition said it had stressed transparency in the appointment of judges in line with article 22 of the Constitution. Barrister Hasan SM Aziz said at Sunday's hearing that the Supreme Judicial Commission was formed during the caretaker government's term to appoint judges. But the commission is no more effective as it was not endorsed by the parliament, he said. He said politicisation in the appointment of judges should be done away with. bd
