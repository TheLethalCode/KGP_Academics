<TEXT>
 Shyedul Islam Talat Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) -- The perpetually over-stretched DMCH burn unit faces its biggest ever challenge with dozens of patients streaming in on Thursday night. Patients, mostly victims of the raging Nimtali fire in Old Dhaka, added to the patients lying about in the corridors of the hospital floor. Project director of Burn and Plastic Surgery Unit of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital at the Dr Samanta Lal Sen said, "It is normal for the number of patients to outnumber the 50 beds available in the unit." "But this is the first time we have had to deal with so many victims at one time." There are 17 regular doctors and 26 nurses in the unit but an additional 10 doctors and 10 nurses have been allocated to the unit from other departments, with a further 10 nurses joining the team soon. One problem is that the unit's staff members are having to deal with large numbers of people who have come to see the injured - many of them unrelated to the victims. Samata Lal Sen said, "We cannot work properly as around 3000-4000 people are visiting the unit every day." "Even security guards are failing to check the onrush of visitors," he said. "We are trying our best but the presence of huge crowd has made it almost impossible for us to do our job," he claimed. AID AND GRANT A long queue of blood donors formed at the DMCH soon after the announcement that blood would be needed for the injured. The Burn's Unit registrar Dr Ashafruzzaman said, "People from all backgrounds have been willing to donate blood - and we have made a list of 250." "We are collecting blood from them when necessary," he said. We are also getting many offers of grants, adding that Action Aid, Popular Infusion, AB Bank and an individual donor called Hannan have already given aid including medicine and other materials. Ashrafuzzaman said, "We are not taking any cash money, but people can help the injured by giving medicine and bandages." Samanta Lal however said, "We have enough of the requisite medicine. But if any one is really interested to help, he can offer a grant to help buy a blood gap analyser and ICU which would help not only the current patients but also patients in the future." b
