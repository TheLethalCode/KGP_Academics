 ANKARA, June 4 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - Turkey will reduce economic and defence ties with Israel, but bilateral cooperation will not be entirely frozen after the Gaza ship raid, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said Friday. Ankara "will reduce relations in these fields to a minimum level, taking into account whether (cooperation) already exists... whether payments have been made or not," Arinc said on NTV television.

Speaking after the raid on the aid ships, Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul said the crisis would not hamper the completion of the project. Israel is expected to deliver the remaining four drones in June or July, he said.

In previous years, Israeli companies have modernised about 100 Turkish F-4 and F-5 fighter jets in a deal worth some 700 million dollars, and sold Turkey rockets and electronic equipment. In 2002, Israeli Military Industries won a 668-million-dollar tender to upgrade 170 M60 tanks, the delivery of which was completed in Ap
