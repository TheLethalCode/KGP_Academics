<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) The seven-storied building at North Begunbari in the capital, which was identified on Friday as tilting to one side, will begin to be demolished on Monday, RAJUK officials said. The twelve families who used to live in that building have moved out. Police have also been posted around the house and its electricity line has been cut. Abdur Razzaque, one of the tenants said, "No one has been allowed to enter the house since Friday morning." "I have been staying at somebody's house since last night. Police asked me to remove all my articles from the building. But I do not know where I will stay in days to come. I am in extreme trouble," he said. "I do not know how I will get back Tk 20,000 which I paid as an advance," he said adding that many others like him are owed money from the owner. Mizanur Rahman, assistant police commissioner of Tejgaon industrial area, confirmed that house owner Siraj Miah had been arrested on Friday night, and was produced in court on Saturday. Akbar Hossain, the caretaker of the building told bdnews24.com: "Though the approval was given for a three storeyed building, it was made into a seven-storeyed by managing the RAJUK officials." However, while visiting the building on Saturday, RAJUK director Sheikh Abdul Mannan rejected the allegation. He said that the building was constructed without approval. "The owner has been asked to dismantle the house. If it is not done, RAJUK will begin the demolishing work from Monday," he added. RAJUK has already hung a notice on the building stating that it will be demolished. Mannan also said, "There are some other unapproved buildings at Begunbari adjacent to Hatirjheel." "Those will be dismantled too. But there are court directions not to demolish some buildings," he added. RAJUK Mohakhali zonal official Shafiqul Islam said, "Most of the buildings at Begunbari are unsafe as they were built without approval." "Twenty buildings in the area have been identified as unsafe. But ten were dangerously unsafe. These buildings will be dismantled in phases," he told bdnews24.com. Earlier in the week a nearby building had collapsed killing 25 people. bdnews24.com/
