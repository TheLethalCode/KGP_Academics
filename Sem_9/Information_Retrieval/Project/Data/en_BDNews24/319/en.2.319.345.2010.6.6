<TEXT>
 KABUL , June 6 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Afghanistan's president Sunday ordered a review of the cases of hundreds of prisoners linked to the Taliban and other militants in a first step to fulfilling the demands of a landmark peace conference. "(Hamid) Karzai has ordered a review of the cases of persons in detention for links with the armed opposition", his office said, indicating that a committee would be set up to oversee the investigation. The three-day "jirga" in Kabul wrapped up on Friday with a 16-point resolution which included a call for the release of prisoners allegedly detained without any evidence proving their links to insurgents. "As a gesture of a goodwill, the government of Afghanistan should take immediate and solid action in freeing from various prisons those detained on the basis of inaccurate information or unsubstantiated allegations," the resolution said. A committee led by the justice minister will look into the cases of people detained for links with militants without "sufficient legally binding criminal evidence", Karzai's office said. Representives from the Supreme Court, the independent Peace and Reconciliation Commission, the Attorney General's Office and the head of the Presidential Legal Advisory Board will form the committee, the statement added. About 1,600 delegates from across Afghanistan's political and social spectrum attended the jirga -- which was attacked by the Taliban on its opening day -- with Karzai pledging to implement its decisions. The president's office did not specify if the review included prisoners detained in US-run prisons. There was no government official immediately available for comment. The peace conference also demanded the removal from a UN terrorists blacklist of militant leaders including Mullah Omar, the Taliban chief, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a former premier who now wages "jihad" against Karzai and his foreign military back
