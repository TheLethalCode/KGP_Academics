 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--More burns units will be formed in hospitals in the capital city, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque told parliament. Taking questions on Sunday, the minister said such facilities would be extended to the district towns. "The prime minister has already issued instructions. We had a meeting with the World Health Organisation [on Sunday]. They said they would cooperate," he said. Answering a question, Ruhal said, "The government has plans to increase the number of beds in the hospitals at Upazila (sub-district) level. Already 163 Upazila hospitals have been increased from 31-bed hospitals to 50-bed ones and the project is on-going. "Gradually all the Upazila hospitals will be developed into 50-bed ones." Answering a supplementary question, he said the health sector was ignored during the past regime of the four-party coalition government. "During the four-party coalition government's tenure, the health sector was degraded through partisanship. Even some people without a degree became professors," he said. A new rule makes it mandatory for the doctors to work two years at the sub-district level, said the minister. He requested MPs to take note of whether the doctors were actually present or not in the hospitals. b
