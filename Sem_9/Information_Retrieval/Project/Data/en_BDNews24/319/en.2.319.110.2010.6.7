 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)--- The historic six-point day is being observed on Monday, a remarkable day in the history of Bengalis when they were pressing for the autonomy of the then East Pakistan before the birth of Bangladesh. Prime minister and Awami League Sheikh Hasina along with cabinet members, central party leaders and MPs paid floral tribute at the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Dhanmondi 32, opposite to the Bangabandhu Museum. National and party flags have been hoisted on top of Bangabandhu Museum, AL headquarters and other party offices across the country marking the day. Parliament deputy leader and AL presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, after paying tribute, said the incumbent government would accomplish the trial of war criminals and root out militancy at any cost. AL will hold a discussion meeting at 4pm at Osmani Memorial Auditorium. Sheikh Hasina will be present there as chief guest. Independence architect Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib had announced his historic six-point political and economic programme in Lahore in 1966, aiming to attain greater autonomy of the then East Pakistan. To press for the demands, a countrywide strike was observed at the call of Awami League on this day, in 1966. During the strike Monu Mia, Shafiq, Shamsul Haq and a number of other picketers were shot and killed by the Pakistani army in Dhaka, Narayanganj and Tongi. The six- point demand turned into a 'charter of freedom' for the Bengali who had been subjected to discrimination in the then East Pakistan. The movement paved the way for the Bengali's' ultimate fight for independence in 1971 under the leadership of Sheikh Mujib. In a message the prime minister called on all to turn the dreams of the 7 June martyrs into a reality by building a Bangladesh free from hunger, poverty and illiteracy. In his message president Zillur Rahman paid tribute to the martyrs and prayed for the salvation of the souls who sacrificed their lives on this day for establishing the rights of people. "The Historic six-points instils a patriotic zeal into our mind and inspires us to build a Bangladesh free from hunger and poverty. "I pay deep respect to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the inevitability and cause for independence of Bangladeshi lie in Six Point Movement." bdn
