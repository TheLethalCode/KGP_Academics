 ROODEPOORT, South Africa, June 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Edson Buddles first two international goals helped United States beat Australia 3-1 in both teams final World Cup warm-up match here on Saturday. The LA Galaxy striker scored twice in the first half with substitute Herculez Gomez adding a third in stoppage time after Tim Cahill had levelled in the first half. USA went ahead after four minutes when Vince Grella dwelt on the ball too long and Buddle stole it. The striker took three steps and unleashed a perfect right-foot shot that easily beat Mark Schwarzer. Australia started to win more possession but were hit on the break in the 15th minute when Clint Dempseys through ball found Robbie Findley in the clear and he did well to round Schwarzer only to miss a gaping goal with his shot. The Socceroos hit back four minutes later through Cahill as he reacted quickest to a Jason Culina corner and scored his 21st international goal. USA continued to be a threat on the break and Dempsey nearly restored the lead with a shot Schwarzer tipped around the post. In the 31st minute, the Americans did get their second goal as right-back Steve Cherundolos cross picked out Buddle at the back post and he made no mistake with a header. Australia should have levelled soon after when Cahill's cross was met by Josh Kennedy, but his header went wide off a post. Both managers made changes at half-time, with Cahill replaced by Carl Valeri and Marcus Hahnemann coming on for USA goalkeeper Tim Howard. Hahnemann was called into action almost immediately, but Kennedy wasted another good chance from a Scott Chipperfield cross. A sublime through ball from Landon Donovan then set up Buddle for his hat-trick, but he unselfishly squared to Findley, who saw his shot bounce back off the crossbar. Dempsey followed up with a header into the net only to be ruled offside. Hahnemann had to be at his best as Australia pressed forward in search of an equaliser with the Wolves keeper saving well from Mark Bresciano and Chipperfield. Gomez eventually made the game safe for the first Group C rivals of England when he slammed home Donovan's cross three minutes into injury
