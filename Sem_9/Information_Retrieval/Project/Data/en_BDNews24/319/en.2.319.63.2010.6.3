 PARIS, June 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - A Rwandan accused of taking part in the 1994 genocide in his country was on Thursday arrested in the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, legal sources said. Octavien Ngenzi, a former mayor of the town of Kabarondo who is suspected of having taken part in the massacre of hundreds of ethnic Tutsis, is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by Rwanda last year. He was being held in Mamoudzou, the capital of the French overseas territory, legal sources in Paris said. The charges against him include crimes against humanity and genocide. Rwandan authorities suspect him of having ordered and led several massacres in Kibungo province, including one carried out on April 13, 2004 by Hutu militiamen in a church in Kabarondo that left a thousand Tutsis dead. Another Rwandan facing genocide charges, Pascal Simbikangwa, was arrested on Mayotte in 2008 and is currently being held in Paris. Rwandan President Paul Kagame said this week that France's decision to arrest key suspects accused of involvement in the genocide was "long overdue." French police last week arrested Rwandan doctor Eugene Rwamucyo. That arrest came three months after police detained Agathe Habyarimana, the widow of Rwanda's assassinated ex-president and one of the alleged masterminds of the Tutsi genocide. Rwanda had repeatedly accused France of allowing genocide suspects to live comfortable lives in French towns and villages and turning a blind eye to calls for them to face justice. France has transferred three Rwandan suspects to Tanzania to face prosecution before an international tribunal, but judges have so far refused to extradite genocide suspects to Kigali. In recent cases, French courts have ruled that the suspects cannot expect a fair trial in their homeland. An estimated 800,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis, were massacred over the course of about 100 days from April to July 1
