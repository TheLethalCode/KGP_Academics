<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, June 4 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Cyprus on Friday on a three-day "pilgrimage," hoping for harmony between the rival Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on the divided eastern Mediterranean island. The pontiff, who said he was following in the footsteps of the apostles Paul and Barnabas, said the island was blessed by a "resilient Christian heritage" and saluted the head of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos II, as his "brother." The pope also told reporters traveling with him that he hoped Middle East peace should not be lost after a deadly Israeli raid on a Gaza aid flotilla which had set off from off Cyprus. Benedict was greeted in the southwestern resort of Paphos by Chrysostomos and by President Demetris Christofias, who said "Cyprus is in need of your words of peace, given the difficult situation the island is facing." Turkish troops have been stationed in the breakaway north of the island since a 1974 invasion in reaction to a Greek Cypriot coup seeking to unite the island with Greece. "Allow me to say that Cyprus is in need of your prayers and your contribution in order to quickly regain its unity and freedom," the president added. The 83-year-old pontiff made an oblique reference to the division, which continues after decades of fruitless UN-sponsored talks. "May the love of your families and the desire to live in harmony with your neighbours" under God's protection "inspire you patiently to resolve the remaining concerns that you share with the international community for the future of your island," he said. Benedict is the first pope to visit Cyprus, and this is his first trip to an Orthodox country, which has raised eyebrows among more traditional churchmen in the country and threats by some of them of a boycott. But his first stop after leaving the Paphos airport was the nearby ancient church of Agia Kyriaki Chrysopolitissa, where he was to take part in an "ecumenical celebration" with Chrysostomos, who has called on people to welcome him. Highlighting local sensitivities, police confiscated a Turkish flag from a Turkish Christian delegation from Istanbul who had gathered in the church. As always with papal trips, Benedict will meet and pray with the Catholic faithful, but the numbers in Cyprus will be much more subdued because the community represents only a small minority of the population apart from Asian expat workers. He also has an official mission to hand over to Catholic prelates who have come to Cyprus from the Middle East a working document for a synod on regional issues to be held in October. Referring to the latest troubles in the Middle East, the pope told reporters aboard his flight: "In all of these episodes we have been living through, there has always been the danger that people lose patience and say: 'I no longer want to seek peace.'" "In the face of each instance of violence, you must not lose patience or courage," he said in response to a written question submitted in advance. "You always have to begin again afresh in the certainty that you can go forward and achieve peace." Unveiling the pope's programme, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said "peace will be the key of this trip," emphasising unity among Christian churches and ecumenism. Some Cypriot clergy view the pope as a heretic, and a number of bishops have said they will boycott a visit by Benedict to the archbishop's palace. Influential Bishop Athanasios of Limassol drew a rebuke from Chrysostomos after saying "we love the pope, we love his followers like we do all people, we do not show them contempt or reject them as people, but we do not accept heresy or accept the wrong faith." Lombardi dismissed the opposition as "marginal." There have been unconfirmed reports that there might be demonstrations by people incensed over the paedophilia scandal in the Roman Catholic Church, or angry over the church's leader coming to Orthodox Cyprus. Some 1,000 police have been deployed to ensure that the pope's visit passes without incident. The pope will spend Saturday and Sunday in the capital Nicosia, where he will celebrate two mas
