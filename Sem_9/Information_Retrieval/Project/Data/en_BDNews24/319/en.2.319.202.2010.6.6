 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--The Jamaat-e-Islami has formally decided to back the June 27 hartal called by the main opposition party even though it had previously vehemently opposed general strikes when sharing power with the BNP. Party secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed told reporters at its Moghbazar office on Sunday evening that the decision was taken at a meeting of the executive committee in the morning. But the active participation of the Jamaat supporters has yet to be decided, he added. BNP chief Khaleda Zia had called for the dawn-to-dusk countrywide general strike on June 27 to protest what she called 'Awami League misrule'. Khaleda made the call protesting the utilities crisis, tender-grabbing, extortion and demanding dissolution of the Election Commission and cancellation of treaties with India. She also announced a mass sit-in at the Institute of Engineers Bangladesh on June 9 protesting 'government interference in the judicial system'. A countrywide protest programme was also set for June 17. Mojaheed said Jamaat will also join the June 9 programme. He said, "The decision was taken at the central executive committee meeting since there is no alternative to a concerted movement to unseat this government." Mojaheed claimed that the hartal will not increase but ease people's sufferings. "People will find ways to escape from the sufferings from this movement," he added. In Bangladesh hartal is the only way to make a movement successful, the Jamaat leader claimed. He said the previous movements, though called separately, had the people's participation. "People now will join the united movement of BNP and Jamaat spontaneously," he hoped. Jamaat, the key ally of the opposition four-party alliance, agreed to support the anti-government movement after a meeting with the BNP chairperson on Saturday. Jamaat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami had said, "There is no alternative to a movement. We consider the BNP's call for a movement positive." BNP earlier held several meetings with its allies, other like-minded parties and professionals ahead of the strike aimed at gaining their support. bdnews2
