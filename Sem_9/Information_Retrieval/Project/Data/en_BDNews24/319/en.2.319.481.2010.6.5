 Atteridgeville, South Africa, June 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Katlego Mphela scored on 76 minutes as World Cup hosts South Africa edged fellow qualifiers Denmark 1-0 in a warm-up on Saturday and stretched an unbeaten run to 12 games. Nicknamed 'Killer' and linked to Birmingham City, the match-winner pounced on a defence-splitting pass to fire the ball under the body of Stefan Andersen and settle a lively if overly cautious contest. South Africa kick off the four-yearly tournament next Friday against Mexico at Soccer City in Johannesburg while Denmark face Netherlands -- 6-1 winners over Hungary also on Saturday -- three days later at the same stadium. "This was a good result as we played with heart, skill and technique against experienced opponents 47 places above us on the FIFA rankings," said South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira. "We enter the World Cup with hope and confidence. I give credit to my boys who were sold a vision that could lead to glory three months ago and responded magnificently." Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar, who reached a half-century of caps for Bafana Bafana (The Boys), admitted: "It was not one of my best games as Christian Poulsen marked me very tight." Scoring chances were scarce in a goalless first half with neither team able to stamp their authority in warm, clear autumn weather at a stadium renamed after former local star Lucas Moripe. Parreira, a World Cup-winning coach with his native Brazil 16 years ago, kept the 4-2-3-1 formation that has helped his team remain unbeaten since he took control a second time last November. Injuries ruled several Danes out of the third game between the countries, including Stoke City goalkeeper Thomas Soerensen and Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner. Lone striker Mphela netted after 10 minutes but was clearly offside and when Denmark threatened well into the half, fit-again goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune came to the rescue. As a cross to the far post fell invitingly for Teko Modise, his header was well off target while Liverpool defender Daniel Agger came much closer at the other end in a similar situation. The only corner of the opening half came six minutes before half-time and its poor execution by Siphiwe Tshabalala reminded Parreira that set pieces are not the strongest suit in the Bafana armoury. Caginess continued to rule as the second half progressed with goalmouth action rare and Khune not tested until midway through the period when he reacted quickly to hold a deflected Martin Joergensen shot. Andersen was equally sharp soon after at the other end, rapidly changing direction to grasp a Tshabalala drive that lacked venom but took a heavy deflection. Even a host of substitutions by both teams was not impacting on a game dominated by teams who retreated quickly and in numbers whenever trouble threatened. It was going to take something special to break the deadlock and it came via the right boot of defensive midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane as his pass from the centre of the field set up Mphela. Denmark had a change to level deep in stoppage time when substitute Mikkel Beckmann ghosted unmarked into the penalty area only to see his shot pushed away by K
