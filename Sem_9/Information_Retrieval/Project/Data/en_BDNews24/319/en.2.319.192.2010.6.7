 Chittagong, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  At least five Bangladesh Chhatra League activists were stabbed in a factional clash of the pro-government student organisation on Chittagong University campus on Monday. The clash ensued when an activist of the BCL group backed by Chittagong City Corporation mayor hopeful ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury smoked in front of a leader of the other group backed by Awami League leader AJM Nasiruddin in the Jhupri area. The pro-Nasir group attacked the rival group. The injured are Asif (4th year student of history department), Russell Chandra Majumdar (3rd year, management), Sadrul Islam Sijar (4th year, physics), Siam (4th year, mathematics) and Sukumar Kundu (master's of oriental language). Critically wounded Asif, Russell and Siam were admitted to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital. The other two were admitted to the university medical centre. CU proctor Mohammad Jashimuddin told bdnews24.com that investigation is underway. "The students responsible for the clash would be punished." BCL Chittagong University unit general secretary Ershad Hossain told bdnews24.com that as a large student organisation BCL might have some internal problems. He, however, said actions would be taken against those responsible for the incident. bdnew
