 HONG KONG, June 4 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - Asian shares were lower on Friday as dealers turned their attention to Japan as the ruling party prepared to choose a new leader while profit-takers cashed in on the previous session's strong gains. Some focus was also on the United States where key jobs figures were due to be released later in the day after a mixed bag of data the day before. Tokyo's Nikkei was flat after dealers sold off advances made earlier in the as the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) chose a leader who could then be confirmed as the country's new prime minister. Finance Minister Naoto Kan looked certain to succeed Yukio Hatoyama -- who resigned on Wednesday over the bungled handling of a US base dispute -- after winning his party's leadership. Kan, who was also deputy prime minister, is a supporter of a weaker yen and has spoken about the need for measures to fight deflation in the world's second biggest economy. "The political impact of the resignation of Hatoyama is fading although today's leadership election will keep the political influence alive, especially if front runner Kan is elected given his earlier comments about the desirability of a weaker yen", said RBC Capital Markets in a note. A weaker yen would be good for the country's key exporters and expectations that Kan will become the next premier led the currency lower.

The dollar could break above 93 yen level if Kan is elected, Nomura Securities strategist Taisuke Tanaka told Dow Jones Newswires. Sydney fell 1.05 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.24 percent and Singapore was down 0.34 percent as investors sold off after Thursday's rallies, which were boosted by strong US housing data. Markets were given a weaker lead from Wall Street Friday as the Dow edged up just 0.06 percent after a mixed batch of news showing a weekly drop in initial unemployment claims and a disappointing report on private-sector job creation. However, the Labor Department is due to publish job creation and unemployment figures Friday, which will give a much clearer idea of the state of recovery in the world's biggest economy. Most analysts expect the government will report 500,000 non-farm jobs were created last month, up from 290,000 in April, as the economy mounts a slow recovery from recession. Unemployment was expected to dip to 9.8 percent from 9.9 percent in April. Shanghai gave up 0.96 percent, with heavyweight banks leading the fall amid pressures over the imminent launch of Agricultural Bank's massive initial public offering, dealers said. Many fear the issue could dilute the market with stocks, putting pressure on prices. Oil was lower.
