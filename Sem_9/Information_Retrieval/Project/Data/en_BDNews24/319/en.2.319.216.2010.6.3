 LONDON, June 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - World oil prices rose on Thursday after positive economic data in the United States sparked a rally in global stock markets, analysts said. New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in July, climbed 14 cents to 73.00 dollars a barrel. London's Brent North Sea crude for July gained 75 cents to 74.50 dollars per barrel.

"The (oil) market is really tracking the stronger economic news coming out of the United States," said Jason Feer, vice president and general manager with energy market analysts Argus Media.
