 Chittagong, June 7 (bdnews24.com)-- Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain has urged political parties to do away with the culture of demanding resignation of Election Commission when they lose polls. He claimed that both ruling Awami League and opposition BNP wanted to make Bhola by-election an issue. "The government would think they would fall if the opposition won while the opposition would think they would be vanished if the government won. Such mentality invited some problems in Bhola elections." He repeated warning against irregularities in the Chittagong City Corporation elections scheduled for June 17. "We want to present the nation with a model election in Chittagong. That's why we expect patient behaviour by the candidates," commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said on Monday after inaugurating a training workshop for presiding, assistant presiding and polling officials in the port city. Sakhawat warned of tough actions against violation against the electoral code of conduct. He disapproved of the political parties involvement in city corporation elections. "Though city corporation elections are supposed to be non-partisan, now they have turned into party polls." Sakhawat urged the election officials to strictly enforce the rules and regularities to ensure free and fair elections. Chief returning officer Jesmin Tuly was present. The commissioner had a meeting with the law-enforcers and administration officials at different levels in the afternoon. Around 16,500 officials and employees of about 2000 government, non-government and autonomous institutions under five sub-districts in Chittagong be on duty during the elections. bdnew
