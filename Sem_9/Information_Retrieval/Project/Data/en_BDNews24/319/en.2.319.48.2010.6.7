 Dhaka, June 7(bdnews24.com) -- Opposition leader and BNP chief Khaleda Zia suggested enhancing revenue collection and slashing unproductive and useless expenditure. Khaleda made the recommendation on Monday afternoon while presenting a shadow budget for the next fiscal year ahead of the budget proposal scheduled on June 10. The programme lasted for about two hours from 4.35 pm to 6.28 pm. Khaleda Zia said, "We think that to overcome the overwhelming crisis, the tax net will have to be widened without increasing tax." "Useless and unproductive government expenditures also need to be slashed," she said. Khaleda urged the government not to impose any new tax in information technology. She proposed that individuals with an income of Tk 2.4 lakh should be eligible for paying income taxes. The two-time former prime minister demanded special budgetary allocation for power, energy, education, health and infrastructural sectors on a priority basis. She proposed steps regarding climate, forming a new fund with Tk 250 crore during the next fiscal year by setting up housing banks, farming insurance, increased subsidy on agriculture and enhanced allocation for education sector.
