 Dhaka, June 05 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has alleged that last year's reduction of transfer fees for non-farming land, fixed at one percent of the total value, was intended to benefit a 'certain quarter'. The parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry at its meeting, Saturday, recommended fixing the transfer fee to at least four percent, instead of the one percent proposed in an amendment bill placed in parliament Wednesday. Finance minister A M Abdul Muhith tabled the Income Tax Ordinance (amendment) Bill 2010 in the Jatiya Sangsad with a view to setting the transfer fee of non-farming land at a flat one percent of the total value of the land, irrespective of its location; a clause that has also drawn the ire of the parliamentary committee. The proposed amendment seeks to do away with an existing clause that exempts land valued at Tk 1 lakh or less from the transfer tax. The standing committee discussed the bill, set to be passed Sunday, and proposed the change. "Up to Aug 31, 2009 the transfer fee of non-farming land in areas outside the city corporations, municipalities and cantonment board, was five percent of the total value of the land," AHM Mustafa Kamal, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com at his parliament office after the meeting. "But on September 1, 2009, the transfer fee was reduced to one percent." "All of the attending members told the meeting that the fee cut was aimed at giving some quarters benefiting for acquiring non-farming land in the rural and semi-urban areas," said the chairman, who is popularly known as Lotus Kamal. The committee observed that the transfer fees should be more than the proposed figure in the bill. "We have suggested fixing the fee at four percent of the total value of the land in the rural areas and five percent in the urban areas outside the city corporations, municipalities and cantonment boards," said the chairman. He said the recommendation on transfer fee hike would help protect agricultural land in the rural areas. Committee members finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, Md Ali Ashraf, Md Motiur Rahman, M A Mannan and Farida Rahman attended the meeting
