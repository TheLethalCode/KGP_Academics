 London, June 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Guus Hiddink has ruled himself out of the race to become Liverpool's new manager, but Sven Goran Eriksson admits it would be a dream to take charge of the Reds. Hiddink has been linked with the vacant Liverpool job since Rafael Benitez departed Anfield by mutual consent on Thursday. The 63-year-old enjoyed a successful spell in the Premier League as interim Chelsea boss in 2009, but the former Australia manager has just taken over as Turkey coach and has no intention of walking out on his new employers. Hiddink's agent, Cees van Nieuwenhuizen, told BBC Sport: "Guus has shown over the years that he is loyal to agreements that he signed. There is no reason today why he would change such behaviour.

"I was shocked when I discovered Rafa Benitez had left. Would I want to be the manager of Liverpool? It is every manager's dream to manage Liverpool. "My father was also a Liverpool supporter and every Saturday we would watch an English match on television. It was the highlight of the week. "Liverpool matches were televised quite regularly and we would cheer them on. They have always been my team and nothing has changed. "When I was starting out in coaching I was invited to Liverpool to see how they did things. Joe Fagan was the manager at the time. "I remember him showing me around Anfield and taking me into their legendary boot room. "It was such a privilege and an honour for me to be invited in there. I will never forget that moment.
