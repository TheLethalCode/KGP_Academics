 Paris, June 7 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- All of France must cheer on its World Cup football team, the government spokesman said Monday, in remarks aimed at the sports minister for criticising the team's choice of a posh hotel. Junior sports minister Rama Yade caused a stir at the weekend when she said the Bleus team should have shown some 'decency' during hard economic times by not choosing a five-star resort to stay in while in South Africa.
