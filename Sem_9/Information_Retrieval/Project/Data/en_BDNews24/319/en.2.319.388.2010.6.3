 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Thursday ordered the government and the police to suspend four policemen for a death in custody. The court also asked the police and the government to take legal measures against Nurul Alam, Fahim Haider, Dulal Chandra and Mizanur Rahman in line with the service law. The bench of justices A H M Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Mohammed Delwar Hossain gave the verdict on a petition by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human rights organisation. The inspector general of police was asked to inform the court whether the order was obeyed. The court also asked the government and the police to explain why they should not be ordered to ensure public security. Manzil Morshed, the counsel for the petitioner, said at the hearing that according to media reports on May 21, 2006, medical representative Saidur Rahman was killed in police custody in Gaibandha. A citizens committee in Gaibandha filed a murder case against four police officials, who sought bail in the High Court. Morshed said the four officials had been performing their duties even though they were facing criminal charges and pointed out that they could pose threat to public security. He said the four policemen were not even suspended from their duties temporarily although the law provides or such action. Deputy attorney general Nazrul Islam Talukder argued for the defence. bdnew
