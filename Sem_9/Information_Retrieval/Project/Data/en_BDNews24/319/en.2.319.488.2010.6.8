 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the opposition leader Khaleda Zia was threatening anti-government agitation to save the war criminals and Islamist militants. She also said the BNP chief is throwing programmes to protect ill-gotten assets and the corrupt. BNP is the unparalleled champion when it comes to backing corruption, terrorism and militancy, Hasina said at a programme on Monday in the capital's Osmani Memorial Auditorium organised by Awami League to observe the historical 'Six-Point Day'. "When we have started procedures of war crimes trial and launching drives against the militants, she (Khaleda) has also started declaring movement programmes," the prime minister said. She criticised Khaleda's husband and former president General Ziaur Rhaman for siding with the collaborators of the Pakistan army. "The war crimes trial process had started, 10,000 criminals were being tried, (former Jamaat-e-Islmai chief) Ghulam Azam was stripped of his Bangladesh citizenship. Ziaur Rahman, however, stopped everything after assuming power. "He had freed those who were behind bars and reinstated them into politics by creating a new political party," said Hasina, alluding to BNP's formation. Zia had betrayed three million martyrs, she said. The ruling party chief also slated Zia for killing hundreds of army officials, starting with the very people who had helped him to hold onto power. Awami League advisery council member Suranjit Sengupta, also present on the occasion, urged the opposition chief to join the budget session of the parliament. Not on the street, they need to join parliament if they want to talk on the budget, he added. The programme was presided over by deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhur. Senior party leaders Amir Hossain Amu, Matia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, Mahbubul Haque Hanif and Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya were also present. bdnews
