 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)Allies of the ruling Awami League-led government have urged the ruling party not to go ahead with the draft health policy without their participation in the discussion process. Hasanul Haque Inu, president of Jatio Samajtantrik Dal (JSD), one of the partners of the Grand Alliance, said this at a round-table on health policy held at the National Press Club on Saturday. Inu said that the health sector should be declared as a 'universal health care service and a facility for the people's welfare". "The government should discuss with the allies and the parliamentary standing committee before finalising the health policy," he said. Inu alleged that the health sector had been in a state of drift for the last 40 years and being run without any proper direction. "An acute disorder is prevailing in this sector. It has been commercialised. The government should take decision in which the sector will be run under a proper system," he added. He urged the government for establishing a regulatory body to oversee the private healthcare sector. Moreover, he also stressed prioritizing primary and emergency healthcare, women healthcare and safe motherhood before finalising the new health policy. Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon alleged that partisanship had reached such a pass that it has become a real concern, hampering services at different levels. "The government must take immediate action on this issue. Otherwise, the sector will simply collapse," he feared. Menon said that the upcoming policy was drafted by the bureaucrats. No discussion was held at parliament and in the parliamentary standing committee meeting in this regard. He emphasised that the government should finalise the policy through discussion with the representatives from different sections of the society, including the parliamentary standing committee members. The Workers' Party president advised the government to set up burn units in different government and non-government hospitals for treatment of the victims. Criticising the prevailing health policy Anu Mohammad, economics professor at Jahangirnagar University, said, "It is unrealistic to expect a public welfare-oriented policy from the government if the present situation goes on." The government should have to be more conscious in this regard, he stressed. The round table was organised by Bangladesh Doctors Association (BDA). Chaired by BDA president Dr Moazzem Hossain, the programme was also attended by BDA's former president Dr Rashid-e-Mahbub, women leader Farida Akther and Dhaka University's pharmacy department's professors A B M Faruk and Dr Iqbal Hossain. bdnews24.c
