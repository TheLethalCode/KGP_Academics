<TITLE> New law for ship-breaking industry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  The environment law is being revised incorporating toxic scrap ship-breaking industry, state minister for environment and forests Hasan Mahmud said on Thursday. The existing Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act (BECA), enacted in 1995, didn't have sufficient safeguards for controlling pollution caused by the ship-breaking industry. "Under the revised law, no one can run their industries without Effluent Treatment Plant," Mahmud told a press conference at his office ahead of World Environment Day on June 5. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to inaugurate the World Environment Day programme and Fair at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. The theme of the World Environment Day-2010 is "Biodiversity  Ecosystems Management and the Green Economy". Scrap ship-breaking industry has drawn a lot of flak from various quarters, including environment organizations across the country. In an apparent effort to reassure the industry, Mahmud said, "Every industry has negative and positive sides. Our aim is not to close down ship-breaking industries, nor do we want any environment pollution." "There was no policy regarding this before, but now we are formulating this. Under the new policy, permission will have to be obtained from the environment department to bring and break scrap ships." Regarding procrastination over relocation of tannery industries, he said, "No government has taken any steps regarding this industry before." "This government itself has taken steps to set up central Effluent Treatment Plant. Tender invitation process has already begun. Now we are going on with our discussion with owners of tannery industries." Over the climate change issue, he said the government has taken the issue seriously and that 12 ministries are centrally working on it. "In addition, climate change branch has been set up at the environment ministry and has been working since June 1," he added. The United Nations has announced 2010 as International Biodiversity Year with an aim to increase public awareness regarding climate change. In light with the UN announcement, Bangladesh has formulated 'Biodiversity National Assessment & Programme of Action, 2010'. He also said a total of 16,339 institutions received environment clearance between 2005 and 2008, while his government issued clearance to 13,594 institutions in just one year and five months. In addition, a total of 11,775 institutions renewed their environment clearance from 2005 to 2008 while 7,206 institutions have renewed their environment during the present government, he added. He blamed human behaviour for the environment pollution. "Our behaviour is also responsible for the mess we're in today. A project has been taken up to change the behaviour of the well-to-do families in Dhaka and Chittagong." "Under the project, every family will be supplied with three waste-dumping bins in the posh areas in Dhaka and Chittagong." "Of the three bins, one will be provided for keeping recyclable waste, the second for rotten waste and the third for solid waste. In addition, vacuum cleaner trucks will work for cleaning roads." The government is also trying to include people living along the river to protect river pollution, he added.
