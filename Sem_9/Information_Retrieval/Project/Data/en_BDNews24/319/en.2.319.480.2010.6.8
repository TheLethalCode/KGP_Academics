 Rajshahi University, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested eight cadres of Islami Chhatra Shibir from Rajshahi University campus. Motihar police station officer-in-charge Abul Khayer told bdnews24.com that police arrested them on Monday, over a case filed relating to Chhatra League member Faruk's murder. The arrestees are, 'Faruque', 'Karim', 'Bayezid', Hasan Uzzaman, 'Shamim', Abul Kalam, 'Habibullah' and 'Ishak'. On February 8, there was a clash on RU campus between Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling Awami League and Islami Chhatra Shibir, student wing of the fundamentalist Jamaa-e-Islami. Chhatra League member Faruk was killed in a Shibir attack and the next day, his body was recovered from a man-hole on campus. Around 150 Shibir men have been arrested for their involvement till date. Motihar OC said that the police had arrested the eight members, from Shahidullah Arts Faculty, after a third year final examination of Islamic Studies department. On Monday, the police took position in front of Shahidullah Arts Faculty, after being informed that 10-15 Shibir men would take the examination. Hundreds of BCL cadres arrived at the Arts Faculty. When the Shibir examinees got out of the examination hall, the BCL members beat Faruque, Karim and Bayezid and handed them over to the police. Police then arrested the rest of the Shibir members and took them to the police station under strict security. The arrested are being questioned about the murder, the OC said. RU BCL general secretary Majedul Islam Apu denied that Chhatra League cadres had beaten up Shibir members. Referring to Shibir men as those who cut off tendons, which happens to be Shibir's execution method of choice, Apu said that the Chhatra League would resist Shibir along with general students and teachers. "There won't be any more religion-based politics." University proctor Chowdhury Mohammad Zakaria said that the police had been told to take necessary steps against the arrestees. bdnews24.c
