 TEHRAN, Jun 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards are ready to provide a military escort to cargo ships trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza, a representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday.

Israel and its ally the United States have refused to rule out military action against Iran to prevent it from getting nuclear arms capability -- something Israel sees as a threat to its survival.
