<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 5 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP is set to meet Jamaat-e-Isami, one of its main allies in the four-party alliance on Saturday ahead of the anti-government campaign. The main opposition and its top fundamentalist ally are officially meeting after 17 long months, presumably to determine the roles each might play in complement to each other. This meeting follows a series of discussions with the BNP chief, Khaleda Zia, has had last month with other smaller parties in order to secure their support. The meeting is scheduled at BNP chief Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office at 8pm. This is the first meeting between Khaleda Zia and Jamaat policymakers after the 2008 national elections. Jamaat has been invited to discuss ways to make the movement successful, Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com, referring to the BNP's announcement of launching a campaign to unseat the government, which evidently kicks off with a country-wide general strike on June 27. Jamaat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami will lead the delegation. The party's assistant secretary general Muhammad Kamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com Saturday morning that they will attend the meeting. But he has no idea about the agenda, he said. The BNP chief on May 27 met with its other allies, Mufti Amini-led Islami Oikyojote and Andalib Rahman Partha-led Bangladesh Jatiya Party. She also sat with Khelafat Majlish, Jatiya Ganatantrik Party, National Peoples Party, National Awami Party, National Democratic Party and other organisations.
