 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Key ally of the four party alliance Jamaat-e-Islami has agreed to support the anti-government movement called by the main opposition BNP. "There is no alternative to a movement. We consider the BNP's call for a movement positive," Jamaat Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami, who led a nine-member delegation, told reporters after holding a one-hour-long meeting with Khaleda Zia, the BNP chief ,which began at 8:45pm. Assistant secretary general Muhammad Kamaruzzaman said Jamaat will discuss the June 27 hartal at its executive committee meeting set for Sunday. "A movement is now the demand of the moment. Both of our parties have agreed to hold a movement", he told bdnews24.com. In an effort to garner support for its call for the countrywide general strike, called for the first time since the Awami-led government came to power one and half years ago, the BNP chief Khaleda Zia sat with the Nizami. Khaleda's press secretary, Maruf Kamal Khan, told bdnews24.com: "The meeting is a part of a programme involving an exchange of views with the partners in the four-party alliance, other like-minded parties and professionals ahead of the June 27 hartal and anti-government movement." The two allies earlier had sat on Dec 10, 2008, just before the ninth general elections. The BNP chief on May 27 met with its other allies, Mufti Amini-led Islami Oikkya Jote and Andalib Rahman Partha-led Bangladesh Jatiya Party. She also had earlier sat with Khelafat Majlish, Jatiya Ganatantrik Party, National Peoples Party, National Awami Party, National Democratic Party and other organisations. bdnew
