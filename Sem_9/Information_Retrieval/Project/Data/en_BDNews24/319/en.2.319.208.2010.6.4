<TEXT>
 Munsiganj, June 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Heavy rains and storm halted ferry service on Mawa-Kawrakandi route, the gateway to country's southern region, for two hours on Friday. Two ferries--MV Jamuna and MV Raniganj--were trapped in the Padma River's shoals with passengers and vehicles on board during the storm. The service disruption, from 12.30pm to 2.30pm, resulted in long tailbacks on both sides of the ferry route between Mawa in Munshiganj and Kewrakandi in Madaripur. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) Mawa pier manager Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com they had kept the service halted to avoid accident. He said in the afternoon that though ferry service had resumed plying of small water vessels like boats and trawlers were still risky due to strong current of water. Islam said three ferries were anchor at Mawa pier, four at Kawrakandi pier and one at Kathalbari during the storm. He said rush of vehicles was much higher than that of other days as Friday was weekend holyday. bdnews
