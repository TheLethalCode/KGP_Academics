<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has signed a loan agreement of $266 million with the Asian Development Bank to augment natural gas supply in the country. 'Bangladesh Natural Gas Access Improvement Project' will be used to build new gas transmission and distribution pipelines to meet the country's growing demand, and to expand coverage to less developed areas in the southwest region, an ADB statement said Thursday. The project will install compressors and metering systems to boost reliability, improve safety, and strengthen the management of gas supply and demand. Economic Relations Division secretary M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan and ADB's country director Thevakumar Kandiah signed the loan agreement. Under the project, an investment programme to promote energy-efficient gas use will be drawn up, and training and support will be given to sector agencies. The project will also help improve supply efficiency by developing four new wells and installing gas processing plants in Titas gas Fields aimed at increasing gas production by 120 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd). Around 200,000 new households in the southwest, along with 1,400 industrial and commercial establishments, will receive gas under the expanded distribution network. As part of the project, Sundarban Gas Co Ltd - a newly formed distribution affiliate of state-owned Petrobangla - will enter into contracts with private firms for the operation, maintenance, metering and billing of gas supplied to consumers in the southwest from 2012. Under the project, regulatory reforms will be expedited to encourage more private investment in the gas industry. The state-owned Petrobangla, Gas Transmission Company Ltd, Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Ltd, Sundarban Distribution Company Ltd, and Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd will execute the project, which is due for completion in March 2015. Besides ADB assistance, Korea Eximbank will provide a loan of $45 million (about Tk 315 crore) for the transmission expansion component, while the Bangladesh government will provide $231 million (about Tk 1,600 crore) in equity and loans, for a total project cost of $542 million.
