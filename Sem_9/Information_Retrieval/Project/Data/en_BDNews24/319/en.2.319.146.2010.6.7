<TEXT>
 Sylhet, June 7 (bdnews24.com)--A Sylhet court has extended for the 31st time the submission deadline of the further probe report on former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria's murder case. Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal judge Muhammad Mahbub-ul-Islam on Sunday set June 13 for the submission following plea from the investigation officer. The previous deadline set on May 24 expired on Sunday. Kishore Kumar Roy, state counsel and special public prosecutor, said the extension was sought to identify the real culprits. Kibria and four others were killed in a grenade attack in Habiganj on Jan 27, 2005. Local Awami League leader Abdul Majid filed the case with the Habiganj Police Station against unidentified people. But on Sep 22, 2008, the case proceedings were stopped following a request from the plaintiff. The CID officer was then asked to carry out further investigation. bdn
