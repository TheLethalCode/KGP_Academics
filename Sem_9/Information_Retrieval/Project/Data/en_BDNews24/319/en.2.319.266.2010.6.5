It is the first panel to be announced for the biennial election of the country's apex business association, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries. The FBCCI election has been delayed by two days from the previously scheduled June 17 as the Chittagong City Corporation election has been scheduled on June 17, said an FBCCI press release.

Professor Ali Ashraf, chairman of FBCCI election board, told bdnews24.com that the election had been delayed for the sake of the voters.
