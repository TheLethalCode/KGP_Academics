 Lahore, June 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Former Pakistan captain Younis Khan won his appeal against an indefinite ban and is now likely to be considered for the national team ahead of their England tour. "The appeal of Younis against an indefinite ban is accepted and the order (punishment) is set aside," the arbitrator, retired justice Irfan Qadir, said in his order. Younis was one of seven players who were banned or fined in March this year. The penalties came after an inquiry committee investigated on and off-field problems during team's tours to the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand and Australia between November and February. Younis and another former captain Mohammad Yousuf were handed indefinite bans over "infighting in the team which let the team down." Younis' lawyer said he was delighted with the outcome of the appeal. "Younis' stance was based on principle and we are delighted to get the ban revoked," lawyer Ahmed Malik Qayyum told AFP. The former captain was named in a preliminary squad of 35, subject to his clearance from the arbitrator, but was not selected in the 15-man Asia Cup squad announced on Thursday. He is, however, likely to be considered for team's tour of England to be announced later. Pakistan take part in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka from June 15-24. They will then play two Twenty20 and two Tests against Australia before playing hosts England in four Tests, five one-day and two Twenty20 -- all in England. The arbitrator last week lifted Shoaib Malik's one-year ban and reduced his two million rupees (24,000 dollars) fine to half. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) legal adviser Talib Rizvi confirmed Younis' appeal was accepted. "The arbitrator has accepted Younis' appeal and the PCB will now complete the legal process," Rizvi told AFP. The arbitrator also quashed the fine on current captain Shahid Afridi and reduced the fine on Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal. "The appeals of Afridi, and Akmal brothers were also taken up and the arbitrator quashed the fine on Afridi and reduced the fines on Akmal brothers," said Rizvi. Afridi was fined on charges of ball-tampering in a one-day match against Australia, while the Akmal brothers were punished for discipline violations. "Afridi confessed his act earned a bad image for the country, but since he was already punished by International Cricket Council (banned for two Twenty20 matches), he cannot be punished twice, so his fine is revoked," said Rizvi. Another former captain Yousuf, banned for an indefinite period, did not appeal, while all-rounder Rana Naved-ul-Hasan's appeal against a one-year ban and fine of 24,000 dollars will be heard on Jun
