 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)No one seems certain about who owns the chemical warehouse believed to have been responsible for the huge number of deaths in Old Dhaka blaze on Thursday. The fire is thought to have started from the depot on the ground floor of a five-storey building at Nimtali in Nawab Katra. No one even knows what chemicals were stored in the warehouse. Bangsal police chief Abdul Mannan told bdnew24.com that the owner of the warehouse was still unidentified. "Even Mohammed Gulzar, the building's owner, is missing," he added. The officer in charge also believed that if the depot had not been there, the accident would not have happened. As many as 41 people, including guests invited to an engagement party and Gulzar's relatives, lost lives. Zakir Hossain, a local, said, "The warehouse was empty even three days ago. But, big drums and white sacks full of chemicals were stored there on Tuesday and Wednesday." The fire spread from this depot in 43/1 Nimtali to the other buildings on Thursday night, said the local people. Saif Israil, an eye-witness, said a fire ball spread from the depot immediately after it had caught fire. According to the local people, the owner lives in Kasaituli in old Dhaka  but no one knew his name. He came once in a while to look after the storage and its inventory, they added. Akbar Ali, another local person, said that Gulzar had bought the building some time ago. "Earlier Gulzar lived in Kasaituli. Some relative or an associate of Gulzar might own the depot too," he said. Locals said that the transformer explosion was caused by a plastic factory's chemicals catching fire. The plastic factory had caught fire accidentally from a stove pit adjacent to it where people were cooking meals for a wedding engagement that would be held on the roof the building that housed the plastic factory. The drums of chemicals exploded and shot out flames. The transformers, right next to the five-storey building  43/1 Agamasi Lane, Kayettuli  were one of the first to be hit by one of those shooting fireballs. The exploding transformer then spread the fire into several adjacent buildings within a few minutes. bdnews24.com/sh
