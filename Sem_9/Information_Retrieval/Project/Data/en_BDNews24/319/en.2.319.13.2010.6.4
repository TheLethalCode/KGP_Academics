 Johannesburg, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Nelson Mandela met South Africa's national soccer team Bafana Bafana on Thursday, wearing the captain's number 4 shirt, to help inspire the team in this month's World Cup which the country is hosting.

Some observers have suggested poor health may keep him away from Africa's first hosting of the world's most watched sports event.
