 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--Police on Sunday arrested a morgue assistant on charges of taking money from a man whose family died in the Nimtali fire after the prime minister ordered an investigation. The maternal uncle of Runa Akhtar, the would-be bride who lost most of her family members in Thursday's devastating fire in Old Dhaka, was forced to pay Tk 7000 to Shyamal Lal, a morgue assistant and 'Rahat', a guard, who work at Salimullah Medical College Hospital, better known as Mitford hospital, so that his family's dead bodies would be washed. Rahat has not yet been arrested. 'Suman', the uncle of Runa, claimed that the two men had said that they would only wash the bodies and the clothes in which they would be buried in exchange for Tk 15,000. He said after haggling, it was agreed that they would receive Tk 7000. Tk 3000 was paid up front and the remainder was to be paid when the work was done. On hearing about the allegation, prime minister Sheikh Hasina asked the director general of her office Dina Haque, and directors (development) Shawkat Akbar and Shamsul Arefin to visit the hospital on Sunday and inquire into the incident.
