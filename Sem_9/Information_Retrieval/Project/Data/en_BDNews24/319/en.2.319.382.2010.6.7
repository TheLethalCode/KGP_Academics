 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)-- BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia suggested launching a state-run television channel to broadcast educational programmes. The main opposition party chief made a number of recommendations in her first-ever shadow budget proposal on Monday ahead of the June 10 national budget by finance minister AMA Muhith. Khaleda told a function at Sheraton Hotel in Dhaka, "The fall in education quality at primary, secondary, higher secondary and university levels is alarming." "Emergency measures have become essential." She recommended a TV channel broadcasting lessons by the best teachers of the country and said the initiative would benefit both the teachers and the students and raise the quality of education.
