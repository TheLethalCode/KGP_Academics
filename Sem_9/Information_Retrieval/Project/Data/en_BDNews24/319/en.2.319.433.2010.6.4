 Chittagong, June 4 (bdnews24.com)--The chief election commissioner on Friday said they wanted to set an unprecedented example of free and fair election in the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation elections. "We want that candidate, whom the people really want, to win the election," ATM Shamsul Huda said as he shared opinions with the aspirants at the port city's Muslim Hall. He responded to Chittagong City BNP chief Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury's allegation that the commission intends to appoint partisan people as polling officials."The Election Commission has no agenda to carry out in the polls," he said. Chowdhury, the chief polling agent of Chittagong Development Movement candidate M Manzur Alam, questioned the neutrality of the commission. Ishaque Mia, chief polling agent of Mohiuddin, contested Khosru's contention. Huda said the lists of the polling officers will be published on Saturday and Sunday. "Anyone, if proved controversial, will be withdrawn." He emphasised candidates conforming to the electoral code of conduct. On the issue of the acting mayor, the CEC said the appointment was made in line with the local government law. The ruling Awami League-backed Nagarik (Citizens) Committee's mayor candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and Manzur were present at the meeting. bdnew
