 Kushtia, June 7 (bdnews24.com) Students started to leave their residential halls on Monday morning after the Islamic University was closed overnight over violence for a week. The decision followed a clash on Sunday between two rival groups of the university's Bangladesh Chhatra League, the ruling party-backed student wing. The decision to close the university was taken at a two-hour emergency syndicate meeting from 8pm on Sunday. After the meeting the vice-chancellor of the university Dr M Alauddin told journalists that the university would remain closed from June 7 to June 14. No classes and examinations would be held during this time. "The students have been asked to leave the dormitories by 9am on Monday." The vice-chancellor said that they had decided to close the campus and dormitories to control the whole situation and avoid unwanted activities. The students were seen to be leaving the dormitories in groups from dawn on Monday. The clash happened within 36 hours of the university opening following a 12-day vacation that had ended on Saturday. At about 10 am on Sunday, witnesses said two groups of students  one led by university unit president Jahangir Hossain and another by Ali Mortuza Khosru - held separate rallies. At midday, the two groups started to chase each other throwing stones as they fought for control of a party tent. The Khosru group later retreated to Bangabandhu hall. As a result of the clash, traffic came to a halt for half an hour on the Khulna-Kushtia highway. Both the groups walked around the campus with sticks and sharp weapons until the authorities intervened to restore calm. Additional police have been deployed on the campus to avert further clash. bdnews24.
