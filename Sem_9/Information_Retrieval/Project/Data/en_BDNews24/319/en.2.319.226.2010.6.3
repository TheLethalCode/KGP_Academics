 Chandpur, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)-- A court has given the police one day to question former BNP state minister ANM Ehsanul Haque Milan in a case that accuses him of attempting to murder Awami League MP Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. The senior judicial magistrate's court of Chandpur on Thursday also warned the police not to torture Milan or they would be held in contempt. Milan is currently in jail in the case, filed in May 2010 by Majibur Rahamn of Sachar in Kacua Upazila, which alleges that he along with six other men vandalised the car of Alamgir, the Awami League MP from Kachua and attempted to murder him. Milan, the former state minister of education, lost to Alamgir in the parliamentary elections on Dec 29, 2008. On May 20, the police had applied to the court to remand Milan in custody for 10 days. Kamrul Islam, Milan's lawyer, told reporters that the case alleged that Milan and his supporters had tried to kill Alamgir in Kachua bazar on Sep 14, 2001. It is further alleged that in Oct 2003 Milan had burnt down houses in the Sachar area. Kamrul claimed that the case is politically motivated and baseless. Earlier around 2pm, hundreds of BNP activists took out a procession and formed a human chain demanding Milan's release. As Milan was brought to the court, protesters started pelted the police with stone, triggering chase and counter-chase. The office in charge of Chandpur Model Police Station Kazi Abdul Kaiyum said 10 people were injured in the incident but he could not name them. "Sixteen BNP activists were arrested for their involvement. Legal action will be taken against them," said the OC. Among the 16 arrestees, seven were identified as 'Mamun', 30, 'Manir', 35, Jahirul Haque, 38, 'Harun', 30, 'Habib', 30, Abul Khair, 22, and 'Sohel', 23. bdnews24.co
