 Chittagong, June 3 (bdnews24.com)A top leader of Chittagong BNP has said the people of the port city want a change in the mayor's office. "The city residents' wish will be reflected in the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation elections," BNP vice president Abdullah Al Noman told a workers' rally at Pahartoli on Thursday. The BNP-backed mayor hopeful from the Chittagong Development Movement M Manzur Alam was also present in the rally. Noman said the CCC was a service-oriented organisation But immediate past mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury made it a commercial one. The former minister urged all to elect Manzur to get the services expected of the CCC. He also said Citizens Committee candidate Mohiuddin, backed by the ruling Awami League, could not put his office to good use in the last 17 years. Noman called on the party activists to guard the voting centres to prevent what he feared attempts to rig ballots. Noman and his supporters joined Manzur during his election campaign for the first time on Thursday since the election schedule was declared. Manzur, earlier in the day, met first secretary of the British High Commission Simon Lever and political analyst Ejajur Rahman. City BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury was present in the meeting. Manzur campaigned at Bahaddarhat, where BNP vice president and former minister M Morshed Khan accompanied him. Manzur also visited the Halishahar area. bdn
