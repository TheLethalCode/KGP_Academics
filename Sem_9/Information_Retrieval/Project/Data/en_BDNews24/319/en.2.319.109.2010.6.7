<TITLE> Amar Desh challenges closure in HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)A writ petition has been filed with the High Court challenging last week's closure of the BNP-leaning daily newspaper Amar Desh. The Bangla-language newspaper's acting chairman Anwar-un-Nabi filed the petition on Monday with the bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Sheikh Hasan Arif. The government closed the newspaper on June 1. The petitioner said the government closed the paper as it had no publisher. Publisher Hashmat Ali resigned on Oct 11, 2009. The petition stated that earlier on Sept 3 that year acting editor Mahmudur Rahman had submitted an application to the district magistrate seeking to be the publisher. Mahmudur was arrested in a fraud case filed by Hashmat Ali on June 2, hours after the daily was shut down. Amar Desh began operations during the BNP-led four-party alliance government's regime in 2004. Barrister Abdur Razzak will conduct the petition for the paper. bd
