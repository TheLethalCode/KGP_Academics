 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)  The death toll from the Begunbari building collapse in the city's Tejgaon area two days ago rose to 25 on Thursday as the fire service decided to end its rescue operations claiming there were no more missing bodies. Confirming that two more bodies were found on Thursday morning, Muneer Hossain, fire service assistant director of Dhaka zone, told bdnews24 that its director general Brig Gen Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah had ordered the rescue operation to be ended after observing the overall situation and talking with local people. The house, 18/B on Post Office alley, toppled around 10:45pm, trapping the inhabitants of the building and the shanties, he said. Most of the dead people were residents of the tin-shed shanties, locals said. The Dhaka district administration have given Tk 20,000 to each to the families for burial. Earlier on Jun 2, state minister for housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan, after visiting the spot, said the building was 'illegal', but there was a court order preventing its removal. "We have to face protests when we take legal steps against people. On the other hand, we face criticism when we don't take the steps," he added. He said RAJUK, the regulatory body responsible for overseeing building construction in Dhaka, was sincere about removing all illegal structures. "All the illegal installations in this area will be removed," he added. ASM Maksud Kamal, a geology department teacher at Dhaka University, also had come to the spot to advise the rescue workers. He told bdnews24.com: "The building toppled as it was not constructed firmly and was situated beside a water body." A similar incident had taken place at Mirpur recently, he said. bdnew
