 Kushtia, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--Islamic University has been closed until July 14 after two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed over the newly declared committee of the pro-government student organisation. Students were asked to leave the dormitories by 9am on Monday, the vice-chancellor said. The decision was taken at a two-hour emergency syndicate meeting held from 10pm on Sunday. Vice-chancellor professor M Alauddin told reporters that classes and examinations will be suspended until the time "to keep the environment on the campus stable". Witnesses said one group led by university unit president Jahangir Hossain and another by deprived Ali Mortuza Khosru held separate rallies around 10am Sunday. Around 12pm they chased each other throwing stones as they fought for control of a party tent. The Khosru group later backtracked to Bangabandhu hall. Due to the clash, traffic came to a halt for half an hour on the Khulna-Kushtia highway. Both the groups patrolled on the campus with sticks and sharp weapons. The authorities later intervened to restore calm. Additional police were deployed on the campus. The VC earlier said that only the leaders of central BCL and the ruling Awami League could resolve the feud over formation of a committee. Jahangir said, "We protested an attack of some so-called BCL cadres and extortionists and drove them out of the campus." Khosru said, "They attacked us as we protested formation of the new committee, which includes non-students and professionals." bdne
