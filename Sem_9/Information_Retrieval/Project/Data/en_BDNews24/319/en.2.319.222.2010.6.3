 Rangamati, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Unknown gunmen on Thursday shot dead a leader of the hills people's organisation, the Pahari Chhatra Parishad (PCP) that supports the peace accord, at Rajasthali Upazila in Rangamati. The dead man has been identified as Ananda Jyoti Tanchangya, 30, the general secretary of Roangchharhi Upazila unit of PCP. Another PCP leader Palash Chakma, 30, sustained bullet injuries in the incident. Sajeeb Chakma, assistant information secretary of the central committee of PCP's mother party, the Parbatya Chattagram Jans Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS), blamed the anti-peace accord organisation United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) for the attack. Local reporters said at about 7am, a number of gunmen took positions at different points in Rajasthali Upazila and fired hundreds of undirected shots into the area. As Ananda and Palash tried to run to safety, the gunmen then targeted them. Ananda died on the spot. The gunmen managed to escape as the police tried to capture them. Injured Palash was admitted to Rajasthali Upazila Health Complex. A spokesman for the UPDF was not available for comment. bdn
