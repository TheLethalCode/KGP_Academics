 Colombo, June 7 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Sri Lanka's new venues for next year's World Cup are on track but the refurbishment of an existing stadium is behind schedule, the International Cricket Council said on Monday. Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament with India and Bangladesh, is set to stage 12 matches at the Premadasa stadium in Colombo and at the newly built grounds in Pallekele and Hambantota, outside the capital.

Officials said they were installing high-intensity floodlights to enable high-definition television broadcasts. The 43-day tournament will be played across 13 venues in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and ends with the final on April 2 at Mumbai's Wankhede stadium.
