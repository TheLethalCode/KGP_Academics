 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has ordered Dhaka Power Distribution Company and Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited to examine all electrical transformers of Dhaka City and report to it. It sought an explanation on why the failure of the government in the maintenance of the transformers should not be declared illegal. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Mohammed Delwar Hossain gave the order on Sunday on two public interest petitions. The power secretary, DPDC and DESCO directors have been asked to report in three weeks. The court appointed M Zahir to advise the judges on the matter. Zahir told reporters: "The power department is blamed for such occurrence." Human rights organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, and Society of Justice filed the petitions on Sunday. The petitioners said score of people were killed and injured in the fire from the explosion of an electrical transformer in Old Dhaka's Nimtali on June 3. Manzil Morshed, the lawyer for the petitioners, said at Sunday's hearing that the power department had neglected its duties. Frequent accidents take place as they do not properly maintain transformers, which jeopardise lives of Dhaka dwellers, he said. At least 117 people were killed in the roaring blaze. Over a hundred severely burnt people are undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Combined Military Hospital. bd
