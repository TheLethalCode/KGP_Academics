 SANAA, June 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yemen has detained around 50 foreigners accused of links to al Qaeda as it has intensified monitoring of Arabic language schools, a Saudi-owned Arab newspaper said on Monday. In south Yemen, two people were shot dead and 13 were injured in the province of Dalea after separatists raised secessionist flags over their homes and protested in the street. Al-Hayat newspaper said that U.S., British, French and Malaysian nationals were among the foreigners detained since a failed December attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound plane. The Nigerian suspect in that case had studied Arabic in Sanaa. Yemen's Western allies and Saudi Arabia fear al Qaeda is trying to exploit instability in Yemen to use the impoverished country, with domestic conflicts in its north and south, as a base to launch attacks in the region and beyond. Al-Hayat, citing Yemeni security sources, said one of those arrested was a 24-year-old French man who travelled to Yemen in October from Egypt to study Arabic, even though he was fluent in the language. Senior Yemeni government officials declined to comment on the report. A Yemeni official had said on Sunday that authorities detained several U.S. and French students on security grounds but made no mention of further detentions. Yemen, next to top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, has been a Western security concern since a Yemen-based regional al Qaeda arm claimed responsibility for the failed plane bombing. The Yemeni official said the handful of Westerners he said were being held had been taken into custody at the behest of their own governments, but declined to give details. A source close to the Yemeni government said two Americans and a French citizen were thought to be held, but the government official could not confirm that. Officials reached at the U.S. and French embassies in Sanaa had no immediate comment. North and South Yemen formally united in 1990 but many in the south, where most of impoverished Yemen's oil facilities are located, complain that northerners usurp their resources while discriminating against them. Yemen's cash-strapped government is almost powerless to meet the needs of demands of most of its people in a heavily armed society that is growing increasingly discontented and where people sometimes take struggles to the street. In the eastern province of Ma'arib, senior al Qaeda member Hamza al-Dhayani has given himself up to Yemeni authorities, a government official told Reuters on Monday. He was the second al Qaeda figure in Ma'arib to surrender himself in two days. Dhayyani, charged by Yemeni authorities with recruiting the al Qaeda elements who killed seven Spanish tourists in 2007 by hitting their convoy in Ma'arib with a car bomb, was handed over to Sanaa's security authorities and will be sent to priso
