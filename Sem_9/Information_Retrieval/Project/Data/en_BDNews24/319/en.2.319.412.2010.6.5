 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Two small fires took place on Saturday at Shankar and Chawkbazar in the capital without casualties. The metre-boxes caught fire at the ground floor of the five-storey building 'Prabaha' in Jafrabad, Shankar at around 4pm. It was put out swiftly even before the fire fighters reached the spot. Mohammadpur fire service station officer said the situation was under control but "not quite safe". The electrical wires were jumbled up leading to the metre boxes, next to which lay the building's generator and water pump. The fire service severed electrical connection to prevent further short-circuits. They said that officials from the designated power agencies would fix them later. Given much tension due to the large fire in Old Dhaka which killed almost 120 people on Thursday, locals prepared to leave the area as soon as news of the fire broke out. Another fire occurred in a plastic factory at Chwakbazar in the Old Dhaka. But fire-fighters put it out within 25 minutes before it could spread and cause any casualties. Witnesses said the plastic factory at 27/1 Kazi Riazuddin Bazar of Chwakbazar caught fire at around 4pm. Fire officials suspect short circuit behind the fire. An official of Lalbagh fire service told bdnews24.com that the loss would be worth Tk 1 lakh. bdnews24.co
