 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has invited the opposition leader Khaleda Zia to parliament with her budget proposals. In a first-ever presentation of a shadow budget by the opposition, BNP chief Khaleda Zia had said her party's politics was for the greater interest of the people. Hasina said that the proposals would be considered if they were acceptable. Khaleda had said that the budget recommendations were BNP's way of cooperating with the government to prevent further misery of the people. She said that the opposition had tried to cooperate with the government on many occasions. "But the government gave us a cold shoulder." In her reaction to the opposition's shadow budget, the prime minister said addressing Khaleda, "Come to Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) and present your proposals." "If they are indeed beneficial for the people, they will be considered." The prime minister was speaking at a programme organised by the ruling Awami League at Osmani Memorial Auditorium to mark the historic 'Six-point Day'. But Hasina also cautioned that the BNP would be made to answer if their proposals are only to deceive the people. bdnews24
