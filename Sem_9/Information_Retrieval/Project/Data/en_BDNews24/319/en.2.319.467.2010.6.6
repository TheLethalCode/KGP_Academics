<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has begun hearing the writ petition filed by Khaleda Zia challenging the government notice asking the BNP chairperson to quit her cantonment house. The bench of justices Najmun Ara Sultana and Sheikh Hasan Arif on Sunday began the hearing which will continue on Monday. Advocate TH Khan argued for Khaleda at the hearing. He said the notice had been served only to 'politically' harass Khaleda. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam represented the state. On May 23, the chief justice transferred the writ petition to the current bench from the bench of justices Md Iman Ali and Obaidul Hasan. On May 17, the hearing was adjourned until May 24 by the order of the former bench following an application for time extension by Khaleda's lawyers. Acting chief justice Md Abdul Matin directed the BNP leader's counsel On May 11 to place the application before chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim on his return from abroad. Earlier, the bench of justices Ali and Hasan had rejected an application to stay the government order requiring her to leave her residence, and had twice rejected subsequent applications that the case be heard before another bench. The opposition chief's petitions were first rejected on April 13, then on May 5 and for the last time on May 11. The Directorate of Military Lands and Cantonments dice served the two-time former prime minister a notice on April 20 2009, asking her to immediately vacate the cantonment house. On May 3 that year, Khaleda filed a petition with the High Court challenging the executive order. In a modified notice on May 7, the Directorate asked the BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. Subsequently, a government ministry in a May 24 notice asked the former prime minister to leave the house by June 30. Three days later, the court stayed the government notice for three months. On Aug 23, the High Court extended its stay order upon the government notice for a further four months, and on Dec 14 the freeze was extended for a further six months The cabinet had decided in April 2009 to cancel the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that Khaleda had violated the lease terms. Before her cabinet took the decision, prime minister Sheikh Hasina had told parliament that Khaleda should vacate the house to make way for blocks of apartments for families of army officers killed in the February BDR mutiny. The massive 2.72-acre spread was originally the official home of the deputy army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Ziaur Rahman, who later became army chief and then president through controversial means. After the murder of Ziaur Rahman, in a military coup in 1981, his widow Khaleda was also awarded a house in Gulshan in addition to the cantonment house which the family had been occupying since the 1970s. bdnew
