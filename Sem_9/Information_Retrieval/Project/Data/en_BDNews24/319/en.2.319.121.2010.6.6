 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnew24.com) -- People living in the country's southern coastal regions subjected to cyclones Sidr and Aila are being provided international support by a group of international agencies, a Food and Agriculture Organisation statement issued on Saturday said. A FAO mission involving experts from its headquarters and the country office visited the southern coastal region for three days from Thursday to Saturday. FAO representative in Bangladesh Ad Spijkers said: "People in the south need more support to rebuild their livelihood after the devastations of cyclones Sidr and Aila. "Support in crop, fisheries and livestock sectors will be supplemented by broadcasting vital information through the voices of the villagers", he said on Friday in a meeting with farmers and officials at Amtali Upazila in Barguna district. "A strong information communication system can upgrade the knowledge of the rural people and improve the livelihood in the rural setting and the community rural radio run by the rural community is extremely important", he added. On Saturday the FAO team discussed their urgent implementation arrangements with the officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Barisal. Spijkers said the enormous potential in the south in boosting farm production should be exploited. "We can do it by introducing stress tolerant improved seeds and modern machines like power tillers and irrigation pumps, promoting balanced use of fertilizers and other inputs, augmenting surface water irrigation, and providing the farmers and fishers with real time information on market, modern technologies and best practices through a community radio of their own. "We have supported 1.4 million farmers after Sidr and Aila with emergency inputs for crop, fisheries and livestock with support from the development partners", he said. In a briefing in Barisalk Spijkers said: "The World Bank project (US$ 16 million) and that under the European Union Food Facility (Euro 7.4 million) for assistance against soaring food prices aim at supporting a sustainable food security for the south". Twelve southern districts will be covered under the EU funding  along side of which a joint programme under FAO, WFP and UNICEF (US$ 8 million) will promote homestead gardening and improving nutrition. "The Government is exploring the opportunities for investment in the southern delta to attain sustainable food security for the country and introducing the modern technologies and practices could be the means to achieve the goals", Ad Spijkers told the meeting. "A master plan for investment is the key to bring the southern region back as 'the bread basket' of Bangladesh." Referring to the last month's Bangladesh Food Security Investment in Dhaka the FAO representative said that they are assisting the government, along with other partners, for a comprehensive Country Investment Plan (CIP) for agriculture, food security and nutrition. "The CIP would be instrumental for drawing enhanced domestic and foreign investment in the sector", added Ad Spijker
