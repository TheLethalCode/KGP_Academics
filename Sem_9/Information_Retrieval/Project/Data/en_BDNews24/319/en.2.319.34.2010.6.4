 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)--City development authority Rajuk has decided to knock down the seven-storey building leaning to one side in Tejgaon's Begunbari, where another building toppled off its base on Tuesday. "The building was developed without approval (from Rajuk). We have decided to knock it down very soon," Md Shafiqul Islam, a Rajuk official told bdnews24.com after visiting the building on Friday. A Rajuk (Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha) team, police and fire service personnel visited the building after hearing the news of its leaning. Fire service men evacuated the dwellers of the 40/A/7 Begunbari building. Islam said: "Measures will also be taken against some other buildings erected without approval in the same area."
