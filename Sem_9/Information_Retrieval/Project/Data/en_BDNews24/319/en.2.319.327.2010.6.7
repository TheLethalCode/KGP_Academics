<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader Khaleda Zia called for allocation of Tk 1 billion in the upcoming budget for a pilot scheme to set up an 'Old Age Pension Fund'. Her call came during presentation of the opposition's budget recommendations for the 2010-2011 fiscal. She declared the details of the shadow budget, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, at a programme in Dhaka's Hotel Sheraton on Monday. Khaleda said, "The country's average longevity is rising. We are proposing to form a pension fund for the old people as there are not many income sources for the aged persons." "The fund will run on a commercial basis to benefit the aged," she added. She said that the pension savings would also help contain inflation. All those who have income sources but do not get pension, would be gradually included in the fund, said Khaleda. The BNP chief also said she believed that the presence of national identity cards would allow smoother management of the funds. bdnews2
