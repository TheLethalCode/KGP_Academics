<TITLE> Africa's first high-speed train opens for World Cup visitors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Jun 07 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  South Africa will open the continent's first high-speed rail link on Tuesday, just in time to whisk a mass influx of World Cup fans Cup from the country's main airport into uptown Johannesburg. The three billion dollar Gautrain project has been dogged by a series of problems since work began in September 2006, including strikes and excavation snags, and only one stretch of the line will open for business this week. But authorities in Gauteng province, the country's economic powerhouse which includes both Johannesburg and Pretoria, say it will help transform the lives of traffic-frazzled commuters and draw in long-term investment. "The good thing about what South Africa has done for the World Cup is that we have not done something for June 11 to July 11, we have put our money for life beyond that," Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane told journalists Saturday. "Currently, congestion is a major threat to the development of the province where traffic volumes grow at a rate of seven percent per year on the main corridor between Johannesburg and Pretoria. "This is going to be an asset and property of the people of South Africa for generations to come," she added. Some 300,000 foreign visitors are expected in South Africa during the month-long tournament, the majority landing at OR Tambo International Airport. A taxi ride from the airport into Johannesburg can take an hour but as of Tuesday, arrivals will be able to make the same journey in less than 15 minutes as the train hurtles along at speed of up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour. The first terminus to open is at Sandton, a swanky suburb which is home to the Johannesburg stock exchange and a massive shopping mall. But the train will eventually take passengers into the central business district, the suburb of Rosebank and onto Pretoria, the seat of government. The highway between Pretoria to Johannesburg is much the busiest in the country and the journey can be a two-hour commute at rush-hour but the same trip on the Gautrain should take just 42 minutes. One-way tickets from the airport to Sandton will cost 100 rands (13 dollars, 10 euros), less than similar rail links in cities such as London or Hong Kong but still a small fortune for the average South African. But the Johannesburg-Pretoria segment will cost just 35 rands, rivalling the price of the mini-buses that currently provide most of area's mass transit. Officials hope the price scheme will help turn South Africans onto public transport, in a country where such mass infrastructure languished for decades under apartheid policies designed to keep whites and blacks apart. There will also be tight security on the trains, using closed-circuit TV cameras, 400 security guards and 50 police officers to convince South Africans to abandon the protective shell of their vehicles. The train would also provide wheelchair access to disabled people, a first in the country. "This is democracy at its best where disabled people for the first time are given a right to choose which transportation they would use," Jerry Magagula, the wheelchair-bound chairman of the Gauteng commuters' organisation, told AFP. "This train will offer us safe, reliable and affordable transport." The Bombela Consortium, an international group that includes Bouygues, Canadian firm Bombardier and two South African companies, began construction on the project in September 2006 and so far the government has spend 23,972 billion rands (3 billion dollars, 2,5 billion euros) on the project. The Gautrain is the first high-speed rail line in Africa. The north African cities of Casablanca, Algiers and Cairo all have metro lines, but none runs as fast or as far as the Gautr
