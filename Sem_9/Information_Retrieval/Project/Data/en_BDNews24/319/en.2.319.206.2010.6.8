Her younger sister, Runa Aktar, was set to be engaged that evening and guests had already come to the party when the fire broke out. In a unique first, the prime minister's official residence is set to host the wedding of Ratna with Mohammed Saiduzzaman Suman. Hearing of the sisters' plight, prime minister Sheikh Hasina announced that she would herself take over the responsibility of their mother who died in the blaze. True to her word, she called the two would-be couples, Ratna and her fiance Suman, Runa and her fiance Jamil Uddin, and their surviving family members to her official residence on Monday evening and initiated marriage talks.
