 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com) The bullish trend at Dhaka stocks set another record as the key index reached an all time high on Thursday registering more than one percent rise and closing at 6202.67 points. Market experts, however, said that the hike was not unusual given the influx of new investors almost everyday. "For the time being this hype is not abnormal," former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. General investors are coming into the market in huge numbers and pushing the price and index high, according to Ahmed, who teaches finance at the University of Dhaka. The premier bourse's general index or the DGEN surged 62.46 points or 1.02 percent closing at 6202.67. This is, however, the third time in the week which saw three records in the index. On the opening day of the week the market had crossed the 6100 mark and reached 6108.50 points; on Tuesday the market set another all time high at 6152.38 points. More than 68 percent of all the issues traded gained, 72 issues declined and four remained unchanged. The daily turnover edged down to Tk 16.21 billion from Wednesday's Tk 17.18 billion. Power and energy led the day with state-owned Titas Gas leading the turnover table, rising by 3.05 percent and shares worth Tk 1443.48 million being traded. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh was second in the turnover chart with shares of Tk 946.81 million traded and gained 6.44 percent. Summit Power followed with a total turnover of Tk 734.15 million and the issue advanced by 1.75 percent. Non-bank financial institution Lanka Bangla Finance was the fourth major issue of the day with a decline of 1.13 percent and shares worth Tk 645.15 million changing hands. Beximco lost 0.75 percent in price and shares worth Tk 602.05 million were traded. The day turned out to be a good one for mutual funds after the recent downturn of the sector.
