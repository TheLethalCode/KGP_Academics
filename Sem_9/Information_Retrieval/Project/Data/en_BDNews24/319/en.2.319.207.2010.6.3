 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)-- Law minister Shafique Ahmed has urged the international community to cooperate with Bangladesh in holding the war crimes trial. He requested the other countries to provide his government with information and data on crimes against humanity during the war of independence in 1971. The minister made the call on Thursday at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of International Criminal Court at Kampala in Uganda, a statement said. He said the Bangladesh government was determined to maintain transparency and international standards in the trial of war criminals and crimes against humanity. Data and information preserved in the archives and libraries of various countries will help the trial process, Ahmed said. He also elaborated upon the government steps regarding the trial. Delegations from 111 countries are participating in the conference scheduled to end on June 11. Earlier on Wednesday, the law minister exchanged views with expatriate Bangladeshis in Uganda. Foreign minister Dipu Moni was also present. The two ministers asked the Bangladeshis to invest in the country and encourage foreigners to do so as well.
