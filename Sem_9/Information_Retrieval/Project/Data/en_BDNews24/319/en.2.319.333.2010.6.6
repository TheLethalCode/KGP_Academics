<TITLE> Maradona factor weighs against Argentina: Ardiles </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, June 6 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Diego Maradona's stewardship of the Argentinian national side is a negative factor which could harm his country's chances, according to 1978 champion and former international team-mate Osvaldo Ardiles. Under Maradona, the two-time champions just crept into the finals after some inept showings in the qualifiers and former Tottenham favourite Ardiles says the problem chiefly emanates in his view from the bench. "I am critical of his irresponsible team selection, and I'm still of the view that he was a strange choice as national team manager," Ardiles said in an article for Britain's Daily Telegraph. "Diego won't think so. He sees himself as The Chosen One, and believes his destiny on earth is to win the World Cup as a player, and as a manager. "But so far he has clearly not been successful as a manager. We qualified for these World Cup finals by the skin of our teeth, and with plenty of luck," Ardiles observed. "Yes, Diego was the greatest player in the history of the game. I know, I played with him (at the 1982 finals); but that does not excuse the glaring omissions from Argentina's squad," said Ardiles in a highly candid assessment, noting that Maradona has travelled to South Africa without 'leaders' such as Javier Zanetti, Esteban Cambiasso and Juan Riquelme. In addition, the squad has no natural candidate for right-back, and Ardiles feels disappointment lies ahead in the coming weeks. "I'm disappointed with Maradona, because there is no rationale behind those decisions. There has been unrest behind the scenes," said Ardiles. "Riquelme should have been conducting the orchestra on the pitch at this tournament. Instead, they no longer talk to each other." Furthermore, "it makes no sense at all to me that Zanetti is missing. He's had a wonderful season as captain of Inter Milan, they completed the treble, with League and Cup in Italy, and took the Champions League." And Ardiles concluded with a withering assessment. "Leaving out top players is giving far too many advantages to the opposition. Very, very stupid." Ardiles, who starred in the 1978 win over Holland when a teenage Maradona did not make the final squad and who then moved to Spurs with Ricky Villa, added that "Maradona surrounds himself with Yes, Diego men, and that has been Maradona's problem all his life. Then Maradona fights with everyone." And the former midfielder suggested that one of the things driving Maradona on was his ongoing grudge at not making the 1978 side, which meant he would not have a chance to beat Pele in becoming the youngest player to win the World Cup - the Brazilian having lifted the trophy at just 17. "He was 16, and he would have been the youngest ever to play. He wanted to beat Pele in everything, and his dream was destroyed." Although Ardiles said a side with Lionel Messi in it had a chance to go far, "the biggest question mark about Argentina is the manager himself and that will only be resolved in the coming six we
