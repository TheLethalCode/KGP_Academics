<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was set to leave Sunday on a tour for stronger security and trade ties with Latin America despite US friction with powerful Brazil over Cuba, Honduras and Iran. The chief US diplomat will first hold a full day of talks in Lima on Monday with officials of the 33 active members of the Organization of American States (OAS) before traveling on to Ecuador, Colombia and Barbados. It was not clear whether rows or differences between Washington and Brasilia, the Western hemisphere's main powers, would stay under the surface or burst into the open and hurt the overall OAS meeting. With security the main theme this year, the OAS General Assembly's agenda lists plans to tackle regional arms sales, crime and Argentina's claim of sovereignty over Britain's Falkland Islands. Clinton's top diplomat for the region, Arturo Valenzuela, said the United States does not support the Argentine claim. "Our position has always been that this is a matter for both countries to address," he told reporters Friday. Peruvian President Alan Garcia seeks to limit arms sales and avert an arms race amid what analyst Michael Shifter says is his concern over purchases by Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela. But Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, told AFP he doubts the proposal will go far amid lack of interest from Brazil and the United States as well as other countries. Valenzuela, the US assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, dismissed fears of an arms race. "There has actually been a significant decline in expenditures on armaments in most countries of the region," he said. Though it may not be on the agenda, there may be debate over US-backed efforts to readmit Honduras to the OAS following its suspension in June last year over the coup that toppled president Manuel Zelaya. OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said Honduras will come up in a free session on Monday but a Peruvian government source said some states prefer to avoid such debate for fear it could degenerate into an ideological row. For many Latin American countries, Honduras cannot return to the OAS unless Zelaya is allowed to return peacefully from exile, according to Insulza. Shifter said there remained a "sharp difference" over readmitting Honduras to the OAS between the United States and Brazil, which sheltered Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa during a long stand-off following the coup. Analyst Christopher Sabatini, an executive at the New York-based Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told AFP it might be possible for the OAS to reach a consensus on a "process" for readmitting Honduras. A similar compromise was tailored for Cuba to save last year's OAS assembly when a dispute emerged with the United States opposing efforts by Venezuela, Brazil and others to readmit Havana to the pan-Arab grouping. Apart from US-Brazilian differences over Honduras, those over Iran and Cuba can also bubble to the surface, Shifter said. US officials declined to say whether Clinton would meet on the margins of the OAS with Celso Amorim, the Brazilian foreign minister, as Washington pushes next week for a UN Security Council vote on new sanctions against Iran. Brazil, a non-permanent council member, has opposed sanctions while pushing a deal opposed by Washington to ship low-grade nuclear fuel to Turkey so that it can be further enriched and returned to Iran for medical purposes. Shifter said Cuba could come up again as many Latin American countries feel little has been done in the last year to readmit Cuba. On Tuesday, Clinton will fly to Quito for talks with Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa and for a speech laying out the broad outlines of President Barack Obama's policies toward Latin America. "The idea now is to set forth a more cooperative agenda," Sabatini said of the speech. "This administration wants to feel it is leaving a mark on Latin American policy," he said, noting it has suffered a number of "fits and starts" in improving ties with a region that has long distrusted the United States. Clinton will visit Colombia on Wednesday and Barbados on Thursday before returning to Washington. She has made around half a dozen tours of Latin American countries since she became secretary of st
