 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)-- Two Dhaka courts on Monday allowed the police to remand for a total of four days Mahmudur Rahman, the detained acting editor of the recently closed Amar Desh newspaper, in two cases. Magistrate Habibur Rahman Bhuiyan of Dhaka's First Additional Chief Magistrate's Court granted one-day remand upon a seven-day remand petition in a case that charges him with obstructing police duty. The new case relates to the attempt by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists to snatch him from police custody when he had been being taken to Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court June 2 on charges of fraud. Mahmudur was arrested in the case filed by the daily's publisher Hashmat Ali for fraud around 4am on June 2, hours after the daily was shut down. The case states that around 100 JCD activists tried to snatch Mahmudur from the police in a confrontation on the court premises. Tejgaon Chhatra Dal leader Hafizur Rahman was detained during the confrontation Following the incident, Kotwali police sub-inspector Shahajahan Miah filed a case against the Chaatra Dal leader and Mahmudur. The case's investigation officer, Mokhlesur Rahman, petitioned the court on Sunday for permission to show Mahmudur detained in the case. The court on June 2 asked police to quiz Mahmudur Rahman at jail gate and refused them permission to question him upon a remand petition. Rezaul Karim, a sub-inspector of Tejgaon police, again petitioned for a seven-day remand the following day. Metropolitan magistrate Mehedi Hasan Talukder felt embarassed at hearing the petition on Monday and left the court. Magistrate Mohammad Ali Hossain of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court-3 later heard the petition and granted police to grill Mahmudur Rahman for three days.
