 Rohan Ziad Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka dwellers should give serious thought about fire safety measures in the wake of the recent fires in Dhaka city, experts say. Bangladesh suffered its highest loss of life from a fire in Thursday night's blaze in old Dhaka's Nimtali area that has so far claimed 117 lives. In addition, two small fires broke out on Saturday in the Shankar area and old Dhaka's Chawkbazaar - though without any casualties. Experts believe that each and every household in Dhaka should take some safety measures including the purchase of basic fire fighting equipment, along with and escape plans if there is a fire. "There should be at least a fire extinguisher at every home," Selim Newaz Bhuiyan, a former fire official told bdnews24.com. The modern "dry powder chemical" fire extinguishers, can be used on any type of fire -- be it chemical, electric or hard fire, he added. According to Bhuiyan, there should be an unbarred window in every house for emergency evacuation. "To ensure security, this may not be a feasible option. However, arrangements should be made on a window grills so that it can be opened in times of fire." Bhuiyan also said that a rope-ladder is essential as most of the buildings in Dhaka have no fire escapes. There are at least nine companies in Dhaka, which sell elementary fire fighting equipment, fire detection systems and automated dowsing systems for big buildings. Isharul Haque, from Safety Fire Protection Co. at Nawabpur Road, said that prices of fire extinguishers vary according to their capacity. "Usually, a 3 kg fire extinguisher costs around Tk 950 and the 5 kg one is priced at about Tk 1250." However, they do not come with a lifetime warranty. After the first two years, it has to be refilled and it has to be done every year onwards, said Haque. Mac Incorporated and Integrated Control Equipment at Dhanmondi, SR Fire Fighting Equipment at Purana Paltan, Bengal Technological Corporation at Naya Palatan also sell similiar equipment. Apart from the extinguisher, gasmasks are also an important thing for households, said fire fighting consultant SM Shahjahan Saju. "Most of the casualties in a fire incident occur due to suffocation, and not from burn injuries," said Saju, the top official of Bengal International Agencies, based at the city's Moghbazaar area.. Saju also pointed out that it's important to have a fire escape in buildings and that regular fire drills are conducted Developers and real estate companies always backtrack from having a fire escape and other precautions, according to Saju. "Developers find the cost of having a fire escape and other measures an unproductive investment." bd
