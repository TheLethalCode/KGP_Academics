 MANCHESTER, England, June 3 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons revealed on Thursday he was set to change his bowling attack as the Tigers looked to level their Test series with England here at Old Trafford. Siddons said paceman Shafiul Islam, left out of the series opening eight-wicket loss at Lord's, would definitely start and that left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak was likely to come in as well. That would suggest seamers Robiul Islam, who made his debut at Lord's, and Rubel Hossain, who also struggled in the first Test, were set to be dropped for what will be the second and final match of the series, starting here on Friday. The Old Trafford pitch has a reputation for taking turn and Siddons told reporters here on Thursday: "Shafiul Islam will come in for one of our fast bowlers, we haven't really worked out which one and I'll have a look at the wicket and see whether it's worthwhile playing another spinner." Only Shahadat Hossain, with five first innings wickets, distinguished himself amongst the quicks, and Siddons added: "Our bowling was horrendous. We lost the game on the first day and, again, put so much pressure on our batsmen to save a game. "We just can't keep doing that, that's why we will make a change to the fast bowling. Shafiul will bowl good areas and be consistent, that's what we need. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, a left-arm spinner, will also hope the pitch stays true to form. Siddons, a prolific batsman in Australian first-class cricket but who never made it to Test level, said: "If it spins, like everyone is talking about, Shakib will worry the England players when it starts to turn. He's very good, as his figures suggest. "If it looks like it will turn, we might even play another spinner, play Razzaq and put them under pressure with spin rather than pace as that had no impact at Lord's. "If it's faster, spinner and bouncing a bit, Shakib will be a real handful. They (the England batsmen) have a lot more trouble with spin than they do with our medium-pacers." Siddons added first Test centurion Tamim Iqbal was still being trouble by a hand injury but that he expected him to play. "He's promised me he'll be fine for tomorrow. Hopefully he'll get on with it. "There's no guarantee the way he plays, he'll score runs here. But if he does, it gives us that great start and everyone's confidence blossoms from there. Particularly the other two guys at the other end. "Imrul Kayes and Junaid Siddique, they can survive and if they get a bad ball they will punish it. "For us it's important he (Tamim) is there or Mohammad Ashraful's there keeping the scoreboard ticking over. Bangladesh have won just three of their 67 Tests but Siddons was hugely encouraged by their display at Lord's, where they took England the fifth day. "Each day, I've just got to look each day for individual performances and look for us to put enough of them together to be competitive. "I love seeing Tamim make a hundred because that's my hard work and his effort and his talent coming out. "I just wish I could have the bowling to work with. Our first-class conditions, the (fast) bowlers bowl three or four overs and then the spinners come on so there are no grounds for them to develop." Asked if he might recruit dual national Anglo-Bangladeshi fast bowlers, Siddons said: "I've pushed it at board level to get the word out there. We'd definitely look at it, if there is a fast bowler who can come back and play for us immediat
