 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the police to gain the people's trust by serving them better. "Your attitude should not scare people, it should encourage them to have faith in you," she said while inaugurating the new Dhaka Metropolitan Police headquarters on Sunday. Hasina asked the policemen to accept cases when victims go to the police stations. "Make sure that the victims can go to the police station and seek justice." Referring to the torture on minorities after 2001 elections she said: "Many victims could not even lodge cases with the police out of fear of reprisals. This will not be allowed anymore." There are widespread allegations that religious minorities faced repression and torture after the BNP-led four-party alliance assumed power in 2001. "Criminals will not be spared whichever party they belong to. They do not bring any good to their families, to society, or to the country. "You should also be careful so that innocent people do not face harassment," the prime minister said. She added that the government was adopting measures to address the crises in the areas of manpower, transport and accommodation within the force. "Every member of the force will be provided with accommodation. But you will have to show professional attitude." She said the vehicles used in various projects can now be given to the police at the end of the projects instead of being sold off. "The home minister (Sahara Khatun) can take the vehicles for free or in exchange for money. But she has not sought any vehicles from me." Hasina thanked the fire fighters and police members for their diligent performance in the Old Dhaka fire. The fire broke out on the night of June 3 claiming at least 117 lives. "I had the police officers providing me information whenever I needed them. I have asked them to call me up any time they face a problem. "This is not a matter of protocol. This is a matter of life and death." Home minister Shahara Khatun, state minister for home Shamsul Hoque Tuku, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder and DMP commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque also spoke among others. The construction of the 1,14,311 square feet building started in 2006 and ended last year. bdne
