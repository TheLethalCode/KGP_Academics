<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 06 (bdnews24.com) Demolition of the seven-storey building that tilted on Friday at Begunbari at Tejgaon started on Sunday. The building's caretaker Akbar Hossain told bdnews24.com that the building's owner had begun the dismantling at around 1pm. Some eight workers began knocking down the building starting with the top floor. He also said, "It will take two to three months to knock down the entire structure." The building (40/A/7 North Begunbari) had tilted on Friday scaring residents and locals of another imminent collapse. Following an on-site observation of the tilted building on the day, Dhaka's real estate regulator RAJUK (Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha) threatened to tear down the building if the owner did not start demolition by Monday. Shafiqul Islam, the officer in charge of RAJUK's Mohakhali zone, told bdnews24.com that they had visited the site on being informed of the start of the demolition. All residents had moved out by Saturday fearing collapse. RAJUK hung a demolition notice on Saturday and the building's electricity connection was snapped. Mizanur Rahman, assistant police commissioner of Tejgaon Industrial Zone, told bdnews24.com that police officials were deployed around the building at RAJUK's request to avoid any untoward incident. He also revealed that the building's owner Siraj Miah was in jail. A total of 25 people died when a five-storey building toppled over and fell on adjacent shanties on Tuesday night in the same area. bdne
