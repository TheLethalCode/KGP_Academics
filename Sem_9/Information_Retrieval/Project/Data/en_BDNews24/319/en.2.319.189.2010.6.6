 Dhaka, June 6(bdnews24.com)--Mahmudur Rahman, the detained acting editor of the recently closed Amar Desh newspaper, has been shown arrested in a new case that charges him with obstructing police duty. The new case relates to the attempt by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists to snatch him from police custody when he had been being taken to Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court last Wednesday on charges of fraud. Mahmudur was arrested for the case filed by the daily's publisher Hashmat Ali for fraud around 4am on Wednesday, hours after the daily was shut down. The new case states that around 100 JCD activists tried to snatch Mahmudur from the police in a confrontation on the court premises. Tejgaon Chhatra Dal leader Hafizur Rahman was detained during the confrontation. Following the incident, Kotwali police sub-inspector Shahajahan Miah filed a case against the Chaatra Dal leader and Mahmudur. The case's investigation officer, Mokhlesur Rahman, petitioned the court on Sunday for permission to show Mahmudur detained in the case. Police's general recording officer at court, sub-inspector Babul Miah and the defendant's lawyer Belal Hossain Jashim confirmed bdnews24.com that magistrate SK Tofail Hasan had granted the application. At Wednesday's hearing, Tejgaon police sub inspector Rezaul Karim, the investigation officer in the earlier cases, petitioned the court to question Mahmudur in police custody. The petition was rejected by the court, and the police were allowed to question Mahmudur at the jail gate. The IO again sought five days to question Mahmudur in their custody on Thursday. The hearing for the new remand prayer is to take place on Monday. bdnews2
