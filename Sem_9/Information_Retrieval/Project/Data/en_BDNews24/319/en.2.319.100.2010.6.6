 Dhaka June 6 (bdnews24.com)--The government is starting a central distribution system for drugs used in hospitals to replace the current district and sub-district-based provision of medicine. Health minister A F M Ruhal Haque made the announcement on Sunday at a press conference at the ministry. Instead of hospitals in the districts buying drugs locally, the government will purchase and supply them directly to the hospitals under the new system. The minister pointed out that under the current system the same medicine was being sold at different prices at different hospitals. And, people are not confident of the quality of the unpackaged medicines provided in hospitals. Under the new system, the minister said, the medicines supplied to the hospital will have a government seal, which will prevent unnecessary waste of medicine and allow customers to feel confident of their quality. It will also, he said, result in lower drug prices. Director general of the health ministry Shah Monir Hossain said any pharmacies caught selling government-supplied drugs will have their drug licences cancelled and face criminal charges. The government has employed 400 people to implement the new project and Hossain said that these people will help prevent illegal conduct on the part of pharmacies. The government has already purchased 500 types of drugs from 25 drug companies at Tk 58 crore and these have already been packaged and sent to most districts. bdne
