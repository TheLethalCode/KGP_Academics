<TEXT>
 Chittagong, June 7(bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League-backed mayor runner ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has said the election result would show what type of 'change' people desire. Mohiuddin made the comment alluding to 'change' in the electoral manifesto of BNP-backed mayoral candidate M Manzur Alam when he was speaking to journalists on Monday. Regarding the allegation that Mohiuddin had turned city corporation into a business firm, he said the opposition was spreading the propaganda out of jealousy and to cover up their own failure. He said, "I ran businesses as part of enhancing the earnings of the city corporation, not for me." Mohiuddin campaigned in different parts of the port city ahead of the city corporation elections on June 17 in which he is seeking an unprecedented fourth term as mayor. Earlier, he exchanged views with the lawyers on Chittagong court premises in the morning. He carried out his campaign at South Kattli, Jelepara, Nath para, Durgapara, Vatiari, Halishahar, and South Pahartali.
