<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Moudud Ahmed has alleged that the government is heading towards dictatorship. "The government is trying to keep its failures under wraps by shutting down newspapers. It is heading towards dictatorship," the main opposition party BNP's standing committee member said. He was addressing a symbolic fast-unto-death and solidarity programme organised by Jatiya Gantantrik Party (JaGPa) at the National Press Club Auditorium on Sunday. The participants were protesting the closure of Daily Amar Desh and the arrest of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman. Reminiscing that newspapers went through a similar situation between 1972 and 1975, Moudud said, "This is not good for the country." He urged journalists to speak out. Moudud said, "The illegal ban on Amar Desh and the arrest of its acting editor for speaking the truth and pointing out the failures of the government is a bad sign." He urged that the ban be immediately withdrawn and the editor released. Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque and BNP leader Razia Fayez were among those who spoke in the meeting presided over by JaGPa president Shafiul Alam Pradhan. The meeting was followed by a symbolic hunger strike which Moudud broke by feeding juice to the strikers. Later in the afternoon, Sammilit Peshajibi Parishad, a professionals' body, formed a human chain in front of the club over the same demands. Veteran journalist Ataus Samad, press club president Shawkat Mahmud, organising secretary Kamal Uddin Sabuj, pro-BNP Doctors Association of Bangladesh president Azizul Haque and others spoke in the meeting that followed. bdne
