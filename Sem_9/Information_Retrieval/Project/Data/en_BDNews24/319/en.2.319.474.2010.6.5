 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Bomber Saikat accused of attacking police on Friday has admitted his involvement with the banned Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). A police operation was under way to arrest his aides. A policeman and three people were wounded when Saikat and an aide hurled a bomb at them at Gendaria in the capital on Friday. Saikat, 25, who made the attack, had been arrested following the incident. On Saturday, Gendaria police chief Md Faruque Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "Saikat's full name is Md Abul Mia." He admitted being an active JMB cadre. Three cases have already been filed against Saikatone under the Explosives Act, one for attacking the police and another under the Anti-terrorism Acthe said. The cases were transferred to the metropolitan Detective Branch Friday night. Police on Friday challenged Saikat at Dayaganj police check post at about 6pm and he tried to escape by throwing bombs at them. They recovered five improvised grenades and some gunpowder from the bag that he had been carrying. The bombs match those used in an attack at Jurain, making Saikat a suspected militant. The police, when raiding a militants' hideout at a house on May 23, came under bomb attack in which seven policemen were injured. On that night, a bomb disposal unit deactivated the bombs at a field in Gendaria. bdnews24.c
