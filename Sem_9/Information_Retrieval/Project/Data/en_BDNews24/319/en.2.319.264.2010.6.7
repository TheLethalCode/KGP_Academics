 Chittagong, June 07 (bdnews24.com)--Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain on Monday said they are embarrassed at the frequent visits of ministers to Chittagong ahead of the city corporation polls. He said if they did not stop visiting Chittagong city at the request of the Election Commission, law-enforcement agencies would not allow them to enter the city anymore. Addressing officials of law-enforcement agencies and magistrates, who will perform duties during the June 17 elections, Sakhawat said: "Ministers, state ministers and high government officials have now enhanced their routine works in Chittagong. The Election Commission is embarrassed at their visits." He said: "There will be no problem if they stop wheat distribution and visit to development works. If they don't pay heed to the request of the commission, law-enforcers won't allow them to enter the city." Naming Jubo League, Chhatra League and Jubo Dal, he said no outsiders would be allowed to enter the city during the elections "because their entry can cause deterioration in law and order. The commissioner came down heavily on the political parties for demanding resignation of commissioners in case of their defeat in polls. He said coordination forces, comprised of army, police, Bangladesh Rifles, Rapid Action Battalion and Ansars, and led by magistrates would be deployed on June 14. "No law breaker will be spared."
