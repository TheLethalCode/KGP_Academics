 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)--The government might bring the Fire Service Department under the disaster management ministry, the minister has said. "The fire service specially deals with disasters and that made us think they should be brought under the ministry," Abdur Razzaque said to journalists at a seminar on regulation in reducing disaster risk at a restaurant in the capital's Gulshan. Many fire incidents have happened in the past, he said, but this is the first time a fire of such devastating scale took place. "We are really sorry that it has happened." The government will take steps to provide necessary medical care for those injured and help in their rehabilitation, he added. He said the Dutch-Bangla Bank will donate Tk 1 lakh for every deceased's family and the government will provide them other assistance so that families can return to their normal life. "Even if other organisations don't help the families, the government will surely help them," said the minister. He also said Bangladesh was a disaster-prone country, and if there is an earthquake it will cause immeasurable damage. The government has spent Tk 70 crore on buying equipment relating to disasters and 62,000 volunteers have been trained to know what to do to reduce levels of death and injury if disasters occur. Bangladesh Disaster Producing Centre (BDPC), Manusher Jonyo Foundation (MJF) and Swiss Agency for Development and Co-operation (SDC) co-organised the seminar which also heard from a number of victims from Bagerhat, Sirajganj, Khulna and Satkhira describing their experiences. bdne
