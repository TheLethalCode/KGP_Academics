<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5(bdnews24.com) A five-storey building has tilted at Nakhalpara, Dhaka. The inmates of the building were evacuated on Saturday afternoon. Utility connections were cut off under the increasing weight of the building. The building tilted towards an adjacent mosque at around 4pm, locals and eyewitnesses said. Locals informed the fire service of the matter. Upon receiving information, Mamunur Rashid, senior officer of Tejagon fire station went to the spot along with some vehicles and rescue workers. Mamun said the building at 527/1 West Nakhalpara Samity Bazar tilted at around 4pm which triggered gas lines to leak. "A lot of gas is whizzing through the supply line leaks," he said adding that Titas Gas has already been informed of the matter. There were no casualties, he said adding that firemen were evacuating people from that building and adjacent buildings. Mamun, however, brushed off what he thought were speculations that the building had tilted pending official probes. In reply to a question he said RAJUK could ascertain if the structure was built illegally. He pointed out that the floors on top of the ground floor had more area as it expanded at the sides. Police personnel have cordoned off the entire area. This is the third incident of a tilted building in five days after the collapse of a building in Begunbari, Dhaka claiming 25 lives. A second building had titled in Begunbari on Friday. Al Amin, a local, told bdnews24.com that the gas connection had ruptured three days ago, "but no one really bothered with that." This tilted building was only exposed after the authorities came to monitor the ruptured gas line. Police and fire-fighters followed them, he added. General secretary of the Samity Bazar mosque committee Mojibul Huq Bhuiyan said a similar rumour spread two years ago. The mosque authority then arranged an engineer for examination who asked the building owner to dismantle the extra portions. But he did not do so, Mojibul added. There are shops on the ground floor and rest of the building is almost entirely rented out to bachelors. Tejgaon Industrial Police sub-inspector Shahabuddin told bdnews24.com that cases will be lodged against the building owner if specific complaints are found. The owner will be arrested in such a case, he added. Concerned authorities of RAJUK have already been informed, he said. They would decide on the next course of action, the policeman added. bdnews24.co
