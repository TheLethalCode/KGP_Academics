<TEXT>
 Bhola, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The defeated BNP candidate in Bhola-3's by-election retired major Hafiz Uddin Ahmed has claimed that his party's supporters are now being attacked. "Many of the local BNP leaders can't stay at their home suspecting a rival's attack," he claimed at a press conference held at his house. The constituency's returning officer, Nuruzzaman Talukder, has given directions to the law enforcing agencies to be on alert till Wednesday. Meanwhile the winner Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon, from the Awami League, said that he was taking steps to keep his supporters calm. On Saturday's by election, over 67 percent of the 234,926 registered voters cast their ballot - with Shaon securing 93,873 and his BNP rival 42,658. Voting was suspended at nine out of 86 centres. Hafiz - a former jute and water resources minister in the BNP-led 2001-6 coalition government, and a leading reformist during the subsequent emergency period - reiterated his demand that the by-election should be cancelled with the resignation of the election commissioners. "The AL supporters managed to take control over many centres and made their candidate win," he said. Hafiz said he had asked for army bases to avoid just this kind of situation. Hafiz also claimed that the Election Commission did not seem interested to look into why "there were no election agents from the BNP in 37 poling centres." At a separate conference held at the home of the winning candidate, Tofail Ahmed, AL's advisory committee member and election coordinator, said BNP would not be given the scope to make the election a political issue. "BNP should accept the election, which was fair and peaceful and Shaon won," he said. Shaon reminded people of the horrible situation in the constituency following the general election in 2001, when Hafiz won. "AL won't let the situation be repeated." Shaon said, "Some, who were tortured in the past, might be angry. But they (AL) won't let it be expressed." He also asked the law enforcing agencies to take strict measures to keep the situation peaceful. bdnews24
