<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The decision to allow screening of Indian films in cinema halls in Bangladesh is to be repealed. The decision came only hours after a protest at the Film Development Corporation by producers and actors involved in the Bangladesh film industry. After attending a programme at Sonargaon Hotel on Monday, Commerce minister Faruk Khan said, "We had recently decided to import Indian films. But will now revert to our previous position." "The government would not do anything that might harm the local film industry," he told reporters. He said steps will be taken to stop films from the South Asian countries entering the country. The ban on import and display of Indian films in the country's cinema halls was imposed in 1972. Following a review of its import policy, the government had recently proposed that films from India and other South Asian countries should be allowed to be screened. Bangladesh Chalachchitra Oikya Parishad, a platform of the local film industry, organised a protest on Monday at the premises of the Film Development Corporation (FDC). They claimed that such a decision would be devastating to the industry. Popular actors including Razzak, Anwara and Mizu Ahmed took part. They said the government had taken this decision without any consultation with those involved in the industry. bdnews24.com/
