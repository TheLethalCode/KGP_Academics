 Thimphu, April 26 (bdnews24.com)For the third SAARC summit running, SAARC will not be conferring any award "to honour and encourage outstanding individuals and organizations within the region." Since the institution of the SAARC Award in 2004, it has been conferred only once when in 2005 it was awarded posthumously to the Late President Ziaur Rahman. The Secretary general Shil Kant Sharma said on Monday that, "So far, we have not found any person of Ziaur Rahman's magnitude for the SAARC award," The BNP's de facto founder Gen Ziaur Rahman in the late 1970s took the initiative to create the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation comprising seven states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. His successor Gen H M Ershad took the process forward after Zia's assassination on May 30, 1981. The seven countries finally agreed on forming SAARC and the first summit took place in 1985 in Dhaka
