<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Monday ordered Kazi Morshedul Haque, the second in command of the banned Islamist outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir, to two more days of police remand. The police investigators sought 14 more days to question the Tahrir leader on two cases after Morshedul's three day remand ended. The Metropolitan Judge Syeda Minhazum Munira ordered one day remand for each case, whilst at the same time rejecting a bail application from the accused. The investigators mentioned in their remand application that Morshedul maintained regular contact with the outfit's chief coordinator in Bangladesh, Mohiuddin Ahmed. They also claimed that the Islamist outfit was involved in anti-state activities under the direction of the two men and they were planning massive subversive operations. Morshedul was arrested on April 21 from the capital on two cases, filed by the police after two Tahrir activists were arrested on April 18 with two petrol bombs. Hizb ut Tahrir was banned on October 22, 2009
