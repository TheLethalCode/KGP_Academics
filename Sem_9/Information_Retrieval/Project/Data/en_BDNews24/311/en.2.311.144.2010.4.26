 Thimphu, April 26 (bdnews24.com)--The foreign secretaries of the SAARC member states on Monday failed to agree on the inclusion of a call for legally-binding cuts to carbon emission levels in the upcoming SAARC declaration to fight climate change. Officials involved in the process hinted that India was to blame for the lack of agreement. All seven member countries other than India are thought to be in favour of legally-binding emission cuts for all countries  but the SAARC charter requires that all decisions must be taken on the basis of consensus. India has said in the past that it will cut emissions voluntarily. It is still possible, however, for subsequent meetings of the foreign ministers and leaders to change this decision in the next few days  though officials said that this was unlikely. At the end of the two-day SAARC standing committee meeting, the secretaries adopted a text on climate change representing the interests of all eight member countries, said Bhutanese foreign secretary Daw Penjo in Thimpu, the kingdom's capital. In reference to the next climate summit to be held in Mexico, he said, "In regard to the legally-binding agreement for the COP 16 meeting, what I can say now is that the work is in progress," he told reporters at a press conference. The standing committee will refer the issue to the meeting of the foreign ministers on Tuesday. Bhutan at the meeting proposed a common SAARC position on climate change, as it is widely accepted that South Asia would be hit hard by the impacts of climate change. The SAARC secretary-general Shil Kant Sharma, who flanked the secretary, told reporters that SAARC itself was not a member of the Conference of the Parties. "The legally-binding measures come from each of the member countries. But we have discussed the commonality at SAARC," Sharma told reporters. A number of officials attending the meeting told bdnews24.com that the standing committee reached consensus on financing for adaptation to climate change, technology transfer and other issues. The next 16th climate change conference in Mexico will resume negotiation on striking a climate deal aimed at ensuring mandatory emissions cuts for all developed and developing countries. The 15th climate change talks in Copenhagen could not sign a deal due to rejection of legally-binding emission cut proposals. Experts say if SAARC could refer to legally binding emission cut measures in its declaration, India would not be in a position to reject it at the climate change summit in Mexico. b
