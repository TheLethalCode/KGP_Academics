<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stoke City fans have had precious little to celebrate in 122 years but victory at Chelsea Sunday would put them one game away from reaching the FA Cup final for the first time while reviving some painful memories. Having already knocked out Manchester City and Arsenal this season another upset against the holders is entirely possible and the Stamford Bridge clash (4 p.m. British time) has set the Potteries abuzz with nostalgia. Stoke were founder members of the Football League in 1888 yet their only-ever trophy is the 1972 League Cup when they beat Chelsea in the final. That success came in their all-too brief "glory years" and was sandwiched by two controversial extra-time FA Cup semi-final defeats by Arsenal that still hurt to this day. In 1971 Stoke led 2-0 at Hillsborough only for Arsenal to make it 2-2 with a penalty after a then-unheard of five minutes of injury time and win the replay 2-0 en route to the Double. The following year they drew again - despite Arsenal having to play the last 15 minutes with striker John Radford in goal after an injury to Bob Wilson.

"I look back on my career with no regrets apart from those two games - it would have meant so much to the club and the area." Stoke never reached even the quarter-finals again until this season and although the Cup has nothing like the prestige it carried in those days, victory Sunday would be huge. At 83 years Reading's wait for a sixth-round appearance has been far longer and the only non-Premier League side left in the competition will hope to match their 1927 achievement of reaching the semis by beating visiting Aston Villa Sunday. Despite struggling near the foot of the Championship (second division) they have accounted for Liverpool, Burnley and West Bromwich Albion this season. Villa, beaten in the League Cup final by Manchester United last weekend, will be desperate to secure a return to Wembley, where both semi-finals are pla
