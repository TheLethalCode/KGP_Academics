<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 08 (bdnews24.com)--A parliamentary panel Monday asked the works ministry to clarify how the then military government waived a transfer fee for a Gulshan house gifted to leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia in 1982. The parliamentary standing committee on housing and public works discussed exemption of the land transfer fee, which the recipient by law must pay, standing committee chairman ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "The committee asked the ministry to come up with a clarification under which law the transfer fee of Khaleda Zia's Gulshan residence was exempted by the then government," Zohirul Haq Bhuiyan Mohon, a committee member, told bdnews24.com. "We think waiver of the transfer fee was not lawful," he said. The then military ruler HM Ershad allocated the property, standing on about 0.5 acres (1.5 bighas) of land in the wealthy Gulshan suburb, to Khaleda, widow of former president Gen Ziaur Rahman, following his assassination on May 31, 1981. Meeting sources said the committee observed that Ershad, now a partner of the Awami League-led alliance government, "illegally" exempted the fee which stood at around Tk 700,000. The military government also gave another house to Khaleda Zia inside Dhaka Cantonment. The Awami League has already cancelled the lease on the cantonment residence, but the issue has been pending in court. COMMITTEE UNHAPPY WITH GOVT PLOT ALLOCATIONS The standing committee in Monday's meeting also recommended the ministry to cancel any allotments of government plots based on false statements by government officials. "We have recommended the ministry to cancel the plot allocations to those who have received more than one government plot to date by submitting false information," Chowdhury said.
