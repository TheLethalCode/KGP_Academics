 JERUSALEM, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Vice President Joe Biden assured Israel on Tuesday of Washington's commitment to its security and said the agreed resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks provided a "moment of real opportunity" for peace. Biden, who arrived on Monday, is the highest-ranking member of President Barack Obama's administration to visit Israel, where concern is high over Iran's nuclear programme.

In his remarks, Peres said: "We have trust in President Obama", and he called on Washington to "surround Iran with an envelope" to protect Israel against Tehran's "missiles and nuclear threat".
