 BEIJING, Mar 9(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States would not have any standing to bring a case against Chinese Internet restrictions to the World Trade Organisation, a Chinese adviser on WTO strategy said in an opinion piece on Tuesday. US trade officials had asked for more information on whether they could pursue a case at the WTO, after Google threatened to shut its China operations following a hacker attack in late 2009.

The Bush administration considered, but did not pursue, a case that China's firewall poses a barrier to entry. Before the hacking attack and Google's threat to withdraw, Chinese authorities had appeared to specifically target Google with accusations pornography was easily available through its search engine, and ordered it to change the way it processed search requests. However, Chinese firms, including Google's top rival Baidu, also have to comply with Chinese censorship rules, and often do so preemptively. Chinese officials have been cagey on whether they are in talks with Google. The Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Li Yizhong, said on Friday his ministry is talking with Google, but over the weekend his vice minister, Miao Wei, said it wasn't. Google declined to comment on either official's comme
