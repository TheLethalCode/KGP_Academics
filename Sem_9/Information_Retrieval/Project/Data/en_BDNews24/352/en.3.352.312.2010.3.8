 LONDON, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 250,000 British civil servants walked out of work on Monday, starting a two-day strike over redundancy pay reflecting frayed union relations with the Labour government just weeks away from an election. Labour, which relies on union funding and counts on union activists to hit the streets during election campaigns, is facing the prospect of defeat to Conservatives at a poll expected on May 6 after 13 years in power. Opinion polls have shown the Conservatives' once considerable lead dwindling this year, raising the possibility of a hung parliament where no one party has control and even giving Labour a glimmer of hope of staying in charge.

The dispute, involving workers from courts, tax offices, parliament and border controls, centres on changes to the civil service compensation scheme which would mean workers get less money if made redundant. It is if the first time security staff in parliament have gone on strike in more than 25 years, the PCS said. Whoever wins the election will have to make big cuts to some government department budgets -- perhaps as much as 17 percent -- in order to bring down a budget deficit forecast to soar above 12 percent of gross domestic product this year. The Conservatives, regarded as less union-friendly than Labour, have indicated they will focus most of the necessary fiscal tightening on spending cuts rather than tax hikes and plans to freeze public sector pay for most workers in 2
