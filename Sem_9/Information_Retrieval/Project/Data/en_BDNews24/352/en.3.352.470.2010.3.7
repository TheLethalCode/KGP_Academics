<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 7 (bdnews24.com)  Stakeholders have strongly criticised a draft study on prices of essentials, conducted under the auspices of the Bangladesh's apex business body, for "inaccuracies". The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) said it was presenting the draft for feedback. Representatives of different market interests, at the presentation on Sunday, provided that feedback, blasting the study for allegedly being riddled with wrong figures that contradicted other standard sources of information. The study titled 'In-Depth Analysis on Price Dynamics of Essential Commodities', prepared with financial assistance of MIDAS, was presented by its author Firoz Iqbal. The study recommended identifying the much-hyped business "syndicates", although the businesses consistently deny that collusion occurs in price fixing. "There is no such thing as 'syndicates'," said MA Siddique, vice president of Bangladesh Indenting Agents Association. He was echoed by Golam Mowla, who represented the Moulvibazar Traders Association of Dhaka. In his presentation, Iqbal said one of the objectives of the study was to collaborate with the central bank on price control measures. "I don't find price control in collaboration with the Bangladesh Bank logical at all," said Ferdous Ara, research-in-charge of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. She questioned the sample size of the study and said that the data was old. 'ERRORS' Disputed figures included Bangladesh's annual demand for salt, which the study cited as 0.95 million tonnes against a production of 1.35 million tonnes. Shamsul Islam, representing the Salt Traders Association, said that the annual demand was around 1.6 million tonnes. The FBCCI president, Annisul Huq, himself questioned the study's estimation of annual wheat production of 844,000 tonnes. "Where does so much wheat grow in Bangladesh?" he said, interrupting the presentation. Fazlur Rahman, chairman of City Group, said the study's figures were wrong and differed widely with the real ones. He said that if the margin of error were around 4 or 5 percent then there could be some discussions. "But when it's around 40 percent, there's nothing to discuss," he replied when Huq asked him to comment on the study. In his closing statement, Annisul Huq admitted that there were at least 10 gross errors in the study. Asked why such a draft was presented in front of the media, Huq said that this had been put forward for feedback
