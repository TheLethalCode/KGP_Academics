I think he's had some problems in the last few days but he had the whole weekend to recover," former United player Beckham told Milan's TV channel on Monday. "He's a fine player and he'll want to participate in the match. Alex Ferguson will certainly use the best possible formation." Former England captain Beckham, 34, won the 1999 Champions League with United before leaving for Real Madrid in 2003 amid media reports of tension with manager Ferguson.
