 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, March 8 (bdnews24.com)  Four-day Indo-Bangladesh Border Coordination Conference began in New Delhi on Monday with a focus on movement of terrorists across the international border. The talks are being held against the backdrop of a startling revelation made by a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) operative, arrested in Dhaka on Feb 28, that the masterminds and perpetrators of the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines' Kathmandu-Delhi flight IC-814 had crossed over to India from Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) chief Maj Gen Md Mainul Islam is leading the 19-member delegation from Bangladesh; while the Indian side is being led by the Director General of the country's Border Security Force (BSF) Raman Srivastava. The BDR chief is expected to take up with his BSF counterpart the issue of frequent intrusions and unprovoked firing by the Indian border guards. The BSF, however, is likely to focus on the cross-border movement of terrorists. It is also expected to seek the BDR's cooperation to stop such activities across the international border. A senior BSF official said that cross-border terrorism was a major cause of concern for India. He said that the other issues to be discussed in conference included human and narcotics trafficking and joint patrolling by the BSF and BDR along the border. "During the conference, the progresses made in implementation of the decisions taken during last year's meet would also be reviewed," said the BSF spokesman, Vijay Singh. The top officials of the BSF and BDR are also expected to discuss and resolve the disputes caused in some stretches of the Indo-Bangla border due to erection of barbed wire fencing by India. The BDR and BSF chiefs are likely to address a news conference on Thursday (Mar 11). The issue of cross-border movement of terrorists came under sharper focus after the Rapid Action Battalion recently arrested five operatives of the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit JeM from Dhaka. One of the operatives, Nannu Mia alias Billal Mandal, reportedly told his interrogators that he had helped the terrorists involved in hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC 814 on December 24, 1999 to cross over to India from Bangladesh. Five Pakistani terrorists of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had hijacked the plane when it was on its way from Kathmandu to Delhi. After touching down in Amritsar (India), Lahore (Pakistan) and Dubai (UAE), the hijackers forced the aircraft to land in Kandahar, Afghanistan, which was then ruled by the Taliban. In order to meet the hijackers' demand, India had to release three incarcerated terrorists  Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Maulana Masood Azhar  to ensure safe release of the passengers and the aircraft. Of the three, Sheikh was again arrested in 2002 in Lahore for the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. After his arrest, Azhar founded the JeM, which was also involved in the 2001 attack on Indian Parliament. According to Indian Home Ministry officials, Nannu Mia's revelation underscores the need to pay more attention on the country's eastern frontier and the BSF would seek the BDR's cooperation to stop cross border movement of terrorists. Maj Gen Islam had told journalists in Dhaka last Saturday that the BDR would focus on the recent border troubles at Sylhet during the talks with the BSF. The BDR, in a statement, had stated that its agenda for the Border Coordination Conference included the BSF's incursions into Bangladesh territory, incessant firing on Bangladeshi citizens and capture of Bangladeshi citizens without any reason.
