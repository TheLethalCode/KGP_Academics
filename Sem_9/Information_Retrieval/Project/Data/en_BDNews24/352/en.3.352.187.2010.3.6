 Dhaka, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, the son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in his first overtly political comments since joining the party of his mother and founded by his grandfather, blamed the "post '75 governments" for the poor image of Bangladesh. The budding politician, who became a primary member of the ruling Awami League last month, was speaking on Saturday at a seminar on 'Developing A Positive Image of Bangladesh', at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre, named after his grandfather, the country's founding president who was assassinated in 1975. Post-'75, it took Awami League 21 years to come to power again. Sajeeb said the governments in that time were only concerned with keeping a hold on power, but building a positive image of Bangladesh was a priority for the present Awami League-led government. "To build a positive image of the nation we need three things: stability, continuity and commitment," he told the seminar, which also marked the end of a three-day Digital Innovation Fair in Dhaka. "The present government with its slogan of 'Digital Bangladesh' is committed to take the advantages of digital technology to the door-steps of everyone," Sajeeb added. Answering questions in the seminar, he said the government would ensure better and cheaper internet bandwidth by this year. Professor Syed Ferhat Anwar, of Dhaka University's Institute of Business Administration, presented the keynote paper on 'Branding Bangladesh'. "Bangladesh is attaining growth and has lots of potential to become a popular destination for investment and tourism." The prime minister's adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury chaired the seminar.
