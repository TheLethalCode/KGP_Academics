 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said on Sunday the government must rethink the role of the "corruption-ridden" National University, under which over one million students of around 1600 degree-level colleges are affiliated. Nahid also described his own ministry and the departments under it as "dens of corruption". "Corruption has been rampant at the National University. So we have to reconsider its future role," he told a discussion meeting at Rangpur Carmichael College. The minister said a committee has been formed to probe the corruption at National University, the certifying authority for general education at graduate and post-graduate level in colleges and equivalent institutions around the country. "Actions will be taken on the basis of the probe report." Decrying corruption at the education ministry as a whole, Nahid said: "Countless officials there feel no shame in demanding bribes." The minister asked the two chief engineers of the Rangpur Education Engineering Department to formulate a master-plan in two months for infrastructural development of Carmichael College. Nahid thanked the teachers and guardians present for helping to hold cheat-free Secondary School Certificate exams. He said Class VIII or junior secondary exams would also soon be held countrywide like the recently introduced primary education terminal exams at the end Class V. Rangpur Rokeya University vice-chancellor Prof Abdul Jalil Miah also addressed the meeting, presided over by Carmichael College principal Prof Abdul Wadud. Rangpur Education Engineering Department chief engineer Mizanul Karim and Rangpur deputy commissioner BM Enamul Haq, among others, were present.
