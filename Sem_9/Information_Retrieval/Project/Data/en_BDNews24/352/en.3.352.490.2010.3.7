 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Sunday that her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman formed detailed war plans for Bangladesh's eventual liberation from Pakistan during a stay in London in 1969, the year he was accorded the title 'Bangabandhu', friend of Bengal. Hasina was addressing a discussion in Dhaka to mark the historic March 7 speech, the day in 1971 when Sheikh Mujib called on the Bangali nation to prepare for the secession struggle from Pakistan. She said Bangabandhu made war plans just months after his release from Kurmitola where he had been detained in the Agartala Conspiracy Case, in which the Pakistan government had brought sedition charges against Bangabandhu and 34 others. "He went to London on October 22 1969, following his release in the Agartala case on April 22 that year. I reached London the next day from Italy, where I was living with my husband.," she recalled. "It was there that Bangabandhu at a meeting made plans for liberation, including when the war would start, where our freedom fighters would be trained and where refugees would take shelter." "All preparations were taken there (London). I was serving tea and entered the room several times where the meeting was being held. I heard their discussions," the prime minister said. Referring to the recent debate over who first proclaimed Bangladesh's independence, she urged all to go through the reports of intelligent agencies and foreign ministries of different countries. She also said the Aug 15 1975 assassination of her father and family members, and the Jail Killings of four national leaders on Nov 3 the same year, were planned by those defeated in the war to take revenge for their defeat. "Those who rewarded the killers had never expected Bangladesh's independence. They wanted to impose the principles of the defeated forces on the people," she added. The prime minister urged leaders and activists of the ruling Awami League, her father's party, to give up intentions of personal gain and uphold the principles of Bangabandhu. "Every politician has to consider what they have given to the country and not think of what they get," she said. Terming her father's March 7 address a milestone, the prime minister said Bangladesh in effect emerged as an independent nation following the historic speech. Senior Awami League figures, including presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Abdul Latif Siddiqui and Rajidduin Ahmed Raju, advisory council member Suranjit Sengupta, general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and cultural affairs secretary Asaduzzman Noor addressed the discussion meeting. b
