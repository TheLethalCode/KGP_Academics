 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)Business leaders on Tuesday called for an appropriate tariff structure in the next budget with a view to shoring up the country's manufacturing sector. Representatives from different trade bodies, at a 'pre-budget workshop', also requested the government to eliminate the existing tax on import of capital machinery in the light engineering sector and VAT imposed on renting space and machinery bought from leasing company in the ready made garments sector. However, the workshop on tariff and non-tariff structure in the upcoming budget and expectation of the industries sector, ended inconclusively apparently because many of the guests did not turn up and the small number of participants who attended came unprepared to make any significant suggestions. The workshop, organised by the ministry of industries, was conducted by the additional secretary. Others who attended were industries minister, secretary and members from the FBCCI, MCCI, DCCI, associations of jute mills, engineering and ceramics. The workshop decided to arrange another meeting on March 23 to discuss the issues in detail. Meanwhile, the industrialists placed several demands including enhancing assistance in producing import substitute goods and to ensure sufficient supply of gas and power to boost economic growth. Minister Dilip Barua reiterated his government's position to develop the industrial sector, saying "It has decided to increase the contribution of the sector to 40 percent of the GDP from the existing 23 percent." "Due to globalisation and open market economy, it is tough to secure interest of the native goods by imposing tariff and non-tariff barriers," he said. He stressed on improving product quality, increasing efficiency and productivity of the industries to compete in the global market.
