 ROME, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan coach Leonardo said he was relishing the challenge of trying to reverse a 3-2 deficit at Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday even though his side fired blanks in Saturday's 0-0 draw at AS Roma. Milan's inability to find the net despite doing almost all the attacking in the Serie A match means they missed the chance to close within a point of leaders Inter Milan. Nevertheless, Leonardo took positives from the performance and remains confident of reaching the quarter-finals of a European competition Milan have won seven times. "I have lots of certainties in this squad, in these players. We really believe (we can do it)," he told Sky television when asked about next week's Champions League last 16 second leg. "Football is giving us a great opportunity. It's extraordinary to go to Old Trafford having to win in an important way. "I don't just mean winning 2-0. I mean victory, going there to score goals and play a game against a Manchester side who have their style. "We have to play as we know how to, try to score goals and that is a marvellous opportunity.
