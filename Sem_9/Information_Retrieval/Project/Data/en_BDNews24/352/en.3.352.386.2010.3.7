<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)The government gave Mitsubishi Pajeros to 20 upazila chairmen at an impromptu ceremony on Sunday, in line with a decision taken last year. Local government minister Ashraful Islam and industries minister Dilip Barua handed the keys to the chairmen at the office of Pragati Industries Ltd at Tejgaon. The ceremony was marred by mismanagement and chaos caused by a last-minute decision asking the Pragati management to organise the event instead of the LGRD ministry. So far, Pragati has handed over 130 V31 model Pajeros to the LGRD ministry. The first 20 chairmen were selected by lottery. The remaining chairmen will be given their jeeps in phases. The Pajero jeeps were assembled by Pragati, which imports the parts from Japan. Ashraf said the vehicles have been allotted to make the chairmen's work easier, not for "luxury". He also said a proposal is also under consideration to raise salaries of the chairmen and vice chairmen of the country's 481 upazilas, the lowest tier of local government. They will be paid more than municipal mayors, according to a spokesperson of the industries ministry. The chairmen and vice chairmen currently get Tk 7,500 and Tk 5000 respectively, while mayors of A-grade municipalities get Tk 5,000. Industries minister Dilip Barua said the state-owned Pragati will be strengthened as per a guideline delivered by the prime minister. Speaking at the occasion, chairman of Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation Abu Hafiz, also sought more government funds to increase Pragati's productivity. "We don't have working capital, so we've to take loans from banks to implement different projects," he said. The government through the local government ministry has ordered 420 jeeps, but the number will rise to 481, managing director of Pragati, Md Zahiruddin Chowdhury, said. The first 50 jeeps, assembled before the last budget, cost Tk 3,250,000 each. Another 130 cost Tk 3,539,000 each due to tax hike in the budget, while the following 240 cost Tk 3,800,000 as the conversion rate of the yen rose in the period, Chowdhury said.
