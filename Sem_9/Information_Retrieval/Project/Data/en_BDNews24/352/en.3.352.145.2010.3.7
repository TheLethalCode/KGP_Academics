 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan returned home on Sunday after two months of medical treatment in Singapore. Bhuiyan, the veteran politician who served as BNP secretary general for 11 years, went to Singapore on Jan 7 for lung treatment at Singapore National University Hospital. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled Mannan Bhuiyan from the party in 2007, just before her arrest during the state of emergency, for his 'reformist' efforts in the party. Since then, he has remained outside of party politics, though he ran in the December 2008 national elections from his Narsinghdi constituency as an independent candidate. He failed to win the seat.
