 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)  An additional 669 criminal cases have been listed as 'politically motivated' and recommended for withdrawal by a government scrutiny committee. The decision came in the 14th meeting of the committee on Tuesday. The monthly meeting, headed by state minister for law Qamrul Islam, was held at the home ministry. The minister told the press after the meeting that the committee has discussed 1072 cases and recommended 669 cases for withdrawal including six filed by the Anticorruption Commission. He added that 109 applications for withdrawal were rejected and the remaining 294 cases would be reconsidered at the next meeting. Those to be withdrawn include cases against state minister for LGRD Jahangir Kabir Nanok, AL organising secretary AFM Bahauddin Nasim, cultural affairs secretary Asaduzzaman Noor, Barisal City Corporation Mayor Showkat Hossain Hiron, former MP Haji Selim, Proshika chairman Kazi Faruque, and former president of Bangladesh Chhatra League Liakat Shikdar. The committee also recommended that a case filed with Shabagh police which alleged that Gono Forum leader Dr Kamal Hossain, Barrister Rokonuddin Mahmud, Barrister Tania Amir and Subrata Chowdhury had committed vandalism in the Supreme Court in December 2006 should be withdrawn. In reply to a question whether the three-hour meeting had been sufficient to deal properly with the huge caseload, the minister said, "We discuss the cases regularly, this meeting is the visible part of our work. All the cases are thoroughly investigated and the decisions are made so that no criminal can take the advantage of the process." Since the present government came to power, a total of 3562 'politically motivated' cases have so far been recommended for withdrawal, mostly against ruling party Awami League politicians and leaders. They include two cases against BNP politicians - senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman and former law minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed  while an application by BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu for withdrawal of a case was rejected. b
