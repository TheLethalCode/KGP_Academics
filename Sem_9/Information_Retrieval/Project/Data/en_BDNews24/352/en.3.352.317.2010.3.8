 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  Two suspected criminals were killed in gunfights with law enforcers in Dhaka and Kushtia early Monday. A suspected robber was killed in a gun battle with the Rapid Action Battalion at Jatrabari, on the outskirts of the capital and a suspected outlaw was killed in a gunfight with the police in Kushtia. Maj Kamruzzaman of RAB-10 said 35-year old Monir Hossain alias 'Kashai' (butcher) Monir was killed in the gunfight with a RAB patrol team. He told bdnews24.com that a gang was about to set off for a robbery at Sutikhalpara at around 1.00am, when a RAB team was patrolling the area. Sensing their presence, the robbers opened fire at RAB and the battalion retaliated, Zaman said. After about 15 minutes of exchanging gunfire, the criminals fled the scene. RAB found Monir's body on the spot and recovered one foreign pistol, one machete and three rounds of ammunition, the official said. In Kushtia, 30-year old Manjurul Islam alias Manju was the military commander of banned extremist organisation Ganabahini, said CA Halim, assistant police superintendent. A joint team of Kushita's police intelligence and Islamic University police carried out a drive at the sadar upazila's Piarpur village at around 4:30am on a tip-off that the radical activists were holding a secret meeting, Halim said. Sensing the presence of the law enforcers the criminals opened fire forcing the police to retaliate. At one stage of the 20-minute gun-battle, the criminals fled the scene, he said. The police found Manju's body on the spot. One light gun, five rounds of bullets and five bullet casings were also recovered, the police official said. The body was sent to Kushita General Hospital for autopsy. CA Halim said there were four cases, including two murder charges against Manju. bd
