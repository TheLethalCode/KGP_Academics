 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court asked authorities concerned to submit all relevant documents regarding 172 ships brought into Bangladesh for scrapping since Mar 17 2008. The bench of justices Md Iman Ali and Md Abu Tarique expressed concern over worker deaths caused by hazardous conditions during scrapping of ships. They said ship breakers are not following rules putting the environment and workers at risk. The court ordered the department of shipping to submit relevant documents, including no objection certificate, release note, detoxification certificate and letter of credit, within Mar 18. It also ordered the environment and forestry ministry to inform the court of the steps taken against ship-breaking in defiance of regulations within the date. The ministry was also ordered to empower the committee formed in February allowing it to monitor ship-breaking sites and take necessary steps. The High Court order came following a petition by Bangladesh Environmentalist Lawyers Association (BELA). The date for the next order has been set on Mar 18. The High Court on Mar 17, 2009 ordered that no ship can enter the country for scrapping unless it is detoxified before entering Bangladesh or at the source country. The petition said that 26 workers have died after the High Court order last year. Adv Iqbal Kabir Liton represented BELA, deputy attorney general Nazrul Islam Talukder represented the government and Adv Mizanur Rahman represented Ship-Breakers Association in the hearing.
