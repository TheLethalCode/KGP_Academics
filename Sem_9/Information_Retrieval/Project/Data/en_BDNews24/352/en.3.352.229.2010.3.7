<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  Name signs at Zia Uddyan were dismantled on Saturday night. The four-hour long demolition work started at 8pm. A cabinet meeting last month decided to rename 39 establishments across the country, in many cases restoring names previously given by the last Awami League government which had been changed by the subsequent BNP administration. An order by the cabinet division was issued two weeks ago to go ahead with the name changes. Zia International Airport has already been renamed Shahjalal International Airport. The list also contained the name of 'Zia Uddyan' which is to revert back to its old name 'Chandrima Uddyan'. Md Akash, one of the workers on the job Saturday night told bdnews24.com, "We are doing the work according to orders from a government contractor." However, despite 15-20 workers on the site, no contractors or security personnel could be seen. A number of police patrol vehicles were observed a little distance away. Abdul Khaleque, officer in charge of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station, told journalists that they came to the location after getting news that the signs were being dimantled. He also said that he had talked with the related executive engineer of the public works ministry. bdnew
