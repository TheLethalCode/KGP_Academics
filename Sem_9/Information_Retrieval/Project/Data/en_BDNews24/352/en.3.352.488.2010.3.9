 Dhaka, March 08 (bdnews24.com)  Deliberations by MPs on a thanksgiving motion for the president's new year address have taken up 30 hours and 21 minutes of parliamentary time between Jan 4 and Mar 4, and they have yet to conclude. The fourth session of parliament, which began on Jan 4, will go on until April 6, deputy speaker Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com on Monday. The decision was taken at a meeting of the business advisory committee. The committee also authorised speaker Abdul Hamid to change the date if necessary, Ali said. The discussion on the president's parliamentary address will end on March 11, said Ali. "The remaining days will be reserved for legislative affairs," he added. Much of the time spent in "discussion on the president's address" have involved long digressions by MPs, as seen on TV. Since the opposition BNP ended a 64-day boycott to rejoin the house on Feb 11, much time has also been spent in mud-slinging between the treasury and opposition benches. Things got so out of hand last week that the speaker threatened to resign. The business advisory committee, headed by the speaker, decides the tenure of each session of parliament. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina attended the eighth meeting of the ninth parliament's business advisory committee on Monday, which also decided that parliament would not sit between March 17-20 or March 25-28, during independence celebrations.
