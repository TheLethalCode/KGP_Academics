<TEXT>
 YANGON, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military government on Tuesday announced criteria for the formation of an election commission, one of five new laws enacted ahead of long-awaited polls that, until now, have been shrouded in secrecy. A date for the vote, the first in the former British colony for 20 years, has yet to be set. The junta plans to release details of other election laws, including who can take part among those governing, in coming days. The proposed election has been widely derided as a sham, with the military retaining key ministries and institutions and pulling the strings behind a civilian-fronted government. The regime announced late on Monday on state radio that five laws had been passed, without giving details. On Tuesday, official newspapers said a Union Election Commission of at least five people -- who must be "prominent and of good reputation" -- would be formed to oversee political parties and organise the vote. It would map out electoral constituencies and be given the power to annul polls in places where "natural disasters or security reasons" prevent the vote from being free and fair. ETHNIC RESISTANCE A retired civil servant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the clause meant the junta could scrap polls in regions where armed separatists, who have enjoyed de facto autonomy for more than 50 years, refused to take part. The regime wants ethnic groups to disarm, transfer their fighters to a government-run Border Guard Force (BGF) and join the political process. Of the 12 ethnic armies that agreed to ceasefire deals with the junta 20 years ago, half have said they will join the BGF. Those resisting are bigger groups, including the United Wa State Army, which has at least 30,000 troops. Exiled Myanmar activists say those who have rejected the junta's "offer" are braced for an offensive by government troops in rebel-held areas, mainly along the northern border with China. Many analysts believe the regime's failure to co-opt rebel groups is the reason for the delay in announcing a date for the election. Diplomats expect the vote to be held in October. The opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which won the 1990 election by a landslide but was denied the chance to govern, said the polls as planned could not be fair. The party, led by detained Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, has yet to decide if it will take part. "I don't think the elections will be free and fair if they are held this year because the political parties will not have enough time to prepare," said NLD spokesman Nyan Win. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon sent a letter to junta supremo Than Shwe late last month expressing concern about Myanmar's lack of progress on democratic reforms. Ban urged the reclusive leader to ensure the vote was "most credible, inclusive and transparent".
