 Dhaka, March 08 (bdnews24.com)The market saw huge losses Monday with the benchmark index of Dhaka stock exchange falling by 2 percent, as investors remained cautious over market interventions and the upcoming DSE election, some observers said. The general index or DGEN slumped 16 points or 2.07 percent from Sunday to end on 5486.43 points at the close of Monday. About 80 percent of the traded issues lost value. Experts said that investors were "nervous" over the frequent regulatory interventions as well as uncertainty over the prime bourse's board election. "General investors are quite nervous and uncertain due to regulatory moves," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. He agreed that the rumor of postponement of the DSE board elections added to the investor jitters. On Sunday, the DSE rescheduled the elections for March 21, which was earlier scheduled to be held March 3. The rescheduling followed a regulator directive making a 'no-objection' or 'clearance' from the SEC as mandatory before filing nominations. Meanwhile, brokers said that the market was witnessing a price correction. Ahmed Rashid Lali, a former senior vice president of the DSE, said that the market was not seeing any major fall. "Prices of those shares have come down, which got overpriced...the fall is due to price correction," he told the media Sunday. Some, however, disagreed, saying a price correction would not last so long. "Price correction can happen for a maximum two days but it's going on for a week," Yaweer Sayeed, the top official of AIMS of Bangladesh told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, brokerage house officials also said that their clients were being very skeptical on putting money on shares. "Most of our clients were kind of querying about prices...a very few of them were seen interested in buying," an official of brokerage firm Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Most of the retail investors were considering to exit from the market for the time being, he said, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Market participation has declined significantly as is evident from the falling turnover. Dhaka Stock Exchange's turnover dropped to Tk 7.45 billion on Monday from Tk 9.59 billion the previous day. Of the traded 236 issues, 187 lost, 47 gained and two remained unchanged. Banks, the market bellwether, continued to slide, joined by insurers, power and fuel shares which gained the previous day. The lone telecom issue, Grameenphone, also suffered a 4.06 percent decline in prices. Mutual funds also witnessed a huge slump, an impact of the regulator's disapproval of AIMS 1st mutual fund's dividends and issuance of right shares. On Feb 24, the fund announced 70 percent stock dividend and 130 percent right shares upon approval from the SEC. The market regulator on the same day halted the trading of the scrip in a bid to curtail abnormal price hike. The mutual fund resumed trading from Monday after its corporate declarations were rejected on Sunday. Lanka Bangla Finance came out as the turnover leader, followed by Bex Tex, Grameenphone, Beximco and Summit Power. Meanwhile, the Chittagong Stock Exchange also lost value. The benchmark selective categories index or the CSCX fell 2.10 percent or 223.93 points to close at 10,400 points. The port city bourse's turnover amounted to Tk 755.452 million
