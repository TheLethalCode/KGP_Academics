 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said her government was determined to establish gender equality with a new women's policy, as Bangladesh along with the rest of the world observed the 100th International Women's Day on Monday. "We want to eliminate discrimination between men and women," Hasina said in an address at a grand ceremony at Bangabandhu International Convention Centre. . "We want to build a modern Bangladesh by ensuring equal rights for all, and stopping violence against women," the prime minister said. In accordance with pledges towards emancipation of women, the government is set to declare a policy, largely based on the national women's policy formulated in 1997. It will go to the cabinet soon for approval, an official of the ministry for women and children's affairs said. The new policy has added a number of proposals including rehabilitation of destitute women, and those affected by disasters. They also include participation of disabled women in development activities. The prime minister also launched a postage stamp commemorating the day that is being marked worldwide this year with the theme "Equal rights, Equal Opportunities: Progress for All". State minister for women and children's affairs Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury presided over the morning's programme. Different women's and rights groups throughout the country were celebrating the day with a host of programmes including rallies, seminars, discussions and cultural functions. Women leaders and development activists began the day lighting candles at the Central Shaheed Minar premises at one minute past midnight. President Md Zillur Rahman and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia issued special messages on the occasion. In his message the president said that it is impossible to address the challenge of the 21st century without women in the age of globalisation. He asked all in society to work together for ensuring the rights of women. The opposition leader in her message said women's empowerment and their involvement with the mainstream development activities have made them confident. The day has been observed since 1910. A woman named Clara Zetkin, leader of the 'Women's Office' for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, tabled the idea of an International Women's Day at the International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen that year. She proposed that every year in every country there should be a celebration on the same day  a Women's Day  to press for equal rights. The conference of over 100 women from 17 countries, representing unions, socialist parties, working women's clubs, and including the first three women elected to the Finnish parliament, greeted Zetkin's suggestion with unanimous approval. bdne
