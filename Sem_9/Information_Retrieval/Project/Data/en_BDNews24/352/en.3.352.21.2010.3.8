<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Mar 08 (bdnews24.com)  Rapid Action Battalion on Monday arrested Mizanur Rahman Mithu, a fugitive in the Kibria murder case. A RAB-9 team, on a tip-off, detained the 22 year-old from his home at Barabazar of Nabiganj Upazila in Habiganj, an officer said. RAB-9 commander Sayed Anagh told reporters that Mithu, questioned after his arrest, confessed involvement in the murder. The suspect, however, was not allowed to appear before or talk to the newsmen. Former Awami League finance minister AMS Kibria and four others were killed and more than 70 people injured in a grenade attack in Habiganj on January 27 2005. Abdul Majid Khan, general secretary of AL's Habiganj district unit, filed two cases in connection with the incident. The case had been languishing for three years when it was taken up for further investigation in 2008, as per directives of the High Court. Former BNP state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar, Harkatul Jihad Islami leader Mufti Hannan and four other accused in the case are now behind the bars. bdnew
