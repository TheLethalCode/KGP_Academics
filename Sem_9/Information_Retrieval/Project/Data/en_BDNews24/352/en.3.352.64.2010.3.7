 Dhaka, Mar 07 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet purchase committee on Sunday selected a Singapore-based company to supply 25,000 MT of unboiled (Atap) rice, expected to arrive in April, aimed at lowering the market price of the staple. More rice will be imported later, food minister Abdur Razzaque said. Just days ago, Razzaque told a seminar on food security that Bangladesh was moving toward self-sufficiency in production of rice and other crops. "We have taken this decision to reduce the rice price. More rice will be imported later on," the minister told reporters Sunday after the purchase committee meeting. Concerning the amount of the rice to be imported, the minister said, "It is not fixed yet. But we have an offer of another 25,000 MT." The food ministry on Jan 25 invited tenders for import of 50,000 MT rice. Among the competing companies, Singapore-based Indo-Sino Trade Private Limited got permission to supply 25,000 MT rice to Bangladesh at a cost of Tk 68.73 crore. The price is $395 per tonne. Asked why Atap rice is being imported, Razzaque said, "Other kinds were not available." Food directorate chief Pius Costa told bdnews24.com the rice would arrive in a month. He said that more will be imported from Myanmar or Pakistan. bdnews
