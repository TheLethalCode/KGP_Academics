 Dhaka, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bad behaviour, among supposed role models, reared its head again Saturday as a Dhaka University department chair reportedly slapped a member of her own department during a confrontation. The incident involved Nahid Akhter, chair of the art history department under Dhaka University's fine arts faculty, and assistant professor Sheikh Monir Uddin. The vice chancellor was verbally informed of the incident by Sheikh Monir Uddin, university proctor KM Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com said. Sheikh Monir told bdnews24.com that the incident occurred during a confrontation between Akhter, himself and another colleague. "The department head put the room of Sabrina Shahnaj, a lecturer of the department, under lock and key 20 days ago. Sabrina Shahnaj informed the vice chancellor about this." "We visited the VC today over the matter again and upon return found the lock broken and the room ransacked by officials from the proctor's office." The duo went to the room of the department chair to inform her of the incident and got involved in a heated row. At one stage of the row, Nahid Akhter slapped Sheikh Monir, the latter said. Nahid Akhter could not be reached for a comment. The incident comes just days after MPs were censured by the media and the speaker of the house for bad behaviour in parliament, coming near to blows last week. The speaker called their behaviour "shameful for the nation". bdn
