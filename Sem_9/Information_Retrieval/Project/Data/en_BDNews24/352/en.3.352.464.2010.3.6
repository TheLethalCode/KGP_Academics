 Khagrachharhi, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  A team of the parliamentary standing committee on the Chittagong Hill Tracts affairs went to Khagrachharhi on Saturday, days after bloody clashes occurred between Bangali settlers and indigenous communities in the hill district. The team led by committee chairman Shah Alam MP reached Khagrachhari at around 10am. The delegation met at the Circuit House with top officials of Khagrachhari and Rangamati. The team is also scheduled to visit areas where the clashes took place and Rangamati's Baghaihat upazila. Clashes erupted between Bangali settlers and hill people over land dispute in Rangamati last month. Several villages were torched and two indigenous people killed during the time. A Bangali settler was killed in Khagrachhari on Feb 23 in the wake of Rangamati incident. The Parbatya Chhattagram Janasanhati Samiti has been demanding parliamentary probe into the incident. The organisation led by Santu Larma also blamed the military posted in the areas for the killings. bd
