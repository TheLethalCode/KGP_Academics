The spinner finished with six for 95 to dismiss Bangladesh A for 202. By close of play, the tourists reached 68-3 with Jonathan Trott batting on 32. Besides, Kevin Pietersen had another failure against left-arm spin. Since the opening one-day warm-up in Fatullah last month, the right-hander has made scores of 0, 6, 1, 18, 22. This time he was suckered by part-timer Mehrab Hossain Jr for two. Raqibul Hasan single-handedly held the home side together with a 165-ball 107 not out. Only three other batsmen -- opener Shamsur Rahman (21), opener Junaid Siddique (16) and wicketkeeper Sahagir Hossain Pavel (12) were able to reach double figures. While wickets kept falling around him, Raqibul brought up his half-century from 82 balls. Dropped for the recent Test series in New Zealand, the right-hander showcased his credentials with 15 fours and three sixes.
