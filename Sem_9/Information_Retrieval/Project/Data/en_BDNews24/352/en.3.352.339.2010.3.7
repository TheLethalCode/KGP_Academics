 MADRID, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael van der Vaart scored an injury-time winner as Real Madrid came back to beat Sevilla 3-2 and replace Barcelona at the top of La Liga on Saturday, after the champions were held 2-2 in Almeria. Sevilla took a two-goal lead at the Bernabeu with an own-goal from Xabi Alonso and an Ivica Dragutinovic freekick early in the second half. Real stormed back, netting twice in four minutes through Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos and the winner came when Van der Vaart scrambled the ball home in added time. Barca twice came from behind to draw with Almeria thanks to a double strike from Lionel Messi, the second coming after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had been sent off in the 61st minute. Real climbed into first place, level on 62 points with their arch-rivals, but with a superior goal difference. Deportivo Coruna climbed to fifth on 41 points with a 3-1 comeback victory at home to lowly Tenerife thanks to goals from Juan Rodriguez, Andres Guardado and Diego Colotto. The islanders have earned two points on their travels all season and have shipped 12 goals in their last three outings
