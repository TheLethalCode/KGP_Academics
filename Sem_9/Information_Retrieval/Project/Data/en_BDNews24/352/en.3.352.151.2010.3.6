<TITLE> Teacher shortage plagues Barguna school </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Monir Hossain Kamal bdnews24.com correspondent Barguna Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)Shohag is a fifth grader at a rural primary school in southern Barguna district. Although he's dreaming of going to high school next year, Shohag is almost certain his dream won't come true because he won't be able to finish his primary school syllabus. Kushum Koli, Shohag's class-mate at the Atharogachhia Primary School under Amtali sub-district in Barguna, said they seldom receive all their scheduled classes. In fact, most of the 175 students run around noisily and play during most of the school day. That should not be surprising given that the school has just one teacher for 87 students. Between the headmaster and an assistant teacher, the two-member faculty is supposed to give 30 lessons a day. Headmaster Akhteruzzaman Khan said although the school is supposed to hold 30 classes every day in two shifts, it is humanly impossible for two teachers to do the job. "As the headmaster, I also have administrative things to look after," he said. Khan said he had to go to the sub-district headquarters for official reasons at least three times a week. Abdul Khalek, the assistant teacher, said that when the two of them do manage to give classes, which is two at a time, the rest of the students run around and make a lot of noise. "Then we have to round them up and make them sit for a class." According to the official records, the school is supposed to have three teachers. One of them, assistant teacher Mizanur Rahman, has remained absent for over two years, since November 11, 2007. The other primary school is about nine kilometres away and not a viable option for the little kids to travel that distance. Guardians also pointed that the schools in Amtali, which is 20 kilometre away, have enough teachers. "But unfortunately our school is plagued by teacher shortage causing our kids to fall way behind," said Dalia Akhter, mother of a student at the Atharogachhia Primary School. Jalal Uddin Hawladar, a member of the school management committee, said the school was not getting more teachers despite their repeated efforts. The sub-district acting education officer, Lutfar Rahman, said there was a shortage of teachers in the area but this school's problem would be specifically discussed at the next meeting of the education committee. b
