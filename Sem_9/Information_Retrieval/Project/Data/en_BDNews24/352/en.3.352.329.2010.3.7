<TITLE> Speaker should have been firmer, sooner: Farrouque </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque complained on Saturday that the speaker was slow to take a firm hand in the house, and should have taken the step of turning MPs' mikes off during unparliamentary comments, as he has now warned, much earlier. MPs on Mar 3 came near to blows in parliament following insulting comments from both sides over the founders of the ruling Awami League party and main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The lawmakers' antics received wide coverage and censure in the media. Speaker Abdu Hamid the following day blasted members of both the treasury and opposition benches, terming their behaviour "shameful for the nation". Hamid also said any MP to use derogatory language in the house would have their mike turned off from now. MPs of both benches welcomed the speaker's tough line and several vowed "not to use insulting language" about national leaders on either side of the political divide. However, Farrouque, at a discussion session at Chittagong Press Club on Saturday, said: "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina initiated the trend in this parliament of making derogatory remarks about late leaders." Farrouque reiterated the opposition's previously aired doubts over the speaker's neutrality and sincerity for not taking the matter in hand then, instead issuing the ruling that "mikes would be turned off " many days later. Questioning the neutrality of the ruling itself, Farrouque said: "The speaker has issued the ruling now only to stop opposition members from saying 'true' things about Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in retaliation to derogatory speeches by ruling party members." "If the speaker had shut off Sheikh Hasina's microphone when she talked against the dead body of the 'declarer of independence', the late president Ziaur Rahman, then things would not have gone this far," Farroque said with a dig in connection with the so-called 'declarer of independence'. While the opposition maintains that Zia, BNP's founder, was the 'declarer of independence', the government has ruled that it was in fact AL founder and the country's founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who officially declared Bangladesh an independent nation. The opposition whip also mentioned he had been elected to parliament five times. "Who is the speaker to teach me the parliamentary code of conduct after all these years?" he asked. bdnew
