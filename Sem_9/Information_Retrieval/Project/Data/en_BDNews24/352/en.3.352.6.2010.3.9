<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has given CID police 10 days to question suspect Sohel Rana in connection with last year's bomb attack against Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh MP. The young MP, related to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, came under attack last October when a bomb was thrown at his car as he was leaving his Motijheel office. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. Second additional chief metropolitan magistrate Abu Zafar Md Kamruzzaman made the order on Tuesday following a remand prayer by assistant commissioner of police Akbar Hossain, the investigation officer in the case. Rana was initially arrested in Chittagong on Feb 22, on charges of threatening Taposh over the mobile phone. He was later shown arrested in connection with the car bomb case. At the time, Taposh had been a member of the government's legal team challenging the appeals of those accused of killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, , Bangladesh's founding president and father of the incumbent prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Police have so far arrested seven people in connection with the bomb attack on Taposh. Of them, five are related to men convicted of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Taposh's father was also killed alongside Sheikh Mujib. The men arrested in the case so far are: Kamrul Haque Swapon, brother of Shariful Haque Dalim; Menhaz Rashid, daughter of Col Rashid; Ataul Huda, brother of Bazlul Huda and Nazmul Hassan and Mahbubul Hassan Imran, sons of Lt Col Mohiuddin; and Freedom Party leaders Shafiuddin Safu and Abdur Rahim. The recording officer Md Abdul Haque said on Tuesday that the court had also asked for submission of the investigation report by April 29. bdn
