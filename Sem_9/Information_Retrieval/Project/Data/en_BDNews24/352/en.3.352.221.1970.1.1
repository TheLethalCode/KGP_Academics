<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Tuesday quashed proceedings in the MiG-29 corruption case against Sheikh Hasina. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin gave the ruling on a 2008 petition by Hasina challenging the case proceedings against her. The former Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the predecessor of the current Anticorruption Commission, filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 11 2001. It accused Sheikh Hasina and six others of incurring financial losses to the state of $129 million in the purchase of eight Russian MiG-29 warplanes during her previous term as prime minister. Charges were framed against Hasina and the others during the regime of the immediate past caretaker government. The High Court stayed the case on Sep 18 2008 following submission of Hasina's petition. The court in its ruling Tuesday said the former Bureau of Anti-Corruption filed the case "under the influence of the then BNP-led four party alliance government to tarnish her image". The High Court judged that there was no legal validity to the case against the prime minister. bdn
