 Madaripur, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  Truck drivers along the Dhaka-Barisal highway blocked the route for two hours on Tuesday after clashes with Ansars at Kawrakandi ferry terminal, over "tolls for serial numbers". They lifted the blockade at around 11:30am after police detained four members of the Ansars, a rural security force of voluntary recruits. Asadul Islam, a sub-inspector of highway police, said the incident occurred at around 9:30am when the Ansars confronted the truck drivers over serial numbers for boarding the ferries. The confrontation turned into a scuffle. Two truck drivers, Enayet Hossain and Kamrul Hossain, were injured and admitted to Shibchar upazila health complex. The drivers blocked the highway protesting the incident. Enayet told reporters that the Ansars demanded 'tolls' of Tk 300 from the truck drivers on the pretext of assuring them an advance serial number. "As we refused to give them the money they assaulted us and damaged our trucks," he said. The drivers submitted a written complaint to Shibchar Police Station. Islam of the highway police said they detained the four Ansar members to bring the situation under control. They were being quizzed, he said, adding that if the Ansars were found guilty police would recommend their withdrawal from the ferry terminal. bdn
