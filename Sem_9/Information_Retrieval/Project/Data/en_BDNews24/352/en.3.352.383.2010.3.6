 Kurigram, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government's new national service job scheme will create job opportunities for over 700,000 unemployed youngsters. "The government has launched this programme in accordance with our election pledge to create job opportunities for every family," the prime minister said at the inauguration of the scheme at Kurigram Government College on Saturday. "The journey is starting from the neglected and famine-stricken Kurigram." "Eventually, job opportunities for 720,000 unemployed will be created all over the country through this programme," Hasina said. She said her Awami League government was upholding its pre-poll pledges. "The target is to ensure food and social security for everyone." She said training will be given to 9,950 youths at Kurigram under the primary phase of the job scheme. They will be given a daily allowance of Tk 100 during the three-month training. On completion, they will be paid Tk 200 a day over a period of two years. "Through this, 39,950 youths of the district will be employed in steps. After two years they will also be able to help other unemployed youths to gain a footing," said the prime minister. Kurigram was chosen in the first phase being one of the most "neglected areas" in the country. The prime minister said, "There are few employment opportunities here. The area is often famine stricken." She said her government will not allow famine to affect the area in the future. Talking about various steps taken by the government to support farmers and boost farm output aiming at food autarky, Hasina said fertiliser price was lowered to Tk 22 from Tk 90 per kilogramme in three steps following her government coming to power at the start of 2009. Steps have also been taken help farmers to open bank accounts with just Tk 10 to receive direct diesel subsidies. She also mentioned her government's measures to ensure affordable rice to low-earning members of society. "Price of rice was lowered to Tk 18 per kilogramme initially from the Tk 45 mark when we formed the government. But it was later increased to Tk 22 to ensure that farmers get their rightful price." "The government has diverted power supply in urban areas to rural areas to give power to farmers," she added. Hasina also complained that the country was suffering a power crisis now due to "corruption and looting" of the past BNP-led government. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, state minister for land Mustafizur Rahman, youth and sports state minister Ahad Ali Sarker, state minister for primary education Mohammad Motahar also spoke at the inauguration of the national service job scheme. bdn
