 Dhaka, Mar 07 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury on Sunday said parliament is no more a place where people's demands can be placed. "Discussions on only dead people are held there, not on any living persons," he said, referring to recent heated exchanges over the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman. "People's interests cannot be placed there  Our national parliament has been turned into a permanent graveyard," said Qader, an MP from Chittagong and a BNP standing committee member. MPs on both sides of the house last week came near to blows over the most recent bout of derogatory comments, this time aimed against Sheikh Mujib, Bangladesh's founding president and the current prime minister's father, as well as former president Zia who founded the main opposition BNP. Another BNP standing committee member, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, said Sunday that the ruling Grand Alliance government is going the same way as the "illegal" interim government did. "The present government is working against BNP just like the interim government was," he said. Mirza Abbas, also a standing committee member, agreed. "The conspirators of 1/11 are even now seen sitting in the front row seats in various official programmes." "They are still scheming against us," Abbas added. Mosharraf Hossain also slammed the ruling party for "wiping out Zia's name". "The Awami League government is removing Zia's name from all the establishments only because they are afraid of his fame." "But his political principles cannot be removed from the hearts of the people of Bangladesh in this way," he said. He expressed hope that Tarique Rahman, BNP chief Khaleda Zia's elder son, currently residing in the UK, would take up the leadership of both BNP and the country "as soon as he returns home". The top-ranking BNP leaders were speaking at a programme held to observe the third anniversary of Tarique's jailing by the interim government. bdn
