<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 08 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition chief Khaleda Zia on Monday accused the Awami League-led coalition government of backing harassment and torture of women across the country. "This government always talks about empowering women. But, on contrary, women are being tortured at the very hands of activists of the pro-government Awami Juba League and Bangladesh Chhatra League," she said. In a recent incident, Bangladesh Chhatra League activists reportedly verbally abused and then beat up a young girl and her companions on Dhaka University campus on Feb 21 as they were returning after placing flowers at the Central Shaheed Minar. Four days later, DU authorities suspended five BCL students for their involvement in the violence. "The government, despite being concerned about such incidents, is playing a silent role," Khaleda said. The leader of the opposition was speaking at a discussion organised by BNP to mark the 100th International Women's Day on Monday. "The government has no control over its activists. We hope the government will work for the welfare of its people rather than just spewing speeches," she said. Leading women and diplomats were among those present at the programme. bdn
