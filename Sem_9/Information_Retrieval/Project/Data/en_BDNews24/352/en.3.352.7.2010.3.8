We should emphasise field education as well as academic," the president said at the first convocation of the Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology at Gazipur. He urged all the universities of engineering and technology to become research centres and create manpower skilled in technology. "Students should be trained so that they can realise and identify the crises of our national lives and pave the ways for their solution," Rahman said.
