 Dinajpur, Mar 06 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman and former president HM Ershad claimed on Saturday that the country looked to him as the only acceptable national leader left in Bangladesh after the passing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman. "Ershad is an innocent man. He has no stain of blood on his hands. Both Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujibur) and Zia are dead. So the 16 crore people of Bangladesh now looking to Ershad," said the former military dictator, who is now a member of the Awami League-led Grand Alliance government. Ershad, addressing a Jatiya Party convention in Dinajpur, also slammed the ruling Awami League for the prevailing troubles in parliament. "I am called a dictator. But what kind of democracy is this that we are witnessing in parliament? This cannot be an example of a democratic and civilised country," Ershad said referring to a recent "shameful" incident in parliament. MPs of both the ruling Awami League and the main opposition BNP locked into disputes on Mar 4 over remarks about Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman and at one stage charged threateningly towards each other. The speaker called the incident "shameful" for the nation. He said the government will never be able to achieve its 'Vision 2021' goals without his cooperation. Ershad issued a caution to prime minister and AL chief Shiekh Hasina, saying, "You know what is going on in the Grand Alliance. So, be alert before the time expires, control your party. Otherwise, the people will be compelled to go for other options." He, however, did not specify what the "other options" would be. Last month, on Feb 13, Ershad had said "no other party will be able to come to power until 2021 if the Grand Alliance sticks together." But on Saturday, he complained of JP's treatment under the Grand Alliance government. "JP garnered 60 lakh and 96 thousand votes for AL in the last national polls whereas we gained only 15 lakh and 37 thousand votes from traditional AL supporters in 29 constituencies," Ershad said without referring to any specific source in support of this claim. "What we've got in return is only harassment. We do not want rice or wealth, we want honour," Ershad said. Ershad later declared a new committee of the Dinajpur unit declaring Delwar Hossain as its president and Ahmed Shafi Rubel, the secretary. bdn
