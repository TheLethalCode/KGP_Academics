<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dark drama "Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire" earned two Oscars on Sunday, including supporting actress for Mo'Nique, as Hollywood's top film honours reached their mid-point. "Precious" also claimed best adapted screenplay, but elsewhere the awards were split among several movies, including family film "Up" for best animated movie. Christoph Waltz won supporting actor in "Inglourious Basterds." Mark Boal took original screenplay for Iraq war film "The Hurt Locker," which could foretell of more awards to come as it competes for best film against "Avatar" and a possible history-making Academy Award for Kathryn Bigelow as best director. But the night's early awards belonged to "Precious" and Mo'Nique, who departed from her usual role as a comedian to claim the role as an abusive mother in the urban drama about a young woman overcoming huge odds to better her life. "I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics," she said with emotion as she took the stage. Indeed, the actress had made headlines for not taking an active a role in the many campaign-style Hollywood events and speeches in which many performers participate in order to win one of the world's top movie honours. Christoph Waltz claimed best supporting actor for his turn as a menacing Nazi officer in revenge fantasy "Inglourious Basterds," which follows a band of American Jews killing their enemies behind lines during World War Two. OSCAR LOOKS "UP" "Up," about an old man who ties balloons to his house and floats off on an adventure with a young boy, has been among the year's best-reviewed movies and director Pete Docter thanked his colleagues and the Disney-Pixar studio that cranked out his movie in a long line of animation hits. "Never did I dream that making a flip book out of my 3rd-grade math book would lead to this," he joked. Both Waltz and "Up" were widely expected to win in their respective categories. Similarly writer Mark Boal was favoured to take home best original screenplay with "The Hurt Locker." Oscar organizers promised a fast-paced show with lots of laughs supplied by co-hosts Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, and early on, the pair did not disappoint. After an opening musical number by Neil Patrick Harris that harkened back to Hollywood's golden era with showgirls and men in tuxedos and tails, Baldwin and Martin put on a stand-up routine picking out stars in the audience. "There's that damn Helen Mirren," Martin said. "No Steve, that's Dame Helen Mirren," Baldwin came back. Comic actor Ben Stiller also grabbed many laughs when he donned blue makeup and spoke in the native tongue of the otherworldly characters of "Avatar." Ahead of the world's biggest film awards, Hollywood's leading ladies dazzled fans on Oscar's red carpet, shunning black gowns for metallics, colours and dashes of sparkles. Among them, Sandra Bullock chose a shimmering silver gown. The actress, dubbed "America's Sweetheart" by the media, is favoured to earn her first Academy Award for best actress as a strong-minded mom in "The Blind Side." If Bullock fails, pundits say the likely winner is veteran Meryl Streep as trailblazing chef Julia Child in the culinary comedy "Julie & Julia." It would be Streep's third Oscar -- just one victory short of legendary Katharine Hepburn, who had four Oscars in her lifetime, more than any man or woman. Jeff Bridges seems a lock for best actor as a drunken singer in "Crazy Heart." But by the time it is over, Hollywood's biggest night may belong to "Hurt Locker" director Bigelow. She is nominated for best director against her ex-husband Cameron, and if Bigelow wins as expected, she will make history as the first woman to win that award in the 82 years of the Academy Awar
