 CANBERRA, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia awarded Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono its highest civilian honour on Tuesday ahead of thorny negotiations on border security and a free trade pact now dragging for more than three years. "President Yudhoyono is a true friend of Australia. President Yudhoyono has also been a champion of democracy and of economic development for the people of Indonesia," Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said announcing the Order of Australia award for the former general.

Rudd is strongly tipped to win a second term, but conservatives have been making strong inroads into his once-stellar popularity in opinion surveys, helped in part by voter division over a softening of border protection rules. Both Indonesia and Australia are members of the Group of 20 major economies and both countries in 2007 began talks on a free trade deal aimed in part at boosting Australian-dominated investment worth A$4.5 billion in 2008. "When you're neighbours, when you are close together, there'll always be issues. The strength is how you deal with those issues," Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith s
