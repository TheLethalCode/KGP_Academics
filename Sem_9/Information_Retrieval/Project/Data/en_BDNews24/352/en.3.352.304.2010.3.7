 KHARTOUM, March 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian footballer Endurance Idahor died after collapsing during a game in Khartoum on Saturday, football association officials said. Idahor, 25, who played for Sudan's Al-Merreikh club, clashed with another player minutes after the start of the match, an official from the Sudan's Football Association told Reuters. "It was a normal incident of obstruction," said the official who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. "He fell over and now he has passed away. It is a huge shock to Sudan's whole sporting family." The official said Idahor collapsed during a game with Sudan Premier League rivals Al-Amal, held at Al-Merreikh's stadium in the Khartoum suburb of Omdurman
