 Khagrachharhi, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com) -- A parliamentary team visiting the hill tracts on Saturday, two weeks after bloody clashes occurred between Bangali settlers and indigenous communities in the region, vowed action would be taken against the guilty. The team of the standing committee on CHT affairs led by its chairman Shah Alam MP met at Khagrachhari Circuit House with top officials of Khagrachharhi and neighbouring Rangamati district. The team later visited the Gangaram Mukh area of Baghaichhari upazila in Rangamati, where several indigenous villages were torched last month. They spoke with the victims and assured them of enhanced assistance. Later they also met with the Bangali settlers and heard their complaints. The team assured both groups that those responsible for the clashes would be brought to justice. They returned to Khagrachhari from Rangamati after midday. Clashes erupted between the two communities in Baghaichhari in Rangamati last month over land disputes. Entire villages were torched and two indigenous people were killed in the violence on Feb 19-20. Within days, the violence spread to neighbouring Khagrachhari where a Bangali settler was killed in the district town during similar clashes on Feb 23. Both areas came under a clampdown as district authorities imposed restrictions on public gatherings. A curfew was also imposed for three successive nights at Khagrachhari district town. The Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) has been demanding a parliamentary probe into the incident. The organisation, an indigenous political group, also blamed the military posted in the areas for the killings of the two tribals at Gangaram Mukh. bd
