 Barisal, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  Water transport workers of the southern district of Barisal have enforced an indefinite strike from Sunday morning protesting against removal of three fellow workers. Launch and ferry movement along 18 routes of the area was suspended starting from 6am due to the strike called by Barisal Launch Labourers Association. The strikers told bdnews24.com that three workers of the launch MV Chandradwip, Nazrul Islam, Md Sadek and Zakir Hossain, were suspended on Feb 24 following a confrontation with the vessel's owner Md Panna. Sadek and Zakir were allowed to return to work after they apologised to the owner, but Nazrul's suspension order was not withdrawn, said fellow workers. The association president, Shah Alam, told bdnews24.com that they had held several meetings with the owner's representatives but there was no positive outcome. Joint secretary Ekin Ali said other workers pled Nazrul's case to the owner but to no avail. Owner Panna could not be reached for comment. Alam said they would continue their strike until they secured a satisfactory outcome. Abu Saleh Quaiyum, an official of Barisal river port, said that they were holding talks with both groups. He said he hoped the workers would withdraw their strike soon. bdnews24
