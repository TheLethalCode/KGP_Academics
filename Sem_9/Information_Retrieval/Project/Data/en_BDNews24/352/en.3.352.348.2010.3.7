<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 06 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles and India's Border Security Force are set to hold five-day long director general-level talks in Delhi starting Sunday. The two border forces will meet in the wake of several border fire incidents sparked by BSF intrusion into Bangladesh territory over a land dispute at the Jaintapur border in Sylhet in the past one month. BDR chief Maj Gen Md Mainul Islam told bdnews24.com Saturday that the recent border troubles at Sylhet would get top priority in the talks. "We will request [BSF] to address the issue such that it does not create obstructions while the premiers of both countries are working for mutual development programmes," he said. A 19-member team of the Bangladeshi border force, led by Gen Mainul, will leave for India on Sunday. The BDR, in a statement, said the Bangladesh agenda includes BSF's sorties into Bangladesh territory, "incessant firing" on Bangladeshi citizens and capture of Bangladeshi citizens without any cause. Talks will also be held on mutual interests like formulating a joint border management policy to prevent smuggling of fertilisers, illegal arms and drugs. BSF is likely to put stress on preventing cross-border crimes and illegal migration by Bangladeshi citizens, the BDR said. The two sides will also discuss infrastructure on the Bangladesh side, including roads and barbed wire fences, which fall within 450 feet of the borderline, the statement added. bd
