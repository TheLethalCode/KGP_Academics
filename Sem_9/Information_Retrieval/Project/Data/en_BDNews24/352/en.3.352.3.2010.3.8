 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will give a ruling Tuesday on a petition by prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging legality of framing charges in the MiG-29 graft case against her. The date was fixed Monday by the bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin following the final hearing on the petition. The former anticorruption bureau, now known as the Anticorruption Commission, filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 11 2001, accusing Sheikh Hasina and six others of incurring financial losses to the state of $129 million. Charges were framed against Sheikh Hasina and others during the regime of the immediate past caretaker government. The High Court stayed the case on Sep 18 2008 following Sheikh Hasina's petition challenging the framing of charges. Barristers Rafique-ul-Haque and Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh stood for the accused in Monday's hearing and Adv Abdul Aziz Khan represented the anticorruption bureau. b
