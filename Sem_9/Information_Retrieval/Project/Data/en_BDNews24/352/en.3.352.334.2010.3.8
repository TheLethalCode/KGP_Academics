In between his goals, Everton striker Ayegbeni Yakubu had a penalty saved by Boaz Myhill and 19-year-old Tom Cairney briefly put Hull level with a well-struck 20-metre shot. Arteta, growing in confidence with each minute of his comeback, had a moral claim for a hat-trick when Everton went 3-1 up six minutes into the second half but his cross-shot went in off Richard Garcia for an own goal. On-loan American striker Landon Donovan marked what could be his last game for the club with Everton's fourth after 82 minutes then set up Jack Rodwell for the fifth soon after.
