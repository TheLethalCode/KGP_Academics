 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)A UK charity that has been warning of unsafe conditions in Bangladeshi factories for years is appealing to British Bangladeshi business leaders for cash following a recent fire that killed over 20 garment workers, to help prevent further tragedies. The call from War on Want follows the deaths of 21 workers and injuries to 50 others amid claims that emergency exits were locked and fire fighting equipment useless at the factory in Gazipur, 30 miles from the capital Dhaka. Four years ago the charity's report on workers making clothes in Dhaka for British superstores, including Primark, Tesco and Asda, revealed that emergency exits at their factories were often locked. The 2006 report came after a spate of garment factory collapses and fires left almost 100 workers dead and many more injured. A War on Want spokesperson told bdnews24.com that the charity hopes UK-based Bangladeshi business chiefs will donate money to train garment workers in their rights to safety, a living wage, decent hours, humane treatment and the freedom to join or form trade unions. They are expected to raise at least 10,000 initially and would like to get more Bangladeshi diaspora involved. Under the Ethical Trading Initiative, top British high street fashion retailers have signed up to a code of conduct which commits them to ensure their suppliers uphold workers rights. But the charity's 2006 research showed garment workers toiling up to 80 hours a week for as little as 5p an hour  far less than a living wage - in potential deathtrap factories supplying major British chain stores and supermarkets. Two years later War on Want found workers in the same six factories faced deeper poverty amid soaring food and fuel costs and earned as little as 7p an hour for up to 80-hour weeks, still well below a living wage. In December last year, the charity revealed that workers in a seventh Dhaka factory, supplying Primark, toiled up to 84 hours a week and earned as little as 19 a month - less than half a living wage. War on Want's partner in Bangladesh, the National Garment Workers Federation, played a big part in winning a 12-year fight for a rise in the minimum wage from 7 a month to 12 a month. It has also secured vital employment rights, such as 16 weeks' maternity leave for mothers and deadlines for factory bosses to pay workers their wages. Now War on Want is seeking donations for the federation to boost its support for workers. Unlike many appeals where charities need to meet their own costs, all of the money will go to aid the workers. Stefanie Pfeil, fundraising director at War on Want, said: "The latest garment factory disaster in Bangladesh underlines that workers must know their rights to decent conditions, such as safety and a living wage. "If 20 Bengali business leaders each gives 500, our partner will provide the advice that can save lives and improve the livelihoods of many workers. Already, one family trust has contributed. Now we urge other Bangladeshis to help."
