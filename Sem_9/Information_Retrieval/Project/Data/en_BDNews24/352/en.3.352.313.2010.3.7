 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League and its associated organisations are observing historic March 7, the day in 1971 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman asked the Bangali nation to prepare for secession from Pakistan. "Ebarer Sangram Muktir Sangram, Ebarer Sangram Swadhinatar Sangram (This time the struggle is for our emancipation, this time the struggle is for liberation)," he told a mammoth rally at the Suhrawardy Uddyan. Mujib's stirring March 7 speech overwhelmed the Bangali nation and inspired them to launch the 9-month long liberation struggle against the Pakistani rulers. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina began the day by laying wreath the portrait of Sheikh Mujib at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi along with her cabinet members and party colleagues at around 7:30am. National and party flags were also hoisted at the Bangabandhu Museum and all AL offices across the country to mark the day. The party has arranged a discussion session at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre from 3pm. The associated organisations also took up many programmes marking the day. bd
