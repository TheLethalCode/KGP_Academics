<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Monday granted the CID four days to question JMB's central committee member Salahuddin (a.k.a Salehin) in connection with the attempted murder of author Humayun Azad. Investigating officer, Mohammed Ali Hossain, asked for seven days to question two accused in the case, Salehin and another JMB Shura member Hafej Mahmud (a.k.a Rakib Hasan, a.k.a Rasel). Dhaka's additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Ali Hossain allowed four days to question Salehin following the remand hearing. The remand hearing of Hafej was set on Mar 22 as he could not be brought to court from Bagerhat prison. The remand petition said that primary evidences of Salehin's involvement in the attempted murder were found. Another JMB Shura member Mijanur Rahman Minhaj (a.k.a Sharif, a.k.a Shaon), one of the main accused in the case, told his name during remand at the prison gate. The same court on Dec 24 allowed questioning of Minhaj, who is imprisoned in Comilla. The court's additional public prosecutor Md Saiful Islam Helal and the plaintiff's personal lawyer Ayat Ali Patwari confirmed the remand order. Azad's brother Manjur Kabir filed a petition to re-open investigations into the case saying that the previous investigation officer, CID inspector Kazi Abdul Malek, had failed to properly identify the accused in the case last year. Humayun Azad, while alive, had said that after the publication of his book 'Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad' he had received many threats. The late professor of Dhaka University's Bangla department was attacked in front of Bangla Academy while he was on his way back home from 'Ekushey Boi Mela' on Feb 27, 2004. After he recovered, Azad was sent to Germany where he died on the night of Aug 11, 2004, the day he reached Germany, the petitioner added. Kabir had filed two cases against unknown people with Ramna Police Station the day after he was attacked by criminals. On Nov 14, 2007, CID inspector Malek pressed charges against Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh kingpin Shaokh Abdur Rahman, top leaders Ataur Rahman Sunny, Noor Mohammad Sabu (aka Shamim), Minhaj (aka Shafiq, aka Shaon, aka Hamim and Anwar Alam (aka Khoka, aka Bhagne Shahid). The IO later appealed for dropping Shaokh Abdur Rahman and Sunny off the chargesheet as they were executed in another case.
