<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka will host a regional climate change conference in May, with assistance from the European Union, state minister for environment Hasan Mahmud said Tuesday. However, the exact date of the conference has not yet been fixed. Mahmud said ambassadors of EU countries made the proposal of assistance to Bangladesh during a meeting at the state guest house Meghna. "The European Union will assist in organising a regional conference in Dhaka as a part of its initiative for countries at high risk due to climate change." The EU ambassadors said that a regional conference in Dhaka of the high risk small nations will play an important role for Bangladesh's preparation for the next UN climate change conference, or 16th Conference of Parties (COP 16), to be held at Mexico later this year. The meeting at Meghna was attended by EU ambassador Stefan Frowein, French, British, German, Dutch, Danish, Italian, Spanish and Norwegian envoys and DFID's country representative Chris Austin, among others. bdnew
