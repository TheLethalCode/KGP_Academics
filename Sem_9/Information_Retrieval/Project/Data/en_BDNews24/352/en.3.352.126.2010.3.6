<TITLE> Dispute over mosque construction in Natore </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Natore, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  Senior rail authorities and locals at Natore have locked in a dispute over construction of a Mosque on railway property. The authorities complained that locals, without proper approval, are constructing the mosque with dishonest intentions by grabbing railway property worth Tk 20 lakh. Locals, however, countered that permission for constructing a mosque is unnecessary. Work of a multi-storied building named 'Station Mosque' on the northern side of the railway station started in mid-February. The building's lower part, covering an approximate area of seven and half thousand square metres, has already been finished. AKM Mahbubul Alam, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) of Pakshi and general manager of western zone ordered the work to stop. Railway officials said two railway employees-- station's ticket collector Younus Ali and security official Khrshed Alam-- have sided with the locals. Younus Ali told bdnews24.com, "Every station has a mosque. One is being built here funded by contributions of rail officials and local businessmen. There is no scope for dispute here." He also claimed that even though approval was not taken from senior authorities, they have been informed of the construction before. A businessman told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity, "Many people have grabbed railway property. We are building a mosque. Believers of Islam are supposed to build mosques." Dewan Nizam Uddin, the station master, said that he joined a few days back and does not know about the matter. However, DRM Mahbubul Alam claimed that railway property is being grabbed using the excuse of the mosque, saying, "Some opportunists are trying to grab the property. They are trying to make money by renting excess areas grabbed in the name of the mosque." He also pointed out that future expansion of the station will also be hampered due to the mosque's construction. Alam said "Police have ordered to halt the work. If they continue work defying the order, legal steps will be taken." Chobir Uddin, a religious scholar, said that Islam does not allow construction of mosque by force. bdnews
