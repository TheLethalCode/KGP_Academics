 BERLIN, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juergen Klinsmann said he was looking forward to getting back into coaching and optimistic about the right offer coming along after this year's World Cup. The former Germany coach, who will work as a TV analyst for Germany's RTL network in South Africa, told reporters on Friday he was prepared to wait for the right opportunity.

"There'll be plenty of time for the team to prepare for the World Cup. Right now a lot of players are caught up in the Bundesliga and Champions League end-run stress."
