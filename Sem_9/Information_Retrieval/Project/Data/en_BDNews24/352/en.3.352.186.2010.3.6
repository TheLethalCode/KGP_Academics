<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 06 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles and India's Border Security Force are set to hold five-day long director general-level talks in Delhi starting Sunday, with intrusion by Indian border guards to top the agenda, the BDR chief has said. The two border forces will meet in the wake of several border fire incidents between BDR and BSF over a land dispute at the Jaintapur border in Sylhet in the past one month. BDR chief Maj Gen Md Mainul Islam told bdnews24.com Saturday that the recent border troubles at Sylhet centring on BSF intrusion across the border would get maximum priority in the talks. "We will request [BSF] to address the issue such that it does not create obstructions while the premiers of both countries are working for mutual development programmes," he said. A 19-member team of the Bangladeshi border force, led by Gen Mainul, will leave for India on Sunday. The BDR, in a statement, said the Bangladesh agenda includes BSF's sorties into Bangladesh territory, "incessant firing" on Bangladeshi citizens and capture of Bangladeshi citizens without any cause. Talks will also be held on mutual interests like formulating a joint border management policy to prevent smuggling of illegal arms, fertilisers, and various drugs. BSF, in line with its agenda, is likely to put stress on cross-border crimes and illegal migration by Bangladeshi citizens, the border force chief said. The two sides will also discuss infrastructure on the Bangladesh side, including roads and barbed wire fences, which fall within 450 feet of the borderline, the BDR statement added. bd
