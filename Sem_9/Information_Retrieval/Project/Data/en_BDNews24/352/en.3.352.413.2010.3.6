<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com) Eleven international banks are aiming to lend $2 billion to some of the poorest communities around the world outside the reach of traditional banking services. The Global Alliance for Banking on Values, an independent network of those banks, aim to kick off the initiative by launching a $250 million fund themselves for pro-poor programmes and 'green businesses'. Bangladesh's BRAC Bank is one of the founding members of the alliance, which was set up in March 2009. The alliance first made the commitment to raise the $250 million fund in September 2009. It reiterated the pledge at a seminar at Brac Inn on Saturday. "Raising this money will result in $2 billion in new lending, at a time when credit continues to be scarce," Peter Blom, chair of GABV and CEO of Triodos Bank of the Netherlands, told the seminar through a video message. "We need to raise more money and invest in the sustainable bankers of the future so we can use it to its full potential. "And we want to promote sustainable banking models that can deal with long-term social and environmental crises," he added. Blom stressed on re-adjustments of regulations for the value-focused banks for better productivity. Finance minister AMA Muhith agreed, but said that the regulations were necessary for restructuring the banking sector to address the recent global economic meltdown. The GABV member banks, having over seven million customers in 20 countries, hold a common mission to ensure a sustainable, better living standard of the poor as well as to maintain the natural environment by using finance. Praising such initiative, finance minister Muhith said, "The banks can take such efforts as part of their corporate social responsibility." The objectives of both the alliance and the government are the same, he added. He also said the alliance, with this new methodology, could address the financial crisis caused by the recession. Muhammad A Ali, chairman of BRAC Bank, said, "It's our duty to know what is good for the society." More banks should come forward with such initiative, he added. In this connection, Ali described some Bangladesh Bank projects like SME refinance and credit facilities for share croppers, which were very effective in reducing poverty. Laurie J. Spengler, president and CEO of ShoreBank from USA, a member bank, said this method could help overcoming financial crises through implementing long-term sustainable projects for the deprived people. Fazle Hassan Abed, co-founder of GABV and chairperson of BRAC, expressed his satisfaction as the number of small businesses in Bangladesh increased. "The banking industry can be a key pillar in fighting climate change and building better livelihoods for millions of people across the developing world," he added. The member banks, although small in numbers, have been working to improve the lot of the poor people in their respective countries, he added. GREATER ACCESS VS LOWER INTEREST RATES While asked about the prevailing higher interest rates in bank loans, for both small and large industries, Ali said it is more important to see whether the level of access to finance and market is increasing. "Banks are offering money at lower rates than those village lenders," he added. Participants from member banks will share experiences and discuss on further initiatives in the three-day seminar
