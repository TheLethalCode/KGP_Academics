 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com) The apparel industry's top trade body BGMEA has more than doubled the number of fire safety teams throughout the industry, the association's president said on Sunday as the trade body compensated families of 21 garment workers who were killed last month in one of the worst factory fires of recent years. The association awarded Tk 2 lakh to each of the families bereaved by the fire at Garib & Garib Sweater Factory at Gazipur on Feb 25. Labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, who handed over the cheques at the association's head office in Dhaka, expressed his deep condolence to the families. A probe committee found the Garib & Garib managing director and the factory authorities responsible for the fire that killed 21 workers, mostly women, and injured at least 50 others. Its report cited the main reason behind the deaths was lack of proper ventilation due to unauthorised construction, leading to suffocation of the workers by toxic smoke. It also said the lack of fire training was to blame as no one was able to use fire extinguishers, which were located on each floor, as the blaze broke out. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedy told bdnews24.com the trade body increased the number of fire safety teams from six to 15 in wake of the fire. "The teams will be visiting each garment factory at least once a month to ensure fire-drills are done on a regular basis in a bid to increase fire safety standards within the industry," he said.
