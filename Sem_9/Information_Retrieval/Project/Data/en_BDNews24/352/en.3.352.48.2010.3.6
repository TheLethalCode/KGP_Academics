<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Marylebone Cricket Club have not put forward a bid to be part of one of the new IPL franchises after deciding their role lies in a "broader relationship" with the tournament, reports Cricinfo. Keith Bradshaw, the MCC chief executive, had previously confirmed the club were interested in taking a stake in one of the two IPL franchises that will join the existing eight from 2011. Bradshaw, along with a committee trustee Anthony Wreford, travelled to India to talk with potential consortium members, but after an MCC committee meeting at Lord's earlier this week they won't be linking up with Lalit Modi's enterprise. "After a healthy debate and a thorough investigation, MCC's Committee has decided to uphold the recommendation of our working party not to proceed as an equity stakeholder in a new IPL franchise." Bradshaw said on Friday. "Having said that, we will continue to discuss other ideas with the IPL and, through their support of the MCC spirit of cricket campaign, maintain a close working relationship with them. "The world of cricket is fast-changing and there's no doubt the IPL is going to be a central part of that world for the foreseeable future. We will remain in close contact with the IPL to develop mutually beneficial opportunities." John Barclay, MCC's president, and their head of cricket John Stephenson will attend the opening ceremony of IPL 3 in Mumbai next
