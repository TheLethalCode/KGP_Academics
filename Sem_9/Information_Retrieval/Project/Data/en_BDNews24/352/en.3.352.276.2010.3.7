<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sandra Bullock has earned a few honours in Hollywood, "America's Sweetheart" among them, and on Saturday she was crowned with the dubious title of worst actress of 2009, one day before she's favoured to win an Oscar. Bullock, whose drama "The Blind Side" has made her the odds-on favourite to claim the best actress Oscar, was given a Razzie Award for worst female performance in "All About Steve." No performer has ever won a Razzie and an Oscar the same year. The actress played a socially awkward designer of newspaper crosswords, who falls in love with a cameraman (Bradley Cooper) and stalks him in the movie. Organizers of the Razzies, an annual event that began in 1980 to spoof the glitzy Oscars, which take place on Sunday, also named Bullock and Cooper the worst screen couple of 2009. Hollywood stars are rare sightings at the Razzies, but in 2005 Halle Berry sportingly claimed her award for "Catwoman," and brought along the Oscar she had previously won for her role in "Monster's Ball." The Razzies this year also turned their inside Hollywood sarcasm on one of the biggest box office hits of 2009, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen." The critically panned blockbuster was named worst film, and organizers bestowed a second trophy of shame upon its director Michael Bay. Special awards were given for the past decade. The 2000 film "Battlefield Earth," based on the writings of Scientology creator L. Ron Hubbard, was named worst picture of the decade. Comedian Eddie Murphy, who has had several box office duds in recent years, and Paris Hilton were named the worst actor and actress of the 2000s, respectively. The so-called "winners" were determined by mailing ballots to 657 voters in the United States and 19 foreign countries. Following is a list of 2009 Razzie winners: Worst picture: "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" Worst actor: The Jonas Brothers ("Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience") Worst actress: Sandra Bullock ("All About Steve") Worst supporting actor: Billy Ray Cyrus ("Hannah Montana: The Movie") Worst supporting actress: Sienna Miller ("G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra") Worst screen couple: Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper ("All About Steve") Worst screenplay: "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" Worst director: Michael Bay ("Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen") Worst remake/rip-off or sequel: "Land of the Lo
