 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities at Sir Salimullah Medical College have formed a probe committee after clashes between two Bangladesh Chhatra League factions over forming a new committee. The probe body has been asked to submit its findings within seven days. Police detained six students Tuesday morning after the clashes. Moves are being taken to free them, college principal MA Azahar said, "Because their presence is required for proper investigation." Witnesses said followers of BCL leaders Mohammad Jabed and Ataur Karim Arbi clashed on campus at around 9:30am over leadership of the college unit. Kotwali police detained six BCL activists, including Jabed and Arbi. Jabed claimed himself to be the president of the college unit according to the new committee formed Monday night. But Arbi and his followers were opposing the decision. Police will remain on campus to avoid further untoward incident. All classes were suspended on Tuesday due to the clashes, but will resume from Wednesday, the principal said. bdnews
