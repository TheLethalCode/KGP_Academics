 Chittagong, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com)  Owners and workers of ship-breaking yards in Chittagong were demonstrating again on Saturday to continue pressure on the government to back down on stricter environmental regulations of the industry. Riding in about 80 trucks, the demonstrators brought out a big procession on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway around 11am, creating huge gridlock on the highway. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded on both sides of the highway until 1pm, police sergeant Amir Faruque told bdnews24.com. Owners shut their yards from Feb 21 against a commerce ministry order requiring environmental clearance certificates for import of scrap ships. The yards reopened on Mar 3 following a "successful" discussion with the government. But the industry leaders said they would continue to press their demands, with demos and other protest programmes, until the government eased up on proposed new regulations. The High Court, on Jan 21, ordered authorities to ensure scrap ships are certified as free of toxic chemicals before entering Bangladesh territory. It also ordered closure of yards that could not provide certification for ships, which are in the process of being broken. The ship-breakers began holding demonstrations in the port city in February, including blockades of the main Dhaka-Chittagong highway, rallies and submissions of memoranda to the prime minister, in protest against the orders. Some 30,000 workers are employed by about a hundred ship-breaking yards along the Sitakunda coast of Chittagong district. b
