 LAHORE, Pakistan, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomb attack on a police intelligence unit in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore killed at least 11 people and wounded about 60 on Monday during the morning rush hour, officials said. The attack outside a federal police office bore all the hallmarks of an operation by al Qaeda-backed Pakistani Taliban militants seeking to topple the government.

A doctor at the hospital treating victims said the dead included a woman and a child. The blast left a huge crater in the road outside the office of the main police investigation agency, the Federal Investigation Agency, and destroyed the front of the building. The agency has been attacked at least twice before in Lahore. Television showed pictures of a man covered in blood trapped in a car and passersby trying to help him out while rescuers searched through the rubble. Some angry residents shouted at police as they arrived at the scene in Lahore's Model Town residential neighbourhood. "We repeatedly asked them to please move this office away from our houses but they didn't give a damn," one woman said.

"The market has become sort of immune to these acts of terror and it only reacts if the damage is huge," said Khalid Iqbal Siddiqui, director at brokers Invest and Finance Securities. Dealers said healthy foreign flows into the market in recent days had helped investor sentiment.
