<TITLE> China to punish hackers, says no Google complaint </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has pledged to punish hackers who attacked Google if there is evidence to prove it, but said it has yet to receive any complaint from the world's top search engine. Google sent shockwaves across business and political circles in January when it declared it would stop censoring Chinese search results, and threatened to pull out of China -- the world's largest online community with 384 million users at the end of last year -- over hacking and censorship concerns.

Li did not elaborate. The dispute about Internet censorship has added to tensions over issues ranging from trade and the Chinese currency, to US arms sale to self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, and a recent meeting between US President Barack Obama and Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The hacking issue made headlines again in late February after reports in the Western media that the attacks had been traced to two schools in China, and the writer of the spyware used had been identified as a Chinese security consultant in his 30s with government links. The Chinese government has denied Google's accusation that the hackers were based in China, calling the claim "groundles
