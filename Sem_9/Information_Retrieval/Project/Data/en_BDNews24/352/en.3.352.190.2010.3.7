<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 7 (bdnews24.com)  A clerk of the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court assaulted a lawyer on Sunday after being refused a "tip" to access legal documents. Witness Md Jahangir Miah Nannu, a lawyer by profession, said the incident occurred at around 2:30pm at the court of magistrate Tania Kamal, when advocate Md Parvez asked bench clerk Md Emdad to show him documents of a case. Emdad demanded money from the lawyer. As Parvez refused to pay the clerk used abusive words. Parvez's senior colleague Pijush Kanti Roy, entering the court at the time, became involved in the altercation with the clerk that turned into a scuffle. As police came to the spot magistrate Tania Kamal asked them to arrest Roy. Members of Dhaka Lawyers Association termed the magistrate's order "unwarranted". The situation was almost under control at one stage. But a senior magistrate's comment infuriated the lawyers again. The comment by second additional chief metropolitan magistrate Abu Zafar Md Kamruzzaman, asking whether the courtroom was the "lawyer's bar", again sparked off the row. The lawyers began demonstrating for removal of magistrate Tania Kamal. Senior magistrates and leaders of the lawyers' association eventually sat in a meeting to reach a solution. Senior magistrate Md Golam Rabbani told newsmen afterwards that Tania Kamal did not recognise Roy as a lawyer as he was not wearing a gown. Measures would be taken against the clerk, he added. b
