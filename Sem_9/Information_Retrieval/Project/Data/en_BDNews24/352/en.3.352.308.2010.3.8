 NEW DELHI, Mar 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Women in the Asia-Pacific region have little economic and political power, impacting economic growth prospects of developing nations, the United Nations said in a report released on Monday. According to the UN Asia-Pacific Human Development Report to mark International Women's Day, the region ranks near the worst in the world on issues such as protecting women from violence or upholding their rights to property.

"Women politicians, particularly those with extra vulnerabilities of poverty or association with marginalised groups, have been killed, raped or faced physical threats for challenging the status quo," said the report. It cited an example of a village council in India where male members spread stories that female members were sexually promiscuous, harassed them with obscene phone calls and made sexual innuendoes during meetings.
