 Dhaka, Mar 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Australia levelled the one-day series against New Zealand after a tense 12-run victory via the Duckworth/Lewis method at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday, reports BBC Sport. Half-centuries from Brad Haddin Cameron White and Mike Hussey helped the tourists post 273-7 in their 50 overs. But the Black Caps' victory target was revised to 266 from 45 overs after rain disrupted play. Despite captain Daniel Vettori hitting 70, New Zealand were dismissed for 253 with Mitchell Johnson taking 4-51. Ricky Ponting's side were desperate for a win coming into the game having gone one down in the five-match series with a two-wicket defeat in Napier on Wednesday. And although the visitors once again failed to hit the 300-run mark, their total ultimately proved defendable. Batting first after winning the toss, Australia dissolved from 73-1 to 116-4 in the space of 10 overs. But a 101-run stand from the ever-dependable Hussey (56) and White (54) resurrected the innings, with useful cameos from Johnson (16 not out) and James Hopes (29) helping them finish on 273-7. Johnson removed dangerman Brendon McCullum for only 24 in reply and his dismissal sparked a mini-collapse to 46-4. The rains arrived briefly to disrupt play and saw the struggling Kiwis handed a revised target of 266. The hosts slowly began to regroup with Styris and a half-fit Vettori leading the fightback. Vettori, whose return to the side was largely prompted by the absence of vice-captain Ross Taylor, took charge, hitting eight boundaries and two sixes on his way to a fourth one-day half-century - but it was ultimately in vain. "It wasn't a great performance by any stretch of the imagination but we did enough to win which is pleasing," Australia captain Ponting said. "When you are a little bit below your best and you still find a way to win that's always satisfying. "I think New Zealand are playing pretty well at the moment as well so you've got to give them some credit." In contrast, Black Caps captain Vettori was left frustrated by another limp batting display from his side's top order. "It's a total we should have got but we just consistently lost wickets," he said. "We put ourselves under too much pressure and couldn't maximise those last 10 overs, including the powerplay, to win the game." Vettori also felt the use of the Duckworth/Lewis method had not worked in New Zealand's favour. "To lose two powerplay overs and to only have eight runs taken off I don't know how that works," he admitted. "It makes it incredibly tough. It would have been better if the game had gone the full 50 overs. It would have been a lot better for us." The teams now head south to Hamilton for the third match on Tuesday all sq
