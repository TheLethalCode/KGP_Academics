 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary-general Khondakar Delwar Hossain said on Thursday that the government's recent announcement to withdraw troops from the Chittagong Hill Tracts would jeopardise the region's security. He called the move "motivated". "We are not in favour of withdrawing the army from CHT. Peace and stability have not yet been ensured in the hill districts," said Delwar at a function to mark the fourth death anniversary of journalist Sheikh Nurul Islam at the National Press Club. The government on Wednesday announced that it would withdraw one complete army brigade from CHT by September, the biggest single pullout since the 1997 peace accord was signed to bring stability to the region. "The real reasons behind the sudden withdrawal of troops from CHT will be understood by the people of the country," said Delwar. In an apparent reference to India, Delwar termed the troop withdrawal and "government silence" on the planned Tipaimukh dam project "conspiracies to turn Bangladesh into a hinterland". He said the people of Bangladesh knew where the Shanti Bahini had received their training, and how that had led to unrest in the area. Delwar said the BNP respected the culture and traditions of the hill tracts: "But they have to bear in mind that the Chittagong Hill Tracts is a part of Bangladesh." "Bengalis also have to live there," he said.
