 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina widened her 38-strong cabinet on Friday by drafting in six new members, a day after her ruling Awami League sprang surprises when it dropped longtime party heavyweights from the policymaking presidium. She arrived at the Bangabhaban just before 11am for the swearing-in of Shahjahan Khan, retired brig gen Enamul Huq, retired captain and army doctor Mujibur Rahman Fakir, advocate Promod Mankin, Mahbubur Rahman and Dr Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury. Of them, Shahjahan Khan, a Madaripur MP and a popular trade union leader of JSD origin who chaired the labour and manpower ministry parliamentary committee, is the only cabinet minister. The other five are state ministers. Enamul Huq is from Shibganj, Chapainawabganj, Fakir hails from Gouripur, Mymensingh and Rahman comes from Patuakhali. Mankin has been an MP in 1996, 2001 and 2006 from Mymensingh. President Zillur Rahman administered their oath to office in the second cabinet expansion since the Awami League-led Grand Alliance government assumed office on Jan 6 January after sweeping the Dec 29 general elections. High civil and military officials and diplomats were present, said Bangabhaban officials. On Jan 24, Hasina appointed six new state ministers.
