<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh survived a tense finish to complete unprecedented one-day whitewash of hosts West Indies after winning the final match of the series by three wickets at Warner Park in St. Kitts early on Saturday (BdST). Chasing 249, the Tigers reached the target with seven balls to spare. The result ensured the tourists made a rare clean sweep of the hosts, who also lost the two-match Test series. After given a tremendous platform by the opening pair of Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique (50 in seven overs), the wheels started to fall off. Half the side was gone by the 25th over, and only a fightback by the lower-order enabled Bangladesh to win the series in comprehensive fashion. Opener Junaed Siddique top-scored with 55 off 73 balls while Mahmudullah Riyad, who got the winning wins, finished unbeaten on 51 off 70 balls. Deservedly, he won the man-of the-match award. Though captain Shakib Al Hasan failed to make a contribution with the bat for a change, he still managed to add a man of the series award to his growing collection. Mahmudullah featured in two vital stands to enable Bangladesh to cross the finish line. He added vital 50 runs for the sixth wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim (31) and then 49 runs with Naeem Islam for the next stand before the latter fell for a useful 22-ball 26. Kemar Roach was the best of the West Indies bowlers with 4-63. In the post-match ceremony, Shakib said that they were looking forward to this series and he was happy that they had won the series. He was also happy with the fact that someone or the other raised their hands up in times of need and were counted. Man of the match Mahmudullah said that he enjoyed the knock as he scored a half-century after some time and felt that he enjoyed his batting as the series was already won. West Indies skipper Reifer thought another 15-20 runs would have made the difference and more partnerships were required at the top of order and he congratulated the Bangladesh team on winning the series. Earlier, West Indies opener Andre Fletcher hit a maiden ODI fifty to help the home side recover from an initial setback after winning the toss to post a fighting 248 all out in 47.4 overs. Handed the new ball, medium pacer Mahbubul Alam gave the visitors the perfect start when he trapped debutant Kieran Powell leg before for a duck after bowling his very first delivery wide. Then new-ball pair Nazmul Hossain cleaned up Devon Smith's stumps with the first delivery of his second over to leave West Indies tottering at 10-2 in 3.1 overs. Fletcher, however, counter-attacked to keep the new-ball pair at bay with a swashbuckling 52 off 42 balls, studded with three sixes and eight fours. He was caught at long-on by Mohammad Ashraful, who later broke Travis Down's stumps with a direct throw from short leg. Fletcher and Dowlin together put on 76 runs to ease the pressure before West Indies captain Floyd Reifer and Darren Sammy each added 40. Sammy, however, was more attacking than Reifer before being caught and bowled by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who returned two for 63. Sammy struck two sixes and five fours facing 33 balls while Reifer consumed 79 balls in which he hit three fours and one six. David Thomas (29), Nikita Miller (13) and Kemar Roach (10) also put some runs on the board to take West Indies near the 250-mark. Mahbubul Alam Robin and Mahmudullah also grabbed two wickets each. b
