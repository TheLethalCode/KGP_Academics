 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said on Thursday that newly qualified students who have just passed their HSC and equivalent exams would face no problems securing places in higher education institutions. Nahid said over 430,000 seats in public and private universities, medical colleges and other educational institutions, including the National University and its affiliated colleges, would be available to absorb the newly passed students. However, according to the education ministry data, the country's public universities have places for only around 200,000 honours-level candidates and around 100,000 at degree level each year. University Grants Commission chairman professor Nazrul Islam recently told bdnews24.com that 51 private universities in the country accounted for just 30,000 further seats. Nahid said some 442,389 students passed the HSC and equivalent examinations this year. The results were published on July 25. "There are 437,171 seats available for higher education. So there is a shortfall of just 5,218 seats. Five thousand seats will be added in the next admission," said Nahid at a meeting with vice-chancellors of public universities at the secretariat. b
