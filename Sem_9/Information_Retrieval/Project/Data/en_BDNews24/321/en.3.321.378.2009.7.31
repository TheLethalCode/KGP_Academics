 LONDON, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Tributes flooded in Friday for former England manager Bobby Robson, who died peacefully at home from cancer aged 76. Here is a selection: "I cannot think of anybody in the game who was held in higher esteem...it was an absolute privilege and honour to work with him." -- England under-21 manager Stuart Pearce who played under Robson. "It's extremely sad that Sir Bobby has lost his final fight against cancer, but he will never be forgotten." -- Current England manager Fabio Capello. "The world, not just the football world, will miss him. Let's hope it won't be long before another like him turns up because we could never get enough of them." -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. "Bobby Robson is one of those people who never die, not so much for what he did in his career, for one victory more or less, but for what he knew to give to those who had, like me, the good fortune to know him and walk by his side," -- Jose Mourinho, who was Robson's assistant at Barcelona. "As a football manager he is one of the greatest of all time. He didn't just taste success here in Britain, he won trophies right across Europe. Quite simply, his record was phenomenal." -- Scotland manager George Burley who played under Robson at Ipswich. "Bobby will be missed by the entire football family. He was a true ambassador for the game and, in addition to his footballing achievements at the likes of Fulham, Ipswich, Barcelona, PSV Eindhoven, Newcastle and England, he will be remembered for his tireless work raising funds for cancer research through the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. He was truly a great man." -- Premier League chairman Dave Richards. "Football was his life, that was it. It's going to be a very sad city. Everyone loved him and he had a great understanding with the fans." -- Former Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepherd. "Barca is in mourning, he won the affection of all the supporters and is a true legend of world football." -- Barcelona "It's a great loss, he was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed especially by those fortunate enough to play under him. I never played under a more passionate, more enthusiastic man in football." -- Former England striker Gary Lineker. "He beat cancer so many times, you thought he'd live into his 100s. In the minute's silence, it did overwhelm me. I hope back in England there will be a standing ovation with a minute's clapping rather than a minute's silence, to celebrate his life. Football was his life." -- striker Kieron Dyer who played under Robson for Newcastle Un
