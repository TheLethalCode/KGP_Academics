 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  Old foes Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club will be the centre of the month-long booters' transfer of the third edition B. League that gets underway on Saturday. The booters' bourse, however, may face a hitch following the League Committee decision to relegate three teams from the top fray as the team likes Brothers Union, Chittagong Mohammedan SC, Farashganj SC, Rahmatganj MFS, Muktijoddha Sangsad are against the decision of the football governing body. Officials of those clubs want to see one team being relegated from the professional football league. Meanwhile, the B. League committee in the middle of July permitted three new clubs --- Narayanganj Shuktara Jubo Sangsad, Feni Soccer Club and Biyanibazar SC of Sylhet to compete in the league's third edition. "Already we let the league committee know our stance on relegation and we may hold up our transfer procedure until they solve it," said Brothers manager Amer Khan, who prefers to demote one team from the 13-club competition. "If the committee sticks to their decision, it will encourage small-budget teams to spend less money to avoid the risk of relegation," said Abdus Sattar, the manager of Muktijoddha Sangsad, which managed to skip the relegation last season finishing just above Khulna Abahani KC. Chittagong Mohammedan SC, the fifth-placed finishers in the second edition league, have no problem to relegate three teams, but questioned the criteria how they chose three new teams where one team was relegated last season. "We are looking forward to improving our standing from the last season and have no problem if three teams are relegated. But it would have been better to relegate one team and then pick one team in the same situation where the team is relegated," said Mohammad Yousuf, the manager of the Chittagong Mohammedan SC. Last year's giant-killers Rahmatganj and spirited Farashganj SC also wanted one team to be demoted instead of three. Keeping eyes on the prestigious trophy of the B. League, both reigning champions Abahani and last year's runners-up Mohammedan have almost confirmed their pick of players one month earlier and now wait to complete the official formalities in the transfer time frame. Abahani have confirmed the service of Mohammedan's striker Mohammad Robin and defender Rajani Kanta Barman, Brothers Union's Motiur Munna, Farashganj's striker Enamul Haq, Chittagong Abahani's defender Mintu. Besides, the Sky Blues have guaranteed the services of stalwarts like Biplob Bhattacharya, Mohammad Sujan, Nazrul Islam, Arif Khan Joy, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury, Pranotosh Kumar, Shahajuddin Tipu, Siraji and others. Abahani manager Sattyjit Das Rupu said they would start the camp by August 10 under the guidance of Argentine trainer Diego Alvaro Cuadrado. Abahani's striker Jahid Hasan Emily, defender Wali Faisal and playmaker Mamunul Isla reportedly joined the Black and Whites along with Brothers' winger Jahid Hossain and Atiqul Islam Mishu. The Motijheel-based outfit have also retained the services of medio Arman Aziz, goalkeeper Aminul Haq, defenders Saikat, Nasir, Kamal, Sharif and others. Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan, member of Mohammedan ad-hoc committee, said that they have confirmed 13 footballers out of 31 players, who were in the national football camp. This time, Sheikh Russel KC have kept faith with youth and club president Nurul Alam Chowdhury said that they were keen on the players, who would able to play a full 90 minute
