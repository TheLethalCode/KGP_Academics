 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  West Indies were 204-7 in 40 overs against Bangladesh after captain Floyd Reifer opted to bat in the third and final one-day international at Warner Park in St Kitts on Friday. Devon Thomas was batting on five with Nikita Miller on six. Darren Sammy was the latest to go, caught and bowled by Abdur Razzak for 40, leaving the side at 190-7 in 38 overs after Mahbubul Alam had Reifer caught by Shakib Al Hasan for identical 40. David Bernard was caught at long-off by Mohammad Ashraful off Mahmudullah Riyad for one, leaving the home side at 124-5 in 27.1 overs Travis Dowlin was earlier run out by a direct throw from short fine-leg by Ashraful, who also took a comfortable catch to send back Andre Fletcher. Fletcher struck 52 off 41 balls, his maiden fifty, that included three sixes and eight fours after the hosts were reduced to 10-2 in 3.1 overs. Nazmul Hossain cleaned up Devon Smith's stumps with a good length delivery for a nine-ball 4 after Mahbubul Alam made the breakthrough trapping debutant opener Kieran Powell leg before for a first-ball duck after his very first delivery was called wide.
