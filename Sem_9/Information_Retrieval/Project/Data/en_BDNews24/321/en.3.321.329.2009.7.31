<TEXT>
 BEIJING, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Robbie Keane scored twice to help Tottenham Hotspur claim a 3-0 victory over Hull City in the final of the Premier League's Asia Trophy on Friday. Aaron Lennon was also on target as manager Harry Redknapp won the biennial pre-season tournament for the second time in a row after leading Portsmouth to victory in Hong Kong in 2007. Ireland striker Keane gave Spurs the lead in the 17th minute, taking Luka Modric's pass on the chest before firing a powerful shot past Hull goalkeeper Tony Warner, who will be disappointed not to have kept it out. There was further disappointment for Warner in the 68th minute when he was adjudged to have brought Jermain Defoe down in the area and Keane calmly stroked the spot kick past him. There was not much he could do about the third goal, however, with Kyle Naughton's cross leaving England winger Lennon unmarked at the far post to score easily. West Ham United earlier beat a second string Beijing Guoan side 2-0 to secure third place in the tournament courtesy of late goals from Danny Gabbidon and Zavon Hines. The Chinese league leaders, who play in Chongqing on Sunday, contained the visitors until Gabbidon headed in from a corner with 10 minutes to go. Hines added a second for West Ham with a solo effort in the last few seconds. There was a minute's silence before each match for former England manager Bobby Robson, who died of cancer on Friday age
