 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)Recently installed Proshika chairman MA Wadud on Sunday called on the government to "save" the organisation, after a march on the NGO's headquarters by sacked chief Kazi Faruque Ahmed with hundreds of supporters sparked violent clashes the day before. He asserted the legitimacy of his appointment at a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters Unity, and said Saturday's clashes were not between "two rival groups" but a result of attacks on legitimate Proshika employees who tried in turn to defend themselves. "I am the authorised chairman of Proshika," Wadud said, adding:"Proshika's governing body sacked Kazi Faruque Ahmed and appointed me in his place, a move that was also approved in the annual general meeting." The governing body of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-government organisations, replaced founding chairman Faruque in May this year following repeated allegations by employees of corruption and nepotism. The ousted chairman led over 200 supporters in a demonstration to the NGO's Dhaka headquarters on Saturday, who tried to force their way into the building, sparking violent clashes with Proshika employees that left at least 35 injured. Faruque was rushed to hospital with chest pains during the demonstration. Proshika CEO Mahbub-ul Karim and director of micro credit field operations Md Abdur Rob also spoke at Sunday's press briefing. In a written statement, Karim said the former chairman had intended to occupy the NGO's head office in Mirpur with the assistance of criminal elements. "He did this when his hopes of regaining his position evaporated after losing three legal cases," claimed Karim. "Faruque was sacked because of his towering ambition and autocratic behaviour," said the CEO. The former chairman, who along with family members also faces money-laundering charges, claims he was illegally "ousted". Faruque, who has challenged his removal in court, told newsmen on Saturday: "I am still the chairman of this organisation." He said he "went to office" on Saturday morning, but was not allowed to enter. Abdur Rob told reporters at the time: "As the founding chairman, he (Faruque) can enter the office any time he wants. But we protested when he arrived with so many outsiders." bd
