 BAGHDAD, Jul 31(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six bombs exploded within minutes near Shi'ite mosques across Baghdad on Friday, killing at least 26 people and wounding scores of others, police and witnesses said. The blasts, which appeared to target Shi'ite Muslims taking part in Friday prayers, was a reminder of the capability of militants in Iraq despite an overall drop in violence in the country over the last 18 months. At least 67 were wounded. Shi'ite religious gatherings in the past have been targets of Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, which regards Shi'ites as heretics. In the worst attack, a car bomb struck people praying outside a crowded mosque in northern Baghdad's Shaab district, killing at least 21 people and wounding 35. "I saw 15 martyrs," said one Iraqi at the mosque. U.S. officials say al Qaeda and other Sunni insurgent groups are trying to reignite the sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shi'ites that brought Iraq to the brink of all-out civil war in 2006 and 2007. U.S. combat forces withdrew from Iraqi cities last month, raising fears amongst many Iraqis that their own forces are not yet ready to handle security. U.S. and Iraqi officials expect militant attacks to increase in the run up to national elections expected in January, in which Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is hoping to capitalize on security gains to present himself as a nationalist who brought stability to Iraq. "I lay the blame for these blasts on the government and Baghdad security officials," said Raad Souar, a politician close to the movement of radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. "The reason for the high number of casualties is due to the weakness of security in Baghdad." A spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry declined to comment on the blasts.
