 ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled on Friday that former president Pervez Musharraf trampled the constitution when he imposed emergency rule two years ago and all actions taken by him then were illegal, television news channels reported. Musharraf, who came to power in a coup in 1999, quit as president almost a year ago to avoid impeachment and has been living in London for the past two months. The judgment, delivered by a panel of 14 judges, comes almost two years after Musharraf's purge of the judiciary, when he suspended the constitution to secure a second term as president before giving up his dual role as army chief. Under Pakistan's constitution, any charges of treason against Musharraf would have to come from parliament. The previous parliament had endorsed Musharraf's actions.
