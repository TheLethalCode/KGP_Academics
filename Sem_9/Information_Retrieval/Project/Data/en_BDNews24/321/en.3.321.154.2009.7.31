<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League's new policymaking presidium on Friday sat at its first meeting at the prime minister's residence. Almost all the presidium members, including Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, are present at the meeting that started at 6pm. The ruling party's president and prime minister Sheikh Hasina is chairing the meeting. On Thursday, Hasina approved a list of her party's central working committee, including a 15-strong members, by axing longtime party heavyweights from the policymaking presidium. Hasina is speculated to pick the 26 executive members of the central working committee. A joint general secretary and the information and research secretary were yet to be picked. Hasina said on Friday that the presidium and the central working committee of her Awami League party reflected the opinions of the councillors. "Many known faces were dropped from the committees in line with the views of the councillors," she told reporters at the Bangabhaban after the swearing-in ceremony of six new ministers. "It was made for the sake of the party," she said, a day after ruling Awami League sprang surprises "We've arranged the council successfully and within a short time," Hasina said. "The committee has been formed in line with the views of the councillors." Big guns Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofael Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Abdul Jalil were sidelined to the ceremonial 20-strong advisory council apparently for pursuing 'reforms' to curb Hasina's power. Sahara Khatun, Abdul Latif Siddique, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, Satish Chandra Roy, Obaidul Qader and Yousuf Mohammad Humayun have been included in the new-look presidium. All the seven organising secretaries of the previous committee failed to make the cut. Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Mukul Bose, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Akhteruzzaman and Sultan Mohammed Monsur Ahmed, all so-called 'reformists', are the other big names failing to make the cut in the Central Working Committee, the highest executive forum. The party council on July 24 dissolved the old committee, which includes a 15-member presidium, 30 secretaries and 26 members. The AL had unanimously re-elected Hasina as party president for a sixth time during the council and trusted Ashraf as general secretary. Ashraf unveiled the names to the media at a press briefing at the prime minister's official residence on Thursday afternoon. The council on July 24 tasked Hasina and Ashraf to pick leaders for 45 posts in the central working committee. The constitution vests powers solely on the president to choose 26 of the 73 members of that committee. The councillors in closed-door deliberations endorsed a proposal to empower Hasina and Ashraf to pick 13 other leaders for the party's policymaking presidium, and 31 departmental secretaries. The new presidium now comprises Hasina, Ashraf, Sayeda Johra Tajuddin, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Motia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Kazi Jafrullah, Abdul Mannan, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser, Sahara Khatun, Abdul Latif Siddique, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, Satish Chandra Roy and Obaidul Qader. bdne
