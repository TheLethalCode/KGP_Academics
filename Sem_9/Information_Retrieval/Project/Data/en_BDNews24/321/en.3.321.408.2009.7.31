 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the cabinet has been expanded to successfully implement the new budget. "There are a good number of ministries, small and large. We have to implement the budget and the expansion was made with a view to execute the new budget," Hasina told reporters after the oath-taking ceremony of six new ministers at teh Bangabhaban on Friday. Hasina widened and shuffled her 38-strong cabinet a day after her ruling Awami League sprang surprises when it dropped longtime party heavyweights from the policymaking presidium. She arrived at the Bangabhaban just before 11am for the swearing-in. President Zillur Rahman administered their oath to office in the second cabinet expansion since the Awami League-led Grand Alliance government assumed office on Jan 6 January after sweeping the Dec 29 general elections. On Jan 24, Hasina appointed six new state ministers. The latest cabinet expansion will bring about changes in the crucial ministries of home and energy, a senior cabinet minister told bdnews24.com, speaking on condition of anonymity. The minister said incumbent state minister for energy and power Shamsul Huq Tuku will move to home as state minister. The minister added that said Shahjahan Khan, a Madaripur MP and a popular trade union leader of JSD origin, will become the new minister for shipping and inland water transport. The incumbent, Afsarul Amin, will take over at primary and mass education division. The newly sworn-in retired brig gen Enamul Huq, from Shibganj, Chapainawabganj will be the new state minister for energy and power, he himself said minutes after the Bangabhaban ceremony on Friday. A formal announcement from the Cabinet Division was expected anytime Friday afternoon, the cabinet minister added. Mahbubur Rahman, from Patuakhali, will be at the water resources ministry as the state minister. Retired captain and army doctor Mujibur Rahman Fakir, from Gouripur, Mymensingh, will be the state minister for health to assist cabinet minister A F M Ruhul Huq.
