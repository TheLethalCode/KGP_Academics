 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com)  Dozens of people were reported injured as the Dhaka headquarters of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-government organisations, came under attack on Saturday. Mirpur police reached the spot at around 10am and were still trying to bring the situation under control by midday. Assistant police commissioner Moniruzzaman said a group of agitators approached the Mirpur-2 offices at around 9am but failed to enter the building as the employees obstructed them. The assailants threw brickbats at the building damaging windowpanes, and clashes occurred as the building's employees tried to chase them off. According to Proshika employees, the attackers were supporters of sacked chairman Kazi Faruq Ahmed. Proshika's board of governors replaced chairman Kazi Faruq Ahmed in May this year in the face of ongoing employees' agitation against Faruque for alleged corruption and nepotism. The former Proshika chief, who faces money laundering charges, brought out a procession Saturday chanting Joy Bangla in front of the Proshika building and was trying to enter, said one witness. Another said at least 30 people were injured in the clashes, some of whom taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The balconies of the 14-storey building were packed with Proshika employees. They were seen to throw brickbats if anybody tried to enter the building. Mirpur zone deputy police commissioner Chowdhury Monjurul Kabir said the clash is an organisational matter of Proshika. "We are not concerned about which group is right or which group is wrong. "We have nothing to do with the internal affair. We will do whatever is required to maintain the law and order," he said. Kabir denied accusations that police were slow to act as the clashes sparked off. bd
