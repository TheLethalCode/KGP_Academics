<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com) - Newly appointed state minister for home, Shamsul Haque Tuku, has ordered law enforcement agencies to take drastic action against "tender terrorists" who claim links to political parties. "The government is creating new rules to protect against tender-terrorism, and if necessary will introduce an online system for the submission of tender quotations," Tuku told reporters on Saturday following a meeting with law enforcement agencies at the Chittagong Circuit House. Local businessmen, with alleged links to the ruling Awami League, have recently been accused of tender manipulation in the Chittagong area. "Individuals engaged in tender manipulation and extortion can have no party identity. Drastic action will be taken to eliminate these practices from the ruling party," said Tuku. On a separate issue, he said recent investigations into the 2004 seizure of '10 truckloads' of arms in Chittagong would soon bear fruit. "Earlier investigations in the case were diverted off the right track," he said. First vice president of BGMEA Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, Chittagong metropolitan police commissioner Md Moniruzzaman and former vice president of BGMEA SM Tayeb also attended the meeting. b
