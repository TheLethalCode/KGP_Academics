 LONDON, Jul 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England manager Bobby Robson has died, British media reported on Friday. Robson, who was 76, had been battling various forms of cancer for several years and was diagnosed with inoperable tumours in both lungs last year. After ending a playing career that earned him 20 England caps, Robson moved into management and after a successful spell in charge of Ipswich Town he became England manager in 1982. After leading England to the World Cup semi-finals in 1990 he returned to club management, including spells in charge of PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, Porto and his Newcastle United. On Sunday, a wheelchair-bound Robson was at St James' Park for a charity match in his honour which attracted a crowd of more than 30,000 fans.
