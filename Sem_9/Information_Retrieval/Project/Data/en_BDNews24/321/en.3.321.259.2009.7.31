<TEXT>
 BIRMINGHAM, England, Jul 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia made a confident start in the third Ashes test against England as Shane Watson's unbeaten fifty lifted them to 126 for one on a rain-disrupted first day on Thursday. The start of the match was delayed by six hours but Watson, recalled in place of Phillip Hughes, and Simon Katich played a series of crisp strokes to seize the initiative against a subdued England seam attack. Katich fell for 46 to off-spinner Graeme Swann but Watson had moved on to 62 at the close, including 10 fours, with his captain Ricky Ponting on 17. "It was a positive result for us," Australia coach Tim Nielsen told a news conference. "It can be difficult to get through a session like that but to lose only one wicket was a good effort." Australia, looking to level the series following their 115-run defeat in the last test at Lord's, suffered a blow when wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, named in the side at the toss, was ruled out with a finger injury sustained in practice. The Australians asked England for permission to replace Haddin and the hosts agreed, allowing Graham Manou to make his debut. "Haddin has fractured the end of the ring finger on his left hand," Nielsen said. "It was after the toss so we really had to rush to speak to England before the start and we were pleased that they agreed to let us play Manou." UNFAMILIAR ROLE Ponting won the toss and Watson was promoted up the order to partner Katich, immediately looking comfortable in an unfamiliar role. He almost played on a delivery from Andrew Flintoff but welcomed Graham Onions to the attack with a perfect off-drive for four to bring up Australia's 50. Watson drove the same bowler straight for four and pulled him fiercely through square leg, forcing England captain Andrew Strauss to withdraw Onions from the attack. He turned to Swann who struck in his first over, trapping Katich lbw as the left-hander aimed to pull him through mid-wicket. Katich struck nine fours in a fluent 48-ball knock but Watson maintained his concentration and reached only his second test fifty just before the close. "Obviously, we are a bit disappointed but we didn't put the ball in the right areas consistently enough," Swann said. "The wet outfield was not a major factor. Watson was under pressure and he played very well. We expected Australia to come out fighting and they did that."
