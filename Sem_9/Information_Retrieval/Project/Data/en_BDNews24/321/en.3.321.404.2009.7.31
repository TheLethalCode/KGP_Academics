 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)--The 10-member parliamentary delegation could not visit the proposed Tipamukh dam site in India on Friday as the helicopter carrying them failed to land due to torrential rains, according to BBC Bengali Service. The team, led by chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources Abdur Razzak, left for the site early in the morning from Guwahati, the capital of Assam. But the team returned to Guwahati without taking any risks amid the heavy rainfall. "We saw the site from above but did not see any installations or construction work being in progress there," Razzak, who later returned to Guwahati, told BBC He said they had come to India to verify the allegation that India had already started the dam construction and New Delhi's claims that it is a hydropower project and the dam will not divert any irrigation water. Some people of Tipaimukh area told BBC that they had been waiting to talk with them amid the heavy rainfall. The members of the parliamentary team include Awami League MPs Abdur Rahman, ABM Anwarul Haq and Jahir Hossain, Jatiya Party MP ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader and independent MP Fazlul Azim. Besides, it has two expertsBUET professor Monwar Hossain and Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission. The other two members are water resources secretary Waheduzzaman and foreign ministry director general Emran Ahmed. Jamaat-e-Islami MP Hamidur Rahman Azad did not join the delegation at the last moment as he fell ill. BNP failed to name two members for the team, even though the party has been among the loudest critics of the dam project in recent months. The main opposition party has been firing from the sidelines, however, unwilling to raise its concerns in parliament as its MPs have been boycotting the House almost continuously since January. b
