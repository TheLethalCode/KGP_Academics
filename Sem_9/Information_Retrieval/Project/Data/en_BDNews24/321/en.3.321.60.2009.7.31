 STANFORD, California, Jul 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Williams sisters remained on course for another final showdown when the top two seeds eased into the last eight of the Stanford Classic with routine second round victories Thursday. Wimbledon champion Serena needed a second set tiebreak to overcome Hungary's Melinda Czink 6-3 7-6, while big sister Venus advanced with a 6-1 7-5 win over Russia's Alla Kudryavtseva. Top seed Serena struggled to master left-handed Czink's fierce forehand but the American's greater experience proved vital, especially in staving off a set point with a clever serve when the Hungarian led 7-6 in the tiebreak. The world number 56 then missed two forehands to hand Serena the set and the match. "I've been off this whole week," said Serena, who sent down 10 aces in setting up a quarter-final against Australia's Samantha Stosur. "She served pretty well towards the end, especially big second serves. I could have returned better." Stosur held match points against the American in Sydney earlier this year and watched her opponent from the stands on Thursday. "She should be very confident going into the match," Serena said. "Hopefully I'll be playing a little better tomorrow (Friday)." Venus faced less of a struggle than her younger sister, but was tested in the second set against the hard-hitting Kudryavtseva. "My error count was a little high," Venus told reporters. "I could have been a little more consistent and maybe won the second set 6-2 or 6-3." Next up for the seven-time grand slam champion is a mouth-watering clash against Maria Sharapova, who is continuing her rehabilitation from a long injury layoff. The Russian, who has won three grand slam titles, leads their rivalry 3-2. "My key is to execute my game as best I can," Williams said. "I feel like it will be a good match-up for me. I always enjoy playing against Maria." In other matches, fourth seeded Jelena Jankovic was pushed hard by German teenage prospect Sabine Lisicki before emerging with a 2-6 6-2 6-4 victory. The Serb advanced to a meeting with eighth-seeded Marion Bartoli of France after last year's losing finalist beat American teen-ager Melanie Oudin 7-5 6-4. Third seed Elena Dementieva of Russia and Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova will contest Friday's other quarter-final.
