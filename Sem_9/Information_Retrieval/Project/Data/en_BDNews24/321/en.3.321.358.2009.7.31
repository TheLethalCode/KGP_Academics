 BIRMINGHAM, England, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  England fast bowlers James Anderson and Graham Onions ripped out Australia for 263 on the second day of the third Ashes Test on Friday. England reached 56 for one in reply at tea with captain Andrew Strauss on 33 and Ravi Bopara on 23. Onions struck with the first two balls of the day to dismiss Shane Watson and Michael Hussey and he also removed Australia captain Ricky Ponting in an inspired spell of seam bowling. Anderson sent back Michael Clarke, Marcus North, Mitchell Johnson and Graham Manou in quick succession just before the interval. The England pace attack had struggled on the rain-disrupted first day but Onions settled quickly into his rhythm after Australia resumed on 126 for one. He trapped Watson lbw for 62 and bowled Hussey when the left-hander misjudged the line and was bowled offering no stroke. Ponting and Clarke took the total to 163 and the former became Australia's highest run-scorer in Tests when he reached 25.

Clarke was badly dropped by Andrew Flintoff at second slip, also off Onions but he looked in good touch until he missed an inswinger from Anderson and was adjudged lbw for 29. North batted over an hour for his 12 but he drove loosely at a wide ball from Anderson and was brilliantly caught one-handed by the diving Prior. Johnson lasted just one ball, also deceived by Anderson's line and trapped lbw, and wicketkeeper Graham Manou fell just before the interval for eight, comprehensively bowled by a perfect outswinger. Australia's last two wickets added 60 useful runs. Siddle was caught by Prior off Anderson for 13 and Ben Hilfenhaus caught by Graeme Swann in the gully off Onions for 20, leaving Nathan Hauritz unbeaten on 20. Australia made an early breakthrough when Siddle dismissed Alastair Cook for a duck, the opener edging a slanting delivery through to Manou. But Strauss and Bopara looked comfortable, both batsmen hitting four boundaries with crisp attacking strokes as England bid to extend their 1-0 lead in the se
