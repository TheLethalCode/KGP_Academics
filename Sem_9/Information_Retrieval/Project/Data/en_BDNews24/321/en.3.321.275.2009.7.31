 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)The latest cabinet expansion will bring about changes in the crucial ministries of home and energy, a senior cabinet minister told bdnews24.com on Friday after the swearing-in ceremony. The minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incumbent state minister for energy and power Shamsul Huq Tuku will move to home as state minister. The cabinet minister said Shahjahan Khan, a Madaripur MP and a popular trade union leader of JSD origin, will become the new minister for shipping and inland water transport. Khan also chaired the labour and manpower ministry parliamentary committee. The incumbent, Afsarul Amin, will take over at primary and mass education division. The newly sworn-in retired brig gen Enamul Huq, from Shibganj, Chapainawabganj will be the new state minister for energy and power, he himself said minutes after the Bangabhaban ceremony. A formal announcement from the Cabinet Division was expected anytime Friday afternoon, the cabinet minister added. Mahbubur Rahman, from Patuakhali, will be at the water resources ministry as the state minister. Retired captain and army doctor Mujibur Rahman Fakir, from Gouripur, Mymensingh, will be the state minister for health to assist cabinet minister A F M Ruhul Huq. Promod Mankin, an MP in 1996, 2001 and 2006 from Mymensingh, is set for the culture ministry. Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury will be state minister for children and women. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina widened and shuffled her 38-strong cabinet on Friday by drafting in the six new members, a day after her ruling Awami League sprang surprises when it dropped longtime party heavyweights from the policymaking presidium. She arrived at the Bangabhaban just before 11am for the swearing-in, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. President Zillur Rahman administered their oath to office in the second cabinet expansion since the Awami League-led Grand Alliance government assumed office on Jan 6 January after sweeping the Dec 29 general elections. High civil and military officials and diplomats were present, said Bangabhaban officials. On Jan 24, Hasina appointed six new state ministers. bd
