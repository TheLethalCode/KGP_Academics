 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com)  President Barack Obama has named Bangladesh's Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, British physicist Stephen Hawking and South African anti-apartheid veteran Desmond Tutu among the 16 recipients of the 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour of the United States. Other figures tapped to receive the honour, for their "especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours", include six women from sport, entertainment, science and government; a Native American war chief, a civil rights leader, an African-American actor, two US politicians and a doctor. "These outstanding men and women represent an incredible diversity of backgrounds... Yet they share one overarching trait: Each has been an agent of change. Each saw an imperfect world and set about improving it, often overcoming great obstacles along the way," President Obama said in a statement issued by the White House on Saturday. "Their relentless devotion to breaking down barriers and lifting up their fellow citizens sets a standard to which we all should strive," said Obama, who will present the Medals at a White House ceremony on August 12. Dr Muhammad Yunus is a global leader in anti-poverty efforts, and has pioneered the use of "micro-loans" to provide credit to poor individuals without collateral. Dr. Yunus, an economist by training, founded the Grameen Bank in 1983 in his native Bangladesh to provide small, low-interest loans to the poor to help better their livelihood and communities. Dr. Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work. Stephen Hawking is an internationally recognised theoretical physicist who has a severe physical disability due to motor neuron disease. He is the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, a post previously held by Isaac Newton in 1669. In addition to his pioneering academic research in mathematics and physics, Hawking has penned three popular science books, including the bestselling A Brief History of Time. Hawking, a British citizen, was hailed by the White House for unlocking "new pathways of discovery" and "inspiring everyday citizens." Desmond Tutu is an Anglican Archbishop emeritus who was a leading anti-apartheid activist in South Africa. Widely regarded as "South Africa's moral conscience," he served as the General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches (SACC) from 1978  1985, where he led a formidable crusade in support of justice and racial reconciliation in South Africa. He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his work through SACC in 1984. Among other recipients of the Medal of Freedom this year are Ireland's first woman president Mary Robinson, who left the presidency early to serve as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights; Harvey Milk, the first openly gay official of a major US city; former tennis pro Billie Jean King, who became the first woman commissioner in professional sport after her court career ended; and Senator Edward Kennedy, in recognition of a career dedicated to "fighting for equal opportunity, fairness and justice for all Americans," the White House said
