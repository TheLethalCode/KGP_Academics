 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) Police arrested Jubok Housing chairman Lokman Hossain in the early hours of Tuesday at his Dhanmondi home on charges of fraud and embezzlement. Two cases were filed in March against Lokman and six others by Ashraf Hossain, officer-in-charge of Dhanmondi Police Station Shah Alam told bdnews24.com. Jubok Housing and Real Estate Development Limited is the sister concern of private company Jubo Karmasangsthan Society. The plaintiff complained that he did not get the plot in time although he had deposited Tk 30 lakh. When he wanted the money back he was beaten up by defendants and forced to sign on a blank stamp paper, Hossain further alleged. On the news of Lokman's arrest, scores of Jubok depositors flocked to the police station in the morning and demanded their money back. "Jubok has stolen the money of thousands of people. If the government does not try them then the [depositors] will try them," Rehana Salam, an victim, told bdnews24.com. Jubok misappropriated several hundred crores of taka of 26,000 people. The depositors tried to get the money back for the last three and a half years but to no avail, said Mustafizur Rahman, the convener of the forum of the deceived depositors. He sought the prime minister's intervention in the matter. Lokman told bdnews24.com at the police station that it was true that many depositors were yet to get the money back. Many of those who filed cases had been returned plots and money, he added. He was to be produced in court in the afternoon.
