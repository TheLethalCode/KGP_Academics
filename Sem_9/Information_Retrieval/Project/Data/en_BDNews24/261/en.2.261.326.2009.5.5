<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam Tuesday said the government will no more allow the law-enforcing agencies to use "crossfire" killings without trialas a tool. "Establishment of rule of law is a must for a democratic country and for that no extra-judicial killings will be allowed to be used as a tool of law-enforcing agencies," Ashraful said at a programme organised by apparel exporters' forum, BGMEA. "The crossfire and extra-judicial killings are not related to general law. The law must be allowed to take its own course." Killings in so-called crossfire have being been widely criticised for years by the national and international rights organisations and countries. A number of ministers of the Awami League-led government have promised to stop the extra-judicial milling by law-enforcing agencies, mainly by the Rapid Action Battalion, since the new government took office on Jan. 6 . But a number of such killings took place in the meantime. Only on Monday, a man was killed in the alleged crossfire with the RAB. bd
