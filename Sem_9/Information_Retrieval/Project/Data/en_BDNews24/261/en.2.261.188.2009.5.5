<TITLE> Panama's president-elect to push US trade deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PANAMA CITY, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finalizing a free-trade deal with the United States is a major goal for Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli, but the supermarket tycoon rejects US accusations that the country is a tax haven. "It will be our No. 1 priority," Martinelli said of the accord on Monday in front of his house after sweeping Sunday's election with over 60 percent of votes. The US-Panama trade pact was signed in June 2007 by Panamanian President Martin Torrijos, but the agreement has been stalled in the US Congress over criticisms that Panama is an offshore tax haven for wealthy foreigners. Panama only collects income tax on money judged to have been earned in the tiny Central American nation. Martinelli's economic team disagrees with US lawmakers who say Panama has failed to deal with tax evasion and needs tougher labor rights standards. "The perception that Panama is a tax haven is totally false," Frank De Lima, Martinelli's top economic adviser, told Reuters. De Lima said the new government will be open to sharing information with US authorities and plans to work to pass the agreement as soon as possible. Panama exported $377 million to the United States last year and 96 percent of goods already enter the United States duty free, but US exporters who sent almost $5 billion to Panama in 2008 still face significant barriers, US lawmakers say. Panama says its exporters are at a disadvantage in the region because other Central American countries and Mexico already have free trade deals with the United States. Torrijos has pledged to sign the trade agreement before stepping down on July 1, but negotiations are moving slowly. US Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, objects to a Panama law that bans a workforce of less than 40 people from forming a union and that in a company less than two years old, a union has no right to call a strike. De Lima said Panama respects labor rights and collective bargaining. The administration of US President Barack Obama has said it hopes to win approval of the Panama deal relatively quickly and to work with Congress to establish "benchmarks" for progress on pending trade deals with Colombia and South Korea. BIG SPENDING Panama's economy has led Latin America with growth of around 10 percent in recent years, fueled by luxury real estate, a booming banking sector and US-Asia trade through the Panama Canal. But growth in 2009 could slow to below 3 percent as the global financial crisis hits credit and shipping, making a US trade deal all the more important. "Martinelli will enter office during a challenging period," said Theresa Paiz Fredel, an analyst at Fitch Ratings in a note. Fitch said the election result will not affect the country's ratings, since Martinelli is expected to push ahead with Panama's $5.25 billion canal expansion plan. Martinelli, a 57-year-old US-educated businessman who owns the dominant Super 99 grocery chain, is open to foreign investment and has pledged to simplify the country's tax code with a 10 to 20 percent flat tax. A coalition of conservative parties that backed Martinelli in the election won a majority of congressional seats on Sunday, which should help the new administration push through tax and spending plans. Martinelli has promised massive infrastructure spending in partnership with foreign investors: a $1 billion subway system for Panama City, up to $400 million on a new highway project, new airports and ports for cruise ships
