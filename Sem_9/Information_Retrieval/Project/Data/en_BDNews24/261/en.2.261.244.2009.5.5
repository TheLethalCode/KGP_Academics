 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  B. League champions Abahani are gearing up for the AFC President's Cup at home as they set their sights on reaching the finals. The Sky Blues have started the camp for the campaign on April 7, seven days after the Citycell Super Cup final but training gained momentum soon after their six national players joined having been busy on national duty in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. National stars goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya, defenders Wali Faisal, M Sujan, midfielders Mamunul Islam, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury and striker Jahid Hossain Emily joined the camp on April 2 and interim coach Sattyajit Das Rupu has concentrated on fitness for the last week as regular coach Amolesh Sen has been suffering from jaundice. Abahani's trustworthy Ghanaian striker Awdhu Ibrahim also joined the team a week back while his compatriot defender Samad Yousuf remained with the team from the start of the training. "Nothing will be achieved until the players gain 100 percent fitness and I'm happy to see the present fitness levels of the players, who have been toiling hard for the last seven days," Rupu, also football manager of Abahani, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. It was seen on Tuesday that Abahani's national stars were ahead of the locals in terms of fitness and Rupu was probably concentrating on to reduce the fitness gap between two groups of players. Abahani are placed in Group B along with Turkmenistan premier league champions FC Ashgabat and Sri Lankan premier league champions Sri Lanka Army. The Dhanmondi-based outfit, Abahani, will start their campaign taking on Sri Lanka Army on May 12 before facing last edition semi-finalist FC Ashgabat on May 16. No doubt Abahani will be keen to avoid a repeat of the 4-0 defeat to Nepal Police in the 2008 edition. The Abahani manager said that was a totally different situation as they sat in the airport for long time and lacked practice before facing Nepal. "We will certainly want to make a winning start against Sri Lanka Army as I think the Turkmenistan side will be better compared to us," said Rupu, who has also B-category coaching license of AFC. Rupu thinks a win against Sri Lanka Army will help them finish as best runners-up among three groups if they cannot emerge group champions from their group. Abahani, however, are unlikely to play any practice match before going into the final battle and it may trouble their combination. "I think the lack of practice match will not hamper the combination as the players have almost been together for two and a half years," said Rupu, who, however, was a bit worried over minor injuries of Arif Khan Joy and Wali Faisal. Joy has been suffering from a calf muscle strain while Wali sustained an ankle injury during the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. Abahani's squad including foreign recruits Awdu Ibrahim and Samad Yousuf were featured in the 2008 AFC President's Cup and only midfielder Mehdi Hasan Ujjal was out of the squad. In 2008, Abahani finished third among four teams after losing Nepal Police 4-0, Regar TAdaz of Tajikistan 2-1 and won against Pakistan WAPDA 1-0. bd
