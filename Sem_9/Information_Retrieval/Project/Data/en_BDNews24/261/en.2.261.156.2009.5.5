 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)The United Arab Emirates Tuesday paid about Tk 10 crore to compensate 879 Bangladeshi children for having been used as camel jockeys in the desert nation, the home minister said. A delegation of the UAE government met with Sahara Khatun at the Secretariat to hand over the compensation package of $ 14, 35, 200. The home minister said the victims would get the money ranging from $1000 to $10,000 each in June through the deputy commissioners. The money will be spent on the victims' education, treatment and housing, she added. A total of 906 children, who worked as camel jockeys between Jan 1, 1993 and Jan 21, 2008 in the Gulf nation, applied for the compensation, but 879 will get the it, she said. The rest failed to provide enough evidence or simply did not match other criteria such as age limit and the time of homecoming. Sahara said the government was taking measures so that children are not used in dangerous assignments like working as camel jockeys. "The government is working to check trafficking in children," she said. The government negotiated with the UAE government for the compensation and involved United Nations children's agency UNICEF in the process, the minister said. UAE charg d'affaires Ghazi Abdulla Ashoor, state minister for home Tanzim Ahmed and home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar also attended the occasion. b
