 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP launched on Tuesday a series of protests spread over a month to protest power, water, and gas crises and 'worsening security'. Party supporters were holding processions and rallies in Upazila, districts and metropolises to put pressure on the government to resolve the issues. The protests will run from May 5 through to June 2. On Apr. 23, secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain declared the programmes at BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. On May 14, countrywide rallies and processions will protest the 'deteriorating law and order'. All metropolises, districts and Upazilas would mark May 19 to demand an end to the 'atrocities being committed at educational institutions and politicisation everywhere'. Rallies and processions would march the streets on May 24 demanding reduced manure and diesel prices, cut in commodity prices, right prices for the farm produces and protection of export-focus industries due to recession. June 2 processions and rallies again would protest 'worsening security and growing incidents of murder, robbery, extortion and harassment'. Delwar had said they had been offering the government advice, recommendations and cooperation on a number of issues and subjects over the past months. But the government maligned and slandered their leaders and workers, he alleged. The secretary general had said BNP could not remain nonchalant about the sufferings the people were going through. b
