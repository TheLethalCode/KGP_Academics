<TITLE> Govt's move against 5th amendment politically motivated: Moudud </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) - BNP MP Moudud Ahmed said Tuesday the government's move to withdraw the appeal against the landmark High Court judgment that declared the fifth amendment to the constitution illegal was "politically motivated". Moudud also said the High Court judgment was not right. On Aug 29, 2005, the High Court declared that the fifth amendment and the martial law regulations proclaimed between Aug 15, 1975 and June 1979 was illegitimate. The fifth amendment involves declaration of martial law and takeover of late president Ziaur Rahman and all his acts since August 15, 1975. Apart from Zia's period, it also involves the reigns of presidents Khandakar Moshtaque Ahmed and ASM Sayem. The BNP government had appealed the verdict and it was stayed. The issue came to the fore when attorney general Mahbubey Alam petitioned the Supreme Court last week for withdrawing that appeal. On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain to file a leave-to-appeal petition within four weeks, which means the court will hear the case. Moudud on Tuesday said the annulment of the fifth amendment will create a vacuum in the constitution since its continuity will be affected. The former law minister thinks current government can cancel the fifth amendment by using its majority in the parliament. "It's not right to involve the judiciary in the process. A constitutional void cannot be created for political reasons," he said. "If it is cancelled anarchy and one-party rule will resurface," he said. He said the fifth amendment was necessary since the fourth amendment established a one-party rule and curtailed independence of judiciary, curbed media freedom and the people's basic rights. "The fifth amendment had returned multiparty democracy, freedom of newspapers and judiciary, and the people's basic rights, and added Bismillah to the preamble to constitution," said Moudud. bdne
