 Nepal, May 5 (bdnews24.com)--- A group of Nepalese political parties has agreed to form a "national government" a day after Maoist Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal resigned. Reported BBC online. After a meeting in Kathmandu, members of the Communist UML party agreed to head the government. The parties have been given five days by Nepal's President Ram Baran Yadav to form the government. Mr Dahal, best known as Prachanda, resigned after the president opposed his decision to sack the army chief. The Maoists boycotted the all-party meeting. They said unless the president apologised, they would not let parliament function.
