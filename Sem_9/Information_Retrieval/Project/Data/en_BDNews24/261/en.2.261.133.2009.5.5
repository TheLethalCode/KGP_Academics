<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) The parliamentary panel investigating alleged corruption of former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has decided to ask him, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to appear before it. The all-party committee will sit on May 14 to decide the date to summon them, Fazle Rabbi Mian, who heads the 11-stong probe body speaker Abdul Hamid formed on March 19, told reporters at parliament building on Tuesday. The committee will also question six public servants involved in the alleged irregularities in appointing staff to the parliament secretariat in 'violation of rules' on May 14, he added. "No people should be punished unheard. They must get the chance to defend themselves." Mian said six-seven officers, who were the members of the selection committee for appointment of staff in Sicar administration, must come to clarify their actions. "They did not follow district, women and freedom fighter quotas in the appointment," he said. The chairman said two sub-committees--one on probing Sircar's 'corruption' in appointing staff and the other on misuse of the speaker's medical fund--had submitted reports to the main committee. The May 14 meeting will review the reports. Another sub-committee investigating purchase during Sircar's tenure would submit its findings soon, Mian said. "We are yet to accept the reports. We will discuss them," Mian told bdnews24.com. The Mian committee at its April 13 meeting formed three sub-committees to make the investigation transparent. In the face of demands by the MPs, speaker Abdul Hamid formed the all-party probe committee to investigate the alleged irregularities by Sircar. The committee has also been investigating spending during Sircar's predecessor Abdul Hamid's time. Speaker Hamid was also elected speaker in July 2001 and served until Sircar replaced him on Oct 28, 2001. The committee is supposed to submit the findings to the speaker by May 20.
