 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  Saikat Ali cracked 88 and later Sabbir Hossain claimed four wickets to power the Bangladesh U-19s to a convincing 30-run win over their visiting Sri Lankan counterparts in the third match at Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore on Tuesday. With the second successive triumph at the same venue, the hosts take a 2-1 lead in the five-match one-day series. Chasing a fighting total of 251-9 in 50 overs, Sri Lanka U-19s ended on 221 all out with 7.4 overs to spare in the face of a twin spin attack from Sabbir and Noor Hossain, who together claimed six wickets to wreck the visitors' innings. Sri Lanka got off to a fine start with opener D Chandimal and one-down Rajapakhsa taking their side to 67-2 from 14-1 before the latter was removed by Abul Hossain for 23. But, Chandimal along with Kushal Perera kept the visitors going with a 78-run partnership for the fourth wicket before Sabbir struck removing Chandimal, who blazed 86 off 75 balls that featured nine fours and four sixes. Perera followed Chandimal for 46 and that triggered a collapse and the visitors were restricted to 221 all out in 42.2 overs. Sabbir returned 4-37 while Noor Hossain took 2-43. Earlier, the hosts opted to bat and they put up a decent total on the board, riding on opener Saikat Ali, who hit a scintillating 88 off 75 balls featuring three sixes and nine fours. Tasamul Haq was the second highest scorer with 42 off 60 balls that included six fours and one six. Besides, Mahmudul Hasan (25), Sabbir Ahmed (23), Noor Hossain (25 not out) helped the hosts go beyond the 250-mark. bd
