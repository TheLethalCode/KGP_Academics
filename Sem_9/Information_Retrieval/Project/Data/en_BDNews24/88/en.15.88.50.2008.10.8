 LONDON, Wed Oct 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stock markets across the world slumped on Wednesday as concerns about the worst financial crisis in nearly 80 years and fears of a global recession gripped investors despite government efforts to intervene. Many investors were looking to central banks to come up with concerted cuts in interest rates. MSCI's main benchmark index of world stocks was at around 4-year lows, down 2.7 percent, and its emerging market stock counterpart fell 7 percent. Wall Street looked set for sharp losses at the open. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index tumbled 3.7 percent, off earlier lows, and Tokyo's Nikkei share average plummeted 9.4 percent, the largest single-day percentage decline since October 1987. Government debt prices jumped as the equity selloff reached fever pitch and investors snatched anything resembling stability, such as gold which rose more than 2.5 percent and the Japanese yen. "There is somehow a disbelief in the ability of the system to repair itself," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin. "Certainly it's a very distressing situation we have got into." The sharp market moves came despite efforts by various authorities to inject calm and money into the battered financial system. Britain unveiled a multibillion pound rescue package for British banks that included plans to inject up to 50 billion pounds ($87.84 billion) of government money into the country's biggest operators. It was designed to offer banks short-term liquidity, make new capital available and give the banking system enough funds to maintain lending in the medium-term. RATE CUTS NEEDED? U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, meanwhile, warned on Tuesday that turmoil in markets could cause U.S. economic activity to be subdued into 2009 and signaled a readiness to cut interest rates. Bernanke's sobering tone about the likelihood of rate cuts came days after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet suggested last week the euro zone too could cut rates. The Bank of England delivers its latest rate decision on Thursday and is expected to ease. However, with the upcoming Group of Seven rich nations meeting on Friday, investors have begun to look for coordinated action to snuff out what has become a severe global threat. "Bernanke and Trichet have clearly opened the door to rate cuts at any point via their recent speeches," Paul Mortimer-Lee, economist at BNP Paribas, said in a note. "What we'd like to ask central banks is: If not now, guys, then when?" HISTORIC LOSSES The losses on stock markets this week have been huge. MSCI's world index, a gauge which many investors use to judge their performance has already lost 11.6 percent since Friday's close and is on track for its worse week in the 20 years it has been in its current form. The emerging market benchmark is in the same boat, losing 17.6 percent for the week to date. The FTSEurofirst, meanwhile, was touched 5 year lows on Wednesday before recovering slightly. "Obviously equities are not the flavor of the month to put it mildly," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. In credit markets -- at the heart of the crisis because of a freezing up of lending -- UK banks were standing out, with the cost of insuring their debt against default falling sharply after the government bail out. But the Markit iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated European credits, was at 634 basis points, according to data from Markit, 19 basis points wider than late on Tuesday. Money markets also showed no sign of thawing with the cost of interbank borrowing staying way above official rates. Three-month dollar interbank rates were quoted as high as 6.00 percent on Reuters system. This compares with market expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to at least 1.25 percent by January. Euro rates for the same period stood at 5.35 percent on Reuters system, compared with the benchmark ECB rate of 4.25 percent. YEN JUMPS, YIELDS FALL The low-yielding yen surged across the board as investors rushed to unwind riskier positions. The yen hit a 6-month high against the dollar and a 3-year high against the euro, while higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar fell sharply against the yen. The dollar was down 1.6 percent at 99.65 yen, after hitting a low of 98.62 yen, according to Reuters data. The euro was down 1.4 percent at 135.78 yen. Interest rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield was down 22 basis points at 2.954 percent
