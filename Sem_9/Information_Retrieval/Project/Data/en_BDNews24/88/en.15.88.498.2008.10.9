<TEXT>
 MALE, Thu Oct 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asia's longest-serving ruler got the most votes in the Maldives' first multiparty presidential poll, but the provisional final tally on Thursday showed him with less than the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff vote. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom had 40.6 percent of all votes, which represented 85.5 percent turnout of the 208,252 registered voters, Election Commissioner Mohamed Ibrahim said. In second place with 25.1 percent was chief challenger Mohamed Nasheed, a former journalist and pro-democracy activist whom Gayoom had jailed repeatedly over his 30 years ruling a tropical paradise with a mythical appeal on par with Zanzibar or Tahiti. "These are the final preliminary results. A formal announcement will be made at 11:30 p.m. (1830 GMT)," Ibrahim said in a brief statement. Under democratic reforms Gayoom signed into law in August after years of criticism that he ruled the palm-dotted archipelago like a personal sultanate, a runoff must be held within 10 days if no one gets 50 percent of the vote. Polling started on Wednesday and stretched 12 hours past its scheduled end into Thursday, with complaints of vote-rigging and missing voter registrations marring the exercise. Diplomats had hoped the election in the sleepy Maldives, home to 300,000 Sunni Muslims, would provide an example of a credible democratic election in a Muslim majority nation which has seen an increase in fundamentalism. Gayoom, 71, campaigned on his record of using tourism to transform what had been a fishing-based economy into one that gives its citizens South Asia's highest per-capita income. Tourism directly accounts for 28 percent of GDP. But critics say those benefits only went to a small group of friends and family surrounding Gayoom, while high rates of child malnutrition, heroin addiction and poverty beset many of the archipelago's residents
