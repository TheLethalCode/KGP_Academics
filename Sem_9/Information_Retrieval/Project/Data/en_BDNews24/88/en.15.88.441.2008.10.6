 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Norway's telecoms giant Telenor, which has 62 percent stakes in Grameenphone, is eager to invest more in Bangladesh, the company's top official was quoted to have told the chief adviser on Monday. Visiting Telenor chairman Harald Norvik, accompanied by chief executive Fredik Baksaas and a member of the board, met Fakhruddin Ahmed at the latter's office. "This was just a courtesy meeting, and they discussed possibilities of new investment and GP's planned IPO," said a senior government official, who attended the meeting and did not want to be named. The government official, however, said the meeting did not mention the ongoing dispute between Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and the world's seventh largest mobile phone company over the management and ownership of US$ 3.2 billion Grameenphone, Bangladesh's biggest. Their visit follows an announcement last month that the Grameenphone CEO, Anders Jensen, would leave the company by the end of the year "for personal reasons". Grameenphone said this was a regular visit by the top Telenor officials. They arrived Monday morning and met the head of government hours later. Telenor has businesses -- mobile, fixed phone, broadband and broadcast services -- in 12 countries, with a subscriber base of 150 million. b
