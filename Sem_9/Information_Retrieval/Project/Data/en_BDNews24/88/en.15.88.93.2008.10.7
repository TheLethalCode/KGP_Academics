<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Tue Oct 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tata Motors Ltd, which is looking for a new home for the ultra low-cost Nano car as it nears its planned launch, will hold a news conference later on Tuesday in Gujarat, a spokesman said. Tata Motors' Chairman Ratan Tata and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi will jointly address a media conference at 5:30 p.m., the spokesman said in a text message that did not give further details. Television news channels, citing unnamed sources, said the state, which has a reputation for being business-friendly, had allocated more than 1,000 acres for the plant near Ahmedabad, and had promised other fiscal incentives. Tata Motors has no facilities in Gujarat currently. At 0845 GMT shares in Tata Motors were up 1.5 percent at 318.50 rupees in a Mumbai market down 1.5 percent. "The expectation is there won't be any more disruptions or delays," said Vineet Hetamasaria, auto analyst at B&K Securities. "They can have a plant up and running in 7-8 months, and do a limited rollout," he said, estimating the impact of the delay in ramping up production would be felt in the 2009/10 fiscal year, which starts next April. Also, the project cost would be higher because of the pressure of inflation and rising commodity costs, he said. Tata Motors, India's top vehicle maker, on Friday pulled out of West Bengal, where violent protests by farmers unhappy with the compensation for their land had led to suspension of work for more than a month at the Nano factory. Tata Motors had planned to make 250,000 Nanos, billed as the world's cheapest car, from around October. It has also received offers for land from states including Karnataka and Uttarakhand. Analysts have said the company, which had invested about $350 million in the West Bengal site, could roll out hundreds or a few thousand of Nano cars initially from existing facilities. The company has said eventual demand for the Nano, which is expected to be priced at just above 100,000 rupees ($2,080), would be about 1 million units. The Peoples' Car, as it has been dubbed, was unveiled to a rousing reception in January and encouraged others including Renault/Nissan, Ford Motor, General Motors, Toyota Motor and Volkswagen to announce plans for low-cost cars
