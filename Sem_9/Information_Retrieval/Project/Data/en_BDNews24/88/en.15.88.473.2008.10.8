 MADRID, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Recreativo Huelva have sacked coach Manolo Zambrano after their poor start to the season and will replace him with former boss Lucas Alcaraz, the Primera Liga club said in a statement on Tuesday. The Andalucians slipped to 18th in the standings after being hammered 4-0 at home by promoted Malaga on Sunday, and have taken only four points from their first six games. Zambrano was promoted from within to replace Victor Munoz in February and just managed to steer them to safety at the end of last season. Alcaraz, who will be presented later on Tuesday, guided Recre to promotion to the top flight in 2002 and, while he could not prevent an immediate return to division two, won widespread praise for his team's attack-minded football in his three seasons at the helm. Under his guidance Recreativo also reached their first final of the King's Cup, where they lost 3-0 to Real Mallorca in 2003. Alcaraz stepped down and went on to have spells with Racing Santander and Real Murcia
