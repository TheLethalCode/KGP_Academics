<TITLE> Vettori not underestimating Bangladesh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said his team was not underestimating Bangladesh ahead of the ODI and Test series, especially the bowling line-up on a subcontinent wicket. The Kiwi skipper was speaking before the media in an official press conference on Sunday, five days after their arrival here on Sept 30, at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. "I think most countries who come to Bangladesh know that they are in for a difficult time. Their record may not be great at this stage but they have (Mashrafee) Mortaza, Shahadat (Hossain) and Abdur Razzak and I think they have got a nice bowling line-up. In their own conditions, they are going to be a formidable opposition for us," said Vettori. But, the Black Caps skipper said he was still confident of winning the series, despite the "tough challenge". "We have come here expecting to win so nothing less than that would work for us, but we are not going to underestimate Bangladesh." Vettori also did not forget to mention that his side would climb up to number two in the world ODI ranking if they could whitewash the hosts in the three ODI series, beginning Oct 9. "Obviously winning the one-day series 3-0 would make us number two in the world and that would be very special," said the 29-year old cricketer. Asked whether the Bangladeshi exodus for the Indian Cricket League had weakened side, Vettori said, "I think from my understanding the only player they are missing is Aftab Ahmed. That's obviously a loss." "But the rest of the team remains pretty much what we have faced in New Zealand. So we are expecting a similar sort of side." On the typical subcontinent wicket, Vettori believed he himself and Jeetan Patel along with Scot Styris and Jessie Ryder could cover it. "I think it will have plenty of runs in it and as it wears, it will start to take some turn. So we have got to cover that with myself and Jeetan Patel and guys like Scot Styris and maybe Jessie Ryder. "I think we are pretty comfortable with the condition and it is like anywhere you turn up, you have to adapt to what's going on, because Bangladesh know the condition better than anyone." The leg-arm spinner Vettori was the leading wicket-taker to have claimed 20 wickets in two Tests during the Kiwis first tour of Bangladesh four years back and he dreams of the same feat here again. "We came across two very good wickets for bowling spin on and put ourselves in very strong position with some batting performance. If we can run the same model here and put up some big scores and hopefully win on the fourth or fifth day, then obviously myself and Jitan have a very good chance to do it again." The Kiwis captain also conceded the difference in terms of strength between two sides, but he singled out the strength Bangladeshi players individually. "If you look at the Bangladesh players from an individual level you have got some guys who have performed at the world stage. "Their captain Ashraful we all know he can play and on his day he can be a world beater. Like I said before they have got very good bowling line up. Their reputation or their results may not be what they wanted but we still look at them individually and they are exciting. "If we are not on top of our game then they can upset us and that's the thing we are trying to avoid here." b
