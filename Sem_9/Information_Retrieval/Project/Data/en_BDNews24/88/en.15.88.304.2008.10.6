<TEXT>
 MADRID, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A second-half goal from Manuel Fernandes gave Valencia a 1-0 victory at Real Valladolid and saw them regain top spot in the Primera Liga on Sunday. The victory helped Valencia draw alongside Villarreal on 16 points from six games but they have the superior goal difference. Fernandes collected the ball outside the box and struck home a low shot to secure his fifth victory of the campaign. Real Madrid twice came from behind to secure a 2-2 draw with Espanyol at the Bernabeu. Raul Tamudo's 21st-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead but Raul levelled four minutes later. Luis Garcia's nicely hit chip restored the lead on 31 minutes for Espanyol before Raul slipped through the visitors' defence and levelled in first-half stoppage time as Real moved to fifth on 13 points. Earlier on Sunday, Sevilla moved to within two points of the pace with a 4-0 demolition of Athletic Bilbao. Mali striker Frederic Kanoute broke the deadlock after a scrappy opening from Sevilla, slipping home the opener on 26 minutes after an error from Bilbao defender Mikel Balenziag. Renato doubled the lead five minutes before the break before second-half goals from Adriano Correia and Ernesto Chevanton completed the rout which put Sevilla on 14 points. Sporting Gijon broke a five-game losing streak with a 2-0 win at Real Mallorca which lifted them from the bottom of the table at the expense of Real Betis, who lost 2-1 at Villarreal on Saturday. Almeria scored twice in the final minutes to carve out a 2-2 draw at Getafe, Alvara Negredo scoring with three minutes to go and Chico adding a second a minute into injury time to earn a point that put them in sixth spot
