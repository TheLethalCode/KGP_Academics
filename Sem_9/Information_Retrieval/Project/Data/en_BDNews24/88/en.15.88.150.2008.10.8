 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) New political party United Citizens Movement was launched Wednesday by Proshika chairman Kazi Faruk Ahmed, who said their immediate challenge was to contest in the upcoming general election. The party was launched at a press conference at the Engineering Institution auditorium. "Bangladesh is limping forward. We will re-establish the human rights that have been snatched from us," said the new party's chief. Ahmed pledged to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor, saying: "We will reduce the tax burden imposed on the less well off." "We will establish a society where justice is ensured and state power stands for the poor, women, and the oppressed," he said. At the launch of the party, London resident and columnist Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury said he firmly believed in the aims of the United Citizens' Movement. "As a strong mid-left political power, the UCM will be able to coordinate with political parties that sympathise with the liberation spirit," he said. The Proshika chief announced the launch of the new party on Oct 6, and has told the Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman that wishes to join the AL-led grand alliance. "I have had talks with the acting AL president about joining the grand alliance and he has responded positively," Ahmed told reporters. "We want to work with democratic, progressive and pro-liberation forces," he added. bdnews24
