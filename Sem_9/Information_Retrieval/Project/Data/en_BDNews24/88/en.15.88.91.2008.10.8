<TITLE> Bangladesh look to leave ICL saga behind </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  A depleted Bangladesh look to fill the void created by the ICL exodus when they take on New Zealand in the three one-day internationals series opener on Thursday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The exodus prompted the selectors to pick three rookies in the side and two of them have been drafted in the 12-member squad for Thursday's match. Uncapped opener Imrul Kayes and middle-order batsman Mehrab Hossain Jr have been left out of the squad. The match is scheduled to start at 9:00am with the state-run television Bangladesh Television beaming the match live from the venue. "Obviously there was a little bit of hiccup with the ICL players leaving and new players coming in. It's not easy to change one player, let alone three players in a team," coach Jamie Siddons said at a press conference after the practice at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. "It's never easy to have changes in the team and we had a lot of changes." The Australian coach was confident that his players would do well this time despite an awful series in Australia in August where the Tigers hit a new low of 74, two short of their previous one-day lowest totals against India and Sri Lanka. "We want to win and that's why we are here. I think generally we are improving in batting and bowling, which has been good in the last few games. I think we can see good results. "The players are looking very good; they are looking very united and a happy group at the moment. So I am looking forward to see what happens tomorrow (Thursday)," said the coach. Of 15 members who toured Australia, six players joined the breakaway Indian Cricket League severely depleting Bangladesh's fragile batting. Siddons believed that the cricketers' departure was a great loss to Bangladesh. The coach would apparently miss the service of middle-order batsman Alok Kapali, who hammered a hundred against India in the Asia Cup. "On the particular thing, Alok Kapali played one amazing innings in Asia Cup, if he could repeat that he would have been a superstar and who knows maybe he would have been, he still will be but he won't be for Bangladesh unfortunately." With Kapali's departure and Roqibul Hassan's finger injury, Bangladesh are likely to struggle in the middle order and Nayeem Islam is expected to make his debut against New Zealand on Thursday. "I can realise the difference between international and local matches, and I have prepared myself in the camp keeping those things in mind. I will try to do well if I get to play," said Nayeem. He had a fine time with both bat and ball with the Bangladesh Academy side during the tours of Sri Lanka, South Africa and England. Captain Mohammad Ashraful expects a good start from the top order to push the opponents hard. He was also confident of his bowlers. "We are concentrating on our batting instead of thinking about the opponents and we will go there for win. We hope all of us will show you good cricket," said Ashraful. The Bangladesh skipper knows it very well that his contribution could make things different and he promised that he would bat as situation called for. Coach Siddons said Ashraful was Bangladesh's potential match-winner but he needs to be patient. "He definitely needs to perform as a captain and as a player. We need him to perform. And we are a much better team when Ashraful performs. He has got the ability." "I think Ashraful has got to accept that he has got to be patient.... he has limitations. He can't play every shot when the fielder is out. He has got to hold, play little bit sensibly." Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Nayeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Shahadat Hossain and Mahbubul Alam Robin. b
