<TEXT>
 Taipei,Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's top negotiator on Taiwan will meet the island's president for the first time, a Taipei official said on Thursday, in what would be a further sign of improved relations between the diplomatic rivals. The two sides would sign deals on regular flights and direct cargo shipments, P.K. Chiang, Taiwan's top negotiator on China policy, told Reuters. Chen Yunlin, head of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, will meet President Ma Ying-jeou in Taiwan at the end of October or at the beginning of November, Chiang said. China's Taiwan Affairs Office was unavailable for comment. China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has vowed to bring the island back under mainland rule, by force if necessary. But relations have greatly improved since Ma came to office in May. During Chen's visit, which would be the highest level by a Chinese official to Taiwan, the two sides would sign deals allowing direct daily passenger flights, a launch of cargo flights and direct cargo sea routes between the two sides, Chiang said. b
