<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sepp Blatter wants stricter rules on foreign ownership of European clubs which has left soccer exposed amid the economic downturn, the FIFA president said on Monday. "There must be better control of football's finances especially in the difficult financial climate we are facing," Blatter told reporters at the European Parliament. "Something has to be done about these billionaire owners so I urge UEFA to work with the European Union (EU) to tighten up the rules  otherwise there will be big financial difficulties in the future." The surge of foreign investment by wealthy businessmen in clubs, notably in England, was one of the issues the head of world soccer's governing body addressed with EU lawmakers in Brussels. "It seems these days you can buy a club as easily as you buy a football jersey," Blatter said. "There is something wrong here and that's why I ask the EU to act. Some of these owners prefer horse racing, others like to buy a Formula One team, now buying a football club is the big attraction." OVERSEAS INVESTMENTS European soccer's governing body UEFA is investigating whether there should be tighter ownership rules and has questioned the motive of owners and the sustainability of large overseas investments. Last month Manchester City became the latest English Premier League club to be bought by wealthy foreign investors, the Abu Dhabi United Group, following in the footsteps of neighbours Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea among others. Liverpool's U.S. owners have delayed the building of a new stadium due to the worldwide credit crunch. Question marks have also been raised over United's record shirt sponsorship deal with insurer AIG which was subject to a U.S. bailout last month. "This is not just about England where the problem is acute," said Blatter. "This will spread across Europe, that's why it needs to be addressed." He said he had "no single remedy" but added owners should have some link or association with the community in which they were buying a club. "There are such national laws in Switzerland for example when you buy property or make an investment, you must prove yourself. You have to prove your link with the area," Blatter said. "We must ask ourselves about what motivates these owners and are they really interested in the game or just making money?"
