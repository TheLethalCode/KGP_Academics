 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) Chairman of the Public Service Commission Dr Saadat Husain announced Wednesday that the probable date for the 28th Bangladesh Civil Service preliminary examination would be November 28. "The PSC is aiming to hold the 28th BCS examination towards the end of November. Friday, November 28 is the most probable date, although the exact date has not been finalised," said Dr Hussain. According to a PSC official, about 1,20,000 applications have been deposited with the Commission, against 1,720 available vacancies in different service cadres. Retired Brigadier General and PSC member Abidur Reza Khan has been put in charge of holding the upcoming examinations. The PSC chief went on to encourage those who failed the 27th BCS examination to try again, while stressing the Commission had worked "honestly and sincerely in organising the 27th BCS results publication". Dr Husain also denied allegations that the children of freedom fighters had been excluded from the process: "Such allegations are totally baseless." "I'm a freedom fighter myself. A good number of freedom fighters' children qualified and secured recommendations for employment," said the PSC chairman. The PSC is also making efforts to notify the 29th BCS examinees of their schedules by January 2009, he added. bdne
