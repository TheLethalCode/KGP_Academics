 ISLAMABAD, Mon Oct 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 12 people and wounded a leading Pakistani opposition politician and member of the minority Shia Muslim community on Monday, police said. The attack targeted the home of Rashid Akbar Khan Nawani, a member of parliament for former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's party, in the town of Bhakkar, 260 km (160 miles) southwest of Islamabad. "The bomber blew himself up the courtyard when Mr. Nawani was sitting with his supporters there," Khadim Hussain, a police officer, told Reuters. Shaukat Javed, police chief of Punjab, said 12 people were killed. Nawani has spoken out in parliament several times recently against growing sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Deep in the central province of Punjab, Bhakkar is in an area where sectarian tensions have run high. "It could a sectarian related attack as he belongs to the Shia community," Khan Baig, a senior police officer in the region said. Several Sunni militant groups, like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, that regard Shias as their enemy, also share a similar world view to al Qaeda and have forged links with Osama bin Laden's network
