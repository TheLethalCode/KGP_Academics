 KARALETI, Georgia, Wed Oct 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian troops completed a pullback on Wednesday from buffer zones next to breakaway Georgian regions that it had established during a war between the two countries in August, a Georgian official said. "We can confirm that from the so-called buffer zones the withdrawal is complete," Georgian Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said. There was no immediate confirmation from a European Union mission monitoring the pullback from the two zones, which are on Georgian territory adjoining the rebel, pro-Russian areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Mission head Hansjoerg Haber said earlier in the day that Russia "seems to have completed most of the withdrawal" but that verification continued. Interfax news agency quoted a Russian Defense Ministry official as saying Russian troops had closed down all six of their checkpoints in the buffer zone around South Ossetia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had said the withdrawal would be completed by midnight, ahead of a Friday deadline contained in a ceasefire deal brokered by France on behalf of the EU. The zones were created outside the two regions, which have unilaterally broken away from Georgia, after Russia sent tanks and troops to repel a Georgian offensive to retake South Ossetia in August. Russia plans to keep 7,600 troops in the rebel regions, which it recognized as independent states after the war
