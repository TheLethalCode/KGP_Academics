 SRINAGAR, Tue Oct 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in Kashmir on Tuesday lifted a curfew imposed to thwart a massive pro-independence rally, as separatist called for calm with the start of harvesting and marriage season in the Himalayan region. Over the past two months Kashmir has seen some of the biggest anti-India protests since a separatist revolt against Indian rule broke out in the mountainous state in 1989. About 40 people have been shot dead by security forces and hundreds injured in protests that have become an embarrassment for the government. As Indian authorities lifted the curfew imposed two days ago, separatist leaders told strife-weary Kashmiris to resume "normal life". The protests subsided for few weeks during the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan which ended on Sept. 30. Autumn has now set in and farmers have started harvesting, mostly apple, rice and wheat. "Let farmers harvest their crop at ease...no examination or marriage should get affected," local newspapers quoted hardline separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, as saying. "A future (protest) programme will be announced soon," he added. Tens of thousands of Indian troops thwarted a planned rally on Monday in Lal Chowk (Red Square), the historic centre of Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar. The government has banned public gatherings for a month in the Muslim-majority region to prevent demonstrations. Indian security forces have been criticised by Kashmiris and international human rights groups for using excessive force to quell protests in a region. The latest round of protests come at a time when violence involving Indian troops and separatist guerrillas has declined significantly since India and Pakistan, which both claim the region, began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. Tens of thousands of people have been killed during the past 20 years
