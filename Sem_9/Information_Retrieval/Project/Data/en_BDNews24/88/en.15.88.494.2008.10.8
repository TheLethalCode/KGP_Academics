<TITLE> Maldives holds historic presidential poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Male,Oct 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Voting began in the Maldives' first multiparty presidential election on Wednesday, in a poll seen as a referendum on President's Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's 30 year-rule on islands famed for their luxury resorts. Asia's longest-serving leader is seeking a seventh term running the archipelago of 300,000 people, mostly Sunni Muslims, which in the past he has been accused of ruling like a personal sultanate -- a form of government abolished there in 1968. The poll in the sleepy Maldives, best known as a tropical luxury hideaway for Hollywood stars, is the culmination of years of agitation for democratic reforms which Gayoom, 71, finally signed into law in August. A few dozen people were in line at polling stations around the capital Male when voting got under way at 9 a.m. (0400 GMT). There was great enthusiasm, despite heavy rain. "I feel very proud to do this for my country. Today is a new kind of election. I think it will be very fair," Mohamed Mahfouz, a 35-year-old fashion designer, said after casting his ballot. Despite some fears of rigging and minor threats against political figures earlier this week, the archipelago of 1,196 islands located 800 km off the tip of India was calm, with a heavy police and military presence. "This election will be very open, very different and very free. The last couple of years we have been practising for this change. I'll be voting for more changes," taxi driver Ali Majeed, 33, said. Polling was taking place at 396 polling stations spread out across the archipelago's nearly 200 inhabited atolls and on some islands with luxury resorts. The electoral commission says 209,000 people have registered to vote. Voting was due to close at 8 p.m. (1500 GMT) with a preliminary result expected within a few hours, the electoral commission said. The official announcement was due on Thursday at 1130 p.m. (1830 GMT). SMALL ELITE Many Maldivians complain that a small political elite has grown rich from tourism, which is the linchpin of the $850 million economy and accounts for 28 percent of GDP. Diplomats hope the poll will be an example of a peaceful and fair democratic election in a Muslim majority nation, with a non-violent transition should power change hands. Most Maldivians expect a runoff, with Gayoom and his longtime opposition nemesis Mohamed Nasheed tipped as favourites, and are sceptical the poll will proceed without bribery and vote-rigging. A runoff date will be announced if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote. Gayoom on Tuesday promised to hand over power peacefully if he loses. Nasheed, known as Ani, has been charged dozens of times by Gayoom's government in what human rights watchdogs say are trumped-up cases, the latest of which was dropped just last month after prosecutors admitted a lack of evidence. Gayoom drew international criticism after a heavy-handed crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, which eventually led to his signing into law a new constitution last month that established an independent judiciary and electoral body. It also abolished the old style of voting for president, where a parliament-approved candidate stood in a referendum. Those elections saw Gayoom returned to power six times with what he said was more than 90 percent of the vote. Whoever wins will inherit two major challenges -- sustaining an economy dependent on tourism and fishing, and rising seas. A UN climate change panel is predicting seas are likely to rise up to 59 cm by 2100, and most of the Maldives' islands are no higher than 1.5 m above sea level
