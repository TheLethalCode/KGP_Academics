<TEXT>
 HARARE, Tue Oct 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition MDC party said on Tuesday talks on forming a cabinet with President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF were deadlocked over all key ministries and called for urgent African mediation. The two sides have been unable to agree on sharing out cabinet posts since an outline power-sharing deal on Sept. 15. "The MDC dismisses ZANU-PF claims that only two cabinet posts are yet to be resolved," the opposition said in a statement. The MDC said help was needed from regional grouping SADC and the African Union to break the impasse. A senior ZANU-PF official said on Monday that Mugabe is expected to meet opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in the next two days in another attempt to break a deadlock over cabinet posts. "The negotiating teams have not met since the meeting between the three principals on Saturday to discuss the outstanding issues," said the MDC, adding there had been no contact between the two parties. "Considering the fact that it is now exactly 21 days after the signing of the global agreement, the cabinet deadlock calls for the urgent help and assistance from SADC and AU as guarantors of the deal to unfreeze the impasse," said the MDC
