 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain has said the campaign schedules for upcoming parliamentary and upazila polls will be made to coincide, pointing out that it will be difficult therefore for the same candidate to contest both elections. The commissioner told bdnews24.com Sunday: "The candidate will have to pick one of two elections, as the campaign periods will coincide." "There is no bar under electoral law for a candidate to run in both elections" he said. But, Sakhawat pointed out, there would be separate election symbols for upazila and national elections. "It will very difficult for a candidate to appeal for votes under different two symbols." The EC will also maintain the same deadline for submission and scrutiny of nomination papers for the two sets of elections, the election official said. "The district commissioner will be the returning officer for national elections and additional district commissioner for upazila polls. So officials will not be overburdened during simultaneous submission and scrutiny of papers for two sets of polls," he added. The election schedules will be announced in the first week of November, the EC has said. Sakhawat said the schedules would thereby be given 45-50 days ahead of both sets of polls. The chief adviser, in an address to the nation last month, announced Dec 18 as the date for parliamentary polls. Elections to upazilas will follow in less than a week in two phases, on Dec 24 and Dec 28. Campaigning is not normally allowed more than 21 days ahead of elections and all campaign activities must come to an end 32 hours prior to elections, according to the electoral laws. Officials of the EC Secretariat say in that case campaigning for parliamentary polls would normally start from Nov 27, and continue until Dec 17. For the two phased upazila elections, campaign activities would normally be allowed from Dec 3 and Dec 7. However, Sakhawat told bdnews24.com that an exception would be made in the case of the upcoming upazila polls to begin campaign activities more than 21 days ahead of the polls, to coincide with the campaign period for the parliamentary election. "Campaign timings of parliamentary and upazila polls will be made simultaneous in the election schedules." "They will start at the same time, and when the general election campaigning comes to an end, the upazila campaigning will be brought to an end too." The EC believes in this way there will be no scope for upazila campaigning to interfere with the general election. "There will be no chance for upazila campaigns immediately prior to or after the general election." The commissioner also mentioned that prospective candidates in some districts were putting up election posters during the Eid and Puja holidays, violating the election code of conduct. Sakhawat said the EC would ask district election officers and deputy commissioners of police to address these violations during scrutiny of candidates' nomination papers for both sets of polls. bdnews2
