 Dhaka, Oct 07 (bdnews24.com) The visiting deputy head of the Myanmar military junta has praised Bangladesh's "Look East Policy" and the caretaker government's reform measures. Speaking at a banquet hosted Tuesday night by Fakhruddin Ahmed at Hotel Sonargaon, Vice Senior General Maung Aye said his visit would strengthen relations between the two governments and the armed forces. The chief adviser in his banquet speech said the general's visit would take forward Bangladesh-Myanmar relations further and suggested "better air and shipping connectivity" with Yangon. "During our brief visit, we witnessed the impressive developments taking place in Bangladesh," said the Mynamar general, who was accompanied by cabinet ministers and chiefs of air and navy forces as part of a 55-strong entourage. "We have also noted with interest the reform measures being undertaken by your government for the best interest of the country," General Maung Aye said in his written speech. He said his country always maintained very friendly relations with Bangladesh. "As my delegation includes high ranking officials from our armed forces, I am confident that our present visit would further consolidate the friendly relations between the two governments and between the two armed forces," he said. He attributed the improved Bangladesh-Myanmar relations to the "Look East Policy" pursued by Dhaka in recent years. "The traditional ties of our friendly relations have been further strengthened by our policy of maintaining friendly relations with its neighbours and your government's adherence to the look east policy initiative," he said. "We highly appreciate this particular policy initiative which has resulted in a rapid increase in the bilateral interactions between our two countries," the general said. Fakhruddin Ahmed said the two countries would sign more bilateral deals "shortly". "Not so long ago, we reached an agreement on direct road link between our two countries. It was a landmark event in the developing road connectivity in the region. "We look forward to better shipping and air connectivity, which, as we all know, will enhance trade and increase people to people contact," said Fakhruddin Ahmed. "We firmly believe that after this visit there would be a giant leap in our bilateral relations," he said. b
