<TITLE> Chargesheet against Khaleda a threat to fair polls: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has claimed the chargesheet submitted by the Anticorruption Commission against Khaleda Zia was an obstacle to holding fair polls. "None can be prevented from polls through threat or intimidation. The government must withdraw such a false case in the interests of fair elections," Delwar told reporters at his NAM flat home. The BNP leader said: "The government should not act to spoil the electoral atmosphere." The ACC submitted the chargesheet against 16 people including the BNP chairperson and ten former ministers in the Barapukuria coalmine case on Sunday. Referring to a statement by election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hussain on Sunday, Delwar said they could not trust the EC. "They change their words moment to moment," he said. Sohul Hossain had said Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina could contest the polls, if they remained un-convicted. Delwar said, "The EC has said there was no obstacle for them to participating in the polls. But the ACC has submitted charge sheets against them to deter them from contesting polls." Submission of the chargesheet was intentional and the case was aimed at putting mental pressure on Khaleda, Delwar alleged. "Khaleda Zia and other leaders cannot be barred from the polls or made ineligible in the polls with these cases. Judicial means used to deter the leaders from polls is not acceptable." Repeating the four party alliance's 5-point demand, including withdrawal of the state of emergency and deferment of upazilla polls, Delwar said: "The proper electoral atmosphere may be created through compliance of these demands." Delwar once more expressed fear that a congenial atmosphere for the national polls would be difficult amid the state of emergency. bdnew
