 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Cricket Board on Monday named three uncapped players in a 14-member squad for the three one-day internationals against visiting New Zealand. The three rookies are Imrul Kayes, Nayeem Islam and Mahbubul Alam Robin. "We have considered the junior players this time as some slots of the national team were open after some cricketers left recently and we hope the newcomers will do well," chief selector Rafiqul Alam said at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Imrul Kayes comes in for retired openers Shahriar Nafees and Nazimuddin while middle-order batsman Nayeem Islam has been included in the place of injured Roqibul Hassan, who is still nursing a finger injury he sustained during the Australia tour in August. Pacer Mahbubul Alam has come in for Dollar Mahmud. Eight top cricketers last month retired from international cricket to play in the breakaway Indian Cricket League, leaving a big void in the national team. Alam, accompanied by two other selectors Akram Khan and Naimur Rahman Durjoy, faced a barrage of questions on whether the selectors ignored the experienced players included in the 24-member provisional squad. "They (senior players) were included in the provisional squad as the options of the international players was reduced after the exodus," said Alam. Asked why opener Nafis Iqbal was ignored despite better showings in the practice matches, Alam said, "He was out of international cricket for two and a half year and he was not with the Academy team, who get the best practice facilitates after the national team." Alam, however, said Nafis might be considered in the two Test series against New Zealand and the Bangladesh tour of South Africa in November. The chief selector remained silent when asked whether they should include a middle-order batsman instead of fourth seamer Mahbubul considering the home condition. Among the 15 members for the away series against Australia in August, fast bowlers Nazmul Hossain and Dollar Mahmud have been axed. Nazimuddin, Nafees, who had pulled out of the Australia series due to exam), Alok Kapali, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and all-rounder Farhad Reza joined the ICL. Medium pacer Syed Rasel and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim returned to the fold. The first ODI takes place on Oct 9 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah Riyad, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Shahadat Hossain, Imrul Kayes, Naeem Islam and Mahbubul Alam Robin. b
