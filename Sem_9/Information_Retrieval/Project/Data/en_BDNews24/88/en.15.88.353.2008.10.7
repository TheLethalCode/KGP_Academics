 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The trial of the two cases on the August 21 grenade attack has been deferred again, to Oct. 14, after pro-Awami League lawyers sough time to defend the plaintiff. Judge Md Masdar Hossain of Speedy Trial Tribunal-1, Dhaka, on Tuesday granted time petitions of the Awami Ainjibi Parishad lawyers. He deferred framing charges against the accused in the case for the seventh time and set Oct. 14 for the next hearing. The time petition read: "We've not yet been able to secure necessary permission from the law ministry solicitor's wing to assist the public prosecutor of the government side on our own expenses. We hope to get it in a day or two though." Advocates Sajawar Hossain, Qamrul Islam and others conducted the appeal hearing, when 13 accused in the cases including former deputy education minister Abdus Salam Pintu and disbanded militant outfit Harkatul Jihad chief Mufti Abdul Hannan were produced in the court. The bailed out accused Shahadat Allah Jewel also showed up in the court, while eight other accused have been fleeing justice. During the hearing, Pintu said to the court, "Based on Harkatul Jihad chief Mufti Abdul Hannan's confessional statement, I was arrested, having been accused of being involved in the attack." "Hannan in his statement had also named the central leaders of Harkatul Jihad; but they were excluded from the charge sheet. The CID didn't try to nab them either." bdnew
