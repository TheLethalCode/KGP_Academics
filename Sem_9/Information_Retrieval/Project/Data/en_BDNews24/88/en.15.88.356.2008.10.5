 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) The cabinet Sunday gave the go-ahead to plans for private postal operators to be regulated by law, a government spokesman said. "Certain sections of the 1889 Post Office Act are being amended to bring the private postal operators under the law," press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said. "Immediately after vetting by the law ministry the proposed ordinance will be presented before the cabinet again for final approval." Munaim said the cabinet move followed a Regulatory Reforms Commission recommendation. The regular weekly meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday afternoon, also discussed dearness allowance for some top functionaries and price of government land. Munaim said the cabinet asked the law ministry to look into a proposed ordinance aimed to raise pay for those holding constitutional posts. A 20 per cent DA for the government officers and employees has been in effect since July 1 this year. The works ministry was told to give a "comprehensive proposal" on refixing price of land under the ministry as well as revised fees for flat and plot ownership transfer, Munaim said. The works ministry would also have to consult the ministries of law and finance. Both proposals will return to the cabinet after the review and scrutiny, Munaim said.
