 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court will hear on Oct. 12 former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's petition for bail in the Noor Ali extortion case. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the defence to file a regular appeal in the meantime against the High Court order rejecting Hasina's bail appeal. Chamber judge Joynul Abedeen's vacation bench gave the order after hearing both sides' arguments on Monday. "We had filed a probational appeal against the High Court order in the Noor Ali case. Simultaneously, we also filed bail prayers," Hasina's counsel barrister Fazle Noor Tapash said to bdnews24.com. "The court set October 12 for hearing the bail prayer before a regular Appellate Division bench. We have also been told to file regular appeal against the High Court order by this time." Her chief counsel barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq said during the hearing, "The government released Sheikh Hasina on parole for treatment abroad. She has appealed for bail on medical grounds, as she is under treatment now." Additional attorney general Mansur Habib opposed the move said Hasina had been paroled on health grounds, which has been extended by another month. She can return home in the meantime and file appeals for bail, he added. Barrister Shafique Ahmed also took part in the hearing with barrister Haque. Hasina on Sunday challenged the High Court order turning down her bail prayer in the extortion case. The High Court on Sept. 29 rejected Hasina's bail petition submitted in the extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. On Aug. 7, 2007 it granted her bail, which eventually came to be halted by the Appellate Division on Aug. 27. Ali, the Unique Group chairman, filed the case against Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helal and his wife Roopa Chowdhury on June 13, 2007, accusing them of extorting Tk 5 crore. Arrested on July 16, 2007, Hasina was released on parole on June 11, 2008 for treatment abroad. bdnew
