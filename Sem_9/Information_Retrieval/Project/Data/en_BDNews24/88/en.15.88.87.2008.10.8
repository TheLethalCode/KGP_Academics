 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Myanmar vowed to renew their relationship and boost trade between the countries, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Wednesday. After a meeting with the commerce minister and planning minister of Myanmar at the FBCCI auditorium, adviser Hossain Zillur told reporters that Bangladesh would import 1 lakh tonnes of rice from Myanmar every year. An agreement on the matter soon would be signed soon, he said. Besides, the two countries would take initiatives to boost bilateral trade, set up river and air communication and resolve the problems over visa and banking. "The economic relationship between Bangladesh and Myanmar is very poor although we are neighbours," Hossain Zillur said. Bangladesh exported $ 5 million products to Myanmar in the last fiscal year and imported $ 100 million worth of goods during the period, the adviser said. "We want the trade to reach $ 500 million a year within a few years. The problems to boost trade will be solved through negotiations," Hossain Zillur said. He said a Bangladesh delegation consisting of representatives from the government and private sectors would visit Myanmar next month. The commerce adviser said Bangladesh devised some strategy to boost trade with its neighbours. And the initiatives to strengthen relationship with Myanmar were part of the strategy. He said the Myanmar ministers proposed Bangladesh to import gas from their country for fertiliser production and export the fertiliser to Myanmar. Bangladesh imported 1 lakh tonnes of staples in the last fiscal year, the adviser said. "We want to import food from Myanmar regularly." A trade fair will be held in Yangon in the first week of January next year in effort to increase exports of Bangladesh products to Myanmar. At a view exchange meeting organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Myanmar's planning minister said his country would take initiatives to remove all obstacles to improving trade relation with Bangladesh. U Sow Tho said Myanmar's export stood at $ 9.8 billion. Bangladesh accounted for only 1.3 percent of it. The Myanmar minister said demand for Bangladeshi construction materials, pharmaceutical goods and leather goods in Myanmar was very high. He hoped all problems would be solved soon to boost trade between the countries. bdnews
