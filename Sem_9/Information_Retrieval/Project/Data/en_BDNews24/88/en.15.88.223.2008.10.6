 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Monday formally inaugurated automation of Chittagong Customs House at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in the capital. At a ceremony, he said an environment friendly to commerce, industries and agriculture is building up in the country thanks to the initiatives of his interim administration. He described the businesspeople and industrialists as the drivers of the economy, and urged them to make the best of the business-friendly environment, build industries and create employment. "The present government has taken initiative for macro-economic and infrastructural reforms including formulation of proper planning to survive in the competitive world market and achieve economic stability. "Better Business Forum and Regulatory Reforms Commission have been formed as parts of it. Information of reduction in cost of initiating business in Bangladesh mentioned in the UNCTAD report is a reflection of it," Fakhruddin said. Fakhruddin said the caretaker government had freed Chittagong port, the lifeline of the trade and commerce of the country, from irregularities and corruption. "Chittagong Customs House is an integral part of the activities of Chittagong Port. Earlier one had to move to 42 points for loading or unloading goods in the customs house. As a result, the importers and exporters would face harassment and loss I am very happy to be able to inaugurate the automation project of Chittagong Customs House." He said introduction of the most modern system of taxation with the initiative of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry under intensive supervision of the army is a unique example of development activities under government-private partnership. The first phase of the automated taxation system was introduced at the customs house in the port city on Aug 8, with the online submission of export and import accounts. The Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry initiated the installation of the automation system with Tk 2 crore in line with a memorandum of understanding between the customs authorities and the CCCI on April 13. Datasoft, a private local firm, is handling the automation system. Datasoft managing director Mahbub Zaman on Sunday said: "The 5-year project will cost around Tk 33 crore. The project, as a public-private joint venture, will forge the country ahead economically, once fully implemented." He pointed out that the project was not being implemented by foreigners. The chief adviser at the inaugural ceremony also spoke of reforms in other areas in his speech. "After assuming power we fixed one of our targets as to establish democratic system on a solid foundation and ensure good governance and transparency at all levels. "For that we are continuing massive institutional reforms. The Election Commission has been reformed as a part of it. An ordinance has been promulgated to establish an independent Election Commission Secretariat. "The reconstituted Election Commission has already prepared list of more than eight crore voters with photographs in only 11 months with the assistance of the army.

Now they are taking all-out preparation for the Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila elections." "Besides, the reformed Anticorruption Commission has taken effective steps as part of the institutional reform. The Commission has already brought a good number of persons to trial. "The Public Service Commission is now working independently. Unwanted interference and irregularities and corruption in public appointments have been completely stopped.
