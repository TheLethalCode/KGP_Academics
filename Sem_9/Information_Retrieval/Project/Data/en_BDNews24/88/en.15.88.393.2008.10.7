 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) Visiting New Zealand's lone warm-up match against Bangladesh Cricket Board XI ahead of the three one-day international series against Bangladesh was abandoned duo to unfit outfield of Narayanganj Fatullah Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. The umpires, inspecting the outfield, called off the match at 11:00am due to heavy rain in the morning. The abandoned match means New Zealand will take on Bangladesh in the first one-dayer on Thursday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium without any practice match.
