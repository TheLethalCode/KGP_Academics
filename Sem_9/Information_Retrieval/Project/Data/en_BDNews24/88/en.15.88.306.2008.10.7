<TEXT>
 Barisal, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Politicians when they return to power through polls will pose a "great challenge" for the anti-graft drive, says ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury. "The days ahead are a great challenge for us. It will be a matter to watch how much work we can do under an elected political government," Hasan Mashhud told reporters on Tuesday in Barisal. "If a political government allows us to work independently, we will be able to work independently. If not, then we won't be able to work," he said when asked to elaborate. "We are preparing to face the challenge. We have the requisite evidence and information with us." But, he added: "If anyone known as corrupt wins, his victory cannot be taken away. "But if there is a charge against them, there will be no changes to the case against them even after the victory. They will have to go face the course of law." About accused persons getting released, the antigraft boss said: "They are getting bail under the framework of the law. What can we do if the court grants them bail? "But bail does not end the case". However, he added: "It has been observed in this country that once a person gets released on bail anyway, he does not return to jail. We must see what happens next." The former army chief said the commission would soon take a tougher stance on high-profile corruption cases. "Whatever the obstacles, we will go all out in our drive against corruption." "The ACC is not alone ... we launched the anticorruption drive with the support of the people." Hasan Mashhud regretted that people may have become disappointed due to recent reverses. "But we hope this despair will not remain." The ACC chairman was speaking to reporters after reopening Rahmatganj High School, which was damaged by Cyclone Sidr last year. The new school building was constructed under the aegis of the Bangladesh-American Association in Pittsburg. About Tk 26 lakh was spent for the construction, supervised by the Anticorruption Commission. A youth rally and a concert to be jointly organised by Transparency International Bangladesh and ACC have been scheduled for Oct 12 at the Barisal Stadium. bdnews24
