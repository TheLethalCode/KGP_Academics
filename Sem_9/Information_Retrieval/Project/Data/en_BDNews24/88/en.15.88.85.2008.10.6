<TITLE> South Korea finds melamine in 10 China-made products </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul,Oct 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's food watchdog said on Monday it had found melamine in 10 Chinese dairy products and ordered them to be taken off shelves. "The levels of melamine found in those products do not pose a big health threat but we'll take the necessary steps to ensure food safety," the Korea Food and Drug Administration agency said in a statement. The agency, which examined 402 processed products manufactured in China, said its tests found 10 products tainted with melamine, the chemical at the centre of a scandal over tainted Chinese dairy products. Widely used in making plastic kitchen utensils, Melamine can pose serious health risks if consumed in large quantities. Thousands of children in China have fallen ill with kidney problems and four have died after drinking milk formula laced with melamine, which is used to cheat quality tests. The 10 tainted products made in China include M&M's milk chocolate snack, Snickers peanut Fun Size, both produced by Mars Inc, Kit Kat bars from Nestle SA, as well as Ritz Sandwich Cracker Cheese and rice cookies produced for domestic food companies
