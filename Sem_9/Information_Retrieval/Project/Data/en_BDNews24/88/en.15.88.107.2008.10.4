<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  The 'rebel' cricketers, led by former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar, left Dhaka Saturday morning for the Indian city of Chandigarh via Delhi to take part in the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL) with hopes of qualifying for the semifinals. The Dhaka Warriors will start their campaign against inaugural league champions Chennai Super Star on Oct 11 in the 11-team second edition twenty20 meet. "We will represent Bangladesh rather than play for a foreign team, and if we perform well, then it will certainly delight Bangladeshi fans," Bashar told reporters during the players' departure at Zia International Airport. "Our first target is to qualify for the semifinals, and then we will consider the rest," said Bangladesh's most successful captain. Bashar sought blessings from the countrymen to do well in the 'rebel cricket league', saying the nation's support would greatly inspire them. "We will hope for a little support from all, and all players from Dhaka Warriors will be very grateful to our countrymen if they back us," said the 36-year-old batsman, adding that they felt cornered after signing for the ICL. Eight top cricketers, contracted by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, retired last month from all forms of cricket to play the ICLfacing a backlash and prompting huge debate in the country on whether they should play the ICL instead of for the national team. Following the cricketers' retirement, the BCB who does not recognise the ICL banned those cricketers for 10 years for playing the league. However, hard-hitter batsman Aftab Ahmed is still dreaming of returning to the national fold and requested the board to reconsider its decision. "I want to play for the country, but don't know how it is possible now," Aftab said regretfully. "I hope the board will reconsider us." Aftab felt no better at the airport as he was leaving the country for the first time without wearing the national jersey. Wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh, however, was in a different mood. "I have given back to Bangladesh as much as it has helped me build up my career," said the 20-year-old wicketkeeper, who has played only 14 one-day internationals for Bangladesh. Middle order batsman Alok Kapali sees playing in the ICL as a challenge as questions about his ability had arisen in the national team. "I have taken it as a challenge and want to prove wrong what had been said about me," said Kapali, who returned to form hitting a century against India in the Asia Cup. Those who left for India are: Habibul Bashar, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Alok Kapali, Tapash Baisya, Nazim Uddin, Farhad Reza, Mosharraf Hossain Rubel, Dhiman Ghosh, Mohammad Rafique, Manjurul Islam, Mahbubul Karim, Golam Mabud and Mohammad Sharif. b
