 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) - Durga Puja, the major religious festival for Hindus in Bangladesh, began Sunday, with Puja pavilions or pandals made ready for five days of celebration. Arriving immediately after Eid-ul-fitr, Durga Puja promises to bring the country another spell of festivity. Puja preparations over the weekend included final decorative touches to the pandals and idols of the goddess Durga, throughout the capital and countrywide. The number of pandals erected countrywide has increased this year, festival organisers said Saturday. The 22,000 raised across the country this year include 165 in the capital alone. Spectacular pandals have been erected in a line from Shakaribazar to Tatibazar and Laxmibazar in the capital's old dictrict. Puja preparations were also completed over the weekend in the festival hotspots of Dhakeswari and Ramna Kali temples as well as Dhaka University's Jagannath Hall. The design and decoration of the major pandals and idols in Dhaka is traditionally done by art and architecture students of the city. CR Dutta, Dhaka City Puja Committee chief, said: "More pandals have been built, security has been tightened and police control rooms have been set up countrywide." In 2007, over 20,000 pandals were counted countrywide. President of the Puja Udjapan Parisad, Professor Nim Chandra Bhowmik, said this year the number had risen to about 22,000. President of Dhaka City Sarbajanin Puja Committee Kazal Debnath said: "We had meetings with the home adviser as well as senior police and RAB officials. They assured us of security measures, we have no doubt about the safety of Puja celebrations." Bhowmik mentioned, however, that pandals had been attacked in some districts including Bagerhat, Satkhira, Gopalganj, Narsingdi and Chittagong. "The government is yet to take all necessary steps so that Puja celebrations can take place peacefully throughout the country," he said. Durga Puja, one of the most important events in the Bengali Hindu calendar, sees a series of rituals over the five days to mark welcome Durga to earth. It is officially recognised as a government holiday, with festivals organised and pandals erected in every district centre, as well as in the thanas and villages. The five-day celebrations are formally launched with 'Devi Bodhon', when the goddess Durga, wife of Shiva, is invited to visit earth. The festival will come to an end on Oct 9 through the sacrifice of the Durga idols on Bijoya Doshomi day. The Puja is more than just a religious festival, however, it is a cultural event in Bangladesh and West Bengal. Visiting pandals with friends and family, meeting others and sampling nearby food stalls are a major part of the festivities. Eden College, Banani playground, Sri Sri Ram Sita Temple in the old city, Shiva Temple in Thatari Bazar, Bhagabati Temple, Pranab Moth, Northbruck Hall Jamidar Bari, Banagram Tarun Sangsad, North and South Mesindi, Narendra Basak Lane, Madan Mohon Temple in Hamanto Das Lane, Rupchan Das Lane, Sri Sri Jamuna Mi Ashram and Siddheswari Kali Temple are among the major festival spots of Durga Puja this year. bdnews24.com/pc/qh/jk
