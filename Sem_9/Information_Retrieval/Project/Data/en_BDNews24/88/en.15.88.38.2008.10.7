 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Political parties willing to run the Dec. 18 general elections must register with the Election Commission by the Oct. 15 deadline, which will not be extended, the chief election commissioner has said. "No-one should have any doubts about holding the Jatiya Sangsad polls on December 18. Those political parties willing to run the elections must go for registration before October 15," ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters at the Election Commission headquarters. He hoped that the major political parties would complete the registration formalities in time, The polls chief said the parties, meantime, had been working to amend their constitutions, as necessary. Huda said he was quite optimistic about the December 18 elections and that the EC had no doubts whatsoever about the polls. He endorsed the latest amendments to the Representation of the People Order 2008 which were approved by the interim cabinet on Tuesday.

The new amendments excluded the small loan recipients from the threat of being declared as 'unqualified.' Huda said the second round of RPO 2008 amendments will be gazetted by Wednesday. As many as 120 application forms so far have been collected and seven political parties have applied for registration. The are Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Janata Dal, Workers Party of Bangladesh, Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal (M-L), Liberal Democratic Party, Freedom Party National People's Party, and Anwar Hossain Manju's Jatiya Party.
