 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) The High Court on Sunday awarded bail to Jubo League general secretary Mirza Azam in an EPR case, and ordered prison authorities to release him if there was no other case pending against him. After the court order, Azam's counsel Motahar Hossain Shaju told bdnews24.com: "There's no other case against him at the moment. There's no bar, therefore, to his release now." The HC granted bail to the former Awami League lawmaker on Sept 16 in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission for amassing illegal wealth. But Police rearrested Azam after release from Dhaka Central Jail on Sept 18, his lawyer said. Azam's lawyer Nazibullah Hiru told bdnews24.com at the time that Mirza Azam was rearrested on allegations that he might violate emergency powers rules once freed. Azam was then sent to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka following a general diary filed with Paltan Police Station. Azam's lawyer said the GD alleged that Azam was trying to assemble party workers and supporters in front of the General Post Office in Paltan although he was barely out of the jail. Metropolitan magistrate Faysal Bin Mahmud sent him to jail again. Deputy attorney general Mohammad Ali Akand opposed Azam's bail petition Sunday, arguing he was not entitled to bail under Emergency Powers Rules 19(d). Azam's counsel Motahar argued there was no bar to the High Court awarding Azam bail, citing the case of Moizuddin Shikder. Mirza Azam was sent to jail on July 16 on his surrender to the lower court in the ACC case. bdnews24.
