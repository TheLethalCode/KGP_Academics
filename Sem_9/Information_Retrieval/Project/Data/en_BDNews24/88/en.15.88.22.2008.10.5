<TITLE> US Rice in Kazakhstan to talk oil, democracy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Astana,Oct 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice landed in Kazakhstan on Sunday on a visit designed to cement energy ties with a strategic nation courted by both Russia and the West. Moscow is sensitive to visits by top US officials to its former Soviet backyard and has in the past accused Western nations of trying to poach its traditional allies. Rice will meet President Nursultan Nazarbayev and other officials during her five-hour stopover in the Caspian nation with strategic proximity to Iran and Afghanistan and bordering Russia and China. Speaking to reporters en route to Kazakhstan, Rice said she was not trying to take allies away from Russia -- nor did he recognise Russia's special sphere of influence in the region. "We don't see any of this as a zero sum game," she said. "Kazakhstan is an independent country, it can have friendships with whomever it wishes. ... So we don't see and don't accept any notion of a special sphere of influence." Lying on some of the world's biggest oil reserves, Kazakhstan has played a careful balancing act by keeping smooth ties with Russia, its former Soviet overlord, while looking to the West to diversify oil exports. Russia's war with Georgia highlighted Kazakhstan's importance further in the energy-rich region prone to instability and ethnic tension. To highlight his neutrality, Nazarbayev held large-scale military exercises with both NATO and Russia in the two weeks preceding Rice's visit. During her talks, Rice will seek to forge closer energy ties with Kazakhstan where U.S. companies have invested billions of dollars in oil money. But no concrete deals are expected to be signed. Another issue is human rights. Kazakhstan's democracy credentials are being closely watched in the West ahead of the country's chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2010. "They are set commitments and I expect Kazakhstan to live up to them, and they are commitments that they've taken and they say they want to live up to," Rice said. She added the United States had raised some individual cases of human rights with the Kazakhs but gave no details. Nazarbayev, in power since Soviet times, is accused by some rights organisations of tolerating no dissent at home and allowing no press freedom. Freedom House, a US rights group, said ahead of Rice's visit that Kazakhstan's failure to make sufficient progress towards democracy risked undermining the OSCE's reputation. b
