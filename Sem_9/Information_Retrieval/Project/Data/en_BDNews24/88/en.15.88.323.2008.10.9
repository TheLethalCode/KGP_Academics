 BUDAPEST, Thu Oct 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO allies face calls on Thursday to send more troops to fight Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan and boost military spending, despite the prospect of budget cuts due to the global financial crisis. Defence ministers of the 26-nation alliance hold a two-day meeting in Budapest against a backdrop of a rise in violence in Afghanistan even though there has been a big increase in the size of the NATO-led international force in the past two years. The United States has urged allies to send extra troops, and commanders of the 50,700-strong NATO force are seeking up to 12,000 more, but Washington's European allies have been reluctant to commit additional numbers. NATO is also seeking to plug shortfalls in equipment such as helicopters and to resolve differences among member countries over U.S. calls for a more aggressive fight against the drugs trade that fuels the Taliban insurgency. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet agreed to allow for an increase in German troop numbers in Afghanistan of 1,000 to up to 4,500. But Berlin has resisted Washington's calls to station troops in the insurgent-troubled south. Washington has urged countries in southeastern Europe, including aspiring NATO members, to send more troops. The United States plans to increase its troop strength in Afghanistan from the present 33,000, which include 13,000 under NATO command, but U.S. officials are concerned allies will see this as an excuse not to meet pledges. "I want to make sure that everybody understands that the increases in U.S. forces are not seen as replacements for NATO contributions. They're reinforcement," U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters travelling with him to Budapest. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the alliance would have to be in Afghanistan "several more long years" and members must pursue military reforms and boost spending, despite the global financial crisis. "We need to do more, not only by increasing military spending, but also by developing the efficiency of forces," he told the Hungarian daily Nepszabadsag. "The global financial crisis will certainly put a pressure on the national budgets, but we must defend our joint values and prepare for facing challenges...". GLOOMY ASSESSMENT U.S. officials said this week Washington had asked Japan and NATO allies that have refused to send troops to Afghanistan to help pay the estimated $17 billion needed to build the Afghan army to a target strength of 134,000. Seven years after U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Britain's military commander and ambassador in Afghanistan gave a gloomy assessment of the effort to stabilise the country and said they thought the war against the Taliban could not be won. Gates dismissed such comments as defeatist but said part of the solution in Afghanistan would be negotiating with members of the Taliban willing to work with the government in Kabul. The demands for Afghanistan come at a time of rising concerns about a resurgent Russia and ministers will discuss what can be done to help NATO hopeful Georgia rebuild its military, which was shattered by Moscow's August invasion. NATO's U.S. military commander wants plans drawn up to protect newer alliance nations, some of which were part of the former Soviet bloc, that feel threatened by Russia's resurgence. U.S. officials say this faces resistance from countries like Germany and France which are worried about Moscow's response. Russia has been incensed by NATO's promise of eventual membership to both Georgia and Ukraine. On Wednesday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the Georgian war showed the security mechanism in Europe, based around NATO and the United States, needed replacing and urged Europe to work with Moscow on a new security pact
