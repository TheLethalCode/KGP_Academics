<TITLE> N Korea bars IAEA from atom plant: diplomats </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Thu Oct 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea on Thursday barred access for UN nuclear monitors to any part of its Yongbyon atomic complex in another step toward reversing a 2007 deal to scrap its atomic bomb program, diplomats said. "The monitors were told that as of today, they are out, no more access permitted to any facilities in Yongbyon. But as of now they are still in their guesthouse on the premises," said a senior diplomat close to the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency. Diplomats said the Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog was expected to make a formal announcement later in the day. The reclusive Stalinist state ousted the monitor team from Yongbyon's plutonium-producing plant, kernel of its atom bomb capability, two weeks ago and vowed to start reactivating the Soviet-era plant within days. But at the time Pyongyang allowed the monitors to continue observing other parts of Yongbyon. The nuclear disarmament pact North Korea struck with five regional powers appeared to unravel last month after Pyongyang vowed to rebuild the largely dismantled Yongbyon in anger at not being removed from a US sponsors-of-terrorism blacklist. Washington said it would take the North off the list, bringing economic and diplomatic benefits, once a system had been agreed to verify its statements on its nuclear program
