<TITLE> No assurance of Myanmar gas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is yet to receive an assurance of gas import from Myanmar, although a hydroelectric power station may be set up in the neighbouring country to meet domestic demand, special aide M Tamim said Wednesday. Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant for energy and mineral resources, briefed reporters at the ministry following a meeting with Myanmar energy minister Brig Gen Lun Thi. "Myanmar has no surplus gas at the moment. They are currently exporting gas to China and Thailand from two gas fields," Tamim told reporters. "Myanmar will start further gas exploration in two blocks. They may export gas to us if that is successful," he said. "In that case, we would receive gas on a competitive basis. At present Myanmar is selling one million cubic feet of gas to China and Thailand at nine dollars per cubic foot," said the special assistant. Tamim said the idea of a hydroelectric power station located in Myanmar was a home grown initiative which could potentially mitigate domestic power generation shortfalls. The special assistant said he was optimistic about the possibility of a new hydroelectric power station being set up somewhere in the Rakhain area of Myanmar. "Talks between the two countries are ongoing to arrange a visit to potential sites in November," he said. Tamim said the meeting also touched on the sea-border demarcations between the two countries. "Myanmar assured us that no gas exploration would be carries out by them until the sea boundary in dispute is settled." He added there was no dispute with Myanmar about nine blocks in Bangladesh sea territory being leased out for exploration. The government began to ponder new avenues for gas following a countrywide crisis in supply last year. The energy ministry gave directives to prioritise gas to fertiliser factories during the last Boro rice season following crop-destroying floods last year. Myanmar had previously assured Dhaka of considering the latter's proposal on gas import, though it said last February that a decision would depend upon discovery of new reserves in Myanmar. It also said priority would be given to Myanmar's promises to India and China ahead of Bangladesh. bdnews24.
