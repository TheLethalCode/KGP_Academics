 Dhaka, Oct 05 (bdnews24.com) -- Chittagong Customs House is set to get a fully automated taxation system, meant to curb irregularities and corruption, from Monday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will inaugurate the long-awaited system at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre by filling out an electronic bill of entry form. Saifuzzaman Chowdhury Javed, president of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the automation would make the taxation and clearing of products much easier and quicker. At a press conference at the National Press Club on Sunday, Javed said: "What now takes four days will take only four hours from Monday." The automation would cut undue procrastination and the hassles faced by businesses, he added. "Businessmen will be able to run their business [without] needing to meet customs officials directly," he said. The first phase of the automated taxation system was introduced at the customs house in the port city on Aug 8, with the online submission of export and import accounts by selected firms. "Many countries including the United States are pressing countries to automate taxation systems and the automation of Chittagong customs house will reshape the image of Bangladesh," the CCCI president said. The chamber will run this project for five years. In case of no further extension of the project, the tax authority will take over, he said. Datasoft, a private local firm, is handling the automation system. Datasoft managing director Mahbub Zaman sai: "The 5-year project will cost around Tk 33 crore. The project, as a public-private joint venture, will forge the country ahead economically, once fully implemented." He pointed out that the project was not being implemented by foreigners. Brigadier General Hasan Nasir, convener of the project's supervising committee, on has said on Sept 24: "Nothing will be handled manually at Chittagong Customs House three months from now." bdnews
