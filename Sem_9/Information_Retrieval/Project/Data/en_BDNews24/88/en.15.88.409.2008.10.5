 Cox's Bazar, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Two youths drowned at Cox's Bazar sea beach Saturday afternoon and Sunday noon, police said. Twenty-two year-old Mohammad Rintu son of Shamsu Mia of Shutrapur in Dhaka, and sixteen year-old Mizanur Rahman, son of Muhammad Ismail of Rumaliachhara in Cox's Bazar, came to Cox's Bazar for the Eid holiday, Sadar police chief AKM Mohiuddin said. A receding tide washed the two, along with Rintu's friend Tushar, out to sea. Tushar was rescued alive. Mostafa Kamal, director of the voluntary organisation Yasir Lifeguard, said Rintu and Tushar went to bathe at Labony Point around 11.45 am and a strong wave took them away. Members of Yasir Lifeguard rescued bith and rushed them to the district's Sadar Hospital where doctors declared Rintu dead. Tushar was doing well, Mostafa said. Police officer Mohiuddin said Rintu came to Cox's Bazar from Dhaka with his friends. He said the body of Mizanur Rahman was handed over to his relatives but Rintu's body was still at the hospital morgue as his relatives did not arrive. Mostafa said rescuers retrieved the body of Mizanur Rahman at about 7am, who drowned Saturday afternoon at Shaibal point.
