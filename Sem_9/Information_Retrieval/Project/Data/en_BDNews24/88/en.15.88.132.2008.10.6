 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com) -- The United Nations is likely to send polls observers for the Dec 18 parliamentary election even if it takes place amid the state of emergency, said its local resident coordinator Monday. "The UN would most probably send officials to monitor and observe the elections," UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessalian told reporters after a meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the ministry. Justifying her comment, Renata said the city corporation and the municipality elections were held peacefully under the state of emergency. "I am positive that the government will devise a methodology whereby people can vote freely without intimidation and the parities can also have the freedom to conduct their campaigns unimpeded," she said. She said she also discussed with the foreign adviser the forthcoming visit of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to Bangladesh in early November. Iftekhar Chowdhury while talking to reporters said the visit of the secretary general would be a "landmark event" in relations between the UN and Bangladesh. bdn
