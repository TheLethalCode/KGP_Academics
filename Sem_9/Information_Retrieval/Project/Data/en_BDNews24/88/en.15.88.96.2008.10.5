 Dharamsala, India, Oct 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dalai Lama will have a medical check next week, a senior aide said on Saturday, calling it a routine follow-up after he was admitted to hospital with abdominal discomfort in August. The 73-year-old exiled Tibetan spiritual leader has since recovered fully and remains cheerful, but doctors have advised him to cut down on long travels and rest more. He will travel to New Delhi for a check-up on Monday. "His health is fine. He's going down for a follow-up medical check up after the pain he had suffered in August," Tenzin Taklha told Reuters. The Dalai Lama was admitted to a hospital in Mumbai with "abdominal discomfort" in August. He was released a few days later after doctors said there was no cause for concern. A smiling Dalai Lama left the hospital for Dharamsala, the headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile in northern India, where he has spent most of his time resting, discussing the situation in Tibet and teaching. US President George W. Bush called to inquire about his health last month after the Nobel Peace Prize winner cancelled his visits to Mexico and the Dominican Republic. At his public discourses, the Dalai Lama has routinely spoken for three to four hours, cheerfully answering questions from followers and admirers. "He just completed eight days of teachings. Every thing went well," Taklha said. The Dalai Lama has called a special meeting of Tibetan exiles in November or December to discuss this year's political unrest in Tibet and the future of the Tibetan movement
