 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Myanmar will sign a deal to avoid double taxation for a boost to trade between the two neighbours, the foreign adviser said Tuesday. The agreement is likely to be signed later in the day at the Chief Adviser's Office during bilateral talks. Myanmar's vice-senior General Maung Aye, with a 55-strong entourage, arrived in Dhaka on a three-day visit Tuesday for bilateral talks. "We will sign an agreement on avoidance of double taxation," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnew24.com at Zia International Airport. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and the Myanmar junta's second-in-command will lead their respective sides at the bilateral talks. As of Aug 2007, bilateral trade volume stood at $60 million. Double taxation is considered one of the barriers in exploiting the potentials of trade between the two neighbours. Iftekhar, expected to attend the talks, told bdnews24.com that linking Bangladesh with China through a cross-border with Myanmar, contract farming and repatriation of the Rohingya refugees would also come up in the bilateral talks. "We have already signed an agreement on the cross-border road within Myanmar. Hopefully this road will help us establish linkage with China on one hand and South East Asia on the other," Iftekhar said. "Contract farming is another key issue; refugees, maritime boundaries, procurement of rice from Myanmarall these are expected to feature the talks," he said. The foreign adviser will also meet separately with Myanmar foreign minister U Nyan Win, one of seven minsiters accompanying General Aye, at the Sonargaon Hotel Tuesday afternoon. bdn
