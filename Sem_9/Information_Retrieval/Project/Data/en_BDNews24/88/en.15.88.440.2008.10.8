 MADRID, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain coach Vicente del Bosque called up Liverpool winger Albert Riera for their October World Cup qualifiers after Diego Capel was forced to withdraw from the squad because of injury on Tuesday. Sevilla's 20-year-old winger Capel had been struggling with a muscle injury in his right leg and failed to complete the morning training session. A later scan ruled him out. Del Bosque turned to Liverpool's new recruit Riera, who has five caps and last represented his country in the 1-0 friendly win over Italy in March, the Spanish Football Federation said on its website (www.rfef.es). Winger Santi Cazorla was able to return for afternoon training on Tuesday after having also left the morning session with bruising to his leg following a collision with Pepe Reina. Group Five leaders Spain, with two wins from two games, travel to face Estonia on Saturday and are also away to Belgium four days later
