<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak has alleged that the amended Representation of the People Order is being further modified to benefit 'a particluar party' of 'anti-liberation elements'. "We hear that the authorities are taking steps to incorporate further changes in the newly amended RPO 2008 to specially benefit a particular political party," said Razzak, as he distributed sarees among destitute women at the Ram Sita temple in Tikatuli on Monday. Asked who the 'particular party' might be, Razzak replied: "Well, everyone knows themthose anti-liberation elements who are not yet reconciled with the freedom of Bangladesh." "Those that have described the liberation war as a 'civil war' and those who have not yet apologised for their sinful actions during the 1971 war." These elements are actively whipping up religious fanaticism, nurturing and encouraging parochial and communal feelings, he alleged. "Religious fanaticism is giving rise to militancy, whereas Islam means 'peace' and doesn't afford any leverage whatsoever to militancy," Razzak said. Expressing his sadness at war crimes trials being deferred, Razzak said: "Jahanara Imam, mother of a martyr, was accused of treason in this country." "On the other hand, the war criminals are moving about scot-free as VIPs." The AL presidium member called upon the government to ensure total security of party president Sheikh Hasina when she returns home. He also urged the Election Commission to defer the upazila polls by at least a month. bdnews2
