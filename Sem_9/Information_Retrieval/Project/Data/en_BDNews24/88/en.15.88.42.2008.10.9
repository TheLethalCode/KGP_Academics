 VIENNA/SEOUL, Thu Oct 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea has reportedly deployed more than 10 missiles on its west coast for what appears to be an imminent launch, and diplomats said on Thursday the North has barred UN monitoring throughout its nuclear complex. Those potentially destabilizing moves came amid reports that the United States has offered to remove North Korea from its terrorist blacklist this month in an effort to keep a nuclear disarmament pact from falling apart. It would be an unprecedented test if North Korea fired all 10 of the surface-to-ship and ship-to-ship missiles, but intelligence sources quoted by the Chosun Ilbo paper said they thought the North may launch five to seven of them. North Korea has forbidden ships to sail in an area in the Yellow Sea until October 15 in preparation for the launch, an intelligence source told the paper. A South Korean defense ministry official declined to comment on the report but said the government had no indications of unusual activities in the North. North Korea has a history of timing its missile launches during periods of increased tension or negotiation to signal a hard line, analysts say. U.S. nuclear envoy Christopher Hill visited Pyongyang last week in a bid to convince North Korea to return to a disarmament-for-aid deal and halt plans to restart an aging nuclear plant that makes bomb-grade plutonium. Kyodo news agency, quoting unidentified Japanese government sources, said Hill agreed that Washington would not make verification of Pyongyang's uranium enrichment program or proliferation activities a condition of delisting. The United States suspects North Korea has a parallel uranium enrichment program in addition to its plutonium-producing reactor in Yongbyon and that it has proliferated nuclear technology to Syria. IAEA MONITORS Analysts had speculated Hill may have reached some kind of understanding in Pyongyang that is delicate in nature and requires the support of the other parties in the nuclear talks -- China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. A Japanese foreign ministry spokesman said he could not immediately comment on the report. Washington said it would take North Korea off the terrorism list -- bringing economic and diplomatic benefits -- once a system had been agreed to verify Pyongyang's nuclear program. In Vienna, diplomats said the International Atomic Energy Agency will announce on Thursday its monitors have been barred throughout the Soviet-era Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea has vowed to rebuild the largely dismantled Yongbyon in anger at not being removed from the blacklist. Pyongyang ousted the monitors from the plutonium-producing area of the complex two weeks ago and vowed to start reactivating the facility within days. But at the time, it let the IAEA continue verifying the shutdown status of other parts of Yongbyon. The IAEA's tools included surveillance cameras and seals placed on equipment. "This (shutdown of IAEA monitoring) was anticipated if things didn't move on the diplomatic front," said a senior Vienna diplomat. "Now we'll see if things move. Whether the monitors go back depends on someone else negotiating this thing; it's not the IAEA." Admiral Timothy Keating, commander of US forces in the Pacific, said he had not seen any increased military activity in North Korea, "nor have we responded in any way with any military posture changes." The United States put North Korea on its list of state sponsors of terrorism for the 1987 midair bombing of a South Korean airliner over the Andaman Sea that killed all 115 people on board
