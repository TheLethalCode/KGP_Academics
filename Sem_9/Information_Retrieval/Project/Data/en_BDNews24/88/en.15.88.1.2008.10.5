 Rangpur, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party chairman H M Ershad says he will field his party candidates in 21 out of 22 seats in greater Rangur while being a part of the Awami League-led grand alliance. "In Rangpur region no concession will be given except in one seat. We'll only give away the Nilphamari Sadar seat to Asaduzzaman Noor of Awami League," the former president told reporters Jatiya Party Rangpur district office Sunday evening. "I had asked for 60 seats to the Grand alliance (before the Jan 22 elections). I was given 50 seats. This time I will demand more." Noor, a popular TV and stage actor who co-owns an advertising firm, is publicity secretary of the Awami League. Ershad said the distribution of seats would be finalised after the grand alliance leader Sheikh Hasina returned home. The former army chief said he was considering running for three seatsone each in Dhaka, Habiganj and Rangpuras a grand alliance candidate. Ershad also said his party had already finalised its candidates for greater Rangpur, considered as his stronghold since his days in power. Though the Jatiya Party would participate in the election as a component of the grand alliance, he said, it would publish its own election manifesto. District Jatiya Party president Karimuddin Bharsha, general secretary Mostafizar Rahman Mostafa, organising secretary Yasir Ahmed and Ershad's nephew Asif Shahriar were present at the views-exchange meeting with local journalists.
