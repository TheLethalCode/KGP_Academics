 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) The proposed 450-megawatt gas-fired power plant project, to be built and operated by a Malaysian company in Habiganj, will be reviewed again, a cabinet committee decided Tuesday. "The cabinet committee on public purchase has ordered re-evaluation of the proposal to set up a power plant at Bibiana in private sector," the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources Dr M Tamim told bdnews24.com after the meeting. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam presided over the meeting. The meeting however approved proposal to import nearly a million tonnes of refined fuel from Malaysia, Tamim said. Power ministry officials said the cabinet committee had asked to review the price quoted by the independent power producer, a consortium led by Malaysia's Powertek. The company quoted 4.53 US cents or about Tk 3.15 for one kilowatt per hour electricity. Four firms were initially technically selected for the 450 MW power plant at Bibiana. Of them only Powertek and its partners submitted the bid at the final stages. The other consortium partners are Korean Electric Power Company (KEFCO) and Germany's Siemens. The government's technical committee and Power Cell's evaluation report mentioned that the price quoted by Powertek consortium was acceptable as per international market price. Later the proposal was sent from the ministry to the cabinet committee for approval.
