<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) The Truth and Accountability Commission is going to summon high government officials based on information gathered from persons confessing crimes to the commission. "Some government officials' names came up during previous hearings. We are set to call them up within the next seven days," said TAC chief Justice Habibur Rahman in the commission's weekly press briefing Wednesday. Replying to queries, he said though the commission is meant for confessions, according to the law the TAC can summon anyone. The TAC chairman later told bdnews24.com that they would call on the government officials to appear for hearings. "Punitive measures will be taken against them if proven guilty," he added. No politicians had yet applied for TAC clemency, said Justice Habibur, adding: "Maybe they are not coming due to the upcoming polls." He also said that no officials from public bodies such as Rajuk, customs, DCC, local government, or the health directorate had appeared for hearings yet. "No files have been sent either from the ACC regarding irregularities in these organisations," he added. Commission member Maj Gen (retd) Manjur Rashid said the commission was not concerned with petty cases. "We are after the big fish." Asked whether the commission has succeeded in serving its purpose so far, Justice Habibur Rahman said: "I do not think the commission has failed." TAC has heard 126 cases so far out of a total 266, he added. "The commission has ordered 83 persons to surrender Tk 18.10 crore to the state. So far Tk 8.73 crore of this has been surrendered," said the TAC chief. He added that pleas for clemency can be made up to the recently extended deadline of Oct 31. bdnews
