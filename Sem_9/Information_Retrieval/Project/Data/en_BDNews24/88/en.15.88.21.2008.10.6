 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission on Monday asked all to tear clean, wipe off, dismantle or pull down by Oct. 15 all Eid and Puja felicitation posters with photographs of probable candidates who might seek nominations and run the elections. Anyone violating the directive will run the risk of having their candidature cancelled, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters Monday. Other election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain were present during the press briefing. "The probable candidates are flouting the electoral laws by putting up colour posters containing their photographs everywhere, across the country, taking advantage of the festivities and conducting polls campaign in the guise of goodwill conveyance," said Huda. "Such violators of polls regulations must bring those posters down by October 15, or their candidature during the forthcoming elections will stand liable to be scrapped." Huda said each district is going to have an election monitoring officer (EMO) of the rank and status of assistant commissioner with the authority of a first class magistrate with effect from October 16. The EMOs will ensure adherence to the election laws and regulations and also verify and authenticate the eight information provided by the polls contestants under affidavit. Detailed instructions about the same will be issued and passed on to the deputy commissioners, police superintendents, district election officers, Upazila chief executives ( nirbahi officers) and Upazila election officers. The elections chief reiterated that the election behaviour codes published recently were applicable to all the polls candidates and the registered political parties. No political party has yet been registered, Huda said, but political parties and personalities should refrain from electioneering including all sorts of campaigning before the timeline. He hoped that all political parties should register by Oct. 15, the deadline for mandatory registration under the new electoral laws. Election codes prohibit campaigning until three weeks before the general elections slated for Dec. 18. bdnews24.
