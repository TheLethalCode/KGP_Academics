 Dhaka, Oct. 5 (bdnews24.com)  There is no bar to former premiers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia running the general elections, the Election Commission has said. In case they are convicted under the emergency powers rules and the conventional law, it might require a little rethinking about if they can still do so, election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain told reporters on Sunday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in an interview with the Time Magazine said allowing or barring the two ex-premiers depended solely on the Election Commission. Commenting on the interview, Sohul said, "The two ex-premiers are no separate issues for us. The chief adviser in his interview might have alluded to the electoral laws. Unless convicted, one would not face any bar to contesting the polls." He said as of now none of the two former premiers has been convicted. "If someone is convicted under the emergency powers rules, they will stand ineligible to run the polls even if they file appeal against the conviction." "On the other hand, one could contest the polls even after being convicted under the conventional law when an appeal has been filed with the higher court." The constitution and the electoral laws say convicts handed down two or more years' jail terms may be barred from the polls. One, however, may be eligible again for running the polls when one has passed five years after serving the punitive term. On lifting the emergency, Sohul said, "Relaxing or lifting the emergency depends solely on the caretaker government." He hoped all restrictions would be lifted to facilitate smooth campaigning prior to the elections. Sohul said they would inform the government of any hurdles that might impede the staging of free and fair elections. He was confident that all complications pertaining to the redefining the electoral districts will be sorted out before the ensuing polls. He said all objections should be heard and resolved through the intervention of the court. The chief election commissioner and his colleagues were also present at the Election Commission headquarters on Sunday, the first workday after the Eid vacation. When it was pointed out that Khaleda had not registered herself as a voter, though enrolling oneself is the most cardinal precondition for running the elections, Sohul said, "If Khaleda Zia wants to participate in the forthcoming polls, she must enroll as a voter before the election schedules are announced. The EC has alerted her about that too." Hasina registered herself as a voter on June 10. bdnews24
