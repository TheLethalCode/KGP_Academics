 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Hajj flights for around 48,000 pilgrims this year will take off from Oct 31, religious affairs and law adviser AF Hassan Ariff said Tuesday. Planes chartered from Bangladesh Biman and Saudi Airlines will carry 34,000 and 14,000 Hajj pilgrims respectively, under government and private management, the adviser said after an inter-ministerial meeting on Hajj management. Some 75 flights by Bangladesh Biman will transport the pilgrims over 33 days; the last Hajj flight will leave Dhaka for Saudi Arabia on Dec 2, Ariff briefed reporters. The adviser said: "As far as possible, advance preparations have been made this year in Hajj management, considering irregularities in the past." "Hajj fees have been taken, and names and addresses of pilgrims have already been recorded as a part of cautionary measures." The government hoped that due to the new measures, there would not be fewer hazards facing pilgrims this year, the adviser added. "The law ministry had formulated a draft of the rules for preventing irregularities in Hajj management and sent it to the law commission," Arriff further briefed reporters. "The law commission is scrutinising the draft rules. It takes quite some time to formulate a law. But the government is continuing its work sincerely." About 7,000 pilgrims will perform Hajj under government management, 80 percent of their required housing was rented, the remaining 20 percent would be secured this week, the adviser said. Around 10 out of 206 Hajj agencies have rented 60 percent work of housing for pilgrims going to Hajj under private management; the rest will be complete by this week, the he added.
