<TITLE> Avoid Cadbury, says adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)  The health adviser on Thursday recommended avoiding Cadbury's products in Bangladesh, following a recall of the company's China-made chocolate over the recent melamine scare. "Authorities have asked BSTI to check whether Cadbury chocolates contain melamine or not. Until the test results are available, the chocolate of that brand had better not be consumed," AMM Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com by telephone. Asked if the Cadbury products would be banned, he said, "It's the job of the commerce ministry to ban commercial products. It's up to them to decide." "Already in some places in the United States and Australia Cadbury chocolates have been banned. However, disputes are there over the level of toxic melamine in the Cadbury products," the adviser said. "Some say (melamine) is at tolerable level, while others say it's higher than the accepted level." "In the circumstances, we should make a decision after the tests." British confectionery group Cadbury Plc said on Monday it was withdrawing all of its 11 chocolate products made in Beijing on concern over the possibility of contamination with melamine in its Chinese plant. "The products that are affected by this withdrawal include a range of Cadbury chocolate products and Choclairs, all produced in our Beijing plant," the world's largest confectionery manufacturer said in a statement. The London-based group said its products, including Dairy Milk chocolate, were being recalled from mainland China and the export markets of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia as a precautionary step pending further supply of fresh product. The candy maker is the latest company to get caught up in the tainted-milk scandal, as a growing list of Chinese milk and milk-related products have been taken off shelves around the world in recent weeks. Melamine was first found in powdered infant formula in China, where four babies died and nearly 53,000 were sickened. It has since been traced to dozens of other products. Melamine is a relatively cheap industrial chemical, commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants added it to milk products to cheat protein quality checks. Health experts say that ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition. Over here, the government banned three brands of Chinese milk powder in the wake of the milk scare, though at least two Bangladeshi firms have since been found marketing the products without BSTI approval and mobile courts have seized tins in open markets over recent days. The government said Chinese authorities had earlier informed Bangladesh of the possible existence of melamine in the products of two companies Sun Care and Yashli, who manufacture 'Sweet Baby' and 'Yashli-1' and 'Yashli-2' milk powders. Melamine content has been detected in Yashli -1, the director general of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution said Tuesday. Md Ajmal Hossain, the BSTI chief, told bdnews24.com: "A melamine content of 72.77 mg per kg has been found in the Chinese Yashli-1 brand milk powder. There has been no melamine found so far in the other two banned Chinese brands." The BSTI chief said samples of Yashli-1, Yashili-2 and Sweet Baby-2 formula were being tested at three laboratories. Of the three, one had reported back so far with a positive melamine result in Yashli-1. "These three brands have already been banned from import and sale in Bangladesh," Hossain said. Last week Cadbury said three factories from which it sources its dairy ingredient supplies in China had been tested by the government and no melamine had been found, but further tests had revealed some doubts so the recall was ordered. The following 11 products are included in the recall, according to Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety:  Cadbury Dark Chocette, 45 grams.  Cadbury Dark Chocette, 80 grams.  Cadbury Eclairs, 180 grams.  Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Pumpkin, 150 grams.  Cadbury Dark Chocolate, 40 grams.  Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms.  Cadbury Dark Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms.  Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms.  Cadbury Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms.  Cadbury Hazelnut Praline Chocolate (2008 Chinese New Year), 312 grams.  Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate (2008 Chinese New Year), 300 grams. bd
