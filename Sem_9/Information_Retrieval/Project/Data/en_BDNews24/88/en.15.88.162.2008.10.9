 ISLAMABAD, Thu Oct 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb attack wounded at least eight people on Thursday at police headquarters in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, a senior police official said. "I am at the site of the blast. I have seen several people wounded, eight or nine," police official Khalid Mehmood told Reuters. Interior Secretary Kamal Shah said a handful of people had been wounded, but there were no deaths reported so far. The explosion was caused by a car bomb, he said. The latest attack struck a target in a high security zone, though security in the city has been increased in the wake of a suicide truck bomb that killed 55 people and destroyed the Marriott hotel on Sept. 20. There have been fears of more bomb attacks in reaction to an army offensive against Islamist militant strongholds in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. The explosion occurred as Pakistan's newly appointed intelligence chief briefed lawmakers on the internal security threat for a second day in a special, closed joint-session of parliament. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani immediately issued a statement saying the attack "would not deter the government from fighting the scourge of terrorism.
