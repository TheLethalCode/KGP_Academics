 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)The UK curry industry has come a long way since the first wave of South Asian immigrants landed in Britain in the 1960s, offering what was then exotic dining at affordable prices. Since then 'Indian restaurants' in the UK, run mainly by Bangladeshis, have generated a 3 billion industry, with curry gaining the status of a 'national cuisine'. But the industry faces a grave threat, according to Bangladeshi caterers, from new immigration laws including a newly introduced point-base system, which came into force in February Bangladeshi restaurant owners in Britain have reluctantly accepted the UK government's proposed conditions in exchange for a possible relaxing of the point-base system in a bid to save the country's curry industry. The British government told Bangladeshi caterers last month that the PBS might be relaxed, to allow "low-skilled" Bangladeshis to enter the UK, only for work in curry house kitchens, provided that they have a knowledge of English and restaurant owners are willing to pay 8.10 per hour. The British government stopped issuing visas for the low-skilled workers since 2006. On Sept 10, however, the British government announced that the curry industry was included in the shortage occupation list for which the PBS could be relaxed for Bangladeshis to get jobs in the restaurant sector. "We have no alternative to accepting the government proposal though it is difficult for us to pay 8.10 per hour," Shahgir Bakht Faruk, chairman of the Bangladesh-British Chamber of Commerce, told bdnews24.com in London recently. "We have agreed that the restaurant workers should learn English," he said. "It is our success that we could convince the government to include this industry in the government's shortage occupation list," said Faruk. Bangladeshi caterers have been pursing systematic campaigns and lobbying the UK government since 2006 to get the point-base system relaxed for "low-skilled" restaurant workers from Bangladesh. A strict enforcement of the PBS will give immigrants from East European countries advantage over Bangladeshis who run about 90 per cent of the UK's 'Indian restaurants'. "But because of the cultural gaps, workers from East European countries cannot work in the heat of a Bengali kitchen. They take jobs, but leave within a few days," Bajloor Rashid, president of Bangladesh Caterers Association in UK, told bdnews24.com. "Without appointing Bangladeshis, we cannot save Britain's curry industry which has an annual turnover of 3.5 billion", Rashid said. Faruk believes the industry at present could employ another 30,000 chefs, cooks, waiters and kitchen staff in the thousands of restaurants run by Bangladeshis throughout the UK. "The Bangladeshis are the lifeblood of the British curry industry," he said. Since the introduction of the PBS, Bangladeshis side by side with the British Migration Advisory Committee has carried out a one-year study on the implications of the PBS on the industry. The survey found out that the curry industry has a huge shortage of workers at this moment. The British government agreed to include the industry in the shortage occupation list on the basis of the findings. One of the main causes of shortage of chefs and restaurant workers is that only first generation Bangladeshis tend to work in the kitchens. "The children of the chefs and restaurant workers do not want to work in the heat of the kitchen. Rather they get educated and integrate more fully into British society," Nahash Pasha, editor of London's Bangla-language daily Jonomot, told bdnews24.com. bdn
