<TITLE> Thai deputy PM quits, car bomb kills one in Bangkok </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Tue Oct 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh quit on Tuesday after 69 people were injured in street clashes with police as campaigners intensified their four-month old bid to unseat the government. One person was killed in a blast that destroyed a truck only a few hundred metres from parliament where anti-government protesters were battling riot police amid clouds of tear gas. "I suspect it was a car bomb because the body parts were cut in pieces and an arm was blown 20 metres away from the car," Colonel Somchai Choyklin, head of Bangkok's Dusit police station, told Reuters. He gave no further details. Shortly after dawn, nearly 70 people were injured after riot police moved to clear thousands of protesters barricaded outside parliament to stop ministers from attending the start of the legislative session. Some protesters were badly hurt, including two men who had part of their legs blown off by exploding teargas canisters, prompting Chavalit to take responsibility and quit. He said he had asked police to exercise restraint. "Since this action did not achieve what I planned, I want to show my responsibility for this operation," Chavalit said in his resignation letter. The loss of the government's top negotiator with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) was a further blow to new Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat's efforts to end a long-running crisis that has damaged investor confidence in Thailand. By late afternoon, the PAD controlled several city blocks and clashed with police around parliament, Suan Dusit Rajabhat University and police headquarters. "Overthrow the Thaksin regime. Together we win or lose. We will know it today. We won't give up," PAD leader Anchalee Paireerak said. The PAD, a coalition of businessmen, academics and activists, accuses Somchai of being a puppet for former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, his brother-in-law, who was removed in a 2006 military coup. The group argues Thai democracy has been undermined by billionaire Thaksin and his allies, who easily won the last three elections, and has called for a "new politics" that would include a proportion of appointed MPs. POLITICAL CRISIS Somchai, a soft-spoken former judge, has proved a harder target for the PAD than his predecessor, the abrasive Samak Sundaravej, who stepped down last month after being found guilty of being paid for hosting a TV cooking show while in office. The demonstrators failed to stop Somchai's speech, in which he called for national reconciliation to end a three-year crisis pitting Thaksin and his rural base against rivals in the royalist and military establishment believed to be backing the PAD. "This government is determined to tackle economic problems and to listen to all sides to find a solution to end the crisis," Somchai told parliament. He slipped out through a back gate to a waiting helicopter, which whisked him out of the parliament grounds. The street campaign has hurt investor confidence and distracted policymakers when they should be focused on remedies for the slowing demand for exports and fallout from the global credit crisis, analysts say. Citing the unrest, traders said the dollar advanced against the baht and the stock market tumbled, although in both cases the global credit crisis was also a major factor. The baht was at 34.47 per dollar, down from 34.38 on Monday. The stock index closed down 4.18 percent at a five-year low, failing to get a lift like some other bourses from a big Australian rate cut. Similar street violence last month triggered a two-week state of emergency in Bangkok, but the army refused to enforce it and the measure was withdrawn after badly damaging tourism. "I don't think they will impose it this time," Ramkhamhaeng University analyst Boonyakiat Karavekphan said. "The previous emergency decree proved to be futile." The PAD has occupied the prime minister's offices at Government House since late August, forcing Somchai to run the country from Bangkok's little-used Don Muang airport. Somchai has tried to open a dialogue with the PAD but no real talks have started and there seems little prospect of compromise with the movement, which says it is acting to protect the monarchy. The PAD's main draw card has been defence of the throne and 80-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, regarded as semi-divine by many Thais, in the face of what they say is a bid by the Thaksin camp to turn the country into a republic. The accusation is denied by Thaksin, who lives in exile in England after he and his wife fled in August to avoid graft charges, saying they could not get a fair trial
