<TITLE> Thai court drops treason charge against protesters </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Thu Oct 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's Court of Appeals watered down charges against nine leaders of an anti-government street campaign on Thursday, saying there was no way they had committed the capital offence of treason. However, the court said the nine People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) leaders might have committed public order offences carrying up to seven years in prison, and issued new arrest warrants. Soon after the ruling, two PAD leaders in police custody were freed on bail of 100,000 baht ($2,900) each, their lawyer said. The other seven leaders, barricaded inside the Government House compound they have occupied with thousands of supporters since late August, were considering their next move, a PAD spokesman said. The original arrest orders were issued on Aug. 27, the day after PAD protesters armed with golf clubs, stakes and machetes stormed a state television station, broke into several ministries and overran the prime minister's official compound. They have been in Government House ever since, making it the heart of a long-running anti-government campaign that spilled over into running battles with riot police on Tuesday in which two people died and 400 were injured. Several police officers were shot, one was skewered with a flag pole and another was run over by a truck. Amid public anger at what was seen as police brutality -- at least six protesters had limbs blown off -- 500 black-clad doctors and nurses marched on the national police headquarters on Thursday, demanding that the government stand down. "We condemn the barbaric act of a tyrannical government," one protest leader shouted, lambasting Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat, who is accused of being a puppet of ousted leader Thaksin Shinawatra, his brother-in-law. "Somchai the Murderer. Somchai, Get Out," one placard read. Police have denied PAD claims that they fired explosives into the crowd, insisting they only used teargas. Several doctors at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok's top medical school, have launched a campaign to deny medical services to police or politicians involved in Tuesday's clashes, the worst street violence in Thailand in 16 years. CONFIDENCE LOW The unrest has hit investor confidence and distracted policymakers when they should be focused on slowing economic growth and the fallout from the global credit crisis, analysts say. Thailand's main stock index was down more than 1 percent on Thursday as the domestic political worries cancelled out the positive impact of interest rate cuts by major central banks around the world which helped some other Asian bourses. "The rate cuts have not helped Thai market sentiment because of the domestic political crisis," said Pichai Lertsupongkij, head of sales at Thanachart Securities. Figures released on Thursday showed consumer confidence fell to a 10-month low in September due to the political turmoil, the credit crunch and high living costs. Tuesday's violence appalled many Thais, including two Thai Airways pilots who refused to let three members of parliament from government parties board their planes for domestic flights, Thai television reported. Revered Queen Sirikit has donated a total of 1 million baht ($29,200) to help treat the injured, a gesture the PAD leaders have embraced as an expression of support for their cause from the palace, although the latest sum goes to a police hospital
