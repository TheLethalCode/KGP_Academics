 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) The US government has authorised five new Fulbright scholarship positions for Bangladesh, said the ambassador James F Moriarty on Wednesday. The Fulbright scholarship provides grants for international exchange programmes of scholars, educators, graduate students and professionals, founded by United States Senator J William Fulbright and operating in 144 countries. "These five new Fulbrighters will pursue master's degree programmes in the US in the area of food security," the US ambassador said at the closing session of the Asia Regional Higher Education Summit organised by USAID at the city's Westin Hotel. USAID country director Denise Rollins said the objective of the regional meet was to share programs and experience related to the four thematic areas and explore partnership opportunities among universities and with private sector and foundations. "Our primary goal was to establish a common, cohesive strategic vision for increased partnerships in tackling major development challenges to the region," she added. The first Asian summit of its kind, and a follow-up to the Higher Education Summit for Global Development in Washington held in April this year, focuses on four global challenges for the region: food security, women entrepreneurship, teacher training and natural disaster management. Other regional summits will also convene in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. Dhaka University VC SMA Faiz, AMM Safiullah VC of BUET also spoke on the occasion. bdn
