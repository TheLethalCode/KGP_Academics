<TITLE> New PBS a 'concern' though meant to be fairer: UK MPs </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)The UK government's new point-based system for immigration will be concern for the British catering industry, though it is mean to be fairer and more transparent than the previous system," visiting UK MPs said Wednesday. "I see the PBS is going well. But there are concerns for the catering industry," Martin Salter MP, a member of a visiting UK delegation, told the press conference. Another MP Gwyn Prosser said, "The PBS will be fairer and more transparent than the previous system." The number of Bangladeshis migrating to Britain would increase under the PBS, he added. "The migration advisory committee has recommended the inclusion of the curry industry in the government's shortage occupation list. I hope the government will accept it," Keith Vaz MP told bdnews24.com at the press conference. Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee on migration, said earlier he would ask his government to support Bangladesh in setting up a catering college in Sylhet to produce skilled chefs and cooks for the UK's curry industry. He said the proposed catering college would resolve the problems of the new points-based system which would bar low-skilled Bangladeshis from entering Britain for work. The British government is yet to fully enforce the PBS, which began being implemented in phases from February, for low-skilled chefs and restaurant workers. "We are really excited with the foreign affairs adviser's idea to create a catering college in Sylhet. We think that it is a very, very exciting idea," Vaz told reporters following his meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. The foreign adviser told reporters that the interim government had taken the initiative as the British curry industry, mainly run by Bangladeshis, requires at least 12,000 more chefs and cooks at present. Said Vaz: "We will certainly go back to our government to see what help they can give in order to assist with this idea." "Of course [the catering college] will deal with a number of issues in the point-based system, if we have here a properly accredited organisation that deals with skills for chefs," he said. The PBS makes it difficult for Bangladeshi chefs and restaurant workers with a poor knowledge of English to settle in the country. The Bangladesh Catering Association in the UK claims Britain's curry industry has an annual turnover of  3.5 billion a year, and is totally dominated by low-skilled Bangladeshi workers. If immigration laws are not relaxed, the curry industry in the UK will collapse, fear the Bangladeshi caterers who have been pursing systematic campaigns and lobbying the UK government since 2006 to allow restaurant workers from Bangladesh into the country. The British government, on Sept 10, proposed the curry industry for the shortage occupation list for which the UK government could allow low-skilled restaurant workers from Bangladesh into Britain, under certain conditions. Keith Vaz came to Bangladesh with a six-member delegation to meet with government and private stakeholders to finalise their recommendations on the matter. bdn
