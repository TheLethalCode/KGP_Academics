 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Myanmar's vice-senior General Maung Aye and seven ministers arrived in Dhaka Tuesday, on a three-day visit for bilateral talks. The delegation landed at 11am by a special flight of Air Bagan. The chief adviser and his wife, along with army chief General Moeen U Ahmed and three advisers, welcomed General Aye. Travelling with a 55-strong entourage, he was met with a 21-gun salute and guard of honour, and went on to the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. The chief adviser said Monday that the visit of Myanmar's second-in-command would further strengthen the relationship between Dhaka and Yangon. Myanmar ambassador in Dhaka U Phae Than and Fakhruddin met at the Chief Adviser's Office ahead the visit Monday, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said. Munaim said the CA hoped they would have talks with the Myanmar delegation to improve communication system and leasing of land during the visit. Maritime boundaries and a cross-border road, as part of an overland link with China, are likely to top the agenda in talks with a high-level delegation from Myanmar arriving Tuesday. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Monday: "This is going to be a significant visit in terms of bilateral relations." "We have a number of projects we are planning together with Myanmar. And I am positive that this visit will boost our cooperation in all areas. "The discussion will focus on construction of a road which will hopefully link up with China, leasing land for agriculture and completion of maritime boundary talks." bdnews
