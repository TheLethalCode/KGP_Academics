The king's loyalists, many of them ministers and senior officials during his absolute rule which ended in 2006, stood in queues for more than an hour to greet Gyanendra on the 10th day of the Dasain festival, when people seek the blessings of elders. Gyanendra and his wife Komal applied red vermilion paste to the foreheads of people, some on wheelchairs and others with crutches, outside their heavily guarded home in the capital Kathmandu. "I feel very happy to receive their blessings," said 75-year-old Ripu Sudan Thapa after he greeted the former royal couple, who sat on chairs in front of their home. Nepal abandoned its 239-year-old monarchy in May and became a republic following a deal with former Maoist rebels to end their decade-long civil war.
