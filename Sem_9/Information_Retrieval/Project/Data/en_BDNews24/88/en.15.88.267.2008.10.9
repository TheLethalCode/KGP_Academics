 New Delhi,Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is watching the global financial crisis closely, will react swiftly to the needs of the market and will take steps to pump in cash if required, its finance minister said on Wednesday. The statement was the latest attempt by Indian policymakers to calm rattled markets, with the benchmark share index down 44 percent this year and the rupee at its weakest in six years as investors pull funds from higher risk emerging markets amid fears of a global recession. The comments, issued by the cabinet of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after a meeting to review the financial situation, came just hours after the US Federal Reserve led central banks in a round of rate cuts aimed at staving off economic contraction. "We wish to assure the people of India that the Indian economy has the capacity and the resilience to weather the storm that is blowing across the world," Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said, reading the statement in a news conference. "We have enough instruments to ensure the stability of the Indian financial system and we will continue to provide credit and other support for the growth of the Indian economy." India's central bank was not among those which took action on Wednesday, having cut its cash reserve ratio for banks on Monday in a surprise move to let more funds into the system and relieve pressure on local markets due to the global financial turmoil. The coordinated cuts helped lift the rupee against the dollar but the news came after the stock market ended down 3.14 percent, having earlier touched its lowest in two years. STRONG ECONOMY, SOUND BANKS Chidambaram said the fundamentals of Asia's third-largest economy were strong and growth in the current financial year would be close to 8 percent. Indian banks had shown great resilience in the face of global market turmoil and continued to provide credit to all sectors. "No one need have any fear about the soundness of India's banking system," he said, adding they were well regulated. The government had no view about the rupee and it would find its appropriate level once capital inflows improved following steps taken to ease inflows of foreign capital, he said. Earlier, Trade Minister Kamal Nath said the economy's strong fundamentals would help it through the crisis and ensure it continued to be attractive for foreign investors. "As we see today the global economy is in a deep crisis. We see in the United States, we see in Europe economies in the hospital," Nath told a news conference. "But India, with its strong fundamentals, we have the confidence to tide over this global financial crisis." GROWTH AND INFLATION Chidambaram said earlier in the week he expected growth of 8 percent this fiscal year to March 2009 and 9 percent next. But private economists forecast expansion will slow to about 7.5 percent this fiscal year from 9 percent last year. Growth in the June quarter slipped to an annual 7.9 percent, the slowest in 3-1/2 years. Higher interest rates to tame double-digit inflation and slowdowns in key export markets have seen them scale back expectations. Nath said foreign direct investment during the April to August period rose 124 percent from a year ago to $14.6 billion and added he was confident of meeting a $35 billion target for the fiscal year. He expected wholesale price inflation, which fell below 12 percent in late September, would continue to moderate in the coming weeks, while another key policymaker said it would fall below 10 percent within a couple of months. b
