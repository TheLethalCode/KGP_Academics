 KUALA LUMPUR, Wed Oct 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is to step down in March next year and on Wednesday endorsed his deputy, Najib Razak, as his successor. Abdullah told a press conference after a meeting of top officials from the coalition government that he would not stand in the leadership election for the main ruling party next March. By tradition, the president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) is leader of the coalition government that Abdullah presently heads. "I hope Najib will be my successor, I believe he can win," Abdullah said. Abdullah, who had planned to hand over power to Najib in 2010, will go down as the shortest-lived prime minister in Malaysia's history. Despite failing to deliver on judicial reforms and tackle corruption so far in his term in office, he promised new laws to tackle the issues in his remaining six months in power. Those are issues that he promised to solve when he became prime minister in 2003. A landslide victory in the 2004 general election was followed by the coalition's worst result in 50 years in an election in March this year
