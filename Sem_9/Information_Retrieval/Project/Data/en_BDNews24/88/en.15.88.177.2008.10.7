<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former India captain Saurav Ganguly announced on Tuesday that he will retire after the test series against Australia that starts this week. "This is going to be my last series," the 36-year-old left-hander told a packed news conference two days ahead of the first test. "I have decided to quit. I have told my team mates before I came here. These four test matches are going to be my last. And hopefully I'll go on a winning note." Ganguly was named in the squad for the first two tests despite being dropped for a premier domestic game, seen as a selection match, following a poor series in Sri Lanka in August. "To be honest I didn't expect to be picked for this series," said India's most successful test captain who staged a remarkable comeback in 2006 after losing his captaincy and later his spot in the team following a public spat with then coach Greg Chappell. Ganguly's retirement announcement came at the end of what was expected to be routine media conference, stirring up further a controversy over suggestions that the Indian cricket board had drawn up an exit plan for five senior players. A board official said last week that skipper Anil Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar, Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Vangipurappu Laxman, all well into their 30s, had been told to plan their retirements by December. Ganguly, however, said: "As far as I am concerned and some of the senior players are concerned, we have not received any intimation from the board on anything." Ganguly has played 109 tests, following a memorable century on debut at Lord's in 1996, and scored 6,888 runs with 15 hundreds. He has played 311 one-day internationals, scoring 11,363 runs with 22 hundreds although he has not played since November last year. The first test in Bangalore starts on Thursday
