<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has asked the chief election commissioner to take initiatives to ensure participation by all political parties in the upcoming polls for a credible national election. Seven senior Awami League leaders met CEC ATM Shamsul Huda on Wednesday and suggested the EC ask the government to create a congenial atmosphere. Election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain accompanied the CEC at the two-hour meeting beginning at 11am. The AL leaders asked the EC to defer upazila polls. They also made a number of demands at the meeting including withdrawal of emergency before polls, banning controversial agencies from observing polls, and cancelling a section of the new Representation of the People Ordinance. AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and chief of the AL's election committee HT Imam were in the delegation. On the AL's demand that Section 91 of the RPO giving the EC authority to cancel candidacy of any candidates be scrapped, the CEC said only an elected government could do that. Referring to the recent city and municipality polls, the CEC said, "Candidacy cannot be cancelled playfully. We are very careful about that." The CEC assured the AL leaders that it would not misuse the power it had been entrusted with. Ha also said: "Election observers must register too. Decision about them will be taken after verifying any allegations against them." HT Imam said they were told that the EC would publish a full list of the election observation agencies ahead of polls. "If anybody has any problem with any agency, he will be allowed to complain to the EC," the AL leader added. The CEC also said political parties might have associate organisations but they must not be named in the party constitution. The AL leaders objected to the proposal that the party constitution should not have any provision allowing any student, workers and teachers wings. Tofail Ahmed claimed: "Awami League does not have any front organisations. It has only associate organisations. Bangladesh Chhatra League, Sramik League and an organisation of teachers are the AL's associate organisations. "The AL will not accept any break with them." Tofail said the AL's working committee would however decide finally on the EC proposals. bdnews24.co
