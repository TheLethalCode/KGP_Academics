<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday ordered the government not to arrest or harass former prime minister Sheikh Hasina until Oct. 20 in Niko and barge-mounted power plants cases. The court also asked the government not to throw obstacles to her free movement at home and abroad. The vacation bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Zubaer Rahman Chowdhury delivered the orders on two bail petitions by Hasina. Awami League chief Hasina is on parole since June 11 to receive treatment in the United States after her arrest on July 16, 2007. Hasina's chief counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq argued in the hearing for Hasina. Advocate MA Aziz Khan on behalf of the Anticorruption Commission and deputy attorney general Mohammad Ali Akhand standing for the government opposed the bail pleas. The vacation bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Zubaer Rahman Chowdhury on Sept. 30 fixed October 5 for the hearing. The bail appeals in the two cases were filed on Sept. 22. Another High Court bench returned the two bail prayers on Sept. 23 on the grounds that it had no jurisdiction to hear them. On Sept. 29 the two bail prayers were filed afresh with the bench led by justice Md Anwarul Haque. ACC deputy director SM Sabbir Hasan on Dec. 9 last year filed the Niko corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina and six others. It was alleged that the Hasina administration inflicted Tk 13,600 crore in financial losses on the state by awarding Chhatak, Kamta and Feni gas fields to Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd without tender. ACC pressed charges in the court against nine persons including Hasina on May 7 this year. ACC deputy director SM Sabbir Hasan on Sept. 2 last year filed a corruption case with Tejgaon Police Station against seven persons including the former prime minister. It accused them of giving special benefits in the work of setting up three barge-mounted power plants in private sector by taking Tk 3 crore bribe in the name of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. The charge sheet in the case was submitted on Jan. 11. Another bench of the High Court on Monday rejected Hasina's bail prayer in the extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. bdne
