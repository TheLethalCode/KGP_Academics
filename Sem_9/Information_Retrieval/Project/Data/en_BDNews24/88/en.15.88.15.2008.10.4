<TITLE> Bangladeshi cricketers have all the shots: Oram </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram said on Saturday Bangladesh have got some exciting cricketers who could give the Kiwis a hard time with all the shots in their repertoire. "I think Bangladesh have got some very exciting players, who showed in New Zealand that they can play all the shots," Oram told reporters after a practice session at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday afternoon. "They have put us under pressure a number of times in the past. Tamim, Siddique and Ashraful are at the top of the order, and Aftab  (though) he has gone now, hasn't he," the left-handed medium pacer said. "They all are exciting players, the guys play all the shots, more shots than us, but maybe too many shots." The Black Caps arrived here on Sept 30, four days ahead of a three ODI and two Test series against Bangladesh. The first one-dayer will be held on Oct 9 at the national stadium. The 30-year old cricketer said that they had been out of international cricket since their England tour in June and had arrived here earlier than their schedule to get used to the humidity and the pitch conditions. The left-handed batsman said that they were here to win, but it was going to be a tough one. "We are here to win. It is going to be a lot tougher than it was back in New Zealand. The conditions are very different." "In test cricket, I think it's about which side has flexibility and depth in different conditions," he said. "We have got a challenge here. The wicket is probably drier, flatter, slower and probably going to assist the spinner more." Oram saw no problem with cricketers joining the Indian Cricket League, saying it was the players' decision. "I understand their decision. If they want to retire from their international careers, then it's their decision, I have got no problem with it." "We have lot of New Zealanders going that way as well. Guys who have retired like (Chris) Cairns  (Shane) Bond and (Lou) Vincent." "I think if you have an offer and financially it is secures your future, I have no problem with that," said Oram, who played in the BCCI-backed Indian Premier League. Meanwhile, the Tigers Saturday morning returned to action with two hours in net after a three-day Eid-ul-Fitr break. b
