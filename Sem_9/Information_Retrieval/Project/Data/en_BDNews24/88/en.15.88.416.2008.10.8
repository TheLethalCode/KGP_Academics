<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Fuel prices may be reduced within a month, given continued falls in the price of oil on the international market, said M Tamim Wednesday. The special assistant to the chief adviser for energy and mineral resources briefed reporters after a meeting with the finance and planning adviser at his Sher-e-Bangla Nagar office. "With the price of oil falling sharply in the international market, we are considering slashing fuel oil prices at home too," said Tamim. "The ministry has also finalised an oil tariff formula, for reviewing prices every month and effecting price adjustments every quarter after comparison through the period," said Tamim. "Since oil prices nosedived to under $100 a barrel in the international market, prices at home may see cuts within a month," the special assistant explained. Asked about the extent of the mulled price cuts, Tamim said the price adjustments will be effected keeping in view government subsidies of up to Tk 5,000 crore to the sector. A senior official from the finance ministry seeking anonymity told bdnews24.com that they've received a proposal forwarded by the energy ministry recommending a 10-20 percent cuts in oil tariff. The government hiked fuel prices on June 30. It raised the prices of diesel and kerosene to Tk 55 from Tk 40, of petrol to Tk 87 from Tk 65, and octane to Tk 90, up from Tk 67. The global price of oil had risen to $140 per barrel, when the government upped prices. The price stood at $89 a barrel on Wednesday. bdnews24.c
