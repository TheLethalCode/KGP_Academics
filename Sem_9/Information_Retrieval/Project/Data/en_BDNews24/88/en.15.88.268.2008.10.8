<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur should issue life bans to fans who verbally abused the club's former captain Sol Campbell last week, FA chairman David Triesman told a conference of soccer business leaders on Tuesday. He also said he would be meeting FIFA president Sepp Blatter soon, following the racist chants aimed at striker Emile Heskey when England played Croatia in a World Cup qualifier last month. Triesman, making the opening keynote speech at the Leaders in Football conference at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground, said Spurs should take the strongest possible action against the fans who abused Campbell when the side played Portsmouth at Fratton Park on Sept. 28. Former England defender Campbell left the club in 2001 to join bitter rivals Arsenal. Although he now plays for Portsmouth, he has never been forgiven for his move across north London by most Spurs supporters. "I abhor the treatment of Sol Campbell by supporters of a club that I have loved and supported all my life," Triesman said. "I hope the individuals will be identified and, if appropriate, banned from Tottenham's ground for life." Triesman said he would talk to Blatter about the 30,000 Swiss franc fine FIFA imposed on the Croatian FA following the World Cup qualifier in Zagreb, which England won 4-1. "I intend to seek an early meeting with Sepp Blatter to discuss the response to racism," he told delegates. TOUGHER SANCTIONS Later, he told reporters: "I want to make sure that in the international system the response to plain instances of racism and racist abuse are dealt with fully and effectively. "FIFA imposes its own fines and takes its own decisions but we'd meet obligations to players who just happen to be black or from a different religious group if we make sure at international level that we all understand the seriousness of racism to the same extent," he said. "I am optimistic it will be a fruitful discussion." Blatter said late on Monday that he was unhappy with the fine imposed by FIFA and intended to propose tougher sanctions in the next few months. "I was not happy about the fine handed down but as president I could not overrule or appeal the decision. But if England had appealed, then let's just say I would have supported it," Blatter told a group of journalists on a trip to Brussels. "I want to see our statutes toughened up and compatible with UEFA's rules. I want to see more points deducted and guilty clubs and countries forced to play behind closed doors. "I also back Michel Platini's stance that the referee should stop the match if he sees fit," he added
