<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  After a 10-day recess for the national football camp and the Eid-ul-Fitr festival, the Citycell B. League resumes Tuesday with title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club hosting the struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad KS. The match will start at 5:00pm at Bangabandhu National Stadium. After playing a 1-1 draw against Chittagong Abahani Limited in the first match, Federation Cup champions Mohammedan returned to their own style blanking Arambagh KS 3-0 in the next match. Coach Maruful Haq, however, was a bit worried over the players' fitness and the combination as the Motijheel-based outfit are out of a competitive match for over half a month since their last match on Sept 18. The coach is still optimistic about better performance against Mutkijoddha Sangsad as his eight top players were practicing football in the nine-day national football camp at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. Haq said that he had almost no problem to pick the best eleven tomorrow though defenders Hasan Al Mamun and Rajani Kanta Barman are in a bit doubtful. Besides, Mohammedan strike duo, Nigerian Bukola and Robin ,are in a fine form and they will appear against bottom-placed Muktijoddha Sangsad, who remained winless in three matches they played against minnows Khulna Abahani, Chittagong Abahani and Arambagh KS. Mohammedan are jointly in the third position with Chittagong Abahani securing four points each as Sheikh Russel KC and Brothers Union jointly lead the point table with seven points each from three outings while Dhaka Abahani are in the second position with six points. Mohammedan, however, played a match short of Russel, Brothers and Abahani's three matches.
