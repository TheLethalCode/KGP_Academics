 NEW DELHI, Wed Oct 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram and Trade Minister Kamal Nath tried to calm rattled markets on Wednesday, saying more cash could be provided to ease liquidity and stressing that Asia's third-largest economy remained strong and could withstand the global financial crisis. India's main BSE share index fell more than 8 percent at one stage to its lowest in two years, but recouped much of the day's losses to close down 3.14 percent, while the rupee dived to its lowest in more than six years during the day. Around the world, panic gripped the stock and foreign exchange markets once again as a global financial turmoil intensified worries of a recession and sent stocks reeling. "If need be, we will take further measures to infuse liquidity in the market," Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters, referring to measures taken this week to ease cash flows. "I am hopeful investors will start coming to the market." Meanwhile, Trade Minister Kamal Nath said the economy's strong fundamentals would help it through the crisis and ensure it continues to be attractive for foreign investors. "As we see today the global economy is in a deep crisis. We see in the United States, we see in Europe economies in the hospital," Nath told a news conference. "But India, with its strong fundamentals, we have the confidence to tide over this global financial crisis." Earlier this week Chidambaram said he expected the economy to grow 8 percent this fiscal year and 9 percent next. But private economists forecast expansion will ease to about 7.5 percent this fiscal after growth in the June quarter eased to an annual 7.9 percent, the slowest pace in 3- years. Higher interest rates designed to tame double digit inflation and slowdowns in key export markets have forced them to scale back expectations. Nath said foreign direct investment during the April to August period rose 124 percent from a year ago to $14.6 billion and added he was confident of meeting a $35 billion target for the fiscal year. He added wholesale price inflation which had fallen below 12 percent in late September would continue to moderate in the coming weeks, while another key policymaker said it would fall below 10 percent within a couple of months. Annual wholesale price inflation has eased in recent weeks but is still close to an annual 12 percent. "Inflation has softened and the price graph is flat. I hope inflation will come down to high single-digits in a couple of months," said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of India's Planning Commission, which charts five-year growth plans. On Monday, the Reserve Bank of India announced a surprise half a percentage point cut in the proportion of deposits that banks must keep with the central bank. The reduction, which is expected to release 200 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) into the banking system, was intended to alleviate pressures on local markets due to the global financial crisis, the central bank said
