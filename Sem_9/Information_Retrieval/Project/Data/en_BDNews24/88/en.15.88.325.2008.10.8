 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  The 10th edition of National Cricket League, the country's only first-class cricket, begins Friday with six divisional teams without national cricketers fighting it out. The defending champions in four-day matches, Khulna will take on Sylhet at home, runners-up Rajshahi face Barisal in Rajshahi and Dhaka will play against Chittagong at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium on the opening day. "We have tried to make all the pitches greenish so that both batsmen and bowlers can prove themselves in a healthy competition," said Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, chairman of the BCB cricket operations committee, at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Lipu said they were aware of last season's poor umpiring and had already asked the umpires' committee to appoint the best available umpires this time. The league will see no stars playing for the divisional teams as the national team have international commitments until December while the longer-version matches of the league are scheduled to complete on Dec 24. Bangladesh are now busy with the home series against New Zealand and will play an away series against South Africa next month before hosting Sri Lanka in December. Tournament committee chairman Golam Mohammad Alamgir said they had increased facilities to the players and the teams compared with the last edition of the league. The last league had a budget of Tk 4.3 crore, but this time the estimated budget has also been increased to Tk 4.73 crore, he added. He, however, said they would try to save money from the estimated budget and added that sponsor Ispahani Mirzapore Tea would provide Tk 35-40 lakh. Chief selector Rafiqul Alam and Ispahani Group of Companies chairman Mirza Ali Behrouze Ispahani were, among others, present. bdne
