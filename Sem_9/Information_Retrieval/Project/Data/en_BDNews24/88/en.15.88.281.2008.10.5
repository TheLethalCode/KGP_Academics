<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission's decision to press charges against Khaleda Zia and others in the Barapukuria coalmine case will put general elections in doubt, BNP leaders say. The ACC on Wednesday approved the chargesheet against former prime minister Khaleda and 15 others in the case that alleges irregularities and corruption in handing over operations of the coalmine to a Chinese company. BNP's vice president MK Anwar and joint senior secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said such approach of the ACC after the announcement of the date for general elections will the elections at stake. "No atmosphere congenial to fair elections has been created for all the parties to participate. The lack of coordination among its institutions can hamper elections. It has been visible with the activities between government and its other institutions." Anwar said to reporters at his Elephant Road residence. Roy said to reporters at BNP's Naya Paltan central office, "[The government's] main task is to create congenial atmosphere after the announcement of election date. It is not a good sign to give approval to the chargesheet submission. "Because of this, whatever doubts there have been in the public minds will deepen." He demanded withdrawal of the case. On the EC's position on the mandatory registration of political parties under the new electoral laws, the former state minister said, "Such hard stance of the Election Commission will not augur well. It will add to anxieties. Because the commission should make sure that political parties are not opposed to them." bdne
