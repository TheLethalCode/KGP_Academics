<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club pulled off the biggest triumph of the season with a comprehensive 7-0 win over struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad KS in the Citycell B. League encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium Tuesday. With two straight wins in three matches, the popular black and white outfit joined the top of the point table along with Sheikh Russel KC and Brothers Union, who have seven points each from three outings. Muktijoddha Sangsad suffering from financial crisis to run the camp and to give the payments to the players remained winless to stay at the bottom of the 11-team point table after playing four matches. Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olaleken struck twice while Nasir Hossain, Enamul Haq Sharif, Hazem Khaled Mahmud, Faisal Mahmud and Mohammad Robin netted one goal each as Mohammedan returned to action 18 days later since their 3-0 win over Arambagh KS on Sept 18. Mohammedan, who also recorded 7-0 triumph against Rahmatganj MFS in the inaugural professional football league, initially looked disorganised in the midfield, but later had the superior ball possession as the Muktijoddha Sangsad players' legs seemed tired after having played just 20 minutes. Left-winger Nasir put Mohammedan ahead in the 32nd minute as he send a Hazem lob to home after racing past Muktijoddha medio Biddut and third choice goalkeeper Mashudur Rahman. Two minutes later, Bukola, who seemingly stayed off-side, doubled the lead with a header off a Hazem cross. After resumption, Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq sent Sharif on the left to add the pace and the winger made the margin 3-0 from a difficult angle before the watch struck the first minute of the second half. Hazem then headed a Sharif cross home in the 66th minute while Faisal Mahmud widened the margin six minutes later with a powerful shot at the edge of the left box. Bukola struck his league's third and team's sixth goal in the 75th minute after capitalising on a low cross from Sharif from the right while Robin sealed the match eight minutes from time. With goalkeeper Mashudur Rahman leaving the field in the 88th minute with a head injury he sustained during Bukola's second strike, Muktijoddha Sangsad were reduced to 10 men as coach Nasir earlier made his all three changes, and Mohammedan spent the rest of the time playing among themselves.
