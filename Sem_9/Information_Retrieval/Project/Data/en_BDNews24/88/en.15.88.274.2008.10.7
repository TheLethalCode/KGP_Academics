 BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Last month's decision to expand the European championship finals from 16 to 24 teams was branded "silly" by FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday. "I was not happy about it," Blatter told reporters on a visit to Brussels. "Practically half of the associations will qualify which seems silly to me." European soccer's governing body voted to expand the Euro finals from 2016, which means nearly half of UEFA's 53 countries will reach the finals. "I am not sure about (diminishing) the quality but it is too complicated for me and not simple enough for countries to compete," added Blatter. The head of the game's world ruling body also said last month's decision to relaunch the UEFA Cup as the Europa League again opened up the possibility of a European super league. "We have the Champions League and this new Europa League which essentially is a first and second division in Europe," said Blatter. "A few years ago a number of the big clubs had the objective of a European league, which remains in the heads of some clubs, and this now opens the door once again to a super league to the detriment of football.
