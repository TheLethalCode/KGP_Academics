 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's refusal to grant bail in the extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali, a lawyer said. The hearing on the appeal petition may be held on Monday. "An appeal has been filed against the High Court order rejecting the bail prayer in Noor Ali case. The hearing on the appeal will be held at the court of the Appellate Division chamber judge on Monday," her chief counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said later said to reporters. The High Court on Sept. 29 turned down Hasina's appeal for bail in the case. The court granted her bail in the case on Aug. 7 last year only for the Appellate Division to cancel it on Aug. 27. Earlier on Sept. 24 the High Court heard Hasina's bail prayer and set Sept. 29 for a ruling. Unique Group chairman Noor Ali on June 13, 2007 filed the Tk 5 crore extortion case against Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helal and his wife Rupa Chowdhury with Tejgaon Police Station. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007 and she got release on parole for treatment abroad under a government executive order on June 11 this year. bdne
