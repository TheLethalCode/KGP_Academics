<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 07 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a deal on Tuesday to avoid double taxation, seeking to almost triple trade volume between the two neighbours to half a billion dollars. The agreement was signed at the end of a bilateral dialogue led by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and Myanmar's visiting senior vice general Maung Aye at the former's office. "We have signed an agreement on avoidance of double taxation to boost trade between the two friendly neighbours," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters at a press conference at the Chief Adviser's Office after the talks. He said at present bilateral trade volume stood at $140 million. "We are seeking to increase the trade volume to $500 million. We hope bilateral trade will increase significantly after Gen Maung Aye's Bangladesh visit," said Iftekhar. Myanmar also agreed in principle to export up to one lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh on a regular basis. "The Myanmar delegation has told us that its rice production was hit by cyclone Nargis, but rice production increased now," said Iftekhar. "They will export 50,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes of rice on a regular basis; and this is a big achievement," Iftekhar said. The foreign adviser said the chief adviser proposed direct air links between Bangladesh and Myanmar and simplification of visas for the businessmen. Myanmar responded positively in this regard, he said. "The chief adviser has also requested Gen Maung Aye to extend the proposed Bangladesh-Myanmar road up to China," the adviser said. "The Myanmar side said they would examine the proposal. "Hopefully, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China will soon sit to discuss the extension of the road," said Iftekhar. Bangladesh has been funding the construction of a 23-kilometres cross-border road from Teknaf to Bawlibazar in Myanmar. The construction of the road would start soon, said the foreign adviser. If Bangladesh wants to be connected to China by road, Myanmar needs to construct a 120 kilometres road up to Kunming in China's Yunan province. The CA also proposed setting up of a gas pipeline from Myanmar to produce fertiliser in Bangladesh to sell back to its neighbour. "We have proposed installing a gas pipeline from Myanmar to produce fertiliser in Bangladesh as both countries need fertiliser," said the foreign adviser. The adviser also said Bangladesh would export pharmaceutical items to Myanmar, and import fresh fish. But there was little progress on leasing of Myanmar land to Bangladeshi entrepreneurs for cultivation. "Contract farming is not an easy issue. This is our interest. "There are some unresolved issues like who will cultivate the land and how," said the foreign adviser. The chief adviser also requested General Maung Aye to help resolve the dispute over maritime border demarcations, he said. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, also present in the talks, said in reply to a question that Myanmar was not carrying out oil and gas exploration in the disputed areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh and Myanmar resumed maritime border demarcation talks earlier this year after a pause of 22 years. The next round of official maritime border delimitation meeting will take place in January in Myanmar. bdn
