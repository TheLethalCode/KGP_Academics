 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)Proshika president Quazi Faruque Ahmed Monday announced launching of a new party and told Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman that he wanted to be part of the AL-led grand alliance. "I have had talks with the acting AL president about joining the grand alliance and he showed positive attitude in this respect," the NGO official told reporters emerging from Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home in the evening. "A decision in this regard would be taken after the Awami League president returns home," he said. AL presidium member Abdur Razzak was also present during the meeting. "We want to work with the democratic, progressive and pro-liberation forces," Quazi Faruque said of his new party, styled Oikyabadda Nagorik Andolon or United Citizen's Movement. Zillur Rahman said: "We have welcomed them. Let the leader (Sheikh Hasina) return. Then we will discuss the matter with the alliance partners and take a decision." Replying to another question, Zillur said, "We will in no way go to election without a free Sheikh Hasina." Earlier, Quazi Faruque at a press conference at the organisation's central office at Mirpur said the new political party would be formally launched through a council Wednesday. About 3,000 councillors from across the country will attend the council at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB). Asked why a new political party was being formed amid the state of emergency Quazi Faruque said, "This is no new organization. The organisation has been active since 1996. The leaders and workers of the organisation have worked throughout the country to raise awareness among the voters." Quazi Faruque said his party would combat "criminalisation of politics" in the country that he said had started with the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. "In the past the Nagorik Andolon was with the 14-party. This time also it will be with the 14-party and the grand alliance." He said that the Nagorik Andolon would field candidates in the national election and register as a party fulfilling all rules of the Election Commission. Responding to another question, the Proshika chief said Proshika facilities would be used for Nagorik Andolon. bdne
