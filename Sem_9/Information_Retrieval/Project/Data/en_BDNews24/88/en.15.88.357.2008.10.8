 Chittagong, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury was released from detention at BSMMU Hospital on Wednesday. "The mayor was released from guard at the hospital just after 3.30pm," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. Speaking to reporters in a BSMMU corridor after his release, Mohiuddin, also an Awami League leader, demanded permanent release of Sheikh Hasina and release of all detained leaders of the party. Asked about the national election, the mayor said he would go with the party decisions on polls. Chittagong AL leaders and workers hoped Mohiuddin's release would speed up the party activities in the port city. "I am very happy that the mayor has been released. Keeping him behind bars without trial was an injustice to the people of Chittagong, not only to the mayor," AL leader Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser told bdnews24.com. He hoped his release would accelerate the development activities of Chittagong city too. Former minister MA Mannan said Mohiuddin was kept behind bars without any specific allegation that was not tenable at all, he added. The ex-president of the Chittagong city AL said the party's next decisions about the city would be taken in line with the guidelines of Mohiuddin. Mohiduddin might return to Chittagong Thursday, said Kazi Inamul Huq Danu, general secretary of Chittagong city AL. Danu said the mayor was likely to go abroad for treatment after staying in Chittagong for up to three days. He would talk to party leaders and workers at his Sholoshahar Chashma Hill home before leaving the country. Earlier on Tuesday, lawyer Ibrahim Hossain Chowdhury Babul told bdnews24.com that Mohiuddin was likely to be released anytime on Wednesday. He said the mayor had secured bail in all cases against him, which meant there were no more hurdles to his release. The most recent bail was secured in the Bijoy TV corruption with a Tk 80,000 bond. Arrested on March 7, 2007, he fell seriously ill during his detention in Bandarban jail. He was taken to Chittagong Medical College Hospital and later shifted to the intensive care unit at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. The mayor has been accused in some 14 separate graft cases. bdnews24.com/
