 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Partex Group chairman MA Hashem has been charged with possessing wealth beyond known sources and giving false statement to the anti-graft officials. ACC deputy director Monzur Ahmed filed the chargesheet with the Dhaka CMM court Sunday noon. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani signed the chargesheet against the former BNP MP and business tycoon. But his wife, Sultana Hashem, was not charged as the investigating officer said allegations against her were not proved. Investigating officer Monzur Ahmed filed the case with Ramna thana on December 5 last year. According to the case details, the ACC gave a notice to the former Noakhali-2 MP to submit a statement of wealth of his family members including himself. Hashem, then in jail but later bailed out, submitted the statement of his and wife's wealth through the prisons authorities. In the statement, he declared he had wealth worth Tk 60.83 crore. The ACC alleges that Hashem concealed information about wealth worth Tk 3.24 crore. But ACC investigators have cleared former energy Dr Khandker Mosharraf Hossain and his wife Bilkis Akhter Hossain and six others in one case, and former BNP MP from Dhaka-4 seat Salahuddin Ahmed, wife Shamsun Nahar and their son Robin in another. The cases were filed with Dhanmondi and Shyampur thanas.
