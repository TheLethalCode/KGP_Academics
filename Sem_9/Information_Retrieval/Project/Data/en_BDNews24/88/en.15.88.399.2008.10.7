 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com political correspondent Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will set free all front organisations, a decision the party's central working committee will finalise at a meeting slated for Oct. 11. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam broke the news to bdnews24.com after a meeting of the party's policymaking presidium at the home of acting president Zillur Rahman in Gulshan. "We will have no front organisations. The matter will be finalised at the central working committee meeting on Saturday (Oct. 11)." He said the associate organisations will run independent of Awami League influence and make decisions on their own. The move comes in line with the new electoral laws that made it mandatory for political parties to disband front organisations to register with the Election Commission. The deadline for registration ends on Oct. 15. The party has nine front organisations. These are student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, youth front Bangladesh Jubo League, women wing Mahila Awami League, peasants front Bangladesh Krishak League, labour wing Jatiya Sramik League, weavers front Bangladesh Tanti League, volunteers wing Awami Sechchhasebak League, physicians front Swadhinata Chikitshak Parishad and lawyers wing Awami Ainjibi Parishad. Ashraful would not say whether they will dismantle the overseas wings of the party. After the AL presidium meeting, Ashraful told a press conference they would send a delegation to the EC headquarters at 11am Wednesday to discuss electoral laws with the election commissioners. "The election code of conduct states that the Election Commission may scrap candidacy of any candidate even after the finalisation of candidates' list after scrutiny of the nomination papers. "We are surprised at such law. We will go to the Election Commission to discuss these issues." He also said they would collect registration form from the EC secretariat on Wednesday. The working committee meeting on Saturday would amend the party constitution for getting registered with the EC as a political party, Ashraful told reporters. The party would also register its objection about local observers to the elections with the EC on that day. It would write to the financiers of the local poll observers asking them not to provide them money, the stand-in general secretary said. "No local observer can be allowed. I have seen in my electoral constituency that senior leaders of (BNP's student wing) Chhatra Dal and BNP were moving inside the polling station wearing observer's badges." He also demanded lifting of the state of emergency. "It has to be ensured by enforcing law that the elections remain free from intimidation and vote buying. "The government can use some emergency rules as general law. But there is no need to keep the state of emergency in its entirety in force." Replying to a question, Ashraf said after finalising the issue of 'grand alliance' they would focus on nomination. He said the party's draft manifesto was ready. The working committee in its meeting will approve the manifesto with some changes. Ashraf said party chief Sheikh Hasina, now on parole receiving treatment in the United States, has told them that she might return home on Oct. 26. He expressed fear over the security of the former prime minister. "We are worried over her security. We have had primary discussion with the government on the issue. The government has also asked us to apply for security for our leader. "We will apply before she returns home." The Awami League, Ashraful said, wanted that Hasina was provided security similar to the head of government. Presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Motia Chowdhury, chairman of election steering committee HT Imam and party information and research secretary Nooh-ul Alam Lenin were present. bdnew
