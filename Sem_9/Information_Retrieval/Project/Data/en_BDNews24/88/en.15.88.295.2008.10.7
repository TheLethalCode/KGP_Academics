 JOHANNESBURG, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa dropped fast bowlers Makhaya Ntini and Andre Nel from the one-day squad to play Kenya and Bangladesh later this month, with an eye on the 2011 one-day World Cup. Ntini has been a permanent fixture in both the test and one-day squads for the best part of a decade but, like Nel, is 31-years-old and is deemed unlikely for the next World Cup. "That has to be our focus now, building a squad for the 2011 World Cup is the priority," national coach Mickey Arthur told Reuters on Tuesday after the squads were named. The Proteas are due to play two one-day internationals against Kenya and a Twenty20 international, three ODIs and two tests against Bangladesh. South Africa included uncapped all rounders Ryan McLaren and Rory Kleinveldt, chosen for the Twenty20 game, in the limited overs squads. Off spinner Johan Botha has been made vice-captain. "Johan is to be congratulated on his promotion and he will, in all probability, captain the side in the two matches against Kenya as we only expect Graeme Smith to recover from injury in time for the series against Bangladesh," Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola told a news conference. South Africa's test squad contains 13 of the players who triumphed 2-1 in England in July and August, with Nel and second spinner Robin Peterson missing out. Test squad: Graeme Smith, (captain), Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn, Monde Zondeki. One-day squad: Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Amla, Kallis, Duminy, De Villiers, Justin Ontong, Albie Morkel, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Steyn, Zondeki. Twenty20 squad: Smith (captain), Loots Bosman, De Villiers, Gibbs, Duminy, Ontong, Botha, Rory Kleinveldt, McLaren, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Steyn
