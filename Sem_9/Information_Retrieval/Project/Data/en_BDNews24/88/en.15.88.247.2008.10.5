 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Advisers Hossain Zillur Rahman and Hassan Ariff have both emphasised that the government is taking every measure to hold a successful general election. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman on Sunday urged all to work together and be optimistic about the national polls set for Dec 18. "We should not sound cynical at this crisis moment of the country. We have to nurture hope. The solution lies in hope," the adviser, who oversees the education and commerce ministries, told reporters at the Secretariat. Said Zillur: "We all will have to do our part from our own respective positions. At this time of crisis instead of speaking of frustration we should all talk about hope." "Nobody can stay idle with only three months left ahead of the election." Zillur ducked a question on the latest political situation and its impact on electoral preparations, but said the government had taken all types of initiatives to make the polls a success. Law adviser Hassan Ariff said: "I do not see any doubt about the election. We hope the election will be held on time. All necessary initiatives in this regard will be taken." The two spoke after a meeting with fellow advisers Ghulam Quader, Anwarul Iqbal and Rasheda K Chowdhury. bdnews24.
