 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Awami League acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam was optimistic on Sunday that all obstacles "will be cleared before polls", and expressed the hope that BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, will participate in the general elections. Speaking in an interview with bdnews24.com and private television channels, Ashraful said about the Dec 18 polls: "A social contract has been made between the government and people. If elections are not held on time, people won't accept it. But at the moment, no apprehension is to be sighted about elections on the stipulated date." Demanding the lifting of emergency, however, he said: "Government should formulate as many laws as needed to make sure people are able to vote for their handpicked representatives. But in this case, there is no need to continue emergency." Whether Hasina's bail refusal, fresh charges against Khaleda Zia, redemarcation of constituencies, and amendment of the Representation of People Order will produce any bar to the elections, he said: "These won't stand in the way of polls. All these issues will be cleared before polls." Ashraful said he saw no reason why BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, should not go to polls and said he expected the government and BNP to narrow their gap regarding upazila elections. The AL leader said his party was in full-fledged mode over election preparations. Party leaders would discuss electoral issues, including registration with the Election Commission, its election manifesto, electioneering, and seat sharing with alliance partners, prior to Hasina's return, he said. The AL president will give a final decision when she arrives back in the country. "Before applying for registration, AL's working committee will sit to amend its constitution," he added. Asked when a final decision would be taken on the make-up of the 'grand alliance', the general secretary said: "Many people are still out of Dhaka. The Eid holidays have just ended. Many will return to Dhaka after Durga Puja holidays." "A few central leaders are also out of the country at present. We will sit in a meeting about the grand alliance when everyone returns." "We are continuing our primary election work. The concluding work will be only after Hasina's return. Many want to join hands in the grand alliance. We will decide following discussions between the present 14-party alliance," said Ashraf. Asked whether AL was attaching priority upon the 14 parties in forming the grand alliance, he said: "The 14-party is an ideal alliance. On the other hand, the grand alliance is an electoral one." Questioned about former president and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad sounding a warning about seat allocations in the grand alliance, Ashraful said: "Ershad has not given any ultimatum to us. Only time will say. The decision has to be taken only after discussions with allies on seat sharing." Asked what things may be added anew to AL's election manifesto, he said: "How to create people's employment in light of present conditions, including education, health, communications, democratisations, how to lessen inflation and keep price of commodities within the reach of commoners, will be added to the manifesto" The general secretary also said Awami League wants all war criminals be tried under international law, and AL would return to the country's 1972 Constitution, if given a chance. " We believe in the Constitution of 1972." Asked about Hasina's homecoming, he said: "She will return this month." bdnews
