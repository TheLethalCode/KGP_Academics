 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday refused former finance minister Saifur Rahman anticipatory bail in the Barapukuria coalmine graft case and ordered him to surrender in the lower court within four weeks, instead. The vacation bench of justices AKM Fazlur Rahman and Abdul Awal gave the order. Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Judge Md Azizul Haque ordered arrest of nine of the accused in the case on Monday, including BNP policymaker Saifur and former minister and Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed. He also asked authorities to submit arrest reports to the court on Oct. 12. "We had appealed for anticipatory bail. But the court said our client cannot be granted bail and ordered him to surrender in the lower court within four weeks," Saifur's counsel Abdur Rezzak Khan later said to reporters. Copy of the High Court order will be produced on Oct. 12 to lower court, Khan said. On that day, former prime minister Khaleda Zia who secured anticipatory bail in the case and four former cabinet colleagues  Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Motiur Rahman Nizami, MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam will also have to appear in the court. The other seven facing arrest are former minister Aminul Haq, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former energy secretary Nazrul Islam, former chairman of Petrobangla SR Osmany, former director (mines and minerals) Moyeenul Ahsan, former managing director of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd Sirajul Islam, and chairman of Hosaf Group Moazzem Hossain, the local agent of the Chinese firm which was awarded the running of the coal mine. No warrant of arrest has been issued against the five accused who had secured bail in the case from High Court. They are Khaleda, Nizami, Anwar, Shamsul Islam and Bhuiyan. Khaleda, the BNP chairperson, secured four months' bail from the High Court on Sept 8. Md Abdur Razzak, lawyer of Jamaat-e-Islami chief Nizami, told bdnews24.com: "The High Court granted Motiur Rahman Nizami bail in the case on August 26 until submission of the charge sheet. He will appear before the court on Oct 12 and make a fresh appeal for bail." As two other charge-sheeted accused in the case, former ministers Khandker Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, are in jail in connection with separate cases, the court ordered jail authorities to produce them before the court on the same date. ACC officer Abul Kashem Fakir pressed charges against 16 people with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka on Sunday. The case was filed with Shahbagh Police Station on Feb. 26 this year citing irregularities and corruption in awarding the production, management and maintenance work of Barapukuria coalmine to a Chinese firm. The agreement with Chinese firm Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) caused losses of Tk 158.71 crore to the state, the case alleges. bdnew
