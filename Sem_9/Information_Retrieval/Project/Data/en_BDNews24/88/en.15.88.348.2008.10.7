<TITLE> Emergency will protect voters: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The general election may be held under emergency rules to protect voters, women and minorities in particular, an adviser said on Tuesday. Education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman also said the state of emergency had already been eased to such a level that it was now imposed in name only. He, however, said it would be relaxed further, if necessary, to facilitate election campaign and politics. The adviser spoke to reporters at the communications ministry at the Secretariat. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader and law adviser AF Hassan Ariff were also present. Earlier, four advisers charged with the dialogue with political parties held a meeting at the office of communications. Local government adviser M Anwarul Iqbal was also present. Hossain Zillur said the people expected meaningful elections and political transition to stability after the elections. The government has created an environment for a meaningful voting. On the government's dialogue with BNP, he said, "There has been much progress regarding the dialogue with BNP. "The government is taking quick steps for political transition. Dialogue with them would be held soon. They are also showing great interest. I hope the dialogue will be fruitful." On the debate about whether the elections should be held under the state of emergency, the adviser said emergency had not stood in the way of elections to four city corporation and nine municipalities. It was a rehearsal for the national elections slated for Dec. 18, and if there were obstacles to smooth holding of the upcoming elections the government would remove them. Post-election violence, intimidation and vote buying were a reality in Bangladesh, which necessitated elections under emergency, he argued. "The international community realised the matter and the European Union too would also realise it soon." Hossain Zillur said the government was going to start dialogue at the grassroots level again to know whether there was any doubt over election and what the common people wanted. He said no dates for the dialogue had been finalized, however. The adviser said dialogue between the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia was necessary for post-election stability. However, it was not a matter only for the government to consider; they would also have to take initiatives, he added. "Everything depends on whether they are interested," he said. bdne
