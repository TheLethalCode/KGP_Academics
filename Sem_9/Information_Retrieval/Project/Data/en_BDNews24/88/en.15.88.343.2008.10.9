 WASHINGTON, Thu Oct 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday it had activated an emergency financing mechanism last used in the 1990s Asian crisis and was ready to assist countries in distress from a mounting financial crisis. The emergency facility was created in 1995 as a way of speeding up the approval of loans to countries in need. It was last activated during the Asian financial crisis that erupted in 1997 and led to sharp declines in currencies, stock markets, and other asset prices of a number of Asian countries. "Yesterday I activated emergency procedures so the IMF can respond quickly ... to be able to answer problems that may happen in some of the emerging countries," IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a news conference. "We are ready to answer any demand by countries facing problems," he added. Speaking ahead of IMF and World Bank meetings of finance leaders in Washington this weekend, Strauss-Kahn said the main task of global policy-makers was to restore confidence in global markets. He called for further coordinated steps to calm markets, beyond the unprecedented simultaneous action of central banks on Wednesday to cut rates to contain the crisis. Strauss-Kahn said the global economy was on the cusp of recession but with quick and forceful action, the spreading crisis could be contained. "All kinds of cooperation has to be recommended. All lonely acts have to be avoided, if not condemned," he said. He said in the last several weeks, emerging economies had started to be affected by cuts in credit lines and a broader slowing of demand as advanced economies were slowed by the crisis
