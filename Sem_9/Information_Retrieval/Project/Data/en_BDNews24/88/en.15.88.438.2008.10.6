<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)The United States government has decided to send election observers to cover the general election in December, even if the emergency is not lifted, said US ambassador James F Moriarty on Tuesday. The ambassador told reporters the US had already decided to send out 120 polls observers. They will be here observing the polls even if the emergency stays, said Moriarty, as he was leaving the office of adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury after a meeting. Replying to a query, he said elections could be held even amid emergency. The important thing was to ensure free and fair polls, he stressed. The major political parties should be working together with the government, he added. Asked if he thought a 'level playing field' had been created for holding free and fair polls, Moriarty replied in the affirmative. The US felt considerable progress had been achieved in levelling the playing field by now, he said. Democracy appears to be in the process of being well instituted too, he said. On seating the two major opposition leaders together, he said it should help in consolidating the democratic processes in the country. bdnews24.
