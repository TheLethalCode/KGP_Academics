<TITLE> Gerrard and I have not been at our best, says Lampard </TITLE>

 LONDON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Frank Lampard said on Tuesday that he and Steven Gerrard agreed with the fans' verdict that the duo had too often failed to reproduce their club form when playing for England, particularly when they were in the same team. The failure of the two world class midfielders to gel when playing for their country has long been a source of frustration for the fans and a succession of managers. "If we are both honest and Stevie is a very honest man, we both haven't played as well for England as we have for our clubs particularly over the last two seasons," Lampard said. "I think if we had done we probably would have qualified for the Euros," Lampard told reporters ahead of Saturday's World Cup Group Six qualifier against Kazakhstan at Wembley. "That's the case whether we've played together or separately. We have to try and make it work if we're asked to play together andwe have to stop worrying about individual players. What we need to do now is to look at the team." Gerrard was ruled out through injury from last month's 4-1 victory in Croatia, when Lampard played a deeper role than usual. With the Liverpool man, who recently complained he hardly ever got to play in an attacking midfield role for England, available again for Saturday, coach Fabio Capello has some decisions to make. "I think it's pretty obvious when you play with Theo Walcott, Joe Cole and two strikers and you go to a place like Croatia where they can knock the ball about, if you leave Gareth Barry on his own in midfield you are going to get exposed," Lampard said. "Maybe we're in a better environment for it to improve now. There is a lot more emphasis on the tactical work now. In the past we probably did just discuss it in the dressing room and say if one sees the other go, he stays back. "In a lot of games now the midfield is overloaded and you can't just leave one player on his own. But there's no better environment to learn than with Capello and the way we are working now. "I'd like to think it can work. We both care passionately about playing for our country and we both want to play well for our country.
