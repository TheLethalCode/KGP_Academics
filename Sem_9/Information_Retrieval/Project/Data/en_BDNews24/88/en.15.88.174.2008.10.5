<TITLE> Egyptian foreign minister visits Iraq: state TV </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Sun Oct 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Sunday, state-run television reported, the latest sign that fellow Arab nations are slowly restoring ties after over five years of war. Iraqiya television also reported that Egypt's energy minister had arrived in Baghdad. In recent months, officials from other Arab nations have made long-awaited visits to Shia-led Iraq, which is hoping that a dramatic reduction in violence will encourage a revival in diplomatic ties with its Middle Eastern neighbors. But Arab nations have moved slowly, in part due to fear that diplomats will be targeted for attack. Egypt's envoy to Iraq was kidnapped and killed shortly after he arrived in 2005
