 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Construction of the 25-kilometre road linking Bangladesh and Myanmar is likely to begin in March 2009, communications adviser Ghulam Quader said on Wednesday. After a meeting with Myanmar's construction minister Saw Tun, Ghulam Quader said they awaited approval by the Myanmar government to begin preliminary surveys. The communications ministry has already sent a list of four firms to the Myanmar authorities for appointment of a consultant for the project. Quader handed over a file regarding the construction of the highway to the Myanmar minister at the housing and public works ministry. The Myanmar minister, according to Quader, said his country would quickly make a decision on the matter. The communications adviser told reporters that they had addressed trade in addition to construction of the highway at the meeting. Quader said works on the road would start once a consultant was appointed. He hoped construction of the 25-kilometre road from Teknaf to Boulibazar, two kilometres on Bangladesh territory and the remainder on the Myanmar side, would begin by March 2009. Bangladesh would finance the construction. The adviser said they had also talks on gas import from Myanmar, appointment of Bangladeshi firms for construction in Myanmar and extension of Myanmar visas for Bangladeshi businessmen to 30 days from 14 days. The Myanmar minister did not speak to reporters. bdne
