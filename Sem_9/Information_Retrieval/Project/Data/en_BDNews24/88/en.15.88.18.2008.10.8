<TITLE> New Zealand fast bowler Martin out of Bangladesh tests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin has been ruled out of the tour of Bangladesh so he can continue treatment on a lingering hamstring and lower back injury, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Wednesday. Martin sustained the injury while playing county cricket in England and had already been ruled out of the one-day series that preceeded the two-test series. NZC selector Dion Nash said that while Martin was pain free he had lost condition and it was decided it was more beneficial that he continue his rehabilitation rather than join the tour. "With such a big season ahead it would have been foolish to rush Chris back too early," Nash said in a statement. "He is better at home working on his fitness and strength." Martin has been replaced by Mark Gillespie for the tests. Gillespie is already in Bangladesh with the one-day squad. New Zealand play three one-day internationals from Oct. 9-14 before the two-test series starts on Oct. 17
