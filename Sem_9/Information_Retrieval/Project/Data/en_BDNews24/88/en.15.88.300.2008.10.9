<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  A top Awami League figure has repeated the party's request to the Election Commission, as well as the government, to take steps to ensure participation of all political parties in the general election. AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, speaking to reporters at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi Thursday, said: "We want the next general election with the participation of all political parties." "If any party objects to participating, the government and the EC must sit with them to find out why they are reluctant and to remove the obstacles." Ashraf also informed reporters that Awami League has started the initial work of nominating party candidates. He said the party is reviewing the previous list of nominees for the cancelled Jan 22 2007 election, as well as the two previous polls, and is collecting information from field level. He added that the selection of grassroots candidates would be given emphasis. Ashraf said Awami League would amend some sections of its party constitution for registration with the Election Commission. Asked whether the power of the party president would be reduced in the constitution for registration, in line with new electoral laws, he said: "Most of the conditions in the new RPO were in the AL constitution already." None of the powers of the president need to be curbed for registration with the EC, the AL leader said. "A party working committee meeting slated for Saturday will discuss these issues in detail," said Ashraful. He elaborated: "Nomination from the grassroots, ensuring a 33 percent women's quota in the party by 2020, not keeping any front organisations, only associate bodies, would feature prominently in the discussion." When asked about his comment on Tuesday about setting free all fronts or associate organisations, Ashraf said that during the talks with the EC on Wednesday they projected their party position on maintaining associate organisations only and the EC had accepted it. bdnews
