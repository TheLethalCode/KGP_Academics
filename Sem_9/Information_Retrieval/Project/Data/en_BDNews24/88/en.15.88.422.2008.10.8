 STOCKHOLM, Wed Oct 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Americans and a Japanese researcher won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Wednesday for the discovery of a glowing protein in jellyfish that helps scientists spot the onset of illnesses such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The prestigious 10 million Swedish crown ($1.4 million) prize recognized Osamu Shimomura of Japan and Americans Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien for their discovery of the protein GFP. "The remarkable brightly glowing green fluorescent protein, GFP, was first observed in the beautiful jellyfish, Aequorea victoria in 1962," the Nobel Committee for Chemistry at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement. "Since then, this protein has become one of the most important tools used in contemporary bioscience. With the aid of GFP, researchers have developed ways to watch processes that were previously invisible, such as the development of nerve cells in the brain or how cancer cells spread." Shimomura first isolated GFP from jellyfish drifting off the west coast of North America and discovered that the protein glowed bright green under ultraviolet light. For 20 years from 1967, he made a summer pilgrimage to Friday Harbor in Washington state to gather more than 3,000 jellyfish per day. Chalfie picked up on the discovery to demonstrate the value of GFP as a genetic tag for biological phenomena and Tsien extended the color palette beyond green, allowing scientists to follow several different biological processes at the same time. SCIENCE AND ART The strong green color of the jellyfish protein appears under blue and ultraviolet light, allowing researchers to illuminate cancer tumors, show the development of Alzheimer's disease in the brain or the growth of harmful bacteria. GFP has been used for art as well as for science. A green-glowing bunny named Alba was made in 2000 at the request of Chicago artist Eduardo Kac and green-glowing pigs have been gene engineered and bred to make green-glowing piglets. Tsien told a news conference over the phone from Californa that he had been woken up with news of the award. "I am very pleased and honored. I didn't expect it. There had been some rumors but from sources who were very questionable," he joked. As Nobel chemistry laureates, the three researchers join the ranks of some of the greatest names in science such as Marie Curie, who also won a physics Nobel, and Linus Pauling, the scientist and renowned peace activist who won the prize in 1954. All but one of the prizes were established in the will of 19th century dynamite tycoon Alfred Nobel and have been handed out since 1901. The economics award was established by Sweden's central bank in 1968. The chemistry prize was the third of this year's crop of Nobels with the awards for medicine and physics having been announced earlier this week. The laureate for literature will be unveiled Thursday, followed by the Nobel Peace Prize Friday and the economics award Monday
