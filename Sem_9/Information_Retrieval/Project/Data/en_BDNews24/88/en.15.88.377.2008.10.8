 LONDON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia striker Roman Pavlyuchenko will miss the next two World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland with an ankle injury that will keep him out of action for three weeks, his club Tottenham Hotspur said on Tuesday. Scans revealed he suffered a partially torn ankle ligament which forced him off during a 1-0 home defeat by Hull City in the Premier League on Sunday that left Spurs bottom. "Roman will now undergo further treatment on the ankle after specialists declared him unfit to play for the next three weeks," Tottenham said on their website (www.spurs.co.uk). Pavlyuchenko joined Spurs from Spartak Moscow for 17 million euros ($23.09 million) on transfer deadline day. Earlier on Tuesday, Russia coach Guus Hiddink called up forward Dmitry Sychev and his Lokomotiv Moscow team mate, central midfielder and squad newcomer Denis Glushakov, as cover for Saturday's Group Four match against Germany in Dortmund. Lokomotiv midfielder Dmitry Torbinsky is struggling with a groin problem while defender Denis Kolodin has been ruled out for the rest of the year with an ankle injury. Germany top the group with four points from two games with Russia in second place after beating Wales in their opener. The Russians are at home to Finland on Wednesday Oct. 15 in Moscow
