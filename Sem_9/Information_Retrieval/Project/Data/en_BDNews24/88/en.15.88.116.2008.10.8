<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition for anticipatory bail Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed filed to evade arrest in Barapukuria coalmine graft case, a lawyer said. Anticorruption Commission lawyer Khurshid Alam Khan, who opposed the bail petition, said Mojaheed's petition was "dismissed as being not pressed." Barrister Abdur Razzaq, the chief counsel for Mujaheed, a cabinet minister in former prime minister Khaleda Zia's administration, however said he did not press on with the bail appeal after making a brief submission. Mojaheed's lawyers were trying for a hearing with the vacation bench of justices Mohammad Anwarul Huq and Zubair Rahman Chowdhury. Razzaq told journalists that the hearing might be held any day either in the court or at the residence of the judges. He claimed that until the issue was settled, it would not be legally right to arrest Mojaheed. Earlier, court sources said, chamber judge Justice Zainul Abedin began hearing the petition but stopped halfway and instructed the defence to move a fresh bail petition to the High Court. The judge said Mojaheed was late with the petition and advised his lawyer to move the High Court or the trial court for redress, the sources added. Barrister Razzaq moved the chamber judge for hearing with a pending petition for a regular appeal against the High Court's refusal of bail on June 3. Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Md Azizul Haque ordered arrest of nine of the accused in the case on Monday, , a day after accepting the charge-sheet in the corruption case, including former finance minister M Saifur Rahman. The other seven facing arrest are former minister Aminul Haq, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former energy secretary Nazrul Islam, former chairman of Petrobangla SR Osmany, former director (mines and minerals) Moyeenul Ahsan, former managing director of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd Sirajul Islam, and chairman of Hosaf Group Moazzem Hossain, the local agent of the Chinese firm which was awarded the running of the coal mine. The High Court on Tuesday refused Saifur anticipatory bail in the case and ordered him to surrender in the lower court within four weeks, instead. Mojaheed flanked by partymen spoke to reporters on the court premises. "This allegation is purposeful and conspiratorial. Some quarter wants to obstruct and foil the election. "The first investigation officer gave final report in the case. Not satisfied, the Anticorruption Commission launched a re-investigation. They made a chargesheet as ordered. There is a deep conspiracy behind it." "It seems the way the chief election commissioner speaks makes him an opponent of the political parties. Political parties are as if his staffers. "There have been question marks over the role of the chief election commissioner for quite sometime. He has to change his conduct. Let the Election Commission hold the election minus the four-party alliance. The desire to keep the four-party alliance outside will not succeed." The ACC pressed charges against 16 people with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka on Sunday. The case was filed with Shahbagh Police Station on Feb. 26 this year citing irregularities and corruption in awarding the production, management and maintenance work of Barapukuria coalmine to a Chinese firm. The agreement with Chinese firm Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) caused losses of Tk 158.71 crore to the state, the case alleges. bdnews24
