 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) In an obvious reference to Awami League, the Jamaat-e-Islami chief, Matiur Rahman Nizami, has accused "certain quarters" of trying to disrupt the Dec 18 general elections. "This conspiracy has to be foiled," Nizami said Saturday at a programme organised by the party's student outfit, Islami Chhatra Shibir. "Those who killed people on the streets using oars and poles, and kept people hostage in the name of political protests, brought this government to power. "That party has to take responsibility for the sufferings in the past one and a half years," Nizami said. He said people would respond through the ballot to such conspiracies. "They also tried to disintegrate the four-party alliance, but failed." Nizami claimed the process of development started by the BNP-led alliance government came to a halt because of the failure to hold the Jan 22 polls. "As a result, the country has fallen behind 20 years in lost opportunities. That party and this government must be held responsible for the loss. "It has been proved in the past 18 months that there is no alternative to a democratic government," Nizami said. bdnews
