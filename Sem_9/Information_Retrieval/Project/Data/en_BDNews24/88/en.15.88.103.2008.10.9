 Dhaka, Oct 09 (bdnews24.com)One of Myanmar's top military rulers Thursday left Bangladesh ending a high-profile state visit that produced deal to boost trade but failed to reach agreement on sharing energy resource or leasing farmland. Vice Senior General Maung Aye, the second-in-command of the former Burma's highest ruling body State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), was seen off at the Chittagong airport by army chief General Moeen U Ahmed. The vice senior general, along with his 54-member entourage, flew to Chittagong Hill Tracts to visit Rangamati in the morning. In Dhaka, the general had been seen off at the Tejgaon helipad by foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, who said "political relations" needed to be improved first between the two neighbours, in a clear reference to failure to close farmland or gas pipeline deal. Seven ministers and the chiefs of Myanmar's navy and air force and a number of SPDC members accompanied General Aye during his three-day visit. They left for Myanmar's capital Naypydaw on an Air Bagan flight. Speaking to bdnews24.com, the foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Bangladesh wanted to "strengthen political relations with Myanmar first and that strong political relation would fetch benefits for the country". "General Maung Aye's visit might not yield immediate result, but it would bring benefit both the countries if they could continue dialogues," he said. "Once political relationship at the central level is strengthened, cooperation usually follows on a whole range of subjects of bilateral interest. "This is what is happening in the case of Myanmar," the foreign adviser told bdnews24.com. "In such cases results may not follow immediately. We will have to continue to work towards our goals and keep the mutual dialogue going," he said. During General Aye's visit, Bangladesh and Myanmar ministers discussed possible cooperation in a number of areas including trade and energy sector. Myanmar energy minister Lun Thi turned down Dhaka's proposal for installing a pipeline to import gas from his country. The two countries also could not reach agreement on leasing of Myanmar land for farming by the Bangladeshi entrepreneurs. However, the two neighbours signed a deal on avoidance of double taxation with the aim of taking the annual bilateral trade volume to US $500 million from the present US $140 million. Myanmar agreed to export at least one lakh tonnes of rice annually to Bangladesh on a regular basis. b
