<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan were forced to leave Mohammad Yousuf out of their squad for this week's four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Toronto after the batsman was refused a visa on Tuesday. Sources confirmed to Reuters that Canadian high commission officials refused to give visas to three players including senior batsman Yousuf who was in the original 20-man party named in September. Pakistan's cricket board announced the 15-man squad just 24 hours before their departure for the Oct. 10-14 tournament. Pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar was recalled after being told last month he could play international and domestic cricket until a High Court decision was made on a seven million rupees ($89,050) fine imposed on the player by the national board. The PCB earlier said Akhtar, who last represented his country in India last December, could not play for Pakistan or in Pakistan until he had cleared the fine imposed on him for disciplinary violations. The selectors included two uncapped players -- pacer Anwar Ali and batsman Shoaib Khan -- in the squad for the tournament that also features Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Canada. Squad: Shoaib Malik (captain), Misbah-ul-Haq, Salman Butt, Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul, Fawad Alam, Sohail Khan, Khalid Latif, Abdur Rauf, Shoaib Khan, Anwar Ali
