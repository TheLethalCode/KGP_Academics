 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  An official enquiry into the death of film actor SM Aslam Talukder, popularly known as Manna, has been pushed back to Oct 30. Metropolitan magistrate Saifur Rahman Siddique had earlier set Sept 29 to start the probe after Manna's brother-in-law Reza Quader sued six doctors and officials of United Hospital in Gulshan over the death. The plaintiff's lawyer Barrister Khondaker Musfiqul Huda told bdnews24.com that the court could not begin the enquiry on Sept 29 because it was busy. Reza Kader in the case filed on Sept 17 alleged that Manna died because of negligence by doctors at United Hospital. According to the case details, Manna was admitted to the hospital at 4am on Feb 17 with chest pains, but doctors did not arrive came until 9am, by which time the actor had suffered an acute heart attack. Manna died later that day. A few weeks after his death, Manna's wife Sheli Quader blamed the United Hospital for her husband's death, but hospital authorities rejected the charges of negligence of duty in medical treatment. The late actor's wife also wrote to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on March 5 with an appeal to "punish those responsible". Dr Md Enayet Hossain Shaikh, Dr Zahiruddin Mahmud Iliyas, Dr Momenuzzaman, Dr Fatema, Dr Shainul Islam Majumdar and the members of the board of directors of the United Hospital are accused in the case filed by Sheli's brother Reza Quader. bdnews24.
