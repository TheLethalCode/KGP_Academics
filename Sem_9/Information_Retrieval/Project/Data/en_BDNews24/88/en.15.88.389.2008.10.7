 Chittagong, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Detained Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury may be released from detention anytime on Wednesday as the copy of the bail order has been sent to Dhaka Central Jail, his lawyer said on Tuesday. "As a result there is no obstacle to Mohiuddin Chowdhury's release," advocate Ibrahim Hossain Chowdhury Babul told bdnews24.com. He said the mayor had secured bail in the other cases, which meant there were no more hurdles to his release. The copy from Chittagong divisional special judge's court reached Chittagong jail at around 2:30pm on Tuesday. Later the jail authorities sent it to Dhaka Central Jail at about 4pm. Senior jail superintendent of Chittagong Central Jail Ataur Rahman confirmed that as per rules the copy of bail order was sent to Dhaka by a messenger. The bail order in Bijoy TV corruption case was submitted to Chittagong divisional special judge's court Tuesday noon. Judge SM Solaiman granted the mayor bail on a Tk 80,000 bond and ordered authorities to send it to Chittagong jail. Advocate Babul said as the Bijoy TV case is on trial at Chittagong divisional special judge's court the copy of the bail order was submitted in Chittagong. He said Mohiuddin is under treatment at the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Though the High court granted him bail on Sept. 30 the process of his release had been delayed. Mohiuddin's another lawyer Harishadhan Deb Brahman who is in Dhaka told bdnews24.com once the copy of the bail order reaches Dhaka from Chittagong he is likely to get released on Wednesday morning or noon. The mayor, also an Awami League leader, was arrested on March 7, 2007. He fell seriously ill while in detention in Bandarban jail. He was taken to Chittagong Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. He is now undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit of BSMMU Hospital. bdnews24
