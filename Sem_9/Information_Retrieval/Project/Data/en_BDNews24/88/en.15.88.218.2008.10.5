<TITLE> BSTI to test Cadbury imports </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution has collected samples of Cadbury's chocolate bars imported from five countries to test for the contaminant melamine, in the continued fallout from the Chinese milk-scare. The BSTI director general Md Ajmal Hossain said Sunday: "We collected samples of Cadbury's chocolate imported from India, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Australia and the United Kingdom to test their ingredients for 'melamine'." "The samples were sent to a private laboratory Plasma Plus for testing on Saturday." Replying to a query, the BSTI boss said: "Imported chocolates are not usually laboratory tested. We plan to take necessary steps in this regard in future." He added that it might take a few days to yield results, as such tests are being conducted "for the first time" in the country. Asked why BSTI didn't carry out the tests in their own laboratory, Hossain said: "Because this private laboratory has already successfully ascertained the presence of 'melamine' in one brand of (banned) milk powder recently." The health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali Thursday advised people not to consume Cadbury's products for the time being. British-based Cadbury Plc said last week it was withdrawing all of its 11 chocolate products made in Beijing on concern over the possibility of contamination with melamine in its Chinese plant. The confectionery group is the latest company to get caught up in the tainted-milk scandal, as a growing list of Chinese milk and milk-related products have been taken off shelves around the world in recent weeks. Melamine was first found in powdered infant formula in China, where four babies died and nearly 53,000 were sickened. It has since been traced to dozens of other products. Melamine is a relatively cheap industrial chemical, commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Over here, the government banned three brands of Chinese milk powder in the wake of the milk scare, though at least two Bangladeshi firms have since been found marketing the products without BSTI approval and mobile courts have seized tins in open markets over recent days. The government said Chinese authorities had earlier informed Bangladesh of the possible existence of melamine in the products of two companies Sun Care and Yashli, who manufacture 'Sweet Baby' and 'Yashli-1' and 'Yashli-2' milk powders. Melamine content has been detected in the banned milk formula Yashli -1, by the private laboratory Plasma Plus, the BSTI head told bdnews24.com last week. bdnews24.c
