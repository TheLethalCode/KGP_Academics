<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Mon Oct 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will hand over a letter later on Monday to European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana regarding the dispute over the country's nuclear program, a senior Iranian official told Reuters. "The two-page letter reflects Iran's view over the handling of the nuclear case by the six powers. It will be handed over to Solana in Brussels in a few hours," Ahmad Khademolmelleh, a spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said. He was referring to the major powers which have called on the Islamic Republic to halt sensitive nuclear work the West fears is aimed at making bombs. Tehran denies the charge. Khademolmelleh said the letter from Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili was addressed to the foreign ministers of the six powers, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The letter will also be delivered to the Swiss embassy in Tehran, he said. Switzerland represents US interests in the country since Washington severed ties with Iran shortly after its 1979 Islamic revolution
