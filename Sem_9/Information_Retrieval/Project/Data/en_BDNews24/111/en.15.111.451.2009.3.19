 RAMALLAH, West Bank,Thu Mar 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops detained 10 Hamas politicians from the occupied West Bank on Thursday in what the Islamist faction called a punitive round-up following Israel's failure to retrieve a captive soldier. Egyptian efforts to mediate the release of Gilad Shalit, held incommunicado by Hamas in the Gaza Strip since June 2006, collapsed this week when the Israelis ruled out its demand of amnesty for scores of jailed Palestinians militant chiefs. The impasse prompted a pledge by Israel to press the crippling Gaza blockade, as well as threats to toughen up conditions for some of the 11,000 Palestinians in its prisons. Thursday's detainees included 4 lawmakers from Hamas, which won a Palestinian election in early 2006 but was shunned by the West for rejecting peace with the Jewish state. Mahmoud Abbas, the US-backed Palestinian president, dissolved a government alliance with Hamas when it seized control of Gaza in 2007.

"It shows the bankruptcy of the enemy. We call on the resistance factions to stick to their conditions in any prisoner exchange that will be discussed." An Israeli military spokesman said that he had "no indication" that the detentions were connected to Shalit. "These men have been the leaders of the ongoing effort to restore the administrative branch of the Hamas terror organization in the region, while attempting to strengthen the power and influence of Hamas," the spokesman said. Abbas's secular Fatah faction holds sway in the West Bank, which is the focus of international efforts to bolster the Palestinian economy and security services as a prelude to any statehood talks. Fatah forces have also been rounding up Hamas members in the West Bank, a sticking point in Egyptian-brokered negotiations over a possible new Palestinian inter-factional unity agreement. In the weeks after Shalit's capture, Israel detained dozens of Hamas West Bank politicians, many of whom remain in custody. At the time, Palestinians accused Israel of gathering "bargaining chips" ahead of a future exchange for Shalit. Of those detainees eventually released, at least three were among the men seized on Thursday, Hamas lawmaker Mahmoud Musleh said. "These arrests are an angry reaction by Israel because of the failure of the Shalit deal," he told Reuters. "This won't do Israel any g
