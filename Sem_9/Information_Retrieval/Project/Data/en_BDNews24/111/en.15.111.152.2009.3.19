 WASHINGTON Wed Mar 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Obama administration Wednesday chose a new top commander for NATO, Navy Admiral James Stavridis, as the alliance prepares to step up its fight against rising insurgent violence in the Afghan war. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced the choice in a set of decisions about who will fill several key US military posts for the first years of Barack Obama's presidency. Stavridis is now head of US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America. Previously he was the senior military assistant to Donald Rumsfeld when Rumsfeld was Pentagon chief. "Admiral Stavridis has done a spectacular job at SOUTHCOM in strengthening our military-to-military relationships throughout Latin America," Gates said. "I think it's a challenging job, and I think he has done it extraordinarily well." The Pentagon chief selected Admiral Robert Willard, head of the US Pacific Fleet, to run the headquarters for US military operations for Asia and the Pacific. He would replace Admiral Timothy Keating as head of US Pacific Command. Gates also recommended second two-year terms for Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Marine Corps General James Cartwright, the vice chairman. Both finish their first terms later this year. Stavridis would be the first naval officer to hold the prestigious post of Supreme Allied Commander Europe. He would replace US Army General John Craddock, who has been at NATO since December 2006 and is expected to retire. Stavridis' place at Southern Command would be taken by Air Force Lieutenant General Douglas Fraser, the current deputy head of Pacific Command, Gates said. WORKING WITH CIVILIAN AGENCIES Putting a Navy officer in the NATO job in the middle of a ground war may not seem a natural choice but US defense officials stress that top officers are trained to command all elements of the military. At Southern Command, Stavridis has integrated military operations with the work of civilian agencies -- an approach US and NATO officials say is essential in Afghanistan to win over local people in the battle against insurgents. The Obama administration is reviewing its Afghan war strategy in the face of rising violence by the Taliban and other insurgents. The review is due to be completed before a NATO summit on April 3-4. About 70,000 foreign troops, including 38,000 Americans, are trying to stabilize Afghanistan. Most of them are members of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, commanded by US Army General David McKiernan. Obama last month approved the deployment of 17,000 extra US troops to Afghanistan and could send more -- as McKiernan has requested -- after the review is complete. Stavridis has no previous experience in Afghanistan but he is regarded as intellectual, ambitious and energetic. He holds a doctorate in international relations. Brookings Institution military analyst Michael O'Hanlon said Stavridis was an intellectually gifted team player but questions had to be asked about the extent of his knowledge of counter-insurgency and stabilization operations. "A case can be made that someone more schooled in those domains, as well as Afghanistan itself, might have been preferable," O'Hanlon said via e-mail. "But it is hard to get everything in one person, and on balance Stavridis would appear a good choice." Top US military officers are nominated by the US president and require US Senate confirmation. The supreme commander's appointment also must be approved by NATO's North Atlantic Council of alliance mem
