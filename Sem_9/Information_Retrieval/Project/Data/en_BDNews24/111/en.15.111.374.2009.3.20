<TITLE> Timing of Sircar probe 'intentional': Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  The parliamentary probe into allegations of corruption against former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar has been purposely timed to influence by-election results, said BNP secretary general Delwar Hossain on Friday. The investigation against Sircar, who is BNP candidate in the upcoming Bogra-6 by-election, is "intentional and illogical", said Delwar. "The suddenness of the decision indicates that the government has intention behind forming the probe committee, to influence the vote," Delwar told reporters. "The committee could have been formed after the election." By-elections to seven constituencies, vacated by MPs who won more than one seat in the Dec 29 general elections, will be held on Apr. 2. Responding to demands from members of parliament, speaker Abdul Hamid formed an 11-member all-party parliamentary probe body on Thursday, headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Miah, to investigate charges of corruption against Sircar. Hamid said the committee would also investigate whether he himself, as speaker of the seventh parliament, resorted to any corrupt practices. This is first ever move of parliament to investigate such allegations against any speaker. Hamid also said he had requested the comptroller and auditor general to audit the finances of all parliaments since independence. Delwar said Friday that BNP had demanded probes into the activities of all speakers since 1972. "But the speaker said they will only be audited." Forming a probe committee for one speaker and audits for the others on the same issue is "discriminatory", he said. "If there should be any investigation, then all the speakers should come under the purview of the probe." BNP reform A decision on rebuilding BNP, in the wake of catastrophic defeat in the national polls, will be taken after receiving the grassroots levels reports from the party's joint secretaries general who are heading six divisional committees, said Delwar. So far, the Chittagong committee, headed by Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, has submitted its report to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. The party interviewed grassroots leaders from Feb. 3 to 28, to gather information on how the party could be rebuilt, said Delwar. The reports will be based on those interviews. bdnews2
