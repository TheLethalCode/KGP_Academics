 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)The national inquiry committee looking into the BDR massacre has asked for another week to submit its findings, its member secretary said on Monday. "We have submitted an application to the appropriate authority requesting another week's time to complete the probe report," additional home secretary Golam Hossain told bdnews24.com. "We're supposed to submit the report Monday," he said. Another home ministry official, speaking anonymously, said, "Monday being the submission deadline, the application was submitted in the morning." A re-constituted committee was formed on Mar 2 and began work the following day. Another week's time was granted on March 9, the first deadline for submission of its report. Earlier on Feb 26, the government had formed an inquiry committee headed by the home minister, but later reformed the committee to be headed by retired civil servant M Anisuzzaman amid calls for removal of ministers. The state minister for law was also dropped. bdnews
