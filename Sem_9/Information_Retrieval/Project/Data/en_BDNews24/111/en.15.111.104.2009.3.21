 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Relatives and neighbours of Shah Imran, whose death at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before sparked overnight disturbances at Bangladesh's biggest public hospital, had blocked the main Rampura TV Road Saturday morning in protest against the death and arrest of his wife. They eventually lifted their roadblock at around noon, said Rampura police. Shahbagh police in the early hours had arrested the wife and brother-in-law of the deceased as protests broke out and angry internees stopped treating emergency patients late Friday night and threatened to go on strike saying they had been assaulted by Imran's family. Shahbagh police officer-in-charge Reazul Karim said the wife, Sanjana Latif Tropa, 29, who had lost her 30 year-old husband just hours earlier, was taken into police custody after midnight along with a brother in law, Ehsanul Latif Rupam, 25. Sanjana, who was detained with a seven-month old baby, Oritro, in her arms, was released later Saturday. "She was released around midday (Saturday), pending her appearance in court, on account of the baby," Karim told bdnews24.com. As he died of his injuries Friday afternoon after being hit by a falling roof of a shopping centre, Imran's family blamed the attending doctors for failing to respond quickly and save his life. As demanded by the junior doctors, the DMCH director, Brig Gen Abdus Shahid Khan himself, filed a case against the dead patient's family in the early hours of Saturday. He said in his statement to police that intern Tania Sharmin had been assaulted by them. Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq, accompanied by the director general of health Shah Monir Hossain, went to the spot at 9.30am to speak with the young doctors, who were threatening to stop work. The trainee doctors called off an 'indefinite strike' and the emergency ward was reopened after the talks. As the doctors relented, emergency patients began being treated again from 10.30am, said the hospital director
