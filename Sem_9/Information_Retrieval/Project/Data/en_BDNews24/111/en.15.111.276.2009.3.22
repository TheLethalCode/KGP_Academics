 Dhaka Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Former finance ministry chiefs have recommended the government offer low interest five-year bonds to let tax-dodgers "whiten" their money, the finance minister says. "I had already announced that we'd consider allowing the black money (undeclared income) to be whitened. Former finance minister and advisers have suggested using low interest five-year bonds to do that," A M A Muhith told reporters Saturday after a meeting with them. "The proposal is interesting," he said. "Since (overseas) aid has declined, but the government spending is up, they have suggested to go all-out to raise revenue income." The minister said he had asked the finance secretary, the NBR chairman and the central bank governor "to take note of their points" and that "these suggestions will help us formulate our budget". The meeting at state guest house Padma was attended by former minister M Syeduzzaman, and former caretaker advisers Akbar Ali Khan and A B Mirza Azizul Islam. Former minister BNP's M Saifur Rahman was also invited but could not make it "due to illness". Several former finance secretaries were also present.
