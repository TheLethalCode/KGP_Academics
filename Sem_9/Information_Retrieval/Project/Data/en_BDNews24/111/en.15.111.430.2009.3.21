 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Police Saturday released the wife of Shah Imran, whose death at Dhaka Medical College Hospital the day before sparked overnight disturbances at Bangladesh's biggest public hospital, causing internees to close the emergency ward and threaten to go on strike. Police in the early hours had arrested the wife and brother-in-law of the deceased as protests broke out and angry internees stopped treating emergency patients late Friday night saying they had been assaulted by Imran's family. Shahabagh police officer-in-charge Reazul Karim said the wife, Sanjana Latif Tropa, 29, who had lost her 30 year-old husband just hours earlier, was taken into police custody after midnight along with a brother in law, Ehsanul Latif Rupam, 25. Sanjana had a seven-month old baby, Oritro, in her arms. "She was released around midday (Saturday), pending her appearance in court, on account of the baby," Karim told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, relatives and neighbours of Imran and Sanjana, residents of Malibagh in Dhaka, had blocked the main road of Rampura for an hour in protest against the arrests. They eventually lifted their roadblock at around noon, said Rampura police. As he died of his injuries Friday afternoon after being hit by a falling roof of a shopping centre, Imran's family blamed the attending doctors for failing to respond quickly and save his life. As demanded by the junior doctors, the DMCH director, Brig Gen Abdus Shahid Khan himself, filed a case against the dead patient's family in the early hours of Saturday. He said in his statement to police that intern Tania Sharmin had been assaulted by them. Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq, accompanied by the director general of health Shah Monir Hossain, went to the spot at 9.30am to speak with the young doctors, who were threatening to stop work. The trainee doctors called off an 'indefinite strike' and the emergency ward was reopened after the talks. As the doctors relented, emergency patients began being treated again from 10.30am, said the hospital director
