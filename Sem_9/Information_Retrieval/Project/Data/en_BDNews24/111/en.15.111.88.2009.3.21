 Gopalganj, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  The probe into the BDR mutiny will not be hurried, nor will it be unduly delayed, said the minister in charge of coordinating post-mutiny activities on Saturday. "Justice will be denied if the trial is delayed; on the other hand, some of the guilty may get away if the investigation is hurried," said Faruq Khan. "[So] the trial process will be started as soon as possible without hurrying the investigation," he said at a gathering in Kashiani, Gopalganj. Faruq said investigators have been working using modern tools with the cooperation of the visiting FBI team. Significant information is coming from interrogation of arrestees. "The report of the government probe will be made public, disclosing if any quarters financed the massacre." Faruq said, "The incident was not a 'mutiny', it was a planned massacre to harm nation." bdnews24.
