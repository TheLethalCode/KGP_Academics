 BATI KOT, Afghanistan, Thu Mar 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign and Afghan troops killed two militants in a raid against al Qaeda bomb-makers on Thursday, the US military said, but angry protesters said the dead were civilians. Civilian casualties are the greatest source of tension between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Western governments and have undermined public support for the presence of more than 70,000 foreign troops fighting a growing Taliban-led insurgency.

Separately, NATO-led and Afghan forces detained a suspected insurgent leader and 17 others during a raid in Logar province, south of Kabul, on Thursday, the alliance said in a statement. Violence in Afghanistan is at its highest level since the Taliban was ousted by US-led forces in 2001, with attacks spreading from the south and east to the outskirts of Kabul. More than 2,100 civilians were killed in Afghanistan last year, 40 percent more than in 2007, the United Nations said. Around a quarter were killed by international forces, it said.
