<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government will take a final decision on the trial process of the BDR mutiny case only after reports of ongoing investigations are in, the law minister has repeated. "There is no decision so far to hold the trial under the Army Act," Shafiq Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Friday after a number of newspapers, quoting the law minister, reported that his ministry had given the go ahead to try the BDR accused by "court martial". Calling those reports "misleading", the minister said, "The law ministry did not give any such decision to the home ministry; we have only suggested the possible procedures of the trial." He said, "The government could issue an order to try the accused under military law". "But the government is yet to take a decision." Rights group urges open trial Meanwhile, a US-based rights group has urged the Bangladesh government to try the accused in the country's regular courts or by special tribunal, rather than military court. The border force, Bangladesh Rifles, is under the charge of the home ministry not the defence ministry, said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, in Dhaka on Thursday. The trial process should rightly go through the normal judicial system under civilian law, not military law, he told a briefing at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. If necessary, the case could be tried by a special tribunal, with an assurance of protecting all rights of the accused, said Adams. He also asked the government to ensure an independent investigation into the BDR mutiny. bdnews24.c
