 SYDNEY, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England beat New Zealand by four wickets on Sunday to win the women's ICC World Cup for the third time. England bowled out New Zealand for 166 in the 48th over before reaching their victory target with 23 balls to spare at North Sydney Oval. All-rounder Nicky Shaw, a last-minute replacement for Jenny Gunn, who aggravated a leg injury in the warm-up, was named player of the match after starring with both and ball. Shaw captured four wickets in New Zealand's innings, then made an unbeaten 17 to guide England to victory after they lost 5-40 in a middle-order batting collapse. England had previously won the women's World Cup in 1973 and 1993, both on home soil. "It's an amazing feeling to be world champions," England captain Charlotte Edwards told reporters. "We told the girls they had to take their opportunities and Nicky has done that today with four wickets and seeing us home. "This is a special moment and we'll remember this for the rest of our lives.
