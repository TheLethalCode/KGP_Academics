<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)--A proposed change in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) will give the government the right to empower executive magistrates to deal with crimes. The standing committee on law ministry has recommended amendment to the proposed CrPC bill--linked to the independence of the judiciary--creating scope for the executive authority to use such powers. The previously proposed amendment had curbed such powers of the executive. The standing committee report was placed in the House by its chief Suranjit Sengupta towards the end of Thursday's session. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2009 was first tabled at the parliament session on Feb 2. The committee held at least four meetings to discuss the bill and also heard from representatives of administrative, police and judicial services. Sengupta told the House his committee sought to balance between the powers of the executive and the judiciary. "There are certain realities and limitations which prevented us from giving direct magisterial powers to the executive." The Awami League presidium member referred to a 1956 speech by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "The Father of the Nation said in a statement to the National Assembly, 'The judiciary must be made independent of the executive if you want to dispense justice to the people'." bdn
