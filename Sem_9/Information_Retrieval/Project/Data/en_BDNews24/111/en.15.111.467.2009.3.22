"I had a good discussion with him (Moeen U Ahmed) and he responded positive in all matters I placed," Salahuddin told reporters at his office. The BFF boss said that he had sought to allot such portion which could accommodate 100 persons including players, coaches and office staffs. Salahuddin also said that the NSC chairman also promised to increase facilities at the Bangabandhu National Stadium and improve the pitch at Kamalapur Stadium. The legendary footballer also requested the NSC chairman to allot the pitches at the district level to the District Football Association for a specific time in a season so that the DFAs could run domestic football smoothly. bd
