 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh, India and Nepal have agreed on construction of a special reservoir to ensure year-round flow of rivers in the region, the water resources minister said Wednesday. "The reservoir, to be built in Nepal, would bring life to the rivers of Bangladesh and India in the dry season," Ramesh Chandra Sen told German radio channel Deutsche Welle in an interview. Pointing out that Nepal had already agreed to construction of the reservoir for use by India and Bangladesh, he said they had been awaiting India's response. "The Indian high commissioner has now responded positively," he said. The details would be discussed at the next meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission, said Sen. He said the JRC meeting would also decide on extending the period of the Ganges water-sharing agreement between Bangladesh and India. India and Nepal were already forging ahead to set up two reservoirs in Pancheshwar and Saptakoshi, Deutsche Welle said, quoting the ministry of water resources in Bangladesh. Dhaka had also proposed construction of water reservoirs in Nepal --- Pancheshwar and Saptakoshi, Kornali, Kaligandhaki-one, Kaligandhaki-two, Shweti and Trishur Ganga, to preserve the navigability of the rivers in Bangladesh. According to the Bangladesh proposal, the country would get another 45 thousand cusecs of water, above the present flow from Farakka Point in the dry season, from the seven reservoirs. Bangladesh and Nepal formed a survey team in as long ago as 1988 to prevent flood prevalence and ensure multi-use of water resources. The team submitted a report with recommendations the following year. It said a reservoir project was indispensable to ensure diversification of water in the region and its maximum use. Such a project was expected to reduce the depth, severity and duration of floods and increase Ganges flow during the dry season. bd
