<TITLE> Britain exits Iraq, confronts Afghanistan's troubles </TITLE>

 LONDON, Thu Mar 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In March 2003, 45,000 British troops joined the US military in invading Iraq to great fanfare, bristling with strength and influence. Six years on, Britain has barely 2,000 soldiers left in the country and all of them will be out by June. Instead of fanfare, they will leave quietly, a force that even the nation's military commanders have said is battered, bruised and exhausted. While Iraq may be more stable than it was only a year ago, the conflict has been debilitating for Britain -- militarily, politically and financially -- and is shaping how much it can project itself in its new focus of operations: Afghanistan. "It's fair to say that Iraq hasn't been a popular deployment and at this stage, the politicians just want to slip quietly away," said Nigel Adderley, a defence expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. "When it comes to Afghanistan though, it's no good going on the way we've been going on. It's not the military's fault, it's just that they don't have the resources to do what's needed. They are chronically under-resourced." When Britain draws the curtain on Iraq, with a death toll of 179, military commanders are hoping there will be a pause to allow the army, navy and air force to recuperate. Six years of intense combat and rolling deployments have taken a toll on equipment, personnel and their families, with Air Chief Marshall Jock Stirrup, the head of the defence forces, describing the situation as one of huge "overstretch". "We're currently doing more than we're structured or resourced for over the long term," Stirrup said late last year as he assessed the state of the military. "We cannot simply make a one-for-one transfer from Iraq to Afghanistan. I'm not saying that we couldn't or shouldn't do more in Afghanistan if we judge that to be necessary. What I am saying is that we have to be able to sustain whatever we do." That may be the case, but the pressing nature of the war there, with U.S. President Barack Obama making it a policy focus and ramping up troop numbers, means Britain, as a key ally and a major player in NATO, is expected to play a large part. Having stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, playing a big role in the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in their heartland is arguably more important, and has more popular backing, than the war in Iraq. "TOO FEW AND TOO EXPOSED" Britain already has 8,100 troops in Afghanistan, the majority in Helmand, a vast desert province in the south of the country that remains a stronghold of the Taliban. Based there since 2006, the troops have struggled to contain the Taliban, in large part because the territory they have to hold is so great and unforgiving. A lack of air assets restricts their movement, preventing rapid response to threats and forcing troops to move by deadly roads. The death toll in Afghanistan -- 152, including 16 this year -- is now approaching Iraq's. There are demands for more money -- the cost of the Afghanistan conflict is set to rise by 54 percent to 2.3 billion pounds ($3.5 bln) in 2008/09 -- and more air support, but the strain on resources makes that unlikely in the short term. There is also, commanders on the ground acknowledge, a need for substantially more troops, but the impact of "overstretch" makes that very unlikely to happen, with at best around 1,500 more soldiers expected to be sent there in the next six months. "In Afghanistan, one has the sense of too few troops who are too exposed and who are not part of a viable strategic plan," said Rosemary Hollis, a visiting professor of international politics at City University in London. "One wonders, did the political leadership commit them on the right assumptions? The troops do the best they can in the circumstances, but when it comes to Afghanistan, one wonders if the politicians have learnt the lessons from Iraq." Britain's Defence Secretary John Hutton has made his commitment to Afghanistan clear, and senior military commanders have said Britain could be engaged there for decades. But when it comes to confronting the immediate demands of the war, for more troops and resources now, the country may struggle. "In many respects Iraq was a massive miscalculation, in part because it not only revealed Britain's limitations, but increased them," said Ho
