<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  The probe into the devastating blaze at Basundhara City failed to find the initial cause of the fire that claimed seven lives and gutted the top six floors of the 20-story commercial complex on Mar 13. "The probe committee could not find the reason of the fire as we lack equipment to investigate such incidents," state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed said Monday. The committee submitted a report to the home minister Monday, recommending another committee try to find the reasons, he said. "The committee tried to reveal facts behind the fire  whether it was accident or sabotage. But the specialists said no fire could spark at the building from electric short-circuit." Asked if the Bashundhara authorities themselves set the fire, the state minister said nothing was possible to say without investigation. He said the probe, led by joint home secretary Iqbal Khan, found that the fire service was called more than an hour after the fire broke out on the 18th floor. The report also said security guards were "withdrawn" before the fire broke out. Questions have surfaced as to why the Bashundhara authorities did not cooperate with the probe committee, provide footages of CCTV cameras and use modern fire extinguishing machines, the state minister said quoting the report. The committee has put a further 19-point charter of recommendations to prevent a repeat of fire at high-rises. These include taking approval of fire service and following building code before any high-rise building is allowed; keeping internal fire extinguishing measures ready; ensuring water supply; widening narrow roads in old part of Dhaka and holding regular fire drills. bdnew
