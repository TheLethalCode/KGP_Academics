<TEXT>
 Jamalpur, March 21 (bdnews24.com)  Reconstitution of BDR, to safeguard the reputation of honest and innocent riflemen, would be the 'biggest challenge', director general of the border force Brig Gen Moinul Islam said on Saturday. No innocent border guards will face harassment or become victims of the mutiny investigations, the BDR chief reiterated. Speaking at an exchange of views at BDR's Jamalpur parade ground, he said action would be taken against those responsible for the Peelkhana carnage. "But we are also taking all precautions so that no innocent jawan is victimised. All border guards have been sent written statements in this regard." Gen Moinul said Bangladesh Rifles would be reconstituted with a new name to protect the reputation of the thousands of honest BDR soldiers who were not involved in the Feb 25-26 massacre. "The BDR has lost trust after the mutiny. The border force will have to rebuild that trust," he said. "This is our biggest challenge," he said. The BDR chief had earlier visited the Mymensingh sector headquarters. bdnews2
