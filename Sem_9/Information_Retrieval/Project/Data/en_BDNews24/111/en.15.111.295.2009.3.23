 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)The national inquiry committee into the BDR carnage got just four more days to submit its findings after seeking a week's extension on Monday, said a home ministry spokesman. Home ministry PRO Md Shahinoor Miah told bdnews24.com the government probe would get another four working days from Monday to hand in its report. The committee had earlier asked for an extra week, its member secretary said. The first deadline for its report, March 9, was already extended by seven working days. "We submitted an application to the appropriate authority requesting another week's time to complete the probe report," additional home secretary Golam Hossain told bdnews24.com Monday morning. "We were supposed to submit the report today," he said. Another home ministry official, speaking anonymously, said, "Today being the submission deadline, the application for more time was submitted in the morning." A re-constituted committee was formed on Mar 2 and began work the following day. Earlier on Feb 26, the government had formed an inquiry committee headed by the home minister, but later reformed the committee to be headed by retired civil servant M Anisuzzaman amid calls for removal of ministers. The state minister for law was also dropped. bdnews24.c
