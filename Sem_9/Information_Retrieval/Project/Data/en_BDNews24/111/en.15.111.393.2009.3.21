Kadomtali police officer in-charge Nur Hossain told bdnews24.com Luna United Company, which makes hospital gauges, caught fire as the six or seven factoryhands, all women, were working in candlelight since the power went off. Earlier at noon, the ground floor of Muktijoddha Market at Mirpur caught fire gutting seven or eight shops. The fire originated from an electrical short circuit, fire fighters said.
