<TITLE> South Africa pin hopes on new opening pair </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAPE TOWN, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa will pin much of their batting hopes on a new opening pair in the third and final test against Australia which starts on Thursday. Imraan Khan has been brought in for his debut and opens with the recalled Ashwell Prince, who normally operates in the middle-order. They come in for captain Graeme Smith (broken finger) and Neil McKenzie (dropped) and South Africa, 2-0 down in the series, want the two left-handers to nullify Mitchell Johnson after the Australia paceman shone in Johannesburg and Durban. "It will be interesting to see how Johnson goes against two left-handers at the top of the order," coach Mickey Arthur told reporters on Tuesday. "It might force him to change his tactics. He's pulled the rug out from under our feet a couple of times and we haven't been able to make a proper first-innings score and that has put us under pressure." Khan, 24, made a century at the weekend and also hit 100 against Australia in a tour match at Potchefstroom last month. Arthur believes Imraan and Prince will be up to the task of facing dangerous left-armer Johnson. "They are both quality players," said the coach. "Imraan has done fantastically well domestically. "He's had a phenomenal season and Ashwell knows exactly what we strive for, he's very excited to be back." Prince was initially named as captain in the absence of Smith but a day later Cricket South Africa announced Jacques Kallis would lead the team in Cape Town. Arthur said there were no serious disagreements among the selectors. GREY AREAS "There are a couple of grey areas that needed to be ironed out but no major issues," he said. South Africa have also dropped all-rounder Morne Morkel but Arthur is confident the team can end the series on a high. "We're all realistic enough to know you can't be perfect in every game," said the coach. "But we are a very settled and stable unit, the players all know their roles and I have no doubt they will step up in this test." Arthur's team captured the three-match series 2-1 in Australia in December and January but Ricky Ponting's side have now won the last three tests against South Africa. "I see it as a blip," said Arthur. "It is a good reality check to experience defeat and the team will push on and work harder. "Cool heads are what is needed when you've lost a series and it's something we haven't experienced in the last 10 series. But the players don't become bad players overnight.
