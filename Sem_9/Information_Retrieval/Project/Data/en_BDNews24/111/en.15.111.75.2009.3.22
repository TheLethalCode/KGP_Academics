<TITLE> BNP won't sit on Sircar probe panel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)BNP decided Sunday not to remain on the committee formed to probe irregularities of former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, an official said. The main opposition party called the detention order of former deputy speaker Akhtar Hamid Siddiqui 'unnatural' and demanded the order be revoked. "BNP thinks after harassing the opposition leaders and workers, the so-called investigation committee is being formed, and arrests and detentions are being made," joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told a press briefing at the office of the party chairperson in Gulshan. Jainal Abdin Farrouque, the opposition chief whip, criticised the enquiry committee headed by the ruling party MP on the former speaker, Khan added. "Such a committee will not do fair investigation. We have decided to stay away from such committee. It appears to me that formation of a committee with those who are complainants is a peculiar one." From the list of members of the committee, it appears that it is nothing but a farce in the name of investigation, Khan added. "It has been done to influence the by-election [Sircar] is contesting." He said arresting a person like him without any investigation and on the allegations of the police was unnatural and condemnable. The former deputy speaker said he had not threatened anybody whereas the police version, not Siddiqui's version, became important to a democratic government. "It is a bad precedent." The BNP thinks through such arrests the government has chosen to harass and insult BNP leaders and workers. "Such activities of the government will not be acceptable to people." He also resented the wholesale transfers of 120 staff of the Islamic Foundation and asked the government to stop "harassments of opposition leaders and workers and stop filing false cases". He criticised the ruling Awami League for not taking into consideration the demand for investigation into the activities of all the speakers since independence. b
