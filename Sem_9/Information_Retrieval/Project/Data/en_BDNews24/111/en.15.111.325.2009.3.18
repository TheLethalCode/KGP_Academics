 BOGOTA, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombia's FARC guerrillas freed their last foreign hostage, an ailing Swedish national they kidnapped nearly two years ago in an extortion attempt, Colombian authorities said on Tuesday. The captive, identified by police as Erik Roland Larsson, 69, was snatched from his farm by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, who officials say had initially sought a $5 million ransom for his release. Two photographs from the DAS state security police showed agents lifting Larsson, barefoot, dressed in a green T-shirt and blue pants, out of a canoe and carrying him across muddy, rural terrain after he was handed over by guerrillas. "He is in a delicate state of health and at this moment is being evaluated by a medical team in the city of Monteria. He will later be transferred to Bogota," the DAS said in a statement. The FARC, Colombia's largest rebel group, often kidnaps for extortion though it has rarely targeted foreigners. Violence and kidnapping from the country's four-decade war has dropped off as the rebels have been weakened by President Alvaro Uribe's US-backed security campaign. Larsson had worked on a hydroelectric project in Cordoba department in the north of the country before settling in the area. Six gunmen kidnapped him in May 2007 with a female companion. According to the Fondelibertad, an organization linked to the Defense Ministry that monitors kidnapping, Larsson was the last foreigner held in FARC captivity. Last month, the FARC released six political hostages, including the last politicians held in captivity. But talks over remaining hostages remain deadlocked over conditions for any negotiations. Three American contractors and French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt were among the FARC's most-prized political hostages before they were freed in July last year. But the rebels still hold more than 20 hostages for political leverage and hundreds more for ransom. Once a mighty peasant army that controlled large parts of Colombia, the FARC has been battered by Uribe's security crackdown helped by billions of dollars in US aid. The rebels have been driven back into remote mountains and jungles. The FARC last year lost three top commanders and suffered scores of desertions. But it is still a force in rural areas, aided in part by revenue from the country's huge cocaine smuggling business and extortion in urban areas
