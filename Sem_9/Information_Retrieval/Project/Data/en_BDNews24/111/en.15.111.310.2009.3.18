 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)--The finance minister, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, warns the Bangladesh economy braces for a big challenge in the next two fiscal years. "The situation is very grave," the minister told reporters Wednesday after a meeting with officials of Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation, the government outfit that disburses micro-credit through NGOs. "The great recession will leave worse impact in the coming two fiscals than in the current FY 2008-9,"he said. "It will be difficult for the government to prepare budget for the FY 2009-10 and FY 2010-11," the finance minister said. "We can't but increase investment to tackle the situation." Asked if the investors--local and foreign--would respond now, Muhith said: "The recession is bound to subside at some stage ... then the investors will take into account the advantages our market offers." The recession, the minister said, offered opportunities too. "Prices of capital machinery and industrial raw materials, for example, have fallen to the bottom," he argued. "This is an added attraction for the investors considering Bangladesh as a destination." The minister referred to his meeting with the Iranian ambassador Wednesday and said the diplomat showed investment interest in various sectors.
