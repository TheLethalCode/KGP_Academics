 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com) - The government has started investigation into alleged irregularities of the '100-day employment generation scheme', with four allegations being proved already, initiated by the previous caretaker government, the food minister said Thursday. The ministry has received 102 allegations, of which 53 are under investigation and investigation into eight more allegations have been completed, Abdur Razzaq told reporters at the secretariat after attending a workshop on the scheme. "Four allegations have already proved to be true," he said. Razzaq said two Union Parisad chairmen and four Union Parisad members in Jessore, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Panchagar were brought under charges in these incidents. "Of them, four have been sent to jail." Investigation is ongoing in other areas, he added. The minister, however, said the participants of Thursday's workshop  DCs, UNOs, project implementation officers, Upazila and Union Parishad chairmen and members  have recommended the government continue with the scheme, as it had worked well for the hardcore poor. Razzaq also said the remainder of the scheme would be realised in Monga-affected regions. The government will also intensify supervision of the implementation process. The minister said some probe teams, to be formed by food ministry officials, would directly deal with the allegations in the field. He said in the first phase of the 100-day scheme, 60 days last October-November was "marred by irregularities and corruption". Over Tk 1,000 crore was allocated for the first phase. bdnews
