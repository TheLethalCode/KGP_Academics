<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, March 19 (bdnews24.com)- New Zealand entered their third World Cup final in high style by posting a mammoth 373 against Pakistan in the final match of the Super Six. Suzie Bates slammed a 105-ball 168 and captain Haidee Tiffen scored her maiden century in a record stand of 262. Their total was the third highest in World Cups and the sixth highest overall in women's cricket. Pakistan made a valiant effort in the chase, scoring their second highest total of the tournament, but went down by 223 runs. They will now meet West Indies in the fifth-place playoff. New Zealand started off aggressively and by the time opener Kate Pulford fell in the fourth over they had scored 34 off just 20 balls. It took Pakistan 36 more overs to get their second wicket; Bates and Tiffen scored at more than seven an over and the hapless Pakistan captain Urooj Mumtaz used eight bowlers in trying to staunch the flow of runs. Mumtaz was the most expensive - going for 20 runs in her one over. Bates hit 19 fours and six sixes in her innings while Tiffen was more sedate with three fours in her 128-ball 100. Nicola Browne topped off the run-fest with an unbeaten 33 off 22 balls. The two teams were also involved in the match with the highest total in men or women's cricket - New Zealand scored 455 and bowled out Pakistan for 47 in Christchurch in 1997. But Pakistan fared much better this time round - batting 48.1 overs for 150 - with opener Nain Abidi scoring a career-best 52. But the total was greatly boosted by some sloppy fielding by New Zealand - missing run-out chances and overthrows. They will have to pick themselves up on the field if they are to overhaul England to take their second world title on Sunday. Courtesy : Cricinf
