<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP is set to hold a national council by July 25, in line with electoral laws, said a senior party leader on Saturday. "We will hold a national council after forming committees through elections at all party levels," BNP joint secretary Nazrul Islam Khan told a briefing at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. "The standing committee will decide on the date, within July 25, in line with the newly amended Representation of the People Order, and keeping in mind the conditions of the Election Commission, " he said. "However, I consider the obligation undemocratic. The commission should not play a role as regulator of political parties, it should assist parties," Nazrul said. It will be a very hard task for the party to hold the council by the given date, he said. "Even so, if the leaders and party workers pull together it should be possible." But the EC should re-consider the time frame considering the overall situation in the aftermath of the BDR mutiny and the upcoming rainy season, said Nazrul. The party's joint secretaries general will submit the reports of six divisional committees, on rebuilding BNP from the grassroots level, to chairperson Khaleda Zia by Sunday, he said. BNP joint secretary Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, also head of the Chittagong organising committee, submitted the Chittagong division report on Wednesday. The reports contain possible tasks and recommendations after reviewing the opinions of the grassroots leaders in Upazila and municipalities. The local-level leaders were summoned to Dhaka between Feb 3 and Feb 24 for their views. According to the new RPO, the parties should hold national council within six months after the national elections. b
