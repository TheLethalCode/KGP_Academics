<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  A US-based rights group has urged the Bangladesh government to try the BDR mutiny case in the country's regular courts or by special tribunal, not in any military court. The border force, Bangladesh Rifles, is under the charge of the home ministry not the defence ministry, said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, in Dhaka on Thursday. The trial process should rightly go through the normal judicial system under civilian law, not military law, he told a briefing at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. If necessary, the case could be tried by a special tribunal, with an assurance of protecting all rights of the accused, said Adams. He also asked the government to ensure an independent investigation into the BDR mutiny. Human Rights Watch had heard reports of the deaths of two BDR personnel so far, said Adams. He requested the government to ensure so that no BDR men were tortured during custody and interrogation. On the overall human rights situation in Bangladesh, the HRW official said law enforcers had tortured many detainees in the past. He expressed concern over allegations against the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence of torture in custody and deaths by 'crossfire' involving the Rapid Action Battalion. These incidents are alarming for the human rights situation, Adams said. Asked to comment on proposed war crimes trials, Adams said the existing International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 could be a starting point, as has been suggested by legal experts. bdne
