 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)The apex trade bodies of the garment industry, BGMEA and BKMEA, say they are ready to launch open market sales of rice for their workers from the first week of next month. Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq told reporters Sunday after a meeting with delegations of the trade bodies that the government is yet to finalise the launching date of the scheme to provide low-cost rice to garment workers. On Wednesday, however, labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain after a meeting with a BGMEA delegation said the government would begin the scheme from May 1, selling rice to 30 lakh garment workers, mostly women, at Tk 18 per kg against the retail price of Tk 24. Razzaq said Sunday another meeting between the ministry and the garment industry representatives next week would finalise the start date. "The ministry, however, is fully prepared right now for the initiative," he added. Razzaq also said the move to assist garment workers came as the industry contributes almost 75 percent of the country's export earnings. "The scheme is aimed to cushion the impact on garments workers of rising commodity prices," he said. bd
