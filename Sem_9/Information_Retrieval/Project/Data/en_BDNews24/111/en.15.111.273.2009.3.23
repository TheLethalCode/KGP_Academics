 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission does not fear any subversive activities by militant groups during the upcoming by-elections, said an official on Monday. "Although fears of militancy have arisen in places, we don't see any such anxiety for the coming polls," said election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain. "We don't know if the intelligence agencies are expecting any subversive activities centring the elections," he told reporters at the EC secretariat. By-elections to six constituencies, vacated by MPs who won more than one seat in the Dec. 29 general election, are scheduled for Apr 2. Sakhawat said all is set for free and fair elections to Bogra-6 and -7, Kishorganj-6, Kurigram-2, Rangpur-3 and -6. "This time we don't want any repetition of controversy or allegations over the by-elections as in the past," Sakhawat said. The EC has already asked the prime minister, the leader of the opposition, the speaker, ministers and persons holding positions equivalent to ministers not to participate in any election campaigns, complying with the electoral code of conduct. The commission will conduct the by-elections with its own officials, a first for parliamentary elections. "Civil servants are sometimes unable to properly conduct the elections held under a political government, as they face 'psychological' pressures," said Sakhawat. bdnews24.co
