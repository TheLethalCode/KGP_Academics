<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)The government will examine NGO financing and activities and take strict measures against those found to be channelling funds to militants in Bangladesh, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Wednesday. He said funding of militants came through many sources, through individuals and organisations. The minister mentioned "the large number of NGOs" approved during the past four-party alliance government by the then social welfare minister Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed. The government would audit the accounts and activities of those NGOs meticulously, said Muhith. "The caretaker government made laws to stop financing of militant outfits through money laundering," he said. "The present government will take all necessary measures to curb militancy in line with those ordinances." The minister was speaking to reporters at the secretariat after a meeting with the microfinance organisation Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation. bdnews
