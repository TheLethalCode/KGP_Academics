 NEW DELHI, Thu Mar 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prakash Karat, head of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said he would be open to talking to the ruling Congress party to support the formation of an alternative "Third Front" government after an upcoming general election. The statement by Karat signals a shift in India's political sands, opening up the chance of a Left-Congress pact after they split angrily last year over a civilian nuclear deal with the United States.

The motive for the two sides getting together could be to stop Hindu nationalists from gaining power, analysts say. Ganguli said there were two possibilities from Karat's statement. Firstly, a Third Front could do well in the election, and ask for outside support of Congress to gain a parliamentary majority. A similar thing happened in 1996. Or, a Congress-led alliance could win office with outside support of the Third Front, or just the communists. "It's not a question of untouchability. We'll do business with all parties but that business will be circumscribed by the nature of the mandate," Karat said. A poll of 14 leading analysts by Reuters published on Tuesday gave a 32 percent chance of a Congress-led government s
