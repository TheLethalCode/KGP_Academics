<TITLE> Thai opposition aims to undermine PM with censure </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's main opposition party began a censure debate against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and other ministers on Thursday, knowing it would not win but hoping its allegations would stick with the public. Thailand experienced months of political chaos last year when mass rallies and occupations of government buildings and Bangkok's airports dominated the action and parliament was largely sidelined. Now the Puea Thai party, close to ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, is accusing Abhisit and other ministers, including Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij and Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya, of abuse of power. Chalerm Youbumrung, who is leading the debate for Puea Thai, admitted to reporters this week that the opposition lacked the votes to topple the government but said it wanted to discredit Abhisit and tarnish the image of his Democrat Party. "I am a former Democrat, but today I want the public to know how crooked they are," Chalerm said in parliament on Thursday, In a three-hour speech, Chalerm mainly accused Abhisit and other Democrat leaders of covering up illegal donations to the party. Abhisit, in power since December, retorted that his party's financial matters had been checked by the Election Commission, which had not found any irregularities. A small group of red-shirted Thaksin supporters demonstrated outside parliament, some setting alight an effigy of Abhisit. The parliamentary procedure could distract Abhisit and his cabinet at a time when it should be concentrating on the economy, which experienced its worst contraction on record in the final quarter of 2008 and is likely to enter recession this year. Even so, Thailand's stock market and the baht rose on Thursday, reacting positively along with other Asian markets to the latest efforts to jump-start the U.S. economy, but analysts said worries over political unrest held stocks back. Under Thai parliament procedure, each minister faces a no-confidence vote, which has been scheduled for Saturday, March 21. Half the lawmakers in the House of Representatives must vote with the opposition for the no-confidence motions to pass. UNDER FIRE The government may face another challenge next week. Members of the pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship said on Thursday they would besiege Government House from March 26 in a bid to force Abhisit to resign. In the parliamentary debate, the opposition will be training its fire on Kasit, the foreign minister. He was a regular speaker at rallies of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), a street movement that last year helped undermine previous governments led by supporters of Thaksin. He described a week-long closure of Bangkok airports by PAD protests late last year as "part of the democratic process". Even if Kasit wins the vote, he may be discredited and some political analysts say he could be replaced. However, the government itself is likely to survive the challenge, they say. "The government has been in office for only a few months. There are no tangible wrongdoings to undermine public trust yet," said Prinya Thewanareumitkul, an analyst at Thammasat University. The government's handling of the economy will feature among the opposition complaints in the censure debate. The Commerce Ministry said on Wednesday that Thailand's exports fell by double digits for a fourth month in February and imports registered their biggest fall in 11 years.[ID:nBKK440461] Abhisit said in London at the weekend the economy was unlikely to start recovering until the fourth quarter of 2009.
