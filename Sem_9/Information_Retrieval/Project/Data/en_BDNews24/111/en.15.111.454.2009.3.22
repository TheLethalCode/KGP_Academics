 ISLAMABAD, Sun Mar 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's top judge Iftikhar Chaudhry resumed office on Sunday, a week after the government announced it was reinstating him to put an end to a mass protest organised by lawyers and opposition parties. Chaudhry became a cause celebre after being dismissed in late 2007 by then-president and army chief General Pervez Musharraf, apparently because Musharraf feared the judge would challenge his strategy for holding on to power. President Asif Ali Zardari, elected by parliament six months ago, was hesitant to reinstate the judge, fearing he could wage a vendetta against Musharraf, and threaten his own position. On Sunday, hundreds of jubilant lawyers and political and rights activists gathered outside Chaudhry's residence in the capital Islamabad for a flag-hoisting ceremony to mark his restoration. "This is a very fortunate day in the history of judicial and political struggle in Pakistan," said Raja Zulqarnain, a Supreme Court lawyer. On Tuesday, Chaudhry will return to the Supreme Court he was evicted from on the night Musharraf declared emergency rule on Nov. 3, 2007. Opposition leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had thrown his weight behind lawyers campaigning for Chaudhry's reinstatement. There had been fears the country could descend into political violence unless the government backed down. Western governments fear chaos would help al Qaeda, the Taliban and other militant groups deepen their presence in Pakistan. While the sense of crisis has subsided, uncertainty remains because of a power struggle between Zardari and Sharif. The government has, however, asked the Supreme Court to suspend a ruling that disqualified Sharif and his brother, Shahbaz Sharif, from holding elected office. That ruling, handed down late last month, had prompted Zardari to impose central rule over Punjab province, ousting the provincial government led by Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party. The government has still to remove central, or governor's, rule over Punjab, the most populous and influential of Pakistan's four provinces. There is considerable speculation that Zardari is trying to manouevre a situation whereby his own party emerges at the head of the next Punjab government. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani went to Lahore for talks with Sharif on Sunday. While Gilani is a member of Zardari's party, the prime minister has also kept good relations with Sharif, and he played a key role, along with the army and the United States and Britain, in defusing the latest crisis in Paki
