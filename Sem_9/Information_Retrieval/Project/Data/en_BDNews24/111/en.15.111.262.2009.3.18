 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com) - Negligence of the Basundhara City authorities caused the devastating fire that engulfed six top floors of the country's largest shopping and office complex, said the probe committee on Wednesday. "The management took action only after the alarm bell had rung 79 times," said committee chief Iqbal Hossain Chowdhury. "The water system was ineffective," he told reporters after interviewing employees at the site. "The building has sufficient fire fighting equipment but not many trained personnel." Chowdhury said the establishment also employs enough safety personnel to tackle a fire, but he again cited insufficient training as a serious failure. Basundhara City general manager (admin) Kamrul Mehedi, however, said, "We have built up our own fire-fighting team with trained personnel, formerly of the navy and fire service department." The probe committee, formed during last Friday's blaze that claimed seven lives, said its main task was to look into what fire safety measures were actually in place at the multistorey commercial complex. It was also investigating why and how the building caught fire, said committee members. The fire, which gutted the buildings top-level corporate offices, originated from the 18th floor, Chowdhury confirmed on Wednesday. b
