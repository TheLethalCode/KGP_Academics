 TEHRAN, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's supreme leader said on Saturday he saw no change in US policy towards the Islamic Republic, a day after US President Barack Obama issued an unprecedented videotaped appeal to the country. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei sharply criticised US behaviour towards Iran since its 1979 Islamic revolution and said the United States was "hated in the world" and should stop interfering in other countries' internal affairs. "They give the slogan of change but in practice no change is seen ... We haven't seen any change," Khamenei said in a televised speech to mark the Iranian New Year. He was speaking in the northeastern city of Mashhad, a day after Obama offered Iran a "new beginning" of diplomatic engagement between the two old foes. Khamenei said a change of US "words" was not enough and added: "We will watch and we will judge (the new US administration) ... You change, our behaviour will change.
