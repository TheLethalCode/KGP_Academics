 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday asked the Anticorruption Commission to submit an inquiry report by Apr 19 on the money laundering case against opposition leader Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco. Fresh date would be fixed again on Apr 19 if the report was not tendered to the court by the date, ACC prosecution officer Mohammad Abdur Rashid told bdnews24.com. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Golam Rabbani took the first information report of the case into cognisance. The Anticorruption Commission sued Coco Tuesday, police said. If found guilty, Coco may be sentenced to seven years in jail. The case, filed under Money Laundering Prevention Act 2009, accused Coco of laundering funds he had received in bribes to Singapore worth nearly US $ 9.32 lakh and Singapore $ 28.85 lakh. It said he used his influence to earn the money illegally between 2004 and 2007 when his mother was prime minister. An accused in GATCO and other cases, Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick. The government extended his parole by a month on Mar 15. The antigraft body also served a notice Tuesday on BNP vice chairman and Khaleda's brother Sayed Eskander, giving him just seven days to come up with a statement of his assets and property. This was the first such notice issued by the ACC since the end of the military-installed two-year emergency government. b
