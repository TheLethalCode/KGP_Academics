<TITLE> Citi, Morgan Stanley look to sidestep bonus caps: report </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, Tue Mar 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anticipating restrictions on bonuses, officials at Citigroup Inc and Morgan Stanley are exploring ways to sidestep tough new federal caps on compensation, the Wall Street Journal said. Executives at these banks and other financial institutions that received government aid are discussing increasing base salaries for some executives and other top-producing employees, the paper said, citing people familiar with the situation.

Wells Fargo & Co, which took $25 billion of capital last year under TARP, disclosed last week that it increased the base salaries of CEO John Stumpf and two other executives, the paper said.
