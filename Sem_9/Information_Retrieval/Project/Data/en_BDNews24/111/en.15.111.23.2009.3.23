 LONDON, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur defender Ledley King, who cannot train between matches because of a chronic knee injury, was recalled to the England squad on Sunday for forthcoming matches against Slovakia and Ukraine. England meet Slovakia in a friendly international at Wembley Stadium next Saturday and face Ukraine in a Group Six World Cup qualifier at the same venue on April 1. King, who won the last of his 19 caps against Estonia in June 2007, has been rewarded for a series of impressive displays for his club, along with his Spurs team mate Aaron Lennon, who was promoted from the Under-21 squad to the senior party. Lennon, who signed a new deal at Spurs last week, won the last of his nine caps against Andorra in a European qualifer in March 2007. Everton defender Leighton Baines is called up for the first time while Manchester United's third choice keeper Ben Foster who gave an outstanding display for Manchester United in this month's League Cup final against Spurs, is also included by Capello for the first time. He won one cap under manager Fabio Capello's predecessor Steve McLaren. Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrad, who both missed England's last match against European champions Spain in Seville last month are also recalled. David Beckham, who is on loan from LA Galaxy to AC Milan, will become England's most capped outfield player if he wins his 109th cap in either game. He currently shares the record with 1966 World Cup winning skipper Bobby Moore. Four Aston Villa players: Luke Young, James Milner, Ashley Young and Gabriel Agbonlahor have all been left out of the squad as has Manchester City defender Wayne Bridge. Squad: Goalkeepers: David James (Portsmouth), Robert Green (West Ham United), Ben Foster (Manchester United) Defenders: Leighton Baines (Everton), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Joleon Lescott (Everton), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), John Terry (Chelsea), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), Glen Johnson (Portsmouth), Matthew Upson (West Ham United), Ledley King (Tottenham Hotspur), Midfielders: Gareth Barry (Aston Villa), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough), David Beckham (AC Milan), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City), Aaron Lennon (Tottenham Hotspur), Steven Gerrad (Liverpool) Forwards: Carlton Cole (West Ham United), Peter Crouch (Portsmouth), Emile Heskey (Aston Villa), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)
