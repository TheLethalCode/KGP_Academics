<TITLE> 'Fastest' mutiny trial: Faruq Khan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)  The trial procedure of the BDR mutiny case will be the "speediest one possible", commerce minister and coordinator of the mutiny investigations, Faruq Khan, said Thursday. "We want to try the guilty in the speediest time and for that a number of steps have been taken," Faruq told reporters, after meeting the US ambassador and the head of the visiting FBI team at the ministry. Faruq said US ambassador James F Moriarty had introduced the chief of the seven-strong FBI team, which arrived earlier in the week. "The FBI  will only assist the Bangladeshi investigations," the minister said on a query. He added that the investigations had been moving forward significantly. Moriarty said the FBI team would continue assisting Bangladeshi investigators to unearth the facts of the BDR massacre. Citing the Sept 11 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre in New York, Moriarty said they saw the 9/11 investigation process coming in useful here. The commerce minister said the two also discussed some trade issues. bdnew
