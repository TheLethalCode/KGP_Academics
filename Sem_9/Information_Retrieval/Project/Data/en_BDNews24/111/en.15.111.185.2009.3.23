<TITLE> New Zealand retain same squad for second India test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand have resisted the temptation to change their squad for the second test against India starting at Napier on Thursday. Despite slumping to a 10-wicket loss in Hamilton last week, New Zealand selectors retained the same 12 players chosen for the opener of the three-match series. The only minor change was the omission of fast bowler Brent Arnel, a non-playing member of the original 13-man squad for the first test, who injured himself playing in the domestic state championship. Iain O'Brien and Daniel Flynn both picked up minor injuries in the first test but Glenn Turner, head of the selection panel, said there were no plans to add any more players. Turner also said all-rounder Jacob Oram was not considered for selection as he recovers from injury but was hopeful of being fit enough for the third test. "He's only had a couple of days in the domestic competition," Turner said in a statement on Monday. "After talking with him we agree he'd benefit from more game time to get up to the fitness level needed for the test side." New Zealand squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Daniel Flynn, James Franklin, Martin Guptill, Tim McIntosh, Brendon McCullum, Chris Martin, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor
