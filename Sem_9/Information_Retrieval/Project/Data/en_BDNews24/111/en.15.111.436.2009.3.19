 ATHENS, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unidentified assailants exploded a homemade bomb at the office of a Greek ruling party deputy Wednesday, causing damage but no injuries, police said. Deputy Kyriakos Mitsotakis, 41, brother of Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyanni and son of former Prime Minister Costas Mitsotakis, was not at his office at the time of the attack, the latest violence to rock the conservative government. "The bomb exploded at his office doorstep, causing minor damage. There was no one in the building at the time of the explosion," said a police official, who declined to be named. Police said they had received no warning and no one had claimed responsibility for the attack. The government is still reeling from the worst riots in decades in December, provoked by the fatal police shooting of a 15-year-old and fueled by anger at youth unemployment and economic measures. Last week, Greece's most militant guerrilla group Revolutionary Struggle said it was behind two attacks against Citibank branches in the Greek capital. The group has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks against police and ministries, including a rocket-propelled grenade attack against the U.S. embassy in Athens, in 2007
