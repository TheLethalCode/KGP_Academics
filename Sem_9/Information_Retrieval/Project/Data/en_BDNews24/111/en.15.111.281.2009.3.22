<TITLE> Farashganj meet Sheikh Russel in Plate final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  Farashganj Sporting Club moved into the Plate final of the Super Cup with a 5-3 tiebreaker win over Rahmatganj MFS in the second semi-final at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. The match rolled into a tie-breaker after regulation and extra time produced a goalless draw though both sides came close to breaking the deadlock several times. Kabir Hossain, Emeka Lucky Uti, Khokon Das, Mamun Miah and Enamul Haque converted the penalty kicks for Farashganj, who will play Sheikh Russel KC in the final on Wednesday. Idris Kasirye, Mostafa Kaba and Jahangir Patuari found the back of the Farashganj net from the spot while Felix Onyo Koro squandered the opportunity to frustrate Rahmatganj, who ended their Super Cup campaign on a losing streak in all four matches. The Old Dhaka outfit, Farashganj, comparatively enjoyed a superior ball possession from the word go, but they were unlucky not taking any of those chances. Rahmatganj, however, threatened the opponents on the counter-attack as they, surviving from two close calls, nearly took a lead when Idris headed a Jahangir corner off the Farashganj sidebar in the 25th minute. Striker Enamul Haq, capitalising a back-header from Rahmatganj's defender Seepon, darted into the danger zone and put/chipped the ball over advancing goalkeeper Mohammad Ali, but it narrowly missed the target. After the interval, it was almost a pedestrian affair except for two attempts from Farashganj. Rahmatganj goalkeeper Ali once again saved his side foiling a long-range shot from Jahangir in the 77th minute while Idris headed out a well-judge centre from Khokon four minutes from time. Rahmatganj came close to ending the deadlock four minutes into extra time when substitute Idriss Mutebi failed to beat Farashganj goalkeeper Sujan Chowdhury in a one-on-one situation and then captain Nche Francis shot wide despite getting a open net. bd
