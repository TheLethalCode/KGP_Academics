 Bridgetown, March 20 (bdnews24.com) - All three 11th round matches in the West Indies Cricket Board's regional four-day tournament have failed to start after players in dispute with the board refused to take to the field, reports Cricinfo. The exact nature of yet another stand-off between the WICB and the region's cricketers is unclear, but the boycott follows the news that last night Dinanath Ramnarine, who heads the players' association, resigned as a director of the board. Players involved in games in Barbados, St Vincent and Jamaica failed to turn up at the grounds for the scheduled start. In the one-day international against England, the West Indies players took to the field with masking tape over the Digicel logos on their left arms. Julian Hunte, the embattled WICB president, told regional news agency CMC he could not speak on the matter because he was "otherwise engaged". Attempts to reach Donald Peters, the board's CEO, were unsuccessful. Courtesy : Crici
