<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)The fire service held a half-hour drill at the secretariat Thursday, as part of a fortnight's programme of fire fighting exercises at key buildings of the city. Fire services director general Abu Nayyim Shahidullah told reporters that 50 firemen and three fire engines joined the exercise. Fog machines were first used to fill the seventh and 21st floors of Building 6 and floor 17 of Building 7 with smoke. The fire engines then rushed to the 'smoking' buildings where firemen engaged in mock fire fighting. They also practiced rescuing people using sky lifts from rooftops. Two sky lifts, an 11,000 litre water carrier and two water pumping vehicles participated in the drill; a number of other fire service vehicles were also used, said the fire chief. Satisfied over fire safety arrangements at the secretariat, Nayyim said, "Dousing any fire at the secretariat should be quite possible in 30 minutes at the most." "We should take 10 minutes to arrive her, 10 minutes for setting up the equipment and another 10 minutes for extinguishing the blaze." "Ordinary fires could be managed using whatever equipment we have now." The fire drill was carried out in the wake of the extensive fire that gutted the top six floors of the 20-storey Basundhara City shopping and office complex last Friday. The fire chief said his men had taken up a fortnight's programme of fire fighting exercises at key buildings of the city. "Today's drill at the secretariat was part of that," said. "We are in fact receiving requests to carry out fire drills from many places. We hope to carry on with such awareness-raising exercises throughout the year." Nayyim said the fire service was currently in the process of procuring state-of-the art fire fighting equipment. bdnew
