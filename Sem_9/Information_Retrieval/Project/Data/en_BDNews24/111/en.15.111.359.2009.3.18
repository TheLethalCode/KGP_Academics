<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Wednesday in parliament that the government would ensure fair justice and added that one who got fair justice had to feel that. She told Md Majibul Huq from Kishoreganj-3 the government had no plan to set aside the post of secretary of law, justice and parliamentary affairs for a judicial service official. The government can decide in which ministry a secretary will work because the constitution states that law and other ministries are also the inseparable part of the executive, she added in the prime minister's question-answer session. "There is no scope to treat the law ministry as part or extended wing of the Supreme Court or the judiciary. "But in the interest of separation of the judiciary from the executive , a separate and effective judicial service secretariat under the Supreme Court like that of the parliamentary secretariat can be created if the judiciary so desires." Replying to a supplementary question, the prime minister said the conflict between the judiciary and the executive was sad and undesirable. The law minister was holding talks to resolve the conflict. "We will be working to separate the judiciary from the executive in a constitutional way". She said new judges would be appointed to clear backlog of cases and steps taken to modernise the judiciary and arrange legal aid. On the voting right of the expatriates, she said, "I, in principle, agree that those who have duel citizenship should have voting right. Arrangements will be made to make the expatriates voters by amending the law." Hasina said during the two-year emergency there were restrictions on the media on some matters. Rashed Khan Menon said who would participate on TV talk shows were decided beforehand. "TV stations came under restrictions, even the producer was beaten in the television station. Who was the authority? Will action be taken against them?" he asked. "You can turn to the judiciary over the issue. There is no emergency and there is no such law now. If any wrong is done, any citizen can seek justice," Hasina said. She added that people were made unemployed as the emergency government retrieved Khas land. Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farrouque asked her whether a parliamentary committee will be formed to probe the interventions in the media affairs and the eviction. She said if all agreed an enquiry committee might be formed. bdnews
