 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)Black money holders should be allowed to buy five-year government bonds at 7.5 percent, according to a plan mooted by business leaders. FBCCI leaders told NBR chief Mohammad Abdul Mazid Monday that the low interest bond would help Bangladesh weather the crisis triggered by the global recession. "This black money [undisclosed income] whitening initiative will boost investment, create new jobs, with direct positive impact on the economy," FBCCI's Annisul Huq said at a pre-budget discussion. "Under the circumstances there is no alternative to industrialisation and infrastructure development with massive investment." There was no direct response from the NBR boss to the FBCCI proposal, but azid said he personally believed no money should lie idle. The FBCCI leaders referred to the widely predicted decline in remittance, export income and foreign aid. The pace of downturn could be frightening, he said. Just two days earlier, former finance ministry chiefs made a similar recommendation to the finance ministera low-interest government bond to absorb black money into the formal economy. A M A Muhith described the proposal as "interesting". The NBR chief said the 2009-10 budget would take into account the likely "impact of the deep recession on our economy". Mazid said growth of local industries would get top priority to boost investment. FBCCI presented three sets of recommendations on income tax, value added tax and import duty. Former FBCCI president Salman F Rahman, the Awami League chief's adviser on private sector, was among others present.
