 SAN FRANCISCO, Tue Mar 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dell Inc unveiled its "luxury" Adamo laptop on Tuesday, calling it the world's thinnest notebook as it seeks to compete in the high-end ultraportable market defined by Apple Inc's MacBook Air. The sleek, aluminum-encased notebook is 0.65-inches thick and comes with a 13.4-inch screen and a 128-gigabyte solid-state drive. Shipping begins on Tuesday. Starting at $1,999, the Adamo is positioned as Dell's new high-end brand. Another configuration will sell for $2,699. The device comes packed in a clear case along with an optional branded sleeve or tote bag from designer luggage and handbag label Tumi.

The Adamo at 4 pounds is heavier than the Air, which weighs 3 pounds and is priced from $1,799. Most PC makers, including Lenovo Group, Hewlett Packard Co and Sony Corp also sell ultraportables. Dell has been trying to reinvigorate its consumer brand amid efforts to diversify its revenue base. Business customers make up around 80 percent of Dell's revenue, while PCs account for roughly 60 percent. Last week, Dell launched the $799 Studio One 19, a touchscreen all-in-one PC meant for family use in the kitchen or the living room. The Studio One 19 will be available first in Japan and then in other countries later in the spring. Dell shares have slid 13 percent since the start of 2009, while Apple's have jumped 12 percent.
