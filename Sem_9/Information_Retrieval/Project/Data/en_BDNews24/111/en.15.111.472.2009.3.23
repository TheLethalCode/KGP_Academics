 BAGHDAD, Mon Mar 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq has requested an additional 140 Abrams tanks on top of the 140 it has already ordered under a deal signed last year, the US commander in charge of foreign military sales to Iraq said on Monday. Brigadier-General Charles Luckey told Reuters the government of Iraq requested the extra tanks, made by General Dynamics Corp, last October, a month after agreeing the first shipment. But he added that the US government had yet to respond to the request. Iraq has not yet shown it has the funds for the latest request, he said. He said the tanks cost about $4.45 million each, so the total cost of that order would be around $625 million, not including maintenance and training for their use. "In addition to the 140 tanks they've already purchased ... they've put in a request, another proposal, for an additional 140 tanks, although they have not signed it and not funded it," Luckey said in an interview. He added that Iraq had also put in a letter of request for an extra 26 Bell 407 armed scout helicopters, made by Textron Inc and costing some $8.67 million each, also around October last year, while it was sealing an existing deal to purchase 24. No letter of acceptance had yet been signed by the U.S. government for that additional number of helicopters, he said. As U.S. forces prepare to pull combat troops out by Aug. 31 2010, Iraq has been aggressively pursuing the acquisition of a range of weapons with which to equip its fledgling forces to maintain security. U.S. officials stress that adequate equipment is a key element that Iraqi forces must have in place when U.S. troops pull out. Its shopping list includes tanks, war planes, helicopters, trucks, radios, guns and mortars -- many sought through the foreign military sales programme since 2005. "We're talking about $4.3 billon worth of equipment, sustainment and training for that equipment that has been purchased and either has been delivered or is in the process of being delivered," Luckey said, adding that Iraq was pondering a further $4 billion worth of offers from the U.S. programme. In August Iraq expressed an interest in buying 36 F-16 combat aircraft built by Lockheed Martin Corp. Luckey said Iraq had signed a letter of request for a price and availability analysis for the F-16s, a sign they were serious about them. "The foreign military sales' ability to provide the Iraqis with the capabilities they need has been much more pronounced than what we've seen at least to date from their direct commercial efforts," Luckey said, adding that more deals had been done in 2008 than all previous years put together. He said the 1st 140 Abrams tanks already purchased would not be delivered until 2010, but as a part of the initiative the United States had loaned the Iraqi security forces 22 Abrams tanks to use for trai
