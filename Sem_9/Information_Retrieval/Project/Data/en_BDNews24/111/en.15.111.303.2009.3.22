 Dhaka, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)A selling spree caused the country's share markets to lose heavily on the opening day of the week, falling for the fifth consecutive trading day. About seventy percent of the scrips traded on the twin bourses saw losses on Sunday. Dhaka Stock Exchange's general index witnessed a slight rise at start followed by a sharp decline. Brokerage house officials said retail investors were busy selling-off their holdings. "There was relatively little buying," an official of Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Some market experts saw the selling trend as "a bit alarming". "It has continued for the last four days ... it seems that investor confidence is getting low," Salahuddin Ahmed, a former chief executive of DSE said. The falling trade volume also reflects low confidence, added Ahmed who teaches finance at the Dhaka University. Other market observers, however, disagreed. "There's nothing to be alarmed at this profit-taking behaviour, as turnover figures are still high in the wake of falling indices," said Saiful Islam, senior vice-president of DSE. Indices slump The DGEN or general index ended on 2590.56, losing 32.20 points or 1.22 percent. The DSI or all share price index finished 31.10 points or 1.42 percent down at 2148.16. The bourse's blue-chip DSE-20 fell 9.88 points or 0.47 percent to 2059.50. Losers outnumbered gainers 169 to 69 while seven issues held steady. Indices on Chittagong Stock Exchange closed downbeat due to massive losses in textile, cement and services scrips while prices of banks edged up. The CSCX or selective categories index fell 63.45 points or 1.21 percent to close at 5143.59. The CASPI or all share price index ended on 7949.36, slumping 119.04 points or 1.47 percent. The CSE-30 blue-chip index shed 16.15 points or 0.25 percent to finish at 6239.53. Of the traded issues, 119 declined, 44 advanced with one scrip remaining unchanged.
