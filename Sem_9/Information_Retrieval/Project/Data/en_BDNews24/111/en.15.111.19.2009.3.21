 ROME, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Serie A (all times GMT): Captain Francesco Totti has failed to recover from a knee problem in time for AS Roma's home game against second-placed Juventus on Saturday (1930). Roma are without six other injured regulars plus four suspended players, defenders Marco Motta and Souleymane Diamoutene and midfielders David Pizarro and Daniele De Rossi, whose appeal to have a two-match ban for dissent halved was rejected on Friday. Coach Luciano Spalletti may be forced to give a start to one of a number of youth team products he has included in fifth-placed Roma's squad. Juventus also have plenty of fitness problems as they try to make inroads into Inter Milan's seven-point lead. Striker Amauri is out with a thigh injury and defender Nicola Legrottaglie is still having trouble with his knee. Italy centre back Giorgio Chiellini should be able to play with a face mask after fracturing his nose in last week's 4-1 win over Bologna. French forward David Trezeguet has recovered from a leg muscle problem and should be on the bench despite a bust-up with coach Claudio Ranieri after he was substituted when Juve were knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea. Injuries and Walter Samuel's suspension mean Colombian Nelson Rivas is probably the only centre back Inter Milan can call on for the champions' home game against bottom side Reggina on Sunday (1400). Coach Jose Mourinho is being tipped to use Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso in defence as a makeshift solution. Luis Figo has a leg strain. Reggina defender Bruno Cirillo is suspended. Midfielder Massimo Ambrosini is suspended for third-placed AC Milan's visit to Napoli on Sunday (1930) while playmaker Kaka is a major doubt with a foot problem that has sidelined him for over a month. Winger Daniele Mannini will be available for Napoli after the Court of Arbitration for Sport temporarily lifted a controversial one-year doping ban while his case is re-examined. Salvatore Aronica is suspended for former AC Milan midfielder and Italy coach Roberto Donadoni's second match in charge of Napoli after last week's 1-1 draw at Reggina
