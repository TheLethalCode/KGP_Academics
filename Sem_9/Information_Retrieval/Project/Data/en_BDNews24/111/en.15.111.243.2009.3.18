 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal's club captain Cesc Fabregas categorically denied spitting at anyone after his side's 2-1 FA Cup win over Hull City on Tuesday, following an accusation made by rival coach Phil Brown. "I categorically deny that I spat at anybody after the match," Fabregas, who did not play in the match because of injury, said in a statement on the Arsenal website (http://www.arsenal.com). "I have never done this in my whole career on the pitch, so why would I do it when I am not even playing? "I can understand the frustration of losing a game to a dubious goal, that has happened to me many times in my career as well. But this is not the fault of me or any of the Arsenal players." Hull manager Phil Brown had accused Spaniard Fabregas of spitting at the feet of assistant manager Brian Horton after the final whistle in the quarter-final. "I was there and I witnessed it, he spat at my assistant manager down the tunnel," Brown said at a post-match news conference after William Gallas's controversial late header knocked his side out. Brown added: "He spat at his feet." Arsenal manager Wenger said he had not witnessed any incidents at the end of the game. "I went early and haven't seen anything," he told reporters. "I don't know what he has seen. I'm sorry I cannot speak of something I have not seen." The managers did not shake hands at the end of a stormy match. Wenger accused Hull of wasting time "from the first minute". Brown was furious that Gallas's goal, which appeared to be offside, had been allowed to stand
