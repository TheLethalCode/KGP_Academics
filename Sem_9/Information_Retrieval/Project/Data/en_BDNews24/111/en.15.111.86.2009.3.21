 Dhaka Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Internees at Dhaka Medical College Hospital called off an 'indefinite strike' and the emergency ward was reopened Saturday morning after the death of a patient sparked overnight disturbances at Bangladesh's biggest public hospital. Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq, accompanied by the director general of health Shah Monir Hossain, had gone to the spot at 9.30am to speak with the young doctors, who were threatening to stop work after relatives of a dead patient assaulted them, they said. As the doctors relented after talks, emergency patients began being treated again from 10.30am, said hospital director Brig Gen Abdus Shahid Khan. Wife with child released after arrest Shahbagh police eventually released the wife of the dead patient, Shah Imran, pending her court appearance, after her arrest in the early hours. Shahabagh police officer-in-charge Reazul Karim said the wife, Sanjana Latif Tropa, 29, who had lost her 30 year-old husband just hours earlier, was taken into police custody after midnight along with a brother in law, Ehsanul Latif Rupam, 25. Sanjana had a seven-month old baby, Oritro, in her arms. "She was released around midday (Saturday), pending her appearance in court, on account of the baby," Karim told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, relatives and neighbours of Imran and Sanjana, residents of Malibagh in Dhaka, had blocked the main road of Rampura for an hour in protest against the arrests. They eventually lifted their roadblock at around noon, said Rampura police. As demanded by the junior doctors, the DMCH director, Khan himself, filed a case against the dead patient's relatives. He said in his statement to police that intern Tania Sharmin had been assaulted by them. Relatives blame doctors, doctors protest As he died of his injuries Friday afternoon after being hit by a falling roof of a shopping centre, his relatives blamed the attending doctors for failing to respond quickly and save his life. The doctors, mostly interns, forced staff to block the entrance to the Emergency at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) around midnight and were still detaining the director even after the arrests of the relatives of the dead man. They had paraded through the hospital shouting slogans, and besieged the director asking him to resign. Golam Mortuza Antu, bdnews24.com staff correspondent, saw dozens of emergency patients stranded at 2am Saturday as the doctors shouted abuse. One of them, a pregnant woman, was seen lying unattended while her relatives were stuck on the other side of the blocked entrance. Several patients were seen leaving for other hospitals. Some 40 doctors used trolleys to put up a barricade to the Emergency entrance and were part of the group that besieged the brigadier general. The doctors had earlier hurled insults at the hospital director as he asked a ward master to be the complainant of a case. They banged tables and shouted abuse at the director when he returned to the hospital around midnight, after an earlier visit, during which he had agreed to the demand that a criminal case be filed. The internees derided Serajul Islam, the ward master for Ward 30 where the patient had been treated for his injuries, as he was told by the hospital chief to file the case. The student doctors said the hospital management must file the case and take steps to improve security. The relatives, according to the hospital staff, had asked for the death certificate and wanted to claim the body without any post-mortem. The doctor on duty rejected the request. The body was still lying in a hospital freezer at 11:30am. bdnews2
