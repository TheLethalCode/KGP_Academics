 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Wednesday the government was talking with donors and development partners to expedite nuclear power plans in a bid to solve the ongoing power crisis. The country's ambitious but chronically-stalled Rooppur Nuclear Power Project was originally conceived in 1961 but past governments have all failed to follow through. Since Hasina's government came to power at the start of the year, both China and Russia have voiced interest in backing the project. One of Awami League's election pledges ahead of last year's December polls was to complete the plant. Hasina was speaking Wednesday at a meeting with a 19-member delegation of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industries, led by president Abdul Hafizuddin Chowdhury. The MCCI leaders raised a number of issues, highlighting problems faced by the pharmaceuticals and tannery industries based in the capital. But their overriding concern was power. The two-time prime minister said her last administration had faced power problems in 1996. "To solve those, the Awami League government initiated a number of projects, but they were not kept running after we left office," said Hasina. She blamed the past BNP-led government for the power crunch. Hasina said her 1996-2001 government had followed a policy to increase power production every year in line with demand, but the four-party alliance government failed to keep up. She pointed out that since coming to power in January this year her government had lifted tax on solar panels to encourage use of alternative energy. The prime minister also mentioned that proper compensation steps were being taken so that extraction at Barapukuria Coalmine could continue without problems for locals. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad briefed the media about the meeting. bd
