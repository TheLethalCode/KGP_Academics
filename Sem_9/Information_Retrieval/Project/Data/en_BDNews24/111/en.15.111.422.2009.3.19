 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com) - Parliament unanimously adopted a bill Thursday on listing "genuine freedom fighters" who fought for independence in 1971. On the private members' day, Naogaon-5 MP proposed deleting names of "fake" freedom fighters from the official list. Several other members taking the floor voiced their support saying many people who were never involved in the independence war appeared on the list of freedom fighters. They demanded amendment to the list and inclusion of genuine freedom fighters, who were not earlier registered. State minister for liberation war affairs AB Tajul Islam admitted the flaw with the list. "The last four-party alliance government published a gazette of 70,000 freedom fighters many of them being fake," he said. Speaker Abdul Hamid asked the state minister if he had objection to tabling the bill. Islam replied in the negative. The bill for drawing up an amended list of freedom fighters was placed before the House that adopted it unanimously. bdnews
