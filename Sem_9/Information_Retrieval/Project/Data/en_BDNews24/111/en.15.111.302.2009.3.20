<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)  A High Court verdict has been upheld declaring the Madhumoti Model Town project in Savar 'illegal' has been upheld. A three-member bench of the Appellate Division, led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, upheld the verdict Thursday, also ordering the authorities concerned to protect the interests of those who bought plots at the Aminbazar site on the outskirts of the capital. The bench however granted 'leaves to appeal' filed by the Madhumoti Model Town project authorities and RAJUK, challenging the High Court verdict. The High Court gave its ruling on July 25 in 2005 on a petition by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. BELA argued that the project was against the capital's master plan and if implemented would seriously hamper the natural flow and drainage of floodwater from the capital and its surroundings. bdnews
