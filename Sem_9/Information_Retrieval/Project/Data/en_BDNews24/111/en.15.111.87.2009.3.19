<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)Charges of money laundering and misappropriation brought against Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury have proved baseless, said investigators Thursday. Mahmudur Rahman, chairman of Amar Desh Publications, filed the case in October last year accusing Mashhud of misappropriating Tk 22.42 crore as chairman of Trust Bank by laundering the funds overseas. As the case was not accepted by any police station, Mahmudur Rahman sent the case statement to the ACC by registered post. The ACC boss called a press conference the next day, rejecting the charges. He asked the government to take legal steps over the allegations against him. A special two-member scrutiny panel, of ACC commissioners Habibur Rahman and Abul Hasan Manjur Mannan, was formed on Jan 25 this year to investigate the charges. The investigation report, which was made public Thursday after conclusion of the probe, said the complainant Mahmudur Rahman failed to present necessary evidence when requested by the ACC. The charges proved inconsistent and Mahmud failed to establish how Mashhud misappropriated funds, although he was given the chance to present records in support of his allegation, it said. In a statement to the probe committee, Mashhud said he discharged the duties of Trust Bank chairman ex-officio from June 2002 to June 2005, during his tenure as army chief, but the financial losses occurred from January 2002 to July 2003. The financial losses were unknown to the bank's governing body and even an audit firm failed to unearth them until August 2003, when the bank's vice chairman Maj Gen Jalal Uddin Ahmed informed Mashhud of the matter, the ACC chairman told the investigators. A committee was immediately formed to investigate the losses and, with permission of Bangladesh Bank, the then managing director of Trust Bank Zahid Hossain Chowdhury was sacked. Thursday's probe report said bank records showed the then chairman of the bank had no scope to be involved in day-to-day activities and hence Mashhud could not be charged for financial losses at the time. bdnews24.
