 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  Fresh from a first-leg win over Chittagong Mohammedan SC, title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan SC square off against their Chittagong namesake in the return-leg semi-final on Tuesday in a bid to seal a Citycell Super Cup final berth. Dhaka Mohammedan need only a draw to set up a mouth-watering final clash against Abahani on March 27. The Chittagong outfit, who require at least a 2-0 margin to see them in the final, apparently lack confidence ahead of the match. "It will be tough to beat Mohammedan tomorrow," said Chittagong coach Nazrul Islam Ledu, who had earlier claimed them favourites before the first-leg match. The Chittagong coach, however, promised to put up a spirited show. "In terms of performance on the pitch, we are no less than Mohammedan, but our real problem is not having a quality striker who can pull out the side from any situation," said the coach. Ledu said they had already achieved their target after qualifying for the semi-finals and now was focusing on a better performance to win the hearts of the spectators. On the other hand, Dhaka Mohammedan are looking to achieve a clean sweep over their opponents to ensure the final clash. "First, we took the first-leg as a quarter-final and we are considering the return-leg as a real semi-final. So we are very serious to win the match," said Dhaka Mohammedan captain Arman Aziz, who missed the first-leg match along with playmaker Enamul Haque Sharif due to suspension. No doubt, the return of Aziz and Sharif will increase the depth of Mohammedan's midfield and Chittagong coach Ledu was aware of the threat posed by their return. "Both of them are creative midfielders and so we will certainly be on the defensive," said Ledu. However, the problem for Dhaka Mohammedan is that they have no consistency and only beat Chittagong Mohammedan after a last-gasp goal from Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olaleken. bd
