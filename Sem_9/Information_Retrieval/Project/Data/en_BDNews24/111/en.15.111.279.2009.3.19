 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary body has expressed its frustration over Bangladesh's poor preparation for hosting the opening ceremony of the Cricket World Cup in early 2011. The parliamentary watchdog on the ministry of sports asked it Thursday to upgrade three stadiums for hosting the world cup matches. "The opening ceremony of the cricket world cup will take place on Feb 19, 2011. But the ministry has no practical preparation for hosting the event," Zahid Ahsan Russel, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after its first meeting at parliament. "We are frustrated. We don't have much time before the world cup." "The (state) minister (for youth and sports) also agreed with us," said Russel. "Ahad Ali Sarker said if we don't start right now, it will be impossible to host the world cup matches in time. "The committee has asked the ministry to start all preparations as soon as possible and submit a report on those," said Russel. According to the ICC's decision, Bangladesh will also host five world cup matches apart from the opening ceremony. The chairman said the committee recommended upgrade of Bangabandhu National Stadium, Sher-e Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur and Osmani Stadium in Fatullah to host the matches. "Bangladesh has got a chance to brighten her image in the international arena," said Russel. "We must utilise the opportunity." Committee members Mizanur Rahman Khan, Begum Mahbub Ara Gini, Talukder Md Touhid Jang (Murad), Md Kobirul Haq and Md Shafiqul Azam Khan attended the meeting
