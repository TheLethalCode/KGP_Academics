 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Accidents and Emergency services at Bangladesh's biggest public hospital were shut Friday night after violent reaction to death of a patient allegedly due to doctors' neglect. Angry young doctors, mostly interns, forced staff to block the entrance to the Out-patient Department at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) after some of them were allegedly assaulted by relatives of a man who died of injuries in the afternoon. They later paraded the hospital and shouted slogans, demanding resignation of the hospital director and the doctors' security. Golam Mortuza Antu, bdnews24.com staff correspondent, saw dozens of emergency patients stranded at 2am Saturday as the doctors shouted abuse. One of them, a pregnant woman, was seen lying unattended to while her relatives were on the other side of the blocked entrance. Several patients, some arriving by rickshaw, were seen leaving for other hospitals. The doctors had earlier shouted at the hospital director, Brig Gen Abdus Shahid Khan, as he asked a ward master to be the complainant of a case. They banged tables and shouted abuse at the director when he returned to the hospital around midnight after an earlier visit, during which he had agreed to demand that a criminal case be filed. They hurled insults at Serajul Islam, the ward master for Ward 30 where the patient had been treated for his injuries, for he was told by the hospital chief to file the case. The student doctors said the hospital management must file the case, get the camera used to take a picture of one of the interns and take steps to improve security. As the man, Shah Imran, 30, of Malibagh, Dhaka, died of his injuries after being hit by a falling roof of a shopping centre, his relatives blamed the attending doctors for failing to respond quickly. The relatives, according to the hospital staff, asked for the death certificate and wanted the body without autopsy. The doctor on duty rejected the request. The body was still lying in the hospital at 2:30am.
