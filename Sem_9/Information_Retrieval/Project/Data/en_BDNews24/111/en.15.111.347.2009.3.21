 Shayedul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka March 21 (bdnews24.com)Criminal investigators may take up to three months more to conclude their work as they face an unprecedented task of dealing with thousands of witnesses, says a senior police source. The source, who is familiar with the CID investigation process and cannot be named for obvious reasons, says the time will be spent in quizzing witnesses, collecting and analysing finger prints, corroborating video footages and examining evidence in preparation of the charge sheet. "It is quite a job to find out the guilty ones from 7,000 people, many of whom could be innocent," the source said Saturday. The source pointed out that the number of "direct eye witnesses" was more than 5,000. "This is the first time CID is investigating a case of this magnitude," said the source. "The number of suspected perpetrators is over a thousand." Several CID teams, including ones outside Dhaka, have been working, but "the nature and scope of the work may take another 90 days". For example, weapons and finger prints have been collected from various locations. "You have to match these with finger prints of at least 1,500 suspects." So, the source says, it would be impossible to come up with a report of any substance "if we are pressed to do it tomorrow". The CID investigators are questioning not only the suspects, but also the surviving army officers and the families. The CID, being the main investigator, alone is working to collect the evidence and build a case for prosecution in a court of law. "But since there are three inquiries being conducted, there'll be little scope for mistakes." Queried, the police officer rubbished reports in the media quoting the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents. "They have not been speaking to the media. Where did they (media) get such stories?" The officer revealed that a restriction had now been imposed on all CID officers' talking to the media. The FBI agents are basically helping CID with technology as well as advice on procedures. "They are not investigators themselves."
