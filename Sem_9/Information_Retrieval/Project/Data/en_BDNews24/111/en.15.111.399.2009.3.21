 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested wife and a relative early Saturday when angry young doctors stopped treating emergency patients at Bangladesh's biggest public hospital late Friday night after violent reaction to death of a patient allegedly due to neglect. The wife, Tropa, 29, who had lost her husband just hours earlier, was in police custody at 3:30am Saturday along with a brother in law, Ehsanul Latif Rupam, 25, police said. As demanded by the junior doctors, the director, Brig Gen Abdus Shahid Khan, himself finally filed the case. He said in his statement to police that an intern, Tania Sharmin, was assaulted by the relatives of the man, Shah Imran, 30, of Malibagh, Dhaka. As he died of his injuries Friday afternoon after being hit by a falling roof of a shopping centre, his relatives blamed the attending doctors for failing to respond quickly and save his life. The doctors, mostly interns, forced staff to block the entrance to the Emergency at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) around midnight and were still detaining the director even after the arrests of the relatives of the dead man. They had paraded the hospital shouting slogans, and besieged the director, asking him to resign. Golam Mortuza Antu, bdnews24.com staff correspondent, saw dozens of emergency patients stranded at 2am Saturday as the doctors shouted abuse. One of them, a pregnant woman, was seen lying unattended to while her relatives were on the other side of the blocked entrance. Several patients, some arriving by rickshaw, were seen leaving for other hospitals. Some 40 doctors used trolleys to put up a barricade to the Emergency entrance and were part of the group that besieged the brigadier general. The doctors had earlier hurled insults at the hospital director as he asked a ward master to be the complainant of a case. They banged tables and shouted abuse at the director when he returned to the hospital around midnight after an earlier visit, during which he had agreed to demand that a criminal case be filed. They derided Serajul Islam, the ward master for Ward 30 where the patient had been treated for his injuries, for he was told by the hospital chief to file the case. The student doctors said the hospital management must file the case, get the camera used to take a picture of one of the interns and take steps to improve security. The relatives, according to the hospital staff, had asked for the death certificate and wanted the body without any post-mortem. The doctor on duty rejected the request. The body was still lying in a hospital freezer at 3:30am.
