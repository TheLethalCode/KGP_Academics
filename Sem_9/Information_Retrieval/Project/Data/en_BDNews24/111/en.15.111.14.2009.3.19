 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)Barrister Abdur Razzaque, assistant secretary general of the Jamaat-e-Islami, has filed a contempt of court case against the government for barring him from flying abroad. Razzaque filed the case with the High Court Thursday, against the home secretary, director general of immigration, inspector general of police and officer-in-charge of airport police station. In his case statement, Razzaque said the High Court on Mar 8 directed the government, on a petition filed by the Jamaat leader himself, not to prevent him from going abroad. But on Mar 18, when he tried to travel to Singapore to see his ailing wife, immigration police at the airport barred him from flying, he said. On Mar 7, he was barred again at the airport trying to travel to Malaysia. Following a motion for more time, from attorney general Mahbubey Alam, the court determined Monday for a hearing. bdnew
