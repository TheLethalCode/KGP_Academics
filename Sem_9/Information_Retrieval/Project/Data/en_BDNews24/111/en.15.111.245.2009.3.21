<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Junaed Siddique is the lone national batsman in the list of top 10 run getters in the shorter-version game in the first-phase of the Premier Division Cricket League. The left-handed batsman, playing for Surjo Tarun, made 385 runs in 11 matches with an average of 38.5 runs to stay in the 10th position while Pakistani Shahbaz Butt stays atop with 484 runs from 11 games. However, it is pleasant to see the some youngsters, who are knocking at the door to enter into the national fold, grabbed the remaining places of the top run getters with M Mithun of Cricket Coaching School in second position to have struck 455 runs with an average of 41.36. Mithun is followed by Amit Majumdar of Victoria SC (452), Rasel Al Mamun of City Club (439), Uttam Sarker of CCS (401), Shamsur Rahman of Mohammedan (398), Shuvagato Hom of CCS (391), Rony Talukdar of Abahani (390), Arman Hossain of Victoria (385). Though the youngsters shone with their bats, the national stars continued their dismal performances in the domestic cricket too. Mehrab Hossain Jr of Old DOHS and Tamim Iqbal of Abahani occupy 14th and 15th positions with 371 and 356 runs from 11 matches. National and Gazi Tank captain Mohammad Ashraful made 258 runs in 10 outings with an average of 32.24 to stay in 36th position, three positions below national and Partex SC's wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim, scored 275 with an average of 34.37. Middle-order batsmen Naeem Islam of Gazi Tank and Roqibul Hassan of MSC scored 210 and 209 to claim the 48th and 49th position while Bangladesh Biman's Shakib Al Hasan is out of the top 50 batsmen list having scored only 185 runs with an average of 46.25. Shakib, however, missed the last six matches of the league because of a groin injury. The bowlers, however, faired better than the batmen in the prestigious league as Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Mahbubul Alam grabbed the third and fourth places after new face Abul Hasan, playing in the Premier League for the first time, surprisingly became the top-wicket taker. Hasan, playing Old DOHS, claimed 29 scalps from 10 matches, seven wickets more than second-placed spinner Saqlain Sajib of Surjo Tarun, Mashrafee of Abahani and Mahbubul of Biman. Saqlain played all 11 matches while Mashrafee, who also opted to bowl off-spin in the last two to three matches due to his back pain, and Robin played 10 and nine games respectively. Paceman Shahadat Hossain took 14 wickets from 11 matches to stay in 11th position, followed by Sajedul Islam (12 wickets), Naeem Islam (10 wickets), Mahmudullah Riad (10), Mehrab Hossain Junior (10) and Shakib Al Hasan (9). bd
