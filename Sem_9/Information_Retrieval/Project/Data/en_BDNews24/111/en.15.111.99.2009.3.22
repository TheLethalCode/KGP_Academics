 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)The government has imposed bar on travelling abroad for suspected war criminal', law minister Shafiq Ahmed said Sunday. "War crimes trials have not kicked off, but are in the process ... that's why the government has ordered some people not to leave the country," the minister told a press conference at his office. He did not give any names. The law minister also said the government wants to get the Law Commission up and running. "A chairman and two members will be appointed very soon." The commission will revise and update the country's existing laws and recommend new legislation, if necessary, said Shafiq. On the BDR mutiny case, he said that the completed investigation would show who were behind the massacre and under what law they would be tried. "Any comments before that is inappropriate."
