 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is to receive a grant of $2 million from Japan, administered by the Asian Development Bank, to tackle the huge challenges posed by climate change over the coming decades. ADB approved a technical assistance grant of US$2 million from the Japan Special Fund on Wednesday to increase the capacity of government agencies implementing a 10-year Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. The Plan addresses food security, disaster preparedness and other key issues linked to climate change. "It is essential that Bangladesh prepares to adapt to climate change and safeguard the future well being of its people," says Zahir Ahmad, Project Implementation Officer for ADB's Bangladesh mission. "ADB assistance will allow the government to implement the Strategy and Action Plan, which will put the country on a low carbon growth path, make it more climate-resilient and help strengthen its food and energy security." In recent years, the country has seen higher-than-normal temperatures, heavier monsoon rains and an increasing number of tropical cyclones and storms linked to climate change, said a statement by ADB. With temperatures expected to keep rising over coming years, it is estimated that average sea levels may rise by around 30 centimetres by 2050 and could make about 14% of the country highly vulnerable to flooding, it said. Along with increasing the capacity of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and other government agencies, support will be given to develop specific climate change mitigation and adaptation programs and projects. A sub-programme will also be put in place to attract private sector businesses and other stakeholders to invest in clean energy projects eligible for carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism. The full cost of the technical assistance is estimated at $2.5 million with the government making an in-kind contribution of $500,000. It will run for two years, starting in August 2009, with the Ministry of Environment and Forests as the executing agency. The Japan Special Fund is financed by the government of Japan and is administered by ADB.
