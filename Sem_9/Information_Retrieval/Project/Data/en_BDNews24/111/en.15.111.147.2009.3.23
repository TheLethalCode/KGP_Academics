<TITLE> ANALYSIS: Global crisis, our response </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Economist MA Taslim , CEO of Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute, writes exclusively for bdnews24.com Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh economy is being inexorably drawn into the vortex of the global downturn. The popular view that there would be little impact since Bangladesh exports mostly low-priced products has proven to be too optimistic. There are now ardent appeals for government handouts in order to avoid the more severe effects of the downturn. The government is obliging, and has already announced that a stimulus package will be forthcoming very soon, perhaps by early next month. The FBCCI has demanded a war chest of Tk 6000 crore, i.e. about one-third of the ADP, to combat the impact of the world recession. More demands for succour will certainly be made from other quarters. With shrinking growth of revenue collections and heightened expectations, this is not an ideal beginning for a newly elected government. In any crisis situation the most important thing is not to lose one's cool. Not an easy thing to do when purveyors of all kinds of scare stories attempt to spook the government into meeting their demands. Just skim through the western media reports if you need convincing! This is also a time when the donor agencies will make their angelic appearance with the promise of attractive financial assistance to tide over current miseries. The package will likely contain some policy advice in addition to financial aid. If the receiving country had resisted any particular advice in the past, this would be an ideal time to make it change its mind. A recession shows up ultimately as a diminution of aggregate demand and income. Falling income reduces aggregate demand and reduced demand causes a decline in income. Thus one feeds the other. The purpose of a fiscal stimulus package is to break this nexus by autonomously increasing demand through increased government spending and reduced taxation. Hopefully, a large increase in government spending will stimulate the economy sufficiently to encourage the private actors to invest and spend more such that a virtuous cycle of higher spending and higher income is created that will swing the economy out of the downturn. Stimulus effect The emphasis here is on large since a small package may fail to stimulate the economy sufficiently to show noticeable results. Small packages may be designed to assist particular industries or vulnerable groups without much affecting the overall economy. If the business pessimism is deep enough, even a large stimulus package may take a considerable time to take effect. The government may have to maintain the stimulus for a while for it to work; a one-off programme may not suffice. And all this while, the government will run up a debt the size of which will depend directly on the extent and nature of the stimulus package. This debt will subsequently have to be serviced. This requirement effectively sets an upper limit to the size of the package that a responsible government can or should adopt. Our economy is linked to the rest of the world through trade in goods and services, labour movement and capital flows. The initial impact of the global recession will operate through these channels. The volume of capital flows in and out of Bangladesh is small since short term portfolio capital flows are restricted, and only government capital (aid) flows and foreign direct investment are permitted. Donors have indicated that they are not likely to reduce aid, but recent data show there has been a steep decline in the volume of FDI. Thus there will be at most a small negative impact on the economy on account of reduced capital flows. During the first two quarters of this fiscal year exports of goods and services maintained a robust growth. This led to the export optimism mentioned above. However, indicative data for more recent months show a declining export trend, which is likely to become more pronounced during the fourth quarter. It is quite likely that export growth for the whole year could fall to a single digit figure, down from the average growth of about 17 per cent during the last four years. Things could get worse during the next fiscal. Much of the thrust that the export sector gives to GDP growth will be lost. This has implications for rate of employment growth and poverty alleviation, which will be reduced. Labour market fall The overseas labour market is an important source of employment and remittance income for the country. Most of our expatriate workers are employed in the countries of West Asia, UK and USA. The global recession has adversely hit all these countries in various degrees. As business declines they will economise on the use of labour. New hiring will taper off, and if the situation is bleak enough they will shed workers. Obviously the first workers to be retrenched would be the foreign workers. We are already witnessing the labour market fallout of the global recession. West Asian countries are sending back workers in droves and Malaysia has cancelled the visa of 55000 workers at one go. The situation is grim and unlikely to improve in the near future. As overseas employment declines, remittance income will eventually decline. This income, which amounted to about one-eighth of GDP during the last fiscal, is spent mostly on consumption and partly on investment. Consumption and investment of the expatriates and their families will accordingly decline. This will reduce aggregate demand of the economy that will cause a further reduction in domestic income. Investment pessimism A worrying development is the collapse in investment demand. While we do not have reliable data on investment, the trend in the import of capital machinery gives a good indication of the intention of the business community. LC opening for the import of machinery during the July-Dec 2008 declined by as much as 21 per cent from that during the corresponding period last year. The investment pessimism appears to be the deepest among the textile industries where LC opening for capital machinery has declined by 38 per cent. There has also been a substantial drop in LC opening in the garment industries. This large reduction in LC opening has occurred before the full impact of the global recession hit the economy. The entrepreneurs seem to have fairly accurately formed expectations regarding the future prospects of their respective industries and acted accordingly by reducing investment activities. Expand or tighten? Many countries are attempting to wriggle themselves out of the recession through expansionary monetary policy and fiscal stimulus packages. Monetary policy in a recessionary situation is targeted to encouraging greater investment and spending in the economy by ensuring steady credit flow, while at the same time maintaining strong financial discipline such that public confidence in the soundness of financial institutions is not shaken. Monetary policy may not work in a recession if the interest rate has already fallen to a very low level (liquidity trap syndrome). The principal instrument through which monetary policy works becomes ineffective. Fortunately, Bangladesh is not in this situation, and monetary policy still has an important role. The difficult task of reviving the economy in a recession falls mostly on fiscal policy, especially if the interest rate is already too low. USA, China, UK, Germany and other countries have already announced large fiscal packages comprising government spending, subsidies and tax cuts. The success of any fiscal package depends crucially on how it is designed and implemented. The efficaciousness of the fiscal spending will be diminished if it is allocated and executed inappropriately. Two organs of the government that are at the forefront of a determined effort to combat a recession are the treasury (Ministry of Finance) and the central bank (Bangladesh Bank). The former is responsible for fiscal policy while the latter for monetary policy. These policies must be so designed that they complement, rather than contradict each other. Balancing act Conflicts may arise since the primary objective of the central bank in most countries is to contain inflation and to maintain the integrity of the financial system. (Don't ask if the Federal Reserve or the European central banks were doing the latter!). The Ministry of Finance on the other hand is more given to raising revenue and spending it on behalf of the government with several objectives in mind including acceleration of the growth rate of the economy. These objectives are frequently in a trade-off relationship such that both cannot be always achieved simultaneously. If the government wants to spend its way to its objective, which is essentially unattainable, a conflict will appear. If the government wants to spend more than its revenue it has to borrow. If it borrows from the central bank, the monetary base increases, thereby increasing money and credit. In this event the central bank has been essentially drawn into an expansionary monetary policy, which may jeopardise its inflation objective. If on the other hand the Ministry of Finance borrows from the market, it will force up the interest rate and crowd out private investment. This is akin to a tightening of the monetary policy. The increased borrowing by the government during the first two quarters of this fiscal led to an increase in the interest rate (repo) from 8.50 to 8.75 per cent and a decrease in the growth of private sector credit from 10.37 to 7.57 per cent. Such a de facto contractionary policy has reduced the enthusiasm for private investment in the country. The growth of total investment could have also declined since much of government spending was directed to consumption. Throughout 2008 Bangladesh Bank was engaged in containing aggregate demand by dampening credit growth. It is now staring down the barrel to a recession situation. It has declared its intention to stimulate the economy by reducing the interest rate and increasing the credit limit of state owned banks. Other measures may be in the offing. The balancing of the conflicting objectives and actions requires that the two vital organs of the government, i.e. Ministry of Finance and Bangladesh Bank, have top quality leadership backed up by a very competent bureaucracy. The current practice of occasional dialogues with 'experts' may be politically expedient, but is of limited practical value. The difficult task of working out the finer details of policies must be done internally. In the end the buck must stop with the leadership. In order to be able to take the right decision the leadership, in addition to choosing the right experts, must also have a clear concept of the macroeconomic aspects of the problems and possible measures that reduce the severity of the problems. The gravity of the international and domestic situation demands that no policy mistakes are made that can amplify the recessionary impact; the costs could be too h
