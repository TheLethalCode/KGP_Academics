<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid formed an all-party parliamentary probe on Thursday to investigate charges of corruption against former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar, now running as a BNP candidate in the upcoming Bogra-6 by-election. Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Miah will head the parliamentary probe, Hamid told parliament. "Over the last few days, some MPs have raised allegations against former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar of corruption, misuse of power and wastage of public money." "So, this is the sentiment of the House that a probe committee be formed," Hamid said. However, the committee will also investigate whether Hamid himself, as speaker of the seventh parliament, resorted to any corrupt practices, he said. It will also investigate graft allegations against any officials of the parliament secretariat. This is first such move of parliament to investigate such allegations against any speaker. The other members of the committee are: chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque (BNP), Mujibul Haq Chunnu (Jatiya Party), Mainuddin Khan Badal (Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal), and AL MPs Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, ASM Feroze, Shajahan Khan, Habibur Rahman, SK Baker, Abdul Mannan and ABM Anwarul Haq. "Some opposition MPs have demanded probing the activities of all speakers since 1972," said Hamid. "But this is not possible as many of the former speakers have died. Besides, there were no specific allegations against any of them." "As Mr Sircar has mentioned my name, however, this committee will also investigate the activities of parliament secretariat under my tenure from July 12 2001 to 28 October 2001," said Hamid. The committee will file its findings by one month, the speaker said. "The report will be placed in the House." The speaker said he had also told the comptroller and auditor general to audit the finances of all parliaments since 1972 (1973). "I hope the special audit team will complete the task," he said. Opposition chief whip Farroque took floor on a point of order and sought clarification on forming a probe body especially against Sircar. "I have formed the committee as per the demand of the House in an unbiased way," Hamid told the House. The speaker announced the names of the committee members without putting it to a House vote. bdnews
