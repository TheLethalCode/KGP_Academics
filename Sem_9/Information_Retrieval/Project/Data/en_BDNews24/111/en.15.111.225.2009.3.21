 Moulavibazar, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  Extending the deadline of the government enquiry into the BDR mutiny was "mysterious", said a BNP leader on Saturday. "The government is trying to cover up the facts of the incident," said the BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah on a visit to Kulaura in Moulavibazar. The government-formed committee was originally given seven days to submit its initial findings on the mutiny; the time was later extended to Mar 19. But the report was yet to be completed on Saturday. The probe will not be hurried, nor will it be unduly delayed, said the minister in charge of coordinating post-mutiny activities earlier in the day. "Justice will be denied if the trial is delayed; on the other hand, some of the guilty may get away if the investigation is hurried," said Faruq Khan. "[So] the trial process will be started as soon as possible without hurrying the investigation," he said at a gathering in Kashiani, Gopalganj. Hannan also criticised the parliamentary probe into allegations of corruption under the tenure of former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, who is the BNP candidate in the upcoming Bogra-6 by-election. Hannan said the probe was a bid to bar Sircar from running in the election. "The government has taken the move to hook him." bdnew
