Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olalikan bailed the team out scoring the all important goal in the 89th minute with a superb header from inside the box jumping on a lob from his compatriot John Godwin from midfield. Dhaka Mohammedan, who now raised the prospect of a mouth-watering final against their arch-rivals Abahani will play the return semi-final against Chittagong Mohammedan on March 24 at the same venue. Abahani beat Brothers Union 3-2 in the first leg of other semi-final and need only draw in the second leg.
