<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  Excessive references to militancy could tarnish Bangladesh's image in the international community, having a direct negative impact on the economy, the FBCCI chief said on Monday. "We all should be aware that if there is too much talk of militancy, others might take it to be true," Annisul Huq said in a pre-budget discussion at the trade body's offices in Motijheel. He attributed the references to 'militant activity' in the country for refusal of foreign visas to two FBCCI directors. "There are also rumours in the air that the Malaysian government cancelled the work permits of 55,000 Bangladeshi workers due to militant activities here," Huq said. "I don't believe this personally, but if it is true, it's really a sad instance for us," said Huq. bdne
