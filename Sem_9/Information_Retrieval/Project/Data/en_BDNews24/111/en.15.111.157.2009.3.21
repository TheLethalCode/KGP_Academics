<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)  More than 16,000 tax-related cases are tying up revenue to the tune of Tk 6, 500 crore, the country's top taxman said on Saturday. "Some 16,372 cases are being tried or pending trial in the courts, which are cutting off revenue of Tk 6,551 crore," said Md Abdul Mazid, chairman of the National Board of Revenue. The tax chief sought assistance from the attorneys general's office, to realise the funds, in a meeting at the NBR office in Segunbagicha. "Many bigwigs remain protected from prosecution through loopholes in the law. But the government is deprived of massive amounts of revenue which cannot be released until the cases are resolved," said Mazid. Of the cases, Tk 3,112 core was tied up in some 2,023 VAT-related cases, he said. Some 12,569 cases on duty, most of them related to pre-shipping inspections, are also under trial holding up some Tk 1,739 crore. Some Tk 1,700 crore was stranded in 1,580 cases related to income tax, said Mazid. Former attorney general Mahmudul Islam said the cases were not being resolved quickly. He blamed the case-jam in courts and negligence of the tax officials. When documents were sought by the AG's office, NBR officials did not always submit them in time, delaying cases, said Islam. A workshop will be held, for taxmen and officials of the AG's office, between March 29 and April 2, on the quick resolution of the cases, said Mazid. bd
