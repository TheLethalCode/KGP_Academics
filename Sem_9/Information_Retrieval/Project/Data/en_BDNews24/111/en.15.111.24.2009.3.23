 CAPE TOWN, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Graeme Smith and Morne Morkel return to the South Africa squad for the first two one-day internationals against Australia, Cricket South Africa said on Monday. Smith will captain the side after missing the entire five-match limited-overs series in Australia in January and the third test in Cape Town which finished on Sunday. The 28-year-old opening batsman had both hands broken by Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson in separate incidents during the third test in Australia and the second test in South Africa. Fast bowler Morkel, dropped for the third test in Cape Town because of his inability to stick to a consistent line and length, has been recalled for the first two one-dayers in Durban on April 3 and Centurion on April 5. Out-of-form batsman Neil McKenzie and left-arm pace bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who is recovering from knee surgery, have been dropped. South Africa and Australia will first play two Twenty20 internationals in Johannesburg on Friday and Centurion on Sunday. "It is possible that we will add other players to the squad depending on performances in the two Pro20 matches this weekend," selection convenor Mike Procter said in a statement. South Africa overpowered Australia 4-1 in the series in January and won the third test in Cape Town by an innings. South Africa also handed Australia a 3-2 defeat in the last home one-day series after being set 435 to win the decisive match in Johannesburg. Squad - Graeme Smith, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Albie Morkel, Mark Boucher, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Hashim Amla, Vaughn van Jaarsveld, Wayne Parnell
