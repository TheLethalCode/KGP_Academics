 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)Profit-taking caused markets to finish down Wednesday for the third straight day. The DSE general index opened in an upbeat mood followed by a slump as midday's selling outpaced the day's buying. Brokerage house officials said the market witnessed buying in the opening session mainly by large-scale and institutional investors.
