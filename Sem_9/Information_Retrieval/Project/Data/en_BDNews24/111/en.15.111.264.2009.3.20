<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government probe into the BDR mutiny needs more time, but "realistic steps" will be taken to bring the accused to justice as fast as possible, says the minister in charge of coordinating all post-mutiny affairs. "The report of a neutral and transparent investigation will be published soon, making clear who were behind the incident and how they carried it out," Faruq Khan told reporters Friday. Asked why the government probe body had not submitted its report by the Thursday (Mar 19) deadline, the minister said: "The committee is taking (more) time ... the BDR incident was not a small one." Faruq did not comment when pressed on whether the accused would be tried under military law. A US-based rights group Thursday urged the Bangladesh government to try the BDR mutiny case in the country's regular courts or by special tribunal, rather than military court. Asked to respond, Faruq said. "Anyone can express their opinions in a democratic country." "But the government will take realistic steps in the speediest time to bring the accused to justice." A government-formed committee was originally given seven days to submit its findings on the mutiny; the time was later extended to Mar 19. Commerce minister Faruq Khan was speaking to reporters after attending a programme at Shishu Academy to mark the World Children's Theatre Day. bd
