 ETROIT,Thu Mar 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Package delivery giant and economic bellwether FedEx Corp reported a 75 percent drop in profit due to the global recession, gave a low quarterly outlook and said it was taking fresh actions to cut costs. "Our financial performance was sharply lower during the quarter due to the global recession," Chief Executive Fred Smith said in a statement on Thursday. "While we are gaining market share in all of our transportation segments, the downturn in our industry and the severity and expected duration of the recession require that we take additional actions." The Memphis-based company reported net income for its fiscal third quarter, ended February 28, of $97 million, or 31 cents a share, down from $393 million, or $1.26 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 46 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "FedEx's results are not much of a surprise given the current environment," said Dan Ortwerth, a research analyst at Edward Jones. "But this is a wake-up call for us that things are not going to get better any time soon." "It's a fairly clear indication that the recent stock market rally better have a strong foundation than merely a positive near-term outlook," he added. Like its main rival, Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx is considered a bellwether of U.S. economic activity. When the economy does well, companies and consumers ship more goods; in a recession, package volumes drop. FedEx said third-quarter revenue fell 14 percent to $8.14 billion. For the current quarter FedEx said it expects to earn between 45 cents to 70 cents a share, below the average of 72 cents expected by analysts. The company said it was cutting capacity at its FedEx Express and FedEx Freight units, and reducing personnel and work hours. FedEx said the measures would result in fourth-quarter charges of roughly $100 million and lead to a reduction in expenses of about $1 billion in its 2010 fiscal year. In December, the company said it had suspended paying matching contributions to its 401 (k) retirement plan for a minimum of one year starting February 1 and would implement pay cuts for all salaried personnel. Smith took a 20 percent pay cut. "Our goal when we implemented compensation reductions in January for U.S. salaried personnel was to both protect our business and minimize the loss of jobs," the CEO said. "With industrial production and global trade trends worsening since last quarter, we are applying these additional measures to continue to secure as many of our jobs as possible during this downturn." Both FedEx and UPS have seen package volumes hit by the downturn. Deutsche Post unit DHL shut down its US domestic service in January with the loss of 9,500 jobs, citing the economic slump and its inability to take market share in a market dominated by FedEx and UPS. Edward Jones analyst Ortwerth said while FedEx's results reflected the recession, one positive sign was that the company is still taking market share. "In a sense these are good times for FedEx," he said. "I'm not worried about them because they work well in downturns." In premarket trade FedEx shares were down more than 4 percent at $41.30. UPS shares were down more than 3 percent at $4
