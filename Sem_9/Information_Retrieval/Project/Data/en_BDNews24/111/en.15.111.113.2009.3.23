<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)The BDR chief, Brig Gen Moinul Islam, will lead the efforts to reform and reorganise Bangladesh's border force. A three-hour meeting, chaired by commerce minister Faruq Khan, coordinator of post-mutiny affairs, decided on Monday that a new frontier force would be formed with a new name. "A seven-member committee headed by the BDR chief will be constituted to implement the decision," Faruq Khan told a news conference. The minister said: "There were over 7,000 BDR men at Peelkhana on the day of the massacre." "Of them, 1,800 members did not report back after the mutiny. Many fled with weapons and ammunition." "Some 714 suspects have been identified and 482 were arrested. Eighty are being interrogated in remand." He said that audio tapes of the Darbar Hall incident and video footage, caught on CCTV, of the looting of weapons and stores were available. The minister refused to speculate on the number of weapons looted. "There are 24 armouries in the headquarters, with huge quantities of arms and ammunition. We do not have the required manpower at the moment to determine exactly how many are missing. "It will take time." Asked on his assertions about "militant connections" to the mutiny, he said he got the information from his own sources. He said he had talked with a number of people inside the headquarters and that he had not got it from any of the investigators. From now on, he said, the BDR relatives will be allowed to meet only "if they can prove it's an emergency". On the students' appeal to allow them to take their educational materials or papers from their homes inside the BDR compound, Faruq said they would have to approach at the Gate no. 4 with proof to get those. In the last few days, the minister said, three BDR members and an Imam of the BDR mosque died inside the Peelkhana that a rights organisation alleged "deaths in custody". Of the four deaths in Dhaka headquarters, Faruq claimed one BDR member committed suicide and two other members died of "physical illness" and the Imam died of cardiac arrest. Outside Dhaka, he said, one member committed suicide in Joypurhat and two more died of "physical illness". The minister added: "The frontiers are well protected since officers and jawans in border areas returned to their battalions and sector headquarters." BDR director general Brig Gen Moinul Islam, investigators including heads of probe committees and other officials were present at Monday's meeting. bdnews2
