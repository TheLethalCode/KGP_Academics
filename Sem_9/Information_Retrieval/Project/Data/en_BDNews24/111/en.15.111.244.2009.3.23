 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet approved Monday the revised National Hajj Policy and Hajj Package for the current year, an official said. The cabinet also approved cultural practices of different indigenous groups in Bangladesh. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said according to the new law of the Saudi government, international passports will be required for the pilgrims instead of Hajj pass. Under the new rule, pilgrims at Mecca will have accommodation at four square metres instead of 3.5 while in Medina it will be 5.5 square metres instead of 4.5, Azad added Along with the additional accommodation for pilgrims, the Saudi government requires a bank guarantee of fifty rials against each pilgrim. Besides, he said, there is directive on transportation for pilgrims staying 2 kilometres away from the Harem Sharif. This year a pilgrim will have to spend Tk 220 550 for the pilgrimage. The cabinet also approved Indigenous Cultural Body Act 2009 embodying distinctiveness of ethnic groups. Under the law, ethnic cultural organisations will be able to acquire their movable and immovable properties and keep them at their disposal. Besides, there will be arrangements to bring all ethnic groups into the mainstream of society, Azad further said quoting the law. The cabinet provisionally approved Fish Hatchery Act 2009.
