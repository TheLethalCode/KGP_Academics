 Rajshahi, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com)A Rajshahi court sentenced seven JMB men to life on Sunday for exploding two bombs in the city as part of the countrywide serial bombings on August 17 2005. Rajshahi Divisional Special Judge Md Motajidur Rahman convicted them of the bombings in the city's Motihar area, at Rajshahi University's Kazla Gate and RUET's main gate. The seven life convicts are: Tariqul Islam, Shafiullah Tarique, Abu Isa, Hasan Ali, Jahangir Alam, Arif (also known as Alal) and Enamul Haque Moni. The judge also fined them Tk 20,000 each or two more years rigorous imprisonment on failure to pay. All except the fugitive Moni appeared in court Sunday. The case was filed under the Explosives Act with Motihar police immediately after the 2005 blasts. Charges were pressed on June 3 2006 against the seven members of the disbanded militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh. Forty witnesses testified in the trial. JMB leaders Shayakh Abdur Rahman, Siddikul Islam Bangla Bhai and Abdul Awal were also originally accused in the case, but their names were later dropped after their executions in separate cases. bdn
