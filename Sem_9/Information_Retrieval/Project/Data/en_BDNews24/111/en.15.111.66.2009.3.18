<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com) - Both Abahani and Brothers Union will be looking to take a step closer to the Citycell Super Cup final by winning the first-leg semi-final on Thursday. The big game will get underway at 5:00pm with Bangladesh Television telecasting the match live from the Bangabandhu National Stadium. B. League champions Abahani are considered the favourites in the cash-rich tournament with their winning streak in 12 matches -- nine of B. League. However, Brothers Union are believed to be a tough hurdle for the Sky Blues if the All Oranges can keep their momentum what they showed against Dhaka Mohammedan SC in the final robin-round match two days back. Abahani captain Nazrul Islam said that the general feeling among the players was to maintain the winning run and they all were mentally and physically ready for the first of two semi-finals. "We know it very well that a win in the first semis means to get closer to the final and the focus is only on the first semi-final and we hope something good can come out of this sort of approach," said the Abahani captain Nazrul Islam at a pre-match briefing at BFF House on Wednesday. Abahani's Jahid Hasan Emily and Nigerian Emeka Christian are considered the best attacking-pair and already proved it with Emeka having found the target five times in three matches. Brothers captain Amit Khan Shuvro also agreed the fact and was getting inspiration from their B. League first-leg 2-0 win over Abahani, who, however, beat the Gopibagh-based outfit in the second leg of the professional football league. "No doubt, the Emily-Emeka pair is threatening for any side, but we would love to remember that we routed them in the B. League without conceding a goal as we negotiated both of them well," said Shuvo. Brothers' backline is comprised of Arup Kumar, Shuvo, Ariful Islam, Atiqur Rahman Mishu, the last three national defenders and it is probably going to be a battle between Brothers defenders and Abahani strikers. Midfielders Arif Khan Joy, Mamunul Islam, Abul Hossain and Ghanaian Awudu Ibrahim are instrumentals behind Emily and Emeka of Abahani, whose backline is equally tough that includes national stalwarts Mohammad Sujan, Wali Faisal and Nazrul Islam and Ghanaian Samad Yousuf. But, it may be a warning for Abahani as Brothers Union are getting sharper as the tournament progressed and Brothers should have won against Mohammedan, but unfortunately they had to be satisfied with a 1-1 draw for their toothless attack. Brothers' midfielders Motiur Munna, Shakil Ahmed, Hasan Imam Riko, promising Jahid Hossain had yielded a lot of opportunities against Mohammedan, but their strikers could not take of those home. "To be frank, we have a weak attack, but I think it doesn't matter if all of players can give their hundred percent effort on the pitch," said a confident Shuvo. He also said that their hundred percent was yet to come and waiting for that sort of performance against Abahani. If Brothers can provide their hundred percent effort, no doubt there will be a classic match on cards. bd
