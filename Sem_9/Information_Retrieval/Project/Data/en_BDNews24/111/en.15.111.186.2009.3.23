 MILAN, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan took another big step towards retaining their Serie A title with an easy 3-0 win over bottom side Reggina on Sunday. Midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, playing as an emergency centre back, clipped home after six minutes following Dejan Stankovic's clever flick before Zlatan Ibrahimovic slotted in a penalty. Sweden striker Ibrahimovic then netted his 19th of the league season with a perfect chip to leave Jose Mourinho's side close to a fourth straight scudetto. Inter have a seven-point lead over second-placed Juventus, who sparkled in a 4-1 win at depleted AS Roma on Saturday. Nine games remain in the season including Juve at home to Inter on April 18. AC Milan, in third, trail Inter by 14 points after drawing 0-0 at Napoli in an action-packed late match. Mid-table Napoli, playing their first home game under the stewardship of former Milan winger Roberto Donadoni, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside in the first half when Marek Hamsik turned in Marcelo Zalayeta's header. Midfielder Daniele Mannini started for the hosts after the Court of Arbitration for Sport last week lifted his one-year suspension for arriving late for a doping test. Genoa earlier stayed ahead in the race for the fourth Champions League spot with a 2-0 home win over Udinese while fifth-placed Fiorentina, two behind, beat Siena 1-0. Reggina, from the southern city of Reggio Calabria, remained six points adrift of safety despite the defeat by Inter after fourth-bottom Bologna lost 1-0 at home to Cagliari. Third-bottom Torino stayed two behind Bologna after Giampaolo Pazzini and Antonio Cassano scored one apiece in Sampdoria's 3-1 win at former Samp boss Walter Novellino's side. Fellow strugglers Lecce drew 2-2 at home with Atalanta but Chievo moved six clear of trouble after a 1-0 win over Palermo
