<TITLE> Australia's Clark to join Kent before Ashes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia fast bowler Stuart Clark will join English county Kent as their overseas player until the beginning of June, the club said on Tuesday. Clark, missing Australia's current tour of South Africa due to an elbow injury, will get the chance to prove he deserves a place in the squad to face England in the Ashes starting in July. "Stuart is a tremendous character and has a great record. He is a genuine wicket-taker and will bring a great amount to the side," Kent chairman of cricket Graham Johnson told the club's website (www.new.kent-ccc.co.uk). Clark claimed 26 wickets in Australia's 5-0 whitewash of England in the last Ashes series in 2006-07. "I realised I had to get some cricket under my belt before the Ashes; that is one of the reasons for me going over there," Clark, 33, told the Sydney Morning Herald. "(Australia selectors) are going to choose the top three fast bowlers for the team, and I think I have done enough with my time in the test team. I feel personally that I am one of those top three at full fitness. I am feeling as fit as I ever have.
