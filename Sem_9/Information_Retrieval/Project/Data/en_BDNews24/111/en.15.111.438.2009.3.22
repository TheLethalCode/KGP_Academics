 KUNDUZ, Afghanistan Sun Mar 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US forces said five Afghans killed in a military operation in north Afghanistan on Sunday were militants, not civilians working for a district mayor, as reported by Afghan police officials. Civilian casualties are the biggest source of tension between Afghans and foreign forces in Afghanistan, which number around 70,000 and are expected to increase by additional 17,000 US troops in the coming months.
