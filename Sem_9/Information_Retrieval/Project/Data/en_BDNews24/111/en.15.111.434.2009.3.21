 Ottawa, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roadside bombs killed four Canadian soldiers as well as a local interpreter in Afghanistan on Friday, Canadian Brigadier-General Jonathan Vance said. Vance, who commands the 2,800 Canadian soldiers in southern Afghanistan, told reporters in remarks televised in Canada that two bombs went off within hours of each other and also wounded eight Canadian soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. Canada has now lost 116 soldiers and one diplomat in Afghanistan since deploying troops there in 2002.
