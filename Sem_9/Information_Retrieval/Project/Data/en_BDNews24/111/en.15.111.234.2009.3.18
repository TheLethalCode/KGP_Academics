 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has raised questions about the 'coordinator' of investigations into the BDR mutiny, saying comments by Faruq Khan were "influencing" the probes. "The government has politicised the matter by employing a politician and minister as 'coordinator' even though there are heads of the three probes," he told a briefing at the party chairperson's Gulshan office Wednesday. "What is his role as coordinator?" Delwar asked. The government on March 11 appointed commerce minister Faruq Khan as coordinator of the various inquiries into the Feb 25-26 carnage at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. "He is influencing the investigation by making comments one after another before coming any report has been issued," said Delwar on Wednesday. He reiterated BNP's demand for a "proper investigation" into the BDR massacre. "Any kind of politicisation of the investigation is not acceptable. "The comments by the coordinator make the people think the government is trying to influence the course of the investigation according to its will. "But people want to know the real facts and scenario of the mutiny. Such a massacre may not be prevented again in future if the investigation is not neutral now," said Delwar. He said his party believed that the sincerity of the government in investigating the mutiny had become questionable through confining terms of reference and appointing biased people. The BNP leader also presented the concerns of the party's standing committee from in Monday night's meeting. The party's highest policy-making body expressed concern over the existing disorder in the civil administration. "The administration has come to a standstill through the government's partisan attitude, the standing committee observed." The committee also asked the government to be more active in handling the global recession. It demanded action to overcome shortages of textbooks, gas, water and power, said Delwar. "The standing committee also called for curbing the spiralling rate of essentials and maintaining law and order." Delwar alleged the opposition was not allowed to play its role in the parliament. "The standing committee has expressed grievances over such activities of the government." "Both the government and the speaker have made parliament the centre of baseless publicity against the opposition," he said. The standing committee was also troubled about the activities of the Anticorruption Commission, the BNP leader said. The graft watchdog had turned into a non-functional institution and was working as the "government's puppet", he said. The ACC were trying to be loyal to the government by filing false and baseless cases against opposition leaders and supporters, he said. On standing committee member Chowdhury Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky's being ousted from the party in Monday's meeting, Delwar said: "As he is an honourable person he has been relieved of his party post." "The word 'expulsion' is used only in extreme cases." b
