<TITLE> Russel in Plate final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Russel KC moved into the Plate final of the Citycell Super Cup with a 5-3 tiebreaker win over Chittagong Abahani at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. The match rolled into the tie-breaker after extra-time remained unsettled following a 1-1 draw in the regulation 90-minute first semi-final of the meet, a tournament for the bottom four teams who failed to qualify for the Cup phase. Moroccan midfielder Rachidi, Bulbul, Mahmudul Hasan, Serbian Milunovic and Alfaz Ahmed converted their spot kicks for Russel, who were ousted from the top fray after being beaten by Dhaka Abahani and Chittagong Mohammedan in the group-phase matches. Chittagong Abahani's Imon first shot his spot kick outside the target to give Sheikh Russel the advantage. Later, Othelo, Saidul and Millar converted, but could not avert the defeat. Veteran Alfaz Ahmed, who was not seen in the group-phase matches, put Sheikh Russel ahead eight minutes into the second half, though the striker was deprived of a certain goal when he shot off the Abahani crossbar in the half hour of first-half play. Sheikh Russel, who finished third in Group A, looked shaky against Group B bottom finishers Chittagong Abahani, who comparatively controlled the game and came close to a lead in the 10th minute with Liberian forward Joseph Fullo hitting the sidebar. After squandering two good opportunities, Joseph Romeo levelled the Abahani margin seven minutes from time as the Liberian capitalised a fumble from Russel's defender Rachidi to drive the ball home in the 83rd minute. bdnew
