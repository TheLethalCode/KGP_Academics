 KUWAIT, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kuwait's ruler dissolved the Gulf Arab state's parliament Wednesday, calling for elections within two months to end a long-running political crisis, a move that could speed up approval of a $5 billion stimulus package. The second dissolution of parliament in a year could allow the government to pass an economic rescue plan by decree before the elections, but a row with the assembly might flare up again as Islamists are expected to dominate again. Lawmakers said Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah was expected to appoint his brother, Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, as new prime minister after the vote. Kuwait's ruler did not reveal his plans for the premiership after accepting the resignation of the cabinet led by his nephew Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah, Monday. Nasser's earlier cabinet resigned in November after a similar row. The ruler, who has the last say in the OPEC country, did not say when the vote would be held but under the constitution it has to be within two months, state news agency KUNA said. The emir said he had been forced to act because of lawmakers' "failure to abide by the constitution and law." Islamist and some liberal deputies have been harrying ministers with questions over that past three years, which have seen five cabinets come and go, many preferring to resign rather than face extensive questioning or a no-confidence vote. The crisis reflects an underlying conflict between the pro-Western government and Islamist members of parliament who wanted to question the caretaker prime minister on his management of an economic crisis and alleged misuse of public funds. Although no official appointment has been announced, the crown prince was seen as the next prime minister. "Sheikh Nawaf has agreed but has not been appointed yet," one MP told Reuters. "The crown prince has accepted. It's most likely he will be appointed," another MP said, citing sources close to the ruling family. The crisis has delayed economic reforms, including the stimulus plan to deal with the global economic crisis, which includes bank guarantees to help the battered financial sector. The caretaker government could issue the stimulus package without parliament and some analysts say the next assembly would then approve it since implementation would have started. Others say parliamentary approval should not be taken for granted and that MPs could respond to being bypassed by approving by-laws that affect the way legislation is implemented. NO END IN SIGHT Monica Malik, a regional economist at investment bank EFG-Hermes, said new elections and the appointment of the crown prince would improve the situation but difficulties would continue as parliament would be dominated by Islamists again. "Consequently, we believe the government will last longer than it has over the last year, although there will still be difficulties in the relationship as the government will broadly remain reformist on the economic front," she said. Ahead of Wednesday's decision, Kuwaiti shares rose one percent Wednesday on hopes that the Islamist-dominated assembly might be dissolved and the political crisis ended. Kuwaiti members of parliament have a history of challenging the government. They have opposed many government plans to open up the economy and scale back a welfare state seen as an obstacle to expanding the private sector. The emir dissolved parliament in March 2008 to end a similar crisis but to no avail. In December, the cabinet canceled a $17 billion joint-venture with Dow Chemical, less than a month after signing it, after some MPs opposed the deal
