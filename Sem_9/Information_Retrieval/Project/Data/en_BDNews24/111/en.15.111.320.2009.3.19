<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Thu Mar 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's government asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to review a ruling last month that banned opposition leaders from elected office and sparked a political crisis. The government, faced with huge protests, had last week offered to appeal against the court ruling which barred former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his politician brother, Shahbaz, from elected office. It also agreed to reinstate a Supreme Court chief dismissed in 2007 to stop a "long march" by lawyers. "We have requested the court to review the order in the interest of constitutionalism and the rule of law," Attorney General Latif Khosa told Reuters, adding the government hoped the court would begin its review on Friday. The request was a big step towards dispelling mistrust between the countries' two biggest parties which have a record of fierce rivalry. The Sharifs said President Asif Ali Zardari was behind the Feb. 25 ruling, that was based on old convictions they say were politically motivated, and joined in the anti-government protest campaign in open confrontation. Zardari's spokesman denied that he had anything to do with the Supreme Court's decision. The lawyers' "long march" protest threatened to plunge the nuclear-armed country into violent turmoil, and distract the government from fighting Islamist militancy and reviving an economy propped up by the International Monetary Fund. The United States wants Pakistan to redouble its efforts to eliminate militant enclaves on the Afghan border, from where al Qaeda and Taliban insurgents orchestrate the war in Afghanistan. The Supreme Court ruling nullified a by-election victory by Shahbaz Sharif and disqualified him from holding the office of chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous and politically influential province. The Sharif party's government was thrown out of power in the province and Zardari imposed central rule there for two months. The ruling enraged the Sharifs and stiffened their resolve to support the protest by anti-government lawyers campaigning for the reinstatement of Supreme Court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. The government agreed on Monday to reinstate the judge in a surprise move to defuse the crisis and end the protest by lawyers and opposition activists. Pakistani stocks have risen strongly since Monday, and ended 2.79 percent up on Thursday, although with tension lingering between Zardari and the Sharifs, dealers say investors should be cautious as the politics plays
