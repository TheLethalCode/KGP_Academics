"I don't know if Beckham will allow me to reveal it eventuallybut it is incredible what he has done to stay at Milan," chief executive Adriano Galliani told reporters on Saturday. "Nothing like that has happened to me in 23 years as a club director. It more than stunned me." Galliani called for a salary cap earlier in the week and said that a "wind of crisis" was blowing through the English and Spanish top flights as well as in Serie A.

"This is more than certain.
