<TEXT>
 Jamalpur, March 21 (bdnews24.com)  No innocent border guards will face harassment or become victims of the BDR mutiny investigations, the BDR chief pledged again on Saturday. Director general of the border force, Brig Gen Moinul Islam, said action would be taken against those responsible for the Peelkhana carnage. "But we are also taking all precautions so that no innocent jawan is victimised. All border guards have been sent written statements in this regard," said Gen Moinul at an exchange of views at BDR's Jamalpur parade ground. He said Bangladesh Rifles would be reconstituted very soon with a new name to protect the reputation of the thousands of honest BDR soldiers who were not involved in the Feb 25-26 massacre. "The BDR has lost trust after the mutiny. The border force will have to rebuild that trust," he said. The BDR chief had earlier visited the Mymensingh sector headquarters. bdnews2
