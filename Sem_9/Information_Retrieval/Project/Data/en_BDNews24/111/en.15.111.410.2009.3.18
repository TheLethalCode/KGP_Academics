 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)The government will start selling cheaper rice to 30 lakh garment workers from May 1 as textile exporters reel under the global financial meltdown, the labour minister says. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said Wednesday after a meeting with a BGMEA delegation that they would sell the staple to workers, mostly women, at Tk 18 a kg against the retail price of Tk 24. BGMEA gave a list of 30 lakh garments workers to the food ministry for allotment of rice for them under Open-Market Sale programme. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi, who led a 32-strong delegation to the meeting with the minister, also said the government wanted a list of garments workers and they submitted it.

The minister said he asked the prime export industry to work through coordination between owners, workers and managements. b
