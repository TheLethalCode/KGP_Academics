<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Defender Daniel Alves said he had made a big leap forward in his career by moving to Barcelona from Sevilla and he would like to see out his playing days with the Primera Liga leaders. "I am thinking of making my life at Barca and if they carry on treating me as well as they are now I'd like to hang up my boots here," the Brazilian said on the club's website (www.fcbarcelona.com). Barca captain Carles Puyol is still recovering from an ankle injury, the club said, and is unlikely to feature against sixth-placed Malaga at the Nou Camp on Sunday (1800 GMT). The Spain international twisted ligaments in the 2-0 home win over Athletic Bilbao earlier this month. Malaga forward Alberto Luque said coach Antonio Tapia had told the players they need to score at least two goals if they are to beat Barca. "This is the season for heroic deeds and exceeding expectations that we never even imagined," he said on the club's website (www.malagacf.com). Real Madrid midfielder Wesley Sneijder said he had put a poor run of form behind him and was fully focused on helping the champions try to cut Barcelona's six-point lead, starting on Sunday at home to Almeria (1600). "It's still early to say that I'm back but I am feeling very good," the Dutch international said on the club's website (www.realmadrid.com). "We have to win all our remaining (11) matches and beat Barcelona when they come here as well." Villarreal striker Joseba Llorente said he had shaken off a knee problem and should be fully fit for the fourth-placed club's match at home to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday (1900). "We can't drop any more points at home because soon all the teams that are at the top of the table are coming here," he said on the club's website (www.villarrealcf.es). "Recently we have been strong at home and we have to keep that going." Struggling Valencia may be boosted by the return of top scorer David Villa for Sunday's match at in-form Racing Santander (1600) as they seek to climb back into the European qualification places from eighth. "We are hopeful," coach Unai Emery said at a news conference. Spain international Villa is recovering from a knee injury and Emery's side have not won a match since Feb. 1
