 MILAN, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A joint top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic added fuel to speculation he could leave Inter Milan for a club with better Champions League prospects by saying he would consider his future at the end of the season.

For now I'm concentrating on winning this championship," the 27-year-old told Rai television when asked about his future. The tall and skilful frontman was voted 2008 Italian players' player of the year but, like his team, has often failed to rise to the occasion in European competition. The former Ajax and Juventus forward, who hit the bar in the 2-0 defeat at United in the Champions League last 16, has scored 19 goals in Serie A this season. The Italian champions would do all they can to keep him with coach Jose Mourinho continually singing the striker's praises, although he added a caveat on Sunday. "He is a really great player, but no footballer is bigger than a club," Mourinho said. "Ibra has become a great player at Inter but certain clubs are bigger than players and coaches.
