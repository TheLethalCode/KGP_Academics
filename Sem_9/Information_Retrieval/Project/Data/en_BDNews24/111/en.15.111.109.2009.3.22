 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)The four top administrators of Bangabandu Sheikh Mujib Medical University quit their posts on Sunday, citing 'personal reasons'. Vice-chancellor Prof Nazrul Islam, pro vice-chancellors Chowdhury Ali Kawser and Mohammad Kamal and treasurer Ruhil Amin Miah, appointed during the past caretaker government regime, faxed their resignation letters to the health secretary in the afternoon. One of the four, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that the resignations came on orders from health minister AFM Ruhul Haq and pressure from a ruling party-backed doctors' alliance. "The minister advised the vice-chancellor to resign but asked him not mention it." Islam told bdnews24.com Sunday: "We resigned for personal reasons." But he also mentioned that the Awami League-backed doctors' alliance at BSMMU had recently "pressed certain demands". "I refused to meet the demands as they were not according to the rules," said the VC. Islam said members of the doctors' alliance claimed to be "part of the government" and that he had to abide by their demands. "Otherwise, they told me, I would not be able to remain in this office ... I told them I don't want to stay in office that way." Some BSMMU staff have said the doctors' alliance pressed a list of names on to the VC for appointments to vacant posts at the hospital. bdn
