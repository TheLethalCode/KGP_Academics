<TITLE> Teen pregnancy up in the US </TITLE>

 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)Teenage pregnancy in the United States has risen for a second year in a row, a new study has found, putting one of the nation's most successful social and public health campaigns in jeopardy. According to a study released by the National Center for Health Statistics on Wednesday, birth rate among 15-to-19-year-olds rose 1.4 percent from 2006 to 2007, continuing a climb that began a year earlier. The rate jumped 3.4 percent from 2005 to 2006, reversing what had been a 14-year decline. "We've now had two years of increases," said Stephanie Ventura of the NCHS. "We may have reached a tipping point. It's hard to know where it's going to go from here", she told the Washington Post about the rise in teen pregnancy. The reasons for the increase remain unclear, although experts speculated that it could be a result of growing complacency about AIDS and teen pregnancy, among other factors. The rise may also reflect a broader trend that affects all age groups, because birth rates have also increased among women in their 20s, 30s and 40s and older unmarried women. The increase raised concerns across the ideological spectrum and fueled an intense debate over federal funding for sex-education programs that focus on encouraging abstinence until marriage. Opponents and proponents are girding for a new round in the battle over funding of abstinence education when President Obama reveals within weeks whether he will seek to continue or cut that funding. "This is certainly not the time to remove any strategy that is going to provide skills for teens to avoid sex," said Valerie Huber of the National Abstinence Education Association. But opponents said the findings provide new evidence that the approach is ineffective and that the money should be shifted to programs that include educating young people about contraceptives -- efforts that have been shown to be highly effective. "The United States can no longer afford to fund failed abstinence-only programs," said James Wagoner of the group Advocates for Youth. Abstinence programs had been receiving about $176 million in federal funding each year, but Congress cut about $14 million from the current budget. White House spokesman Reid Cherlin called the new numbers "highly troubling." "President Obama is committed to reducing the number of unintended pregnancies in this country, and we are reviewing these programs as part of the budget process," he said. The teen birth rate rose sharply from 1986 to 1991, leading to a widespread campaign that caused teenage sexual activity and births to decrease. But a long decline in teenage sexual activity appeared to level off in 2001, and teen births increased in 2005. Experts were uncertain, however, whether the rise represented a one-year aberration or the beginning of a trend. The latest data, from an annual analysis of birth certificates nationwide, found that while the birth rate among girls ages 10 to 14 remained unchanged, the overall rate for those ages 15 to 19 rose again, from 41.9 births per 1,000 to 42.5. While the national increase from 2005 to 2006 occurred across all ethnic groups, the trends between 2006 and 2007 were not uniform. The birth rate increased 2 percent among whites and Asians and 1 percent among blacks, but it decreased 2 percent among Hispanics. The mixed statistics and modest increase raised the odds that the two years of increases could be a statistical blip, Ventura said. But other experts said the two-year data probably represent a trend and fit with other research showing a stall in the long drop in sexual activity among teenagers, as well as a decrease in condom use. "I think it's a real trend," said John Santelli of Columbia University, who studies teenage sexual behavior. "It's a huge disappointment and a huge failure in public policy to see this reverse itself." One contributing problem may be teenagers having repeat pregnancies, said Margaret Rodan of Georgetown University, who directs the research project GirlTalk, which tracks first-time teenage mothers and pairs them with counselors who help them set goals, do better in school and space their next pregnancy. The economy also may be at work in the rise in teen births, said Lee Beers, director of the Healthy Generations Program at Children's National Medical Center. "Teen pregnancy is not an issue in isolation," she said. When families are stressed by economic forces, parental communication and supervision may decline, which in turn may have an effect, s
