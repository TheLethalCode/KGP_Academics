 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  Parliament ratified the caretaker government's trademark ordinance, with some revisions, on Wednesday, clearing way for Bangladesh to enter the World Trade Organisation. Bangladesh also had obligations to ratify the law as a signatory to the Paris Convention, and Trade Related Aspect and Intellectual Property Rights Agreement. The Trademark (Revised) Ordinance-2009 was placed before the House on Feb. 28, which sent it to the standing committee on the industries ministry for review. The cabinet had given a final approval in principle on Feb. 25. MPs Wednesday rejected the proposal to send the law again to a review committee for scrutiny, by voice vote, passing it through parliament. The Law Commission formulated the draft 'Trademark (Revised) Ordinance-2009 integrating the Trademarks Act-1940 and Merchandise Marks Act-1989. The Trademark Ordinance-2008 was revised in line with the decision of Bangladesh Better Business Forum. The advisory council of the past caretaker government finally approved the Trademark Ordinance-2008 on Jan 6, 2008. The president approved the ordinance on Jan. 12 and the government gazetted it on Feb 14. The law took effect on July 1 last year. The present government formulated a new bill to ratify the law to ensure business-friendly environment and meet constitutional obligations. bdn
