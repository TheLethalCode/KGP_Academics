<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  Striker Jahid Hasan Emily slammed two goals in two minutes to rescue Abahani with a thrilling 3-2 win over Brothers Union in the first of two semi-final meetings of the Citycell Super Cup on Thursday. Before a brace from Emily, Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim gave Abahani a 15-minute lead while Henry Quaye and Shakil Ahmed struck one goal each in each half for Brothers at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The crucial triumph not only put the Sky Blues a step closer to the final, but also stretched their winning run to 14 matches in front of a 12,000-strong crowd at the big bowl. Favourites Abahani will face Brothers Union in the return-leg semi-final on March 23. Both sides got off to a cautious start and the game ran smoothly till the first 18 minutes before referee Taybed Hasan seemingly made a blinder to destroy the tempo of the high-voltage encounter. Hasan apparently ignored a penalty claimed by Brothers, who then were one goal down, as Abahani stopper Wali Faisal handled a ball inside the box that stirred up a little trouble in the galleries and play was stopped for five minutes. Brothers, however, returned to the pitch and levelled in the 42nd minute with Henry cancelling Awudu's strike as the Abahani players appeared disheartened rather than Brothers. Picking a ball from Emily, Awudu suddenly drove a dipping shot from the left that found the Brothers far post with goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman standing at the near post having nothing to do rather than seeing the ball enter the net in the 15th minute. Brothers then threatened twice to level the margin inside a minute, but both efforts, one from Henry and other by Atiqur Rahman Mishu, were drifting away. The Gopibagh-based outfit then found the equaliser three minutes from the breather when a midfielder Hasan Imam Rikto drive was blocked by a stretching goalkeeper Biplob, but an unmarked Henry fired the follow-up home from close. After resumption, Brothers enjoyed the majority of ball possession and stepped up their attacks. Two efforts from Ariful Islam and Jahid Hasan went narrowly wide before Shakil made the Brothers margin 2-1, capitalising on fumble by defender Nazrul Islam, who could have cleared the ball easily, but he deposited the ball to Shakil's feet inside the danger zone. Shakil's changed his foot to take the ball to his left before lashing a powerful shot to the near post to give Brothers a deserved lead. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen brought speedy midfielder Jahed Parvez Chowdhury and holding midfielder Pranotosh in the place of Abul Hossain and Arif Khan, but they had hardly any impact on the pitch before Emily showed a glimpse of his skill to rescue Abahani. With 10 minutes left, Abahani appeared dead and buried, but national striker Emily somehow found the back of the net twice in two minutes. Wali Faisal whipped a cross from the left for Emily, who rose high to head the spot kick home to make things exciting in the 80th minute. One minute later, Awudu Ibrahim flicked a clever lob and Emily darted into the box to drive the ball past advancing goalkeeper Zia. bd
