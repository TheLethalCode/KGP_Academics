 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com) - A High Court bench gave a split judgement Thursday on a bail petition by ex-Awami League MP Joynal Hazari, who has been earlier convicted and sentenced to different jail terms in five separate cases. Senior bench judge Syed AB Mahmudul Huq on ordered Hazari to surrender to trial court within eight weeks. According to the order, the defendant will sign the surrender papers in court custody and then return to the High Court for the bail hearing without being sent to jail. The other bench judge, Moinul Islam Chowdhury, dismissed the bail petition outright and ordered the defendant to surrender to the lower court immediately. Hazari has been sentenced to life in one of three arms cases and seven years each in two other cases. He has also been sentenced to ten years and three years for amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth information from the ACC. The same HC bench gave split judgements on Feb 23 on bail petitions of VIPs, including former communication minister Anwar Hossain Manju, Awami League leaders Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Mokbul Hossain, Hajee Selim and M Mohiuddin, BNP's Nadim Mostafa, Babul Chowdhury and Abul Bashar. The petitions have been sent to the chief justice for decision and will be settled after he forms a third bench. Advocate Baset Mazumdar moved the bail petition for Hazari on Thursday. b
