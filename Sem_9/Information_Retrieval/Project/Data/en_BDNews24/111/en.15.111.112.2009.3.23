 Paris, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has shared the DNA profiles of suspected terrorists linked to last year's attacks in Mumbai with Interpol, the policy agency said on Sunday in what it called a benchmark move. Interpol, which has 187 member countries, said the information would allow it to help Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to determine "the full international dimension" of the attacks. "Pakistan's decision to send its DNA terrorist-related profiles to Interpol so that all member countries can compare their DNA profiles against them sets a benchmark for Interpol in terrorist-related investigations," Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in a statement. Interpol said in December that India had not shared information with it about the attacks, which killed 179 people. Pakistan, under pressure over Indian accusations that the 10 gunmen who attacked Mumbai came from Pakistan, had also complained that India had yet to provide it with any evidence to push its investigation forward. Tensions between the two countries, which are both members of Interpol, worsened since the attacks on India's financial heart that killed 179 people.
