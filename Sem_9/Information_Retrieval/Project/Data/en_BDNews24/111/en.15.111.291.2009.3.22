<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com) - Referee Abdul Rahman Abdou of Qatar arrived in Dhaka on Sunday morning to officiate the second-leg semi-finals of the Citycell Super Cup that begins on Monday. The tournament committee had opted to appoint foreign referees to conduct both return-leg semi-finals and the final after Brothers Union filed a written allegation to the committee following a 1-1 draw against Dhaka Mohammedan SC in the group-phase match. Abdou will conduct the semi-final between Abahani and Brothers Union at the Bangabandhu National Stadium while the local referees will assist him. Abahani defeated Brothers Union 3-2 in the thrilling first match, but the refereeing was not beyond question like the other group-phase matches. Tournament committee vice-chairman Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir said that Abdou would also conduct the second-leg semi-final between Dhaka Mohammedan SC and Chittagong Mohammedan SC. However, a fresh group comprising three Iranians will conduct the final on March 27 and they are scheduled to arrive here a day before the final clash. Alireza Faghani will referee the final while he will be accompanied by his compatriot Rasoul Foroghi and Reza Sokhandan. bd
