<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Neither the CID chief nor the investigating officer knows anything about the statements attributed to the FBI agents by several newspapers in their Saturday editions. The newspaper reports quoted the CID officials as saying that the visiting FBI team termed the Peelkhana massacre "pre-planned". "I know nothing about that and I didn't have talks with them (FBI team)," said CID chief, additional IGP Syed Shahzaman Raj, to bdnews24.com Saturday. "The CID team probing the incident might be able to talk about it." A similar statement came from the IO, CID's senior ASP, Abdul Kahhar Akhand. "I have no idea about what the FBI team said," Akhand told bdnews24.com Saturday. Another senior police official, who spoke on condition anonymity, revealed restrictions had been imposed on officials talking to media after the newspaper reports. "We don't know where the media got the information from. FBI members are not investigators; they are here to assist the Bangladesh officials. "And their main task is to advise on investigation procedures and provide technical assistance."
