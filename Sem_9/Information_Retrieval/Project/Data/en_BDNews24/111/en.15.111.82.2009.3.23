 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's highest policy-making body began sitting from Sunday to discuss reports of grassroots level views on party reform. A two-hour BNP standing committee meeting, chaired by Khaleda Zia at her party office, adjourned just after 10pm, to be resumed on Monday, said joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan. Party chief Khaleda has said the BNP reform process will start after the divisional reports of interviews with local level leaders are reviewed by the standing committee. "We'll soon begin party restructuring after discussing all six reports," she told reporters Saturday. The former prime minister and current leader of the opposition announced on Jan 1 that her party would be reformed at levels in the wake of a catastrophic defeat in the December 2008 general election. Kahleda formed the six organising committees headed by six party joint secretary-generals on Feb 1 to report on the party situation at the grassroots. The reports were prepared through interviews with local-level leaders between Feb 3-24
