<TITLE> Stage set for all-Mohammedan semi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club will be considered the 'underdogs' in the first-leg semi-final of the Citycell Super Cup when the Dhaka giants lock horns with a spirited Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club on Friday. The clash will kick off at 5:00pm at the Bangabandhu National Stadium and Bangladesh Television will telecast it live from the venue. Dhaka Mohammedan, who survived a scare to play a 1-1 draw against Brothers Union and needed a controversial penalty to beat Chittagong Abahani 1-0, will miss the services of creative playmaker Arman Aziz and hard-working midfielder Enamul Haq Sharif for bookings, and doubtless their absence will reduce Mohammedan's depth in midfield. Though, Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq thought that he still had good weapons -- Pappu and Danny Emanuel -- to make up for the position, both of them were hardly seen in the starting line-up in the concluded professional football league matches. Shrugging off the awful performance in the group phase, the players, Maruful believes, would put up better performances against a well-organised Chittagong Mohammedan. "Despite having capability, efficiency and strength, Mohammedan could not finish the B. League as expected. To make up for the B. League failure, the players were very excited in the group-phase matches of the tournament and could not perform accordingly. I talked to them and I hope for a better performance from them tomorrow," said Maruful. Stand-in-captain Rajani Kanta Barman also agreed their performance was not satisfactory. "The players have realised that they were not up to the mark in the group phase matches, but now we are confident to make a new start from the first-leg semi-final. Dhaka Mohammedan will have to rely on the strike pair Alamu Bukola Olaleken and his Nigerian compatriot John Goodwin, who proved his worth finding the target in his debut match against Brothers. Now it remains to be seen how Dhaka Mohammedan to play against a tensionless Chittagong Mohammedan, who ousted giants Sheikh Russel KC 2-0 and went 2-1 down to Abahani despite having a lead before qualifying for the semi-finals beating Rahmatganj MFS 2-0. "Our main strength is team combination and a cordial relationship among the players and the officials and we want to keep on our momentum what we showed in the group-phase matches," said Chittagong Mohammedan coach Nazrul Islam Ledu. "We said before that our target was to qualify for the semi-finals and we did it finely," Ledu said. "Now we have nothing to lose, but don't want to give any room to our opponents on the pitch." Captain Masud Parvez Kaiser said, "It is not a do-or-die match for us, but we want to go closer to the final winning the first-leg semi-final as all of us are free from any pressure." With the absence of Arman and Sharif, it is almost clear that Dhaka Mohammedan will adopt a wait and see strategy against Mohammedan's all-out attack. bd
