 LONDON, March 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Premier League ahead of this weekend's matches (all times GMT): Manchester United captain Gary Neville could return to the starting line-up for Saturday's trip to Fulham (1500) after missing the club's last 10 games due to a groin injury. Defender Wes Brown is still out after an ankle injury. Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia is likely to be given the all clear for the team's trip to Newcastle United on Saturday (1730) after suffering an ankle injury during last weekend's win over Blackburn Rovers. Captain Cesc Fabregas and striker Eduardo are out through injury. Newcastle's Habib Beye could win a place on the bench after returning to training this week following nearly three months recovering from ankle ligament damage in December. Everton defender Joseph Yobo will miss Saturday's game at Portsmouth on Saturday (1245) after a hamstring problem ruled the Nigerian international out for up to a month. Fellow defender Tony Hibbert is also out with a thigh injury but midfielder Tim Cahill is expected to be fit to return. West Ham United are without their top Premier League scorer Carlton Cole who is suspended for Saturday's game at Blackburn (1500). Blackburn defender Stephen Warnock should be fit after a toe injury last weekend, while captain Ryan Nelsen will undergo a fitness test later on Friday. The Rovers will be without Roque Santa Cruz and Vince Grella due to injury. Middlesbrough's Didier Digard will miss Saturday's game at Stoke City (1500) with long-term thigh and knee problems. Defender Chris Riggott is also injured, while Gary O'Neil returns to the squad after a groin injury. Stoke's four million pound ($5.83 million) January signing Matthew Etherington could return to the starting line up if he is passed as 100 percent fit after an ankle injury suffered mid-week. Manchester City striker Benjani Mwaruwari could make a return for Sunday's home game against Sunderland (1500) after missing the last 11 league games with a thigh injury. But Martin Petrov, Dietmar Hamann and Daniel Sturridge remain doubtful due to injury. Sunderland's Anton Ferdinand is hoping to be fit after missing two games with a hamstring injury.
