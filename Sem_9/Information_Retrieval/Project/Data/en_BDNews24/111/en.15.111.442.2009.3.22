 Dhaka, March 22(bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad called upon prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday to control the ruling party-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League. "Your student 'front' is resorting to terrorism and this is impairing the image of the grand alliance of which JP is a partner," said Ershad in Rangpur. He said prices of essentials, including rice, have fallen but terrorism has increased. The ex-president and former military ruler was attending a prize-giving ceremony for teachers and caretakers of mosque-based schools at Rangpur town hall. Ershad slammed militancy, saying: "In our country those who want to establish militancy and kill people with bombs are not true Muslims." "These people going astray are doing harm to Islam'. Mujibur Rahman MP, chairman of the standing committee on religious affairs, Shamim Mohammed Afzal, director general of the Islamic Foundation, and Rangpur municipal mayor Abdur Rauf Manik were also present. bdnews
