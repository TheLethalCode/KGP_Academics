 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court sent 154 border guards to prison on Sunday, on different charges including sedition and murder, in the BDR mutiny case. The 154 were produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court under heavy security measures of Central Investigation Department police. Three BDR men were also remanded into CID custody Sunday for interrogation. Of the three, Lance Naik M Gausul Azam and Subedar Major Gofran Mallik, who were produced in court after their earlier 10-day remand came to an end, were remanded again for three days for further interrogation. The court gave seven days for Habildar Abdul Barek, a new arrestee, against a 10-day remand petition. Lawyer Hemayetuddin Khan Hiron, however, sought bail for Barek, the only member among the BDR accused who has sought bail so far. Court officer Khandakar Ekhlasur Rahman said that as many as 482 BDR members have been detained so far with 83 being grilled in remand
