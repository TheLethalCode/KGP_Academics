 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)The next budget is being formulated keeping the global recession and the new government's election commitments in mind, said the NBR chief on Monday. "The new government was elected to power after making some major pledges to fulfil the demands of the nation. The new budget will be formulated keeping those commitments as well as the global crisis in view," said Mohammad Abdul Mazid. The National Board of Revenue chairman was addressing a pre-budget discussion with heads of national dailies and electronic media at the NBR conference room. He said foreign aid flow was slowing down, which will necessitate tapping more internal resources in the new budget. "The next budget will expand the taxpayers' net as too many people who should be paying have so far dodged tax," said the NBR boss. Explaining the shortfalls in reaching VAT and import duty targets, he said, "Global prices of most commodities, such as fuel and food grain, were on the high side when the government announced the 2008-09 budget, and began falling soon after." "Oil that was at $140 fuel now costs around $40, which is why revenue from VAT and import duty have also seen sharp cuts." Mentioning that there has been a proposal placed for introducing a separate pay scale for tax officials, he said, "I've told the pay commission that taxmen must have a separate pay scale with increased pay and allowances, as their services shouldn't be compared with those of the social welfare or any other ministry." The NBR chairman assured all present that tax officials would contribute more positively once their pay and allowances were enhanced. Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam, Manabjamin editor Motiur Rahman Chowdhury, Financial Express editor Moazzem Hossain, Bhorer Kagoj editor Shymal Dutta, Channel i director Faridur Reza Shagar, NTV executive director Enayetur Rahman Bappi, New Nation editor Mostafa Kamal Mazumdar, Radio Today's Rafiqul Haque and others from national dailies and electronic media joined the talks. bdnew
