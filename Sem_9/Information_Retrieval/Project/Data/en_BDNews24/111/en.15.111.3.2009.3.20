 Sylhet, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government is geared toward maximum investment in farming, said the finance minister Friday. Visiting an expo in Sylhet, AMA Muhith said the country's development depended on its agriculture, fisheries and livestock resources. "Agriculture got top priority in our Charter for Change and that is why maximum investment is being allotted for farming and rural development," he said, at the opening of an agriculture, fisheries and livestock technology expo at Sagardighi. He condemned the ruthless destruction by some of the country's resources to make 'a quick buck'. "Work for the sake of the country keeping petty interests aside," he said. 'Farming to go high-tech' The prime minister, the previous day, had stressed the need to go high-tech to raise food output, in a meeting with FAO's country representative. Sheikh Hasina told Ad Spijkers the government would apply the latest technology to modernise farming and ensure food security. The two discussed ways to turn Bangladesh into a "food surplus" country, the prime minister's press secretary said. Hasina also said private sector investment in farming would be encouraged. bdnews24.
