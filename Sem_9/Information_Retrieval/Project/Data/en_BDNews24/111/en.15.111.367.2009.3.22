<TITLE> Abahani, Brothers target final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites Abahani will be aiming to cement their Citycell Super Cup final berth when they take on Brothers Union in the second-leg semi-final at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. The Sky Blues, who are flying high on the back of a 13-game winning streak, need just a draw against Brothers to enter the final after their thrilling 3-2 win over the Oranges in the first-leg match. On the other hand, Brothers require at least a 2-0 margin win to knock a positive Abahani down to ensure a final place. Brothers, however, may opt to try and beat Abahani by a 1-0 margin. In that case, the match will roll into a tie-breaker as the aggregate scores will be the same. Wasim Iqbal's men came from behind to go 2-1 up till the 80th minute before Jahid Hasan Emily showed a glimpse of skill to strike two goals in two minutes to pull Abahani out of trouble to raise final hopes. Yet, it is Abahani, who are getting inspiration from their 13-match winning run. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen knows very well that a defensive approach would allow their opponents to dominate the match. "We won't play for a draw and our target is to qualify for the final playing attacking football," said Abahani's long-serving coach. However, it seems things will not be easy for the B. League champions Abahani especially after the way Brothers played in the first match. Abahani looked very well-organised in the first 20 minutes during the first-leg game, but they went into a shell as the match progressed in the face of a spirited show from Brothers. "Despite having a good start, we failed to maintain the momentum due to poor refereeing. Besides, we might have taken extra pressure in the match because we targeted the first-leg match to get closer to the final," said striker Emily. "But this time we hope to show a better performance to ensure our final place. The players are really motivated with the 13-matches winning streak," said the national striker. Emily will miss his partner Ghanaian Awudu Ibrahim, who broke the deadlock against Brothers, due to suspension. Emily, however, may be relieved that top scorer Nigerian playmaker Emeka Christian is still in the starting line-up. Abahani coach Sen has problems with his struggling midfield comprising Arif Khan Joy, Emeka, Abul Hossain and Mamunul Islam along with a vulnerable backline, especially on the right side. Captain Nazrul Islam was struggling to restrict a speedy Jahid Hasan on the right and Abahani conceded the second goal due to his fumble. It seems Ibrul Siraji may take Nazrul's place on Monday while Ghanaian Tetti may also be seen in the Abahani midfield if his ITC (international transfer certificate) reaches by Sunday. Brothers will play without any pressure. "We have nothing to lose and we are taking Monday's match as a new game," said Brothers coach Wasim Iqbal adding that Brothers had an experienced beating Abahani 2-0 in a B. League match. "My first goal is to play better football and the boys have already proved in the previous match and if they can keep the tempo on Monday then good things can be achieved," said a confident Iqbal. There is also good news for Iqbal that he is getting back Arup Kumar, who will certainly increase the depth in the Brothers midfield along with Shakil Ahmed, Jahid Hasan and veteran Montiur Munna. bd
