 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  Some 92 percent babies in the north-western region's island chars , or semi-permanent shoals, are born at the hands of traditional untrained birth attendants and without any modern medical help, new research reveals. "And some 70 percent women do not receive any healthcare during pregnancy, while 40 percent of them are deprived of crucial tetanus vaccines," said researcher Taifur Rahman, of Unnayan Samannay, Saturday. Speaking at the CIRDAP auditorium in the city, he was disclosing the findings of a study conducted at nearly 51 chars in Pabna, Nilfamari and Lalmanirhat districts, with the cooperation of international NGO Concern Worldwide. Nearly 97 percent of babies were delivered at home, while just one percent of women are taken to hospitals or clinics to give birth. "Besides, 92 percent babies are delivered by traditional untrained birth attendants, called dhai ," said Taifur, also the research organisation's programme chief. "Government healthcare services rarely reach these remote chars ." "Only 15 percent of residents of these chars receive treatment from trained doctors; nearly 71 percent of them are highly dependent on quack doctors," he said. Presenting the recommendations of the research, Taifur said healthcare systems needed a big boost by, among other things, providing extra incentives to health workers to visit these remote areas. bdn
