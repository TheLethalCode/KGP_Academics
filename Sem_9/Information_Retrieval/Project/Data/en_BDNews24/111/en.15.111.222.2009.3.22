<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Santi Cazorla and Matias Fernandez gave Villarreal a 2-0 home win over Athletic Bilbao to strengthen their hold on fourth place in the Primera Liga on Saturday. An entertaining game turned Villarreal's way when Giuseppe Rossi's diagonal run and pass found Cazorla unmarked on the edge of the area in the 69th minute, and the Spain winger drove a powerful shot wide of Gorka Iraizoz. Athletic's response was hindered when Markel Susaeta was sent off soon after and the King's Cup finalists were condemned to their fourth successive defeat when Villarreal substitute Fernandez skipped round his marker to score at the end. Manuel Pellegrini's side are fourth with 48 points, three short of Sevilla who host Real Valladolid in Saturday's late game.
