<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fabio Capello has said he is pleased David Beckham will stay at AC Milan until the end of the season but that the move would not guarantee his England place. Beckham will play for both Milan in Serie A and Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS which means that the midfielder, who will be 34 in May, will be playing without a break for up to 15 months before next year's World Cup in South Africa. Capello was quoted in British newspapers on Sunday as saying only form, not age, would determine whether Beckham would be picked for future England squads. Capello told the Sunday Mirror: "I have watched the last few games that David has played for AC Milan and I am very happy with his performances. He's played very well. "When I look at it, player age does not come into it. I'm looking for the best players. Italy still pick Fabio Cannavaro and he is 35 years old. I'm looking at other things." However, Capello is concerned that the standard of soccer in the MLS is not as high as the European leagues. "Beckham made a personal decision," said the Italian. "The standard in America is different. In this moment it is important for him to play in Europenot only Milan but Europe." Capello added: "American football is not at the same level as Italy, Spain, Germany and England, thats for sure." Former England captain Beckham will return to Los Angeles in mid-July and play in Galaxy's season until the end of their campaign in November. Although expected to be in Capello's squad for the upcoming matches against Slovakia and Ukraine, the Galaxy have said they will not release Beckham for friendlies against the Netherlands on Aug. 12 and Slovenia on Sept. 5
