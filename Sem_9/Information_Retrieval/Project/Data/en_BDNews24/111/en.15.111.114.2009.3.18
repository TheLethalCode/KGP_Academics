<TITLE> South Africa may drop graft charges against Zuma </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Wed Mar 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African prosecutors were considering dropping corruption charges against ruling ANC leader Jacob Zuma after he lodged a legal request, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Wednesday. A decision to drop the charges could boost the ANC's campaign for elections on April 22. The African National Congress faces its greatest challenge since apartheid ended in 1994, but Zuma is still expected to emerge as president. "Mr. Zuma has made representations to the NPA...possibly to change the complexion of the decision that has been taken by the NPA to institute criminal proceedings against him," NPA spokesman Tlali Tlali told Reuters. "The matter is under consideration." The corruption case against Zuma has increased political uncertainty in Africa's biggest economy, where growth had been slowing even before the heavy impact of the global financial crisis. Last month, a judge postponed Zuma's trial to Aug. 25 -- several months after he is expected to become president. Tlali said the decision on whether to continue with the graft trial or drop charges could take some time. "We will announce our decision when we are ready to do so." Zuma's lawyer Michael Hulley said his legal team had made a presentation to the NPA but no decision had been made yet. "I do not know anything about the NPA dropping charges. All I know is what Tlali said. One that a presentation has been made to the NPA and two that no decision has been made yet. Once the decision has been made they will let us know." South African media said the NPA would meet later on Wednesday to make a decision, but Tlali declined to confirm this. CONSPIRACY Analysts have said Zuma's lawyers could strike a deal with prosecutors to end the case or alternatively that the ANC could try to change the constitution to grant a serving president immunity from prosecution. The ANC leader has denied wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political conspiracy. The NPA charged Zuma with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering on Dec. 28, 2007, eight days after he won the ANC party leadership by defeating then President Thabo Mbeki. A High Court judge dismissed the corruption charges but the decision was overturned by the appeals court in January. Investors have been expecting the state to drop charges against Zuma for some time, said political analyst Nic Borain. "A guy with so much political capital is unlikely to face trial. I think mostly there will be relief that they can get on with business," Borain said. The ANC faces its most serious election test in the April vote since coming to power, but the party's electoral dominance will almost certainly assure victory. The ANC faces a challenge at the election from the breakaway Congress of the People (COPE) and growing public frustration with corruption, poor services and widespread poverty and crime. Political analyst Borain said if charges against Zuma were withdrawn, the ANC's election campaign will benefit. "The ANC is already feeling quite confident. I think this will make them more confident, more celebratory ... It will be good for their election campa
