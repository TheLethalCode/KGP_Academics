 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)  Victoria SC inched closer away from top flight relegation when they handed a four-wicket defeat to City Club in the Relegation League of the Premier Division Cricket League at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. Victoria raised their points tally to eight, six points earned from the first-phase matches while City Club still remained winless. Victoria will play their last match against Young Pegasus, who have five points and two matches in hand. Victoria reached 117-6 in 22.3 overs, in reply to City Club's poor total of 116 all out in 26.2 overs. Chasing a paltry total, Victoria fell into trouble sinking to 17-3 inside five overs with Sirajullah Khaled removing Arman Hossain (0), Amit Majumdar (6) and Shakil Haider (7). Ashraful Aziz (12), Akil Arshad (27) and Sharifullah (12) produced some resistance before returning to the dressing room. However, M Selim and Arafat Salahuddin remained unbeaten on 22 and 21 to steer Victoria home. Earlier, City Club put in to bat, were dismissed for a miserable total with Arman Haider top-scoring 45. Mayshukur Rahman (11) and Saif Mahmud (16) were only other two batsmen to reach double figures after some tight bowling from Akil Arshad (3-6) and Waskurni Polash (3-52).
