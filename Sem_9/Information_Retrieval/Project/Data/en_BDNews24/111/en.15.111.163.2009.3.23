<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 23 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites Abahani moved into the Citycell Super Cup final with an aggregate 3-2 result after playing a goalless draw with Brothers Union in the return-leg semi-final at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. The B. League champions will face the winners between Dhaka Mohammedan SC and Chittagong Mohammedan SC on March 27 with the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expected to witness the mouth-watering game. Enjoying a 3-2 win against the Oranges in the first-leg semi-final, the Sky Blues got off to fine start with Ibnul Siraji threatening Brothers with a superb cross, but Jahid Hasan Emily floated it over the post in the sixth minute. Nine minutes later, Nigerian striker Emeka Christian got into a good position, but he drove a Mamun through pass outside to frustrate the Sky Blues in front of the 12,000-strong crowd. Siraji, playing for Nazrul Islam, ran down the left to dart into Brothers box before firing a shot to the near post, but his powerful effort was thwarted by goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman at the cost of corner half way in the first half. Brothers then started to get into the game with Atiqur Rahman Mishu heading the ball on to the Abahani post two minutes from the breather. The Gopibagh-based outfit was given a penalty when Pranotosh fouled Medhi Hasan Tapu inside the Abahani box, but Jahid Hasan frustrated Brothers with goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya diving to his left to stop the spot kick in stoppage time. After the resumption, it seemed Abahani, who needed a draw to cement their final play, apparently went on the defensive allowing Brothers to launch attacks. But it was goalkeeper Biplob, who thwarted a couple of good chances to keep Abahani in the match. Biplob fisted a powerful shot from Matiur Munna in the 78th minute while Brothers Henry headed an Abdullah cross wide four minutes from time. However, Abahani went close to breaking the deadlock in the 80th minute when Wali Faisal and Mamun played a fine one-two to enter into Brothers box before a claver shot from Wali was blocked by the Brothers defenders. Abahani were reduced to 10 men in the dying minutes when Pranotosh Kumar was booked for the second time by Abdur Rahman Abdou of Qatar. bd
