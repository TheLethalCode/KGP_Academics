 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday granted two months anticipatory bail to Jama'at-e-Islami assistant secretary general barrister Abdur Razzak Siddique and his wife Saleha Siddique in a criminal case. The court also ordered the government to show cause within three weeks as to why the couple should not be granted permanent bail in the case filed against them for trying to board a plane at Zia International Airport 'by force'. On the night of March 18, the couple were stopped at the airport when they attempted leaving the country. Immigration police had previously, on March 7, stopped barrister Razzak from leaving the country. On March 8, the High Court in a writ order directed the government not to create any hindrance to Razzak's going abroad. Barrister Razzak on March 19 filed a case against the government for 'contempt of court' by failing to heed the High Court order. However, airport police inspector Dewan Abul Hossain also filed a case on March 19 against barrister Razzak and Saleha. The case statement says on the night of March 18, the couple violated the law by 'forcing their way' into the protected boarding bridge zone at the airport without the airport authorities' approval or exit seals on their passports, of intimidating security personnel and obstructing them from their duty. Senior advocate Khandaker Mahbub Hossain and Ajmalul Hossain QC represented the accused in the bail hearing on Sunday. The High Court is expected to hold a hearing of the case on Monday. bd
