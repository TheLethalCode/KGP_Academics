<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 22 (bdnews24.com)India has for the first time agreed to reach an "equitable solution" regarding maritime demarcation with Bangladesh on the basis of a UN law on seas, a government official said Sunday. Additional foreign secretary MAK Mahmood said it marked the first time New Delhi had used the phrase, with reference to the international convention, in a total of 12 sea border meetings with Dhaka. "This is the first time, India has agreed to an 'equitable solution' under UNCLOS," said Mahmood, who led the 11-member Bangladesh side at the just-concluded 12th bilateral meeting (March 17-18) in in New Delhi. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the basis of the negotiations as both countries are signatories to the 1982 convention. Mahmood was optimistic about the possibility of "bridging some of the gaps between the two countries." "We are coming to a greater understanding than before," he told bdnews24.com at his office. He said there were still some disagreements on the procedure for demarcation. "But the differences can be narrowed down," he said. Bangladesh and India resumed maritime boundary talks, the 11th round, in September last year after a 24 year-long hiatus. The September talks in Dhaka failed over disagreement on measuring the mid-point of the boundary river Hariabhanga. India said the mid-point, which would be the border line, should be demarcated from the Eastern side while Bangladesh demanded it be measured from the West. However, the two sides agreed to continue dialogue.
