<TITLE> Baghabari plant restarts after 13 days </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com) - The Baghabari 71 MW power plant resumed operation Wednesday after a 13-day closure on erratic gas supply, officials said. The plant came back into life after gas pressures rose in the service pipeline of the Pashchimanchal Gas Company Ltd (West Gas), the only source of gas supply in the region, plant manager Akhteruzzaman said. "Pressures are still fluctuating and we are still waiting for the required pressure," said the manager. Fall of pressures could shut it again, Akhteruzzaman feared. The PDB-run plant produces 68-70 MW power and the other 100 MW plant in the area yields nearly 90 MW at normal pressures, he said.
