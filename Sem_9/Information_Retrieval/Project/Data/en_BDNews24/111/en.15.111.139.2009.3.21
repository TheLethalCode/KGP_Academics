Wenger said he was worried about an injury that will keep Walcott out of Saturday's match at Newcastle United and makes him a doubt for England's upcoming friendly against Slovakia and World Cup qualifier against Ukraine.

"For the rest of the season might be too long, but he's out of tomorrow's squad and he could be out of the England squad."
