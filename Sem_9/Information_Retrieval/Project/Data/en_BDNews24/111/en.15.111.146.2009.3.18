 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid said Wednesday his own spending as speaker would come under the audit, as demanded by his predecessor Jamiruddin Sircar. He also said he already had asked the comptroller and auditor general to audit all spending since first parliament in 1973. Sircar at a news conference Tuesday called for a probe into the spending of Hamid and former speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury. Hamid also took the office of speaker on July 12, 2001 after Chowdhury died. "As [Sircar] has mentioned my name, I can assure you that I will also investigate spending of my time," Hamid told reporters after inaugurating a workshop on auditing and prevention of corruption. Sircar, who chaired the eighth parliament, at a media conference alleged that Chowdhury allegedly took Tk 35 lakh from speaker's medical fund in the Awami League-led seventh parliament without undergoing a heart surgery. He made the allegation as Hamid, in the face of demands by MPs, announced in parliament Monday that he would form an all-party parliamentary committee to probe the alleged corruption by Sircar in appointing staff in parliament secretariat, spending money from the medical fund and other activities. USAID-funded project Progati organised the workshop marking an anti-corruption week at Hotel Westin. US ambassador James F Moriarty, and comptroller and auditor general Ahmed Ataul Hakeem also spoke at the opening ceremony. "Crores of taka are recovered every year from the public offices through audits. This is only the tip of the iceberg," Hakeem said. Only a third of the reports made by the audit department are discussed in parliament and 700 audit reports are awaiting discussions in the House since independence, he said. He said the audit department despite being a constitutional office was dependent on the executive, which was spreading corruption in the audit department and standing in the way of professional functioning. "We have urged the government to frame an audit law to ensure transparency and accountability in the public sector for maximum utilisation of resources," he said.
