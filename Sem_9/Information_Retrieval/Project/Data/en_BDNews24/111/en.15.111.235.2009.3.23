<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 23 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Monday stayed for three weeks part of a High Court judgment that had directed the Department of Environment to ensure that all ship breaking yards operating without environmental clearance close down operations. Appellate Division judge-in-chamber, Justice Md. Abdul Aziz, passed the order on a stay petition by the Ship Breaking Association. Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud moved the petition, while Barrister Fida M Kamal opposed it. The court directed the association to file a regular leave to appeal petition within three weeks. HC halt order The High Court on March 17 directed the Department of Environment to ensure that all ship breaking yards operating without environmental clearance close operation within two weeks from receipt of the court order. The court passed the judgment on a public interest writ petition filed by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. It said no ship breaking should take place without the legally mandatory environmental clearance. Toxic ships The High Court also directed that no Greenpeace-listed 'toxic' ship shall be imported into Bangladesh for breaking purposes unless appropriate scrutiny of their waste content and cleaning is done by authorities in line with applicable laws and the proper infrastructural facility is in place to deal with such ships. The court had also directed the government to ensure that no ship with hazardous wastes enter Bangladesh without being pre-cleaned at source or outside the territory of Bangladesh. The court ordered the government to ensure that ships are only broken after guaranteeing safe working conditions for the labourers and having in place appropriate disposal arrangements for hazardous wastes and protection of environment. New rules The HC directed the Ministry of Environment and Forest to frame necessary rules within three months on ship breaking relying on the obligations of Bangladesh under the Basel Convention, 1989, the Environment Conservation Act, 1995 and the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997.
