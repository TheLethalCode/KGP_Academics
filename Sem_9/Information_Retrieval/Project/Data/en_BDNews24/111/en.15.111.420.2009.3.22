 SAN FRANCISCO, Mar 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Google Inc co-founder Larry Page is building an eco-mansion in Palo Alto, the original Silicon Valley powerhouse town, the local weekly said on Friday. Page's green-certified home should be 6,000 square feet, hardly modest for most folks, but only a bit over half the size that he could build on the lot, according to Palo Alto Online, the website for Palo Alto Weekly, which uncovered the plans. Google declined to comment. The house will include solar panels, materials that do not give off noxious chemicals, and paving that lets the rain seep through, a big deal in dry California where water planners want to fill up aquifers. That should be enough to give it the minimum qualification for a green home, as measured by the Green Point Certification program, the website said. Page aims to apply for a building permit next week on the 0.75 acre lot. It is adjacent to where he already lives, Palo Alto Online quoted neighbors as saying
