 PARIS, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Toulouse needed a penalty shootout to overcome Lille at home in the French Cup quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw marred by three red cards on Tuesday. Michel Fernandes Bastos put Lille in front with a powerful long-range shot in the first-half of extra time but fellow Brazilian Emerson scored an own goal in the second period to keep Toulouse in the tie. Toulouse keeper Cedric Carrasso then made the decisive save in the shootout from Emerson to send the southern side through to the semi-finals. "It was a very tough game and we won mentally," Carrasso told France 3 television channel. Both teams were reduced to 10 men in the first half after Lille's Ludovic Obraniak and Toulouse's Alexandre Bonnet were sent off. Lille, who knocked out holders Olympique Lyon in the previous round, were reduced to nine men when Yohan Cabaye was sent off for dissent just before the start of extra time. Brazilian Ribeiro Eduardo scored a double to help Guingamp go through to the semi-finals with a 3-1 win at Ligue 2 rivals Sedan.
