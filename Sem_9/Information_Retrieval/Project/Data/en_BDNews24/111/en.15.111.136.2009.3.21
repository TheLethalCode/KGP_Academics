 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  Urgent action is required to get the long-mired Rooppur nuclear power project off the ground and on line by 2015, said experts at a power crisis conference on Saturday. It is possible to commence the construction of the plant by 2011, said nuclear experts and engineers at the talks on 'Power crisis: issues and challenges' at the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh. Bangladesh should prioritise coal and nuclear energy to overcome the current power crunch, and manage future energy demands, due to gas shortages, they said. Chief guest, science minister and former architect Yafes Osman said, "There is no obstacle that cannot be overcome; our engineers know the solution to any problem in setting up the nuclear plant." "The people must know that we are trying to solve the energy crisis with all out efforts." State minister for power Shamsul Haq Tuku said, "It is not a case of having no gas. The problem lies in extraction. It is too costly to identify new fields." The prime minister has taken a firm decision to establish nuclear power, he said. "Right now, our main concern is irrigation. We are undertaking load management based on the previous caretaker government's policy." Mesbahur Rahman, general secretary of IEB, which organised the talks, citing data of Centre for Policy Dialogue, said load shedding cost the economy Tk 30,000 crore over the last seven years." Md. Mizanur Rahman, deputy director of the government's power cell, said in the keynote that paper, coal, nuclear and solar may be the future sources of primary energy. "We should start with coal and nuclear." Shakat Akbar, director of Atomic Energy Commission said it was possible to start the construction of Rooppur by 2011 and get it online by 2015. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said earlier in the week the government was talking with donors and development partners to expedite nuclear power plans in a bid to solve the ongoing power crisis. The country's ambitious but chronically-stalled Rooppur project was originally conceived in 1961 but past governments have all failed to follow through. Since Hasina's government came to power at the start of the year, both China and Russia have voiced interest in backing the project. One of Awami League's election pledges ahead of last year's December polls was to finally realise complete the project. Saturday's roundtable participants recommended some immediate steps to conserve energy, which could be implemented within the next 30 days, such as shutting shops and malls by 7pm instead of 8pm, rationing gas supply to factories, shutting off electric hoardings, bill boards and neon signs. Among others, PDB chairman Shawkat Ali, DPDC managing director Ataul masud, WASA managing director Rayhanul Abedin and REB member Najmul Hossen Chowdhury also spoke. Engineer Shakat Ali chaired the talks.
