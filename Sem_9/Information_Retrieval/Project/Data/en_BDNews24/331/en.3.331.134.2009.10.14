 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku has said the plots 10-truck arms, grenade attack on Sheikh Hasina and the recent activities of Indian Ulfa insurgents are all part of a conspiracy against the country and the government is working to uproot them. "During the four-party alliance government 10 truckloads of arms came to the country and a deadly grenade attack was carried out on Sheikh Hasina on Aug 21," Tuku said at a function at Victim Support Centre at the premises of Tejgaon Police Station on Wednesday. Police recently arrested United Liberation Front of Assam's military leader Amal Das while the party's top leader, Anup Chetia, remains behind bars in Bangladesh over a decade. A grenade attack was carried out at an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004 on Bangabandhu Avenue. The 10-truck arms were also seized the same year in Chittagong. "The government is working to uproot terrorism and militancy that originated during that time," he said. All criminals and terrorists would be brought to book, the state minister said. The government is going to procure more vehicles and equipment and deploy more highway police, industrial police and naval police to strengthen the activities of the law enforcers, he said. Tuku said the Victim Support Centre will provide the victims legal, mental and social support. Starting its operation on Feb 10, the centre has so far provided assistance to 281 victims in cooperation with 10 local and international private human rights organisations. bdnews2
