<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi children suffer physical torture in schools, homes and workplaces, a Unicef report says. The finding was contained in a report titled 'Children's Opinion Poll-2008', published by the United Nations Children's Fund, Bangladesh at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Thursday. State minister for women and children Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury and Carel de Rooy, Unicef representative to Bangladesh, launched the report. Ninety-one percent children in schools, 74 in homes and 65 in workplaces receive physical torture, the report said. Canes and sticks are used to torture them physically, said 87.6 percent of the 3,840 children surveyed. Students living in towns and slum houses suffer scars and bruises from the punishment in their schools. Ninety eight percent boys under nine to 13 years mostly suffer corporal punishment and 81 percent under 14 to 18 years girls suffer less. The report also found that children from poor families have to receive more torture than those from well-off families. A third of children who took the survey said they also have to fall victims of corporal punishment in their families. Sixty five percent working children admitted that they face physical torture while 25 percent talked about receiving major punishments. Chowdhury later told reporters the torture on children is not alarming. It is not possible to stop child labour and initiatives are being taken to bring them to schools through stipends. The national children policy is being updated. Women and children affairs ministry secretary Rokeya Sultana presided over the discussion. bd
