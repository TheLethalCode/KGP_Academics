 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court ended the hearing on Bangabandhu murder appeals for the seventh day on Tuesday. The five-judge bench of the Appellate Division led by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam ended the day's hearing at 1:30pm. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin, finished reading out the ruling by Justice A B M Khairul Haque from the paperbook. The apex court on the sixth day had heard that governments between 1975 and 1996 had protected and rehabilitated the killers of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The court also heard that Pakistan was among the first countries which acknowledged the new government immediately after the bloody coup on Aug 15, 1975. On Monday, Mamun read out from the part of the ruling given on Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Farukur Rahman, retired Lt Col AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and retired Major Bazlul Huda. Mamun had read out from page 1240 to page 1474 at the sixth day's hearing. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the hearing that Col Safayet Jamil in his statement said how former Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim had taken him hostage at gunpoint. This was mentioned in the ruling given by Justice Haque, he said. "The ruling also said how the killers were sent with jobs at Bangladesh missions abroad," he said. "Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed termed them 'sons of the sun'. Pakistan acknowledged the new government immediately after the bloody coup," the attorney general said. Alam said: "After the '75 incident Gen Shafiullah was exhausted and Col Safayet Jamil was taken hostage at gunpoint. But Ziaur Rahman was very normal." The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. bdn
