 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP has objected to the provision for the cancellation of registration of political parties in the amended electoral laws awaiting passage in parliament. "We've given a note of dissent. The RPO ordinance formulated during the caretaker government period did not have the condition of cancellation," senior leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP said at a news briefing after the standing committee meeting on law and parliamentary affairs on Monday. The Election Commission has given us a certificate for registration, where it is mentioned that the commission had given registration to the party being satisfied. There was no condition, he added. The BNP and five others have not submitted their permanent constitution to the EC, mandatory for final registration under the electoral laws. "But the condition of registration has been included in the second amendment, which we oppose," he said of the Representation of People Order (Amended) Bill-2009. Chowdhury later told bdnews24.com, "We don't have any other objections." In his written statement, Chowdhury stated, "The newly included proposal to cancel registration after the elections is not legally acceptable and it would create complications in the overall results." An amendment to the RPO was tabled in the House on Oct 4 with the provision that registration of political parties will be cancelled if they fail to submit their permanent constitutions to the Election Commission by the Jan 25, 2010 deadline. Law minister Shafique Ahmed placed the bill for a second amendment, regarding cancellation of party registration on failure to meet the new deadline, before the House at the beginning of proceedings on Sunday afternoon . According to the 1972 Representation of Public Order (Second Amendment) Bill-2009, political parties must submit their permanent ratified constitutions within 12 months of the start of parliament. An earlier deadline had allowed six months ending on July 24 this year, as the ninth parliament went into its maiden session on Jan 25, 2009. A total of 39 political parties were provisionally registered with draft constitutions ahead of the Dec 2008 elections. Of them, 33 parties including ruling Awami League completed their registration process by submitting their final constitutions to the EC by July 24. The rest, including main opposition BNP, appealed to the EC for extension of the deadline citing their inability to hold party councils and ratify their constitutions within the stipulated time. The cabinet on Sep 14 endorsed the EC's recommendation to increase the deadline from six to 12 months. An amendment was made to the RPO to extend the deadline. The bill amends Article 90 D of the RPO, where the fresh deadline for submission of permanent party constitutions has been extended to 12 months from six months with the new provision that registration will be scrapped if the deadline is not met. bdnew
