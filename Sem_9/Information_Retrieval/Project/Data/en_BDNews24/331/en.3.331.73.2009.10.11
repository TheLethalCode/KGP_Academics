 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh proposed a strong regulatory body with global scope to keep tabs on the world economy at two international financial summits this month, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Sunday following his return from the two key conferences. The Commonwealth finance ministers sat in Limasol, Cyprus, from Sept 30 to Oct 3, while the Turkish city Istanbul hosted the WB-IMF annual meeting on Oct 6 and Oct 7. "World Bank, IMF, ADB and many other development agencies are working for global economic development. But there is no international regulatory body to monitor whether countries are following international regulations and guidelines," Muhith told a news conference. "I think it is crucial to have a strong international regulatory body." Muhith said India's finance minister, Australia's finance minister and other representatives from the developing and developed world supported the idea. He also said finance ministers of Commonwealth countries, and central bank governors and top officials of WB-IMF widely appreciated Bangladesh for tackling the hit of the global recession efficiently. "They were unanimous in their observation that Bangladesh was doing 'very good' in the economic downturn," said Muhith. "They said Bangladesh made the 'impossible possible'." The minister said that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have softened their terms for loan assistance to Bangladesh in the light of its economic performance. The World Bank has set Bangladesh free to spend its unused $1.7 billion in loan assistance, which had been held up for different conditions, on any project it wants. Muhith also said that the bank had promised increased assistance to deal with the effects of the global recession. Bangladesh's 12-member delegation to Cyprus and Turkey included Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, finance secretary Mohammmad Tareq, Economic Relations Division secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan and the prime minister's economic affairs adviser Moshiur Rahman. The minister and his team, apart from Moshiur Rahman, returned home on Friday and spoke in turn at the news conference at the NEC auditorium in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. "Remittance of all countries are falling in the main; only Bangladesh's is rising. This amazed participants at both the conferences. They wanted to know how it could be possible," central bank boss Atiur Rahman said. "I told them that we acted by opening exchange houses in different countries to help maintain remittance inflow through banking channels. And our workers abroad struggle a lot, live hard lives to send more money back home." Finance secretary Mohammad Tareq said Bangladesh portrayed a brighter image in both the conferences, which would play a positive impact for getting more loan support from WB-IMF. ERD secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan agreed, adding that Bangladesh had a number of bilateral meetings with representatives of different countries during the conferences. He said, "Previously Bangladesh was not treated with much importance. But this time representatives of different countries gave greater importance to Bangladesh. They paid attention to our speeches and supported our proposals." bdn
