 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)The governments between 1975 and 1996 protected and rehabilitated the killers of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Pakistan acknowledged the new government immediately after Aug 15, 1975 events. The five-judge bench of the Appellate Division led by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam on Monday heard the deliberations from a previous High Court ruling on Bangabandhu murder case. The sixth day's hearing on Bangabandhu murder case appeals started at 9:42am and ended at 1:35pm. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts retired major Bazlul Huda and retired lt col A K M Mohiuddin, said he had read out from the paperbook containing the ruling by Justice A B M Khairul Haque. "I have read out from the part of the ruling given on lt col (dismissed) Syed Farukur Rahman, retired lt col AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, retired lt col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and retired maj Bazlul Huda," Mamun said. "I have read out the statements by the state witnesses. Justice A B M Khairul Haque found the convicts guilty after recognising them killers and plotters." The reading of the ruling by Justice Haque will end on Tuesday, Mamun said. "The court will decide whether I need to read out the ruling of the third judge, justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim." Continued Mamun: "Then Comilla Awami League president Khorshed Alam did not give the same statement on the plot to the court as he did before the investigation officer. "Even though Justice Haque accepted his statement and found the convicts guilty. "Justice Haque in his ruling said col Faruk and other convicts had got favour from many governments. From that it is clearly understood that they are real killers," the lawyer said. Mamun read out from page 1240 to page 1474 at the sixth day's hearing. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the hearing that col Safayet Jamil in his statement said how former Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim took him hostage at gunpoint. This was mentioned in the ruling given by Justice Haque, he said. "The ruling also said how the killers were sent with jobs to Bangladesh missions abroad," he said. "Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed termed them 'sons of the sun'. Pakistan acknowledged the new government immediately after the incident," the attorney general said. Alam said: "After the '75 incident Gen Shafiullah was exhausted and col Safayet Jamil was hostage at gunpoint. But Ziaur Rahman was very normal." The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
