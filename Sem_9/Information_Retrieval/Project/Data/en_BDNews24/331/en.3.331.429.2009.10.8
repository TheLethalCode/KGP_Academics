<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Independent MP Fazlul Azim, the opposition member to be attending parliament in the absence of mainstream opposition, has threatened to boycott proceedings if the government tried to 'gag' him. Azim issued the threat on Thursday as deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was chairing the House, asked him to shorten his speech on a private-member resolution demanding two police stations in Hatia, Noakhali. Ali intervened as Azim got angry with home minister Sahara Khatun's answer to his demand for two police stations in Hatia. "If you want to silence me, I will not talk (in future), I will not come to parliament again," Azim threatened Shawkat Ali who asked him not to overreact to the minister's comment. "Terrorism, theft, robbery are not new in his constituency," Sahara said. "The party (BNP) he belonged to could have set the police stations there. The terrorists of his previous party have been involved in the criminal activities. "As you have got elected to parliament as an independent candidate, they are creating problems." The chair then gave Azim floor to speak. "Why should she say so much on the demand of two police stations? "Have I demanded those for myself?" Azim snapped. Azim in his proposal said his constituency needed two more police outposts as theft and robbery was rampant in Hatia. "I don't say that theft and robbery did not exist before in my area. Robbery exists everywherein the US, UK and Germany," he said. "This situation must be changed. You have pledged changes. We want to see a change." The chair repeatedly asked him to come to the point instead of getting emotional. "Don't misuse the liberty you have been given. Please, come to the point or I will be forced to switch your microphone off," said Ali.
