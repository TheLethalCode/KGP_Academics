 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  Students at Mirpur Bangla College continued with their demonstrations on Monday demanding withdrawal of a government decision regarding grading system. The demonstrators put up barricades on both sides of the Mirpur Road, creating a huge traffic gridlock in the area. They took out procession inside the campus at around 12:30pm and later marched onto the main road in front of the college. Akram Hossain, a college student, said they would continue with their movement until their demand was met. Mirpur police chief Zakir Hossain said police forces had been dispatched to the spot. The demonstrators earlier announced that they would put up barricades on the Shahbagh Road on Tuesday and besiege the education ministry on Wednesday to press home their demands. Students of some colleges on Sunday took to the streets in front of Dhaka College to press for the same demands. The agitating students said the recent gazette notification issued by the education ministry reversed a previous decision of grading system. The demonstrators were successful candidates in SSC and HSC examinations held between 2001 and 2004. They said the gazette changed the equalisation of grading system and division system for their academic time. The GPA system was introduced in 2001 under which GPA-2 was set equal to second division (45 percent marks) and GPA-3 equal to first division (60 percent marks). But the government gazette published on June 2 said the below GPA-3 would be estimated as third division and below GPA-4 as second division for the students who passed SSC and HSC examinations after 2004. For students who passed SSC and HSC between 2001 and 2003, below GPA-2.5 would be counted as third division and less than 3.5 as second division for them. It means students whose GPA was earlier counted as second division would now be counted as third division after the publication of the new gazzette. Students said they had talked with the education minister and other top ministry officials about the issue but no solution came out. They demanded withdrawal of the June 2 gazette. bd
