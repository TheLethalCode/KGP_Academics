<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Tuesday rejected a proposal to strip BNP MP and former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar of membership for corruption charges. The House rejected the proposal of a parliamentary probe report which called for cancelling Sircar's membership, but unanimously passed a set of resolutions which included referring the corruption charges to the Anticorruption Commission for further action. Parliament also asked the government to realise Tk 1.75 crore from Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandoker Delwar Hossain for "unauthorised" use of public money. It proposed that the ACC should also take up the corruption allegations against Siddiqui and Hossain for further investigation. Workers' Party president Rashed Khan MP put the proposal to the House to cancel Sircar's membership.
