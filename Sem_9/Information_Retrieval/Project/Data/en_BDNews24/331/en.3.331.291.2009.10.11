 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)The government will announce the new pay scale for civil servants in a month, the finance minister said on Sunday. A M A Muhith said at a news conference at NEC auditorium in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar that the government had also taken initiatives to formulate a new 'Civil Service Act' in a bid to ensure transparency and accountability in civil service. "No, not in tomorrow's cabinet meeting we will approve the pay scale," he said in reply to a question on whether the decision will be announced from Monday's regular meeting of the council of ministers. "But we hope to declare it in a month," the minister who returned on Friday from from two key international conferences in Cyprus and Turkey. "Whenever the declaration comes, civil servants will get their salaries and bonus in accordance with the new pay scale from July 2009," he added. The National Pay Commission, secretary committee and judicial commission had submitted their reports. The minister clarified that it was taking time to compile the reports. "I will soon scrutinise the reports and forward them to the cabinet committee." The Pay Commission was formed in Sep 2008 with former secretary Mostafizur Rahman as its chief. The commission submitted their report to the finance minister in late April, and proposed pay scales for the civil servants ranging from Tk 4,500 to Tk 45,000 per month. Later the secretary level committee revised the proposals and suggested the lowest salary at Tk 4,150 and the highest at Tk 39,000. Muhith said: "I cannot say at this moment what would be there in the new Civil Service Act. It will be formed based on everybody's opinion." bdn
