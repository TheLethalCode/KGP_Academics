 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)--Ever since Barack Obama entered the White House nine months ago, some of his diehard political opponents seem determined to cause as much trouble for him as they can, sometimes using baseless and fabricated stories. Now they've turned their attention on First lady Michelle Obama. In recent weeks, a group of conservative critics have used emails, blogs and chat rooms to launch an attack against the first lady accusing her of employing a "massive" staff with tax payers' money. Of course, this is not the first time that first ladies had been criticized for such indulgences. But the current attack on Mrs Obama seemed particularly harsh given the fact that her staff is in no way bigger than previous first ladies. To meet a Congressional requirement, the Obama White House on July 1 posted the Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff on its official blog. Soon after, a minor brouhaha erupted over the first lady's staff size. One critic at CanadianFreePress.com accused the president's wife of employing an "unprecedented number of staffers" for someone who "doesn't perform any official duties". Another widely circulated chain email reported that "there has never been anyone in the White House at any time that has created such an army of staffers whose sole duties are the facilitation of the First Lady's social life. Many other critics of the Obama administration expressed similar sentiments. But what are the facts regarding how many people are under her employ, and how does the size of her staff compare to that of past first ladies? The Factcheck.org, a non-partisan group, discovered that there are 16 White House staffers with the term "first lady" in their job title, along with eight additional staffers who also provide support to Michelle Obama, bringing the total number of paid first lady aides to 24, two more staffers than the number noted in the aforementioned chain email circulated by Obama critics. Michelle Obama's press secretary, Katie McCormick Lelyveld, confirmed that 24 was an accurate count of staffers working for the current first lady. So just what does a staff of 24 do for Michelle Obama? Well, for starters there are the 32,000 pieces of mail that have flooded the East Wing since Michelle Obama took occupancy in January, but the main official duty of the first lady is to tend to the care and maintenance of the White House and its seemingly endless social functions. Of course some first ladies, like Michelle Obama, maintain a higher profile than others, and with that comes the need for people to help write speeches, arrange travel and security details, handle media inquiries, etc. About the myriad tasks and responsibilities handled by White House staffers, Anita McBride, Laura Bush's former chief of staff, recently said, "There's never enough people to do the amount of work that has to get done." As far as Michelle Obama's staff size being "unprecedented" in modern times, this appears to be factually inaccurate. According to the Washington Post, the Bush White House also had 16 people on staff whose official titles included the term "first lady" working for Laura Bush, and a recent Associated Press story placed her total number of staffers at between 24 and 26. The same AP report also noted that Hillary Clinton had up to 19 staffers, while Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy had 30 and 40, respectively. To that end, Snopes.com, another Web site dedicated to checking the facts on issues prominent in the public discourse, described the claims of Michelle Obama's "unprecedented" staff as "grossly inaccurate" and "on par with her predecessor
