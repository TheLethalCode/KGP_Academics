 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP minister Shahjahan Siraj was freed on bail on Tuesday after the Supreme Court on Monday turned down a government appeal against the High Court order that granted him bail. The vice president of BNP came out of the prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University at around 5:30pm. His daughter barrister Sarwat Siraj told bdnews24.com, "My father was released on bail from the hospital at 4:30pm. The guards at his cell have been withdrawn." Siraj, a former forests and environment minister of the BNP government, was sent to jail after he surrendered to court on June 30 in connection with all four cases. A full five-judge bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin, quashed the government petition against the High Court's bail order. The bench, on Aug 25, stayed the High Court's Aug 18 bail orders in two cases accusing Siraj of illegally grabbing forestland. The Supreme Court on Aug 23 issued an immediate one-day stay on a High Court order for release of Siraj on bail "within an hour". Barrister Rafiq-Ul Huq, assisted by barrister Sarwat Siraj, defended Siraj at the hearing on Monday. Additional attorney general A K M Zahirul Huq argued for the state. After Monday's verdict, Sarwat told bdnews24.com, "The regular bench of the Appellate Division quashed the stay order by the chamber judge. There's no more bar to his release now." The Appellate Division bench, however, upheld Siraj's Aug 19 bail in the two other cases, one for possession of illegal wealth and one for tax evasion. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for tax evasion on Aug 29, 2007, and to 13 years for amassing illegal wealth on April 23, 2008. His wife Rabeya Siraj, son Rajib Siraj and daughter-in-law Farzana Khan have also been convicted in tax evasion cases. bd
