 HAVANA Oct 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro lauded the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to US President Barack Obama, saying on Saturday it was "a positive measure" that was more a criticism of past US policies than a recognition of Obama's accomplishments. Castro said the prize made up for the blow Obama suffered last week when the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2016 Summer Games to Rio de Janeiro after Obama had flown to Copenhagen to pitch for Chicago, his adoptive hometown.

Also, he criticized the United States, as he often does, for not doing more to cut emission of greenhouse gases said to be causing global warming. Castro, 83, ran Cuba for 49 years after taking power in a 1959 revolution but stepped down last year and was replaced as president by his younger brother Raul Castro.
