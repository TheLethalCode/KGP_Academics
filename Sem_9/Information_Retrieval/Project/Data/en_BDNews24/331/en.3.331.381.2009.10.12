 Rangamati, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Rangamati district administration has begun the process of revoking lease of some Khas land (government plots) as they were left unused by the allottees defying conditions. The district administration on Wednesday cancelled the lease of eight plots (350 acres of land) in Rangamati sadar and Kaukhali upazila and five more plots (125 acres of land) are in the process of being cancelled. "We have cancelled lease of the lands of those who breached conditions of the allotment," deputy commissioner Sourendranath Chakrabarty told bdnews24.com. The eight plots cancelled had been leased out between 1981 and 1985, he said, adding that the process of cancellation of some more lands is underway. The district administration recently formed a committee with additional deputy commissioner (revenue), revenue deputy collector and concerned Upazila Nirbahi Officers to probe case of leased lands. Following the committee's report the district administration summoned the lease holders on Aug 25. The decision was made since the lease holders failed to give any satisfactory reply as to why they kept the lands unused. The parliamentary standing committee on CHT affairs in a meeting held in Khagrachari on Feb 29 recommended for revoking 13 plots (475 acres) in Rangamati district. Those plots were leased out for commercial or agricultural use, including rubber plantation. Those whose lease were cancelled are Chandra Shekhar Das, Mahfuzul Haque and Salauddin Ahmed from Chittagong, Hasanuzzaman and Khaledur Rahman from Dhaka, and Md Nurul Amin Chowdhury, Md Shafiul Ansari and Golam Mostafa Mridha from Rangamati. bdnews
