 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)Rogue brokers and traders are taking new investors for a ride, overpricing small companies' stocks to a point not justified at all. According to estimations from brokerage firms, some 1,50,000 new BO accountsa tenth of the total number in the country had been opened in the past three months, induced mainly by the news of floating Grameenphone shares. On Wednesday, Dhaka Stock Exchange's key index rose 15 points from the previous day to end on 3296 points, touching a new high while the turnover also set a new record of Tk 12.01 billion. An analysis of trade data of the last 10 days, between Oct 4 and Oct 14, shows that prices of certain issues are surging without any price influencing developments like disclosures of deals or business expansion. A section of investors are playing with shares of these good companies, but very small with low market capitalisation, to make some quick dough by taking advantage of these new funds. Three textile companies, with paid-up capitals of between Tk 50 million and Tk 99 million, have witnessed unusual price movements over the last 10 days. 'A' category scrip Mithun Knitting, whose face value is Tk 100, shot up from Tk 607 on Oct 4 to Tk 750 on Wednesday but the company has not disclosed any information of any major deal or expansion plans. Sonargaon Textile, a 'B' category share, saw its price sky-rocketing to Tk 688 on Wednesday from Tk 463 on Oct 4. Al-Haj Textile, with a face value of Tk 10, ended on Tk 137 in 10 days from Tk 91. Meanwhile, a couple of IT shares are also witnessing similar responses. BDCOM Online, a company with a paid-up capital of Tk 123 million, rose by almost Tk 20, during the same period while Information Services Networks Ltd (ISNL) finished at almost Tk 62 on Wednesday from Tk 45. InTech Online Ltd and Agni Systems Ltd shot up about Tk 14 over the same timeframe. Beach Hatchery, a company with Tk 220 million paid-up capital, was at Tk 47 on Oct 4 and ended on Tk 63. According to market experts, a market correction is always imminent; this means the new comers will lose confidence in the market forever when they burn their fingers. "What goes up always comes down, that is the rule of the market," Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former CEO of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. He said that if the correction lands hard, it would jeopardise small investors. Major players are also worried that the market is "overbought". "Trade pattern is simply not following any fundamentals as the market is flooded with new investors' funds," mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed told bdnews24.com. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the market is hovering around 80 from the end of last month, whereas the threshold is 70, he said. The RSI identifies overbought and oversold conditions in the market. It is scaled from 0 to 100. Typically, readings below 20 indicate oversold, while readings over 80 indicate overbought. "This indicates to sell-off and leave the market," added Sayeed, CEO of asset management firm, AIMS of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the market regulators say that they are always monitoring the situation and will take action if anything unlawful" happens. "Prices can always go up and it's a matter between the buyer and seller," Mansur Alam, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. The SEC takes action if any trading move violates the law, he said. Referring to previous probes on unusual price hike, Alam said that they have successfully traced such issues and have taken action against the perpetrators. Market operators, however, ruled out any possibilities of wrongdoing in trading. "It's not that this is a result of planned or syndicated investment," said Rakibur Rahman, the president of Dhaka Stock Exchange. He blamed these unusual hikes on the shortage of supply of shares in the market. "The whole market is on fire, the government needs to float its entities to ease the situation," he told bdnews24.com.
