 YANGON Fri Oct 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's ruling junta allowed detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to meet with Western diplomats on Friday, a week after she asked for talks about sanctions on the isolated country.

US sanctions were imposed in 1988, when the army that has ruled Myanmar since a 1962 coup violently crushed pro-democracy demonstrations, killing an estimated 3,000 people. The EU has had sanctions in place since 1996. They were further tightened after a harsh crackdown on monk-led protests in 2007. Australia has visa restrictions on the regime and a ban on defense exports. Critics say the extension of Suu Kyi's house arrest was intended to minimize her influence on next year's elections, the first since 1990 when her NLD party won but was never allowed to r
