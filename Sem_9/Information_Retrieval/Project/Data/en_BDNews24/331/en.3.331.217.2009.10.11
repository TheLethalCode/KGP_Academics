 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has given the CID police another three days to question former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu in the murder case regarding the grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. Dhaka third additional chief metropolitan magistrate Golam Rabbani gave the order on Sunday after senior assistant CID superintendent Abdul Kahar Akhand sought seven more days to grill Pintu. The judge asked the police to take caution during the grilling. Police questioned Pintu last week for three days. Advocate Khandaker Mahbub Hossain appealed for cancellation of the remand. There is no information in the previous remand of a headway in the gathering of evidence to suggest Pintu's involvement in the case, he said. "Why will he be taken into remand again?" He alleged the investigation officer was not obeying the court order regarding his client's treatment. Hossain said: "If the defendant does not survive how will he be questioned? "Mufti Hannan in his confessional statement said that Pintu was involved in the case but later sought to retract the statement." Mahbub, claiming that his client is not a criminal, said, "The defendant is in no way an instigator of crime. The incumbent president now backs criminals, which came in the newspaper." He was referring to an article published in the Daily Prothom Alo on Sunday. It said president Zillur Rahman's military secretary major general Ehteshamul Haque's name came up in confession of a militant arrested on charges of bid-to-murder of prime minister Sheikh Hasina eight years back in Sylhet. Chief counsel for the state Syed Rezaur Rahman said, "Referring to an article published in a newspaper in court is not lawful." Pintu, the BNP leader, was arrested on Jan 17, 2008 in the case. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the killing and explosives cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. b
