<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia have named Mike Hussey as deputy to skipper Ricky Ponting in their 15-player squad for a one-day series in India starting on Oct. 25. Hussey's elevation follows a back injury to fellow batsman Michael Clarke, who was forced to withdraw from their Champions Trophy squad in South Africa. Australia will also miss first choice wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, undergoing rehabilitation after finger surgery, as well as left-arm paceman Nathan Bracken (knee), Cricket Australia said in a statement. Attacking left-handed opener Shaun Marsh returns to the squad after recovering from a hamstring injury. The World Cup winners enter the seven-match series on a high, having swept to a 6-1 ODI series win against England ahead of the Champions Trophy. "We're really pleased with the progress the ODI squad has made recently," chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said. "To reclaim our number one ICC world ranking was recognition of this squad's recent achievements but we recognise we have to continue to improve and to establish a winning culture within this young group of players on tough tours, like this, to India." The matches will be played in Baroda (Oct. 25), Nagpur (Oct. 28), New Delhi (Oct. 31), Mohali (Nov. 2), Hyderabad (Nov. 5), Guwahati (Nov. 8) and Mumbai (Nov. 11). Squad: Ricky Ponting (captain), Mike Hussey (vice captain), Shane Watson, Shaun Marsh, Tim Paine (wicketkeeper), Adam Voges, Cameron White, James Hopes, Doug Bollinger, Nathan Hauritz, Jon Holland, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Peter Siddle.
