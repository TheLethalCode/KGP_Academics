 Sherpur, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  Three suspected terrorists, arrested by RAB on Monday with ten hand grenades from Jhinaigati, Sherpur, were remanded into police custody on Tuesday for five days. The three men are Md Rafiqul Islam, 36, Lang Fang Sangma, 37, and Nitin Sangma, 25, from Jhinaigati. Judicial magistrate Palash Chandra Roy approved the remand on the request of Jhinaigati police sub-inspector Bajendra Nath Mandal, who is the investigating officer in the case. Abul Kalam Azad, who directs RAB's legal and media wing, said on Monday that the elite force arrested Islam on a tip-off at Panbor village of Jhinaigati Upazila in the early hours of Monday and found the grenades at his home. On information gleaned from him, the others were arrested at Chhoto Gazni village of the same upazila. Azad said the explosives were Austrian-made Arge grenades, similar to those used in the Aug 21, 2004, attack on Awami League. The RAB team handed the suspects over to police along with the recovered grenades, Jhinaigati police chief Md Omar Faruq told bdnews24.com. RAB-1 deputy assistant director Md Joynal Hossain filed a case under the Explosives Act. The case details said the three men had amassed the grenades to create anarchy within the country. The arrestees claim they were caught on Friday night and they do not know anything about the recovered grenades. bdnews2
