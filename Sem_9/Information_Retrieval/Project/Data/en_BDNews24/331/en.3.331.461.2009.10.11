 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka City development authority Rajuk on Sunday launched a drive to dismantle unapproved structures on parking spaces in commercial buildings. On the first day of the drive, a team, led by magistrate Rokonuddowla, razed down structures on seven buildings on the Sat Masjid Road in Dhanmondi. Authorising officer at Rajuk, Aminur Rahman, told bdnews24.com illegal structures of Ziang Zing Chinese restaurant, Bikolpo Dental Clinic, Star Kabab, Prime Bank, Kakoli High School, Utsob Restaurant and Almas Shopping Centre were bulldozed. Rahman said a total of 198 buildings have been identified in the capital, where illegal structures have been thrown up on space designated for parking. Rokonuddowla told bdnews24.com the RAJUK team faced resistance at Almas. Tension ran high after police arrested three staffs of the shop. Police later took the situation under control. The building has approval for offices, but they are doing business by setting up a shopping mall, he said. Manager of Almas Jalaluddin told bdnews24.com they are doing business there with permission. RAJUK did not issue any notice. The glass and shutter of the mall were knocked down by a bulldozer and the team left the place halfway into operations, he alleged. "The team did not give us time to move the merchandise even though we asked for it," he added. "We have launched this operation to recover the space for parking," RAJUK officer Rahman said. The drive will continue on Monday, he added. bd
