 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday rejected a petition of former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar 'as not placed' after the former speaker had appealed for withdrawing it. The bench of justices Tariq-Ul Hakim and Borhan Uddin made the order. Deputy attorney general Mostafa Jaman Islam told bdnews24.comi the court had rejected the petition on grounds that the petition was not placed. "Sircar appealed for returning the petition as the parliament made a decision on him (Tuesday)," he said. Speaker Abdul Hamid Tuesday came to the rescue of his predecessor by refusing to allow MPs to vote on a proposal to strip Sircar of his membership on corruption charges a parliamentary probe found true. In a landmark ruling, the speaker said: "There is no specific provision in our constitution or rules of procedure for cancelling membership of an MP for these sort of offences." But the House unanimously passed a set of resolutions which included referring the charges against Sircar, now a BNP MP, to the Anticorruption Commission for further action. Sircar filed the petition on Aug 16 seeking to challenge the legality of convening a parliamentary committee for probing the allegations against him, its activities and recommendations. He told reporters after Wednesday's ruling: "I have withdrawn the petition in the wake of a changed situation. "The parliamentary committee recommended for striping of my membership of parliament. "I am withdrawing my petition since my membership was not cancelled," said Sircar, now an opposition BNP MP. He said he might file a petition later following the new decision. The former speaker was elected from the Bogra constituency in the by-election after opposition chief Khaleda Zia vacated the seat. On July 5, a parliamentary probe body looking into corruption charges against the former speaker and two others recommended for cancellation of his membership and legal actions against him. The committee alleged he had drawn Tk 27 lakh as medical allowances without the permission of the then prime minister and House leader Khaleda. He also wasted millions of taka in the name of beautifying the parliament secretariat during his tenure as speaker from Oct 28, 2001 to Jan 25, 2009, it said. b
