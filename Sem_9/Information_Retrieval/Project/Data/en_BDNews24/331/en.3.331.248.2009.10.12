<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, joint secretary general of main opposition BNP, on Monday surrendered before a Dhaka court in a case related to amassing illegal wealth. The BNP leader turned himself in at the 3rd Special Judge's Court and appealed for bail. Judge Mozammel Hossain on hearing the bail petition did not give any order and sent the case documents to the court of metropolitan senior special judge A N M Bashiurllah. The hearing was likely to take place after a while on Monday, court sources said. Special public prosecutor Abdus Salam Khan said in the first bail appeal hearing that Goyeshwar did not obey the High Court order and failed to show up before the court. Nitai Chandra Roy, counsel for the BNP leader, refuted the statement, saying the defence did not dishonour the HC order. The judge said after the hearing that the HC ordered Goyeshwar to surrender before the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court within eight weeks. The Anticorruption Commission had filed the case with Ramna Police Station on Jan 5 on charges of accumulating illegal wealth worth Tk 2.68 crore and hiding the information to the graft watchdog. Goyeshwar surrendered before the High Court on March 9 and sought anticipatory bail. The HC granted him bail until the submission of the chargesheet which was pressed on July 5. On Aug 16, the HC ordered the BNP leader to show up before the Special Judge's Court within eight weeks after the defence appealed for bail extension. bdn
