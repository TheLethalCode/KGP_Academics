<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)The tenure of the current session of parliament will be extended to the first week of November, chief whip Abdus Shahid said Monday. Shahid told bdnews24.com that the third session would be stretched to avoid holding an additional session before the winter session in January. "The House will be adjourned until October 28 after business on Tuesday." "It will then continue up to the first week of November," Shahid said at his parliament office. He clarified that if the current session ended on Tuesday, the government must convene another session before Dec 13 according to constitutional obligations. The constitution stipulates that parliament must sit again within 60 days of the last day of the immediate-past session. Again, parliament must convene in January for the president's new year speech. The chief whip said speaker Abdul Hamid would soon convene a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee which approves the tenures of any session of parliament.
