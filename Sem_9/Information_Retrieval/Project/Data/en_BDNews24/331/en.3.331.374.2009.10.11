 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary standing committee took just 10 minutes on Sunday to okay a bill on lifetime security for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's surviving family members, which includes prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and their children. Home minister Sahara Khatun tabled the controversial Father of the Nation Family Members Security Bill 2009 in parliament on Oct 5, and the House sent it to the standing committee for further scrutiny before passage. The parliamentary standing committee on the home ministry held a meeting Sunday at the cabinet committee room in parliament to discuss different sections of the bill. Committee chairman Abdus Salam presided over the meeting. State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku and MPs Md Mujibul Haq, Md Nurul Islam Sujon, Sanjida Khanam, and Habibor Rahman and Shafiqul Islam attended. "The meeting started at around 4.00 pm and lasted for about 10 minutes," a security personnel who guarded the meeting venue told bdnews24.com afterwards. "They just had tea and left," he said. Neither the committee chairman nor the committee members spoke to reporters after the meeting. But the parliamentary secretariat in a statement later Sunday said, "The Father of the Nation Family Members Security Bill 2009 has been finalised and unanimously approved to present before parliament." The main opposition BNP has termed the bill for special lifetime security to be provided by the state to Mujib's immediate family "unprecedented" anywhere in the world. The Awami League government has said the law is needed as Hasina, Rehana and their family members face threats to their security. Hasina's father and Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his immediate family were assassinated in a military putsch on Aug 15, 1975. The previous Awami League administration passed a similar bill in June 2001 giving Hasina and her sister special security. The subsequent BNP government coming to power in October 2001 repealed the bill in December of that year.
