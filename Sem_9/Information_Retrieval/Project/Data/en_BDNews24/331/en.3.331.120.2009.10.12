 Dhaka, Oct12 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid told the House Monday that he hoped the government would deal seriously with a newspaper report containing allegations against major general Ehtesham Ul Huq, former military secretary to the president. General Huq has just been made general officer commanding (GOC) of the army's Rangpur-based division. The general was linked by newspaper Prothom Alo on Sunday to militants who were charged with launching an attack on Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina on Sep 26, 2001, during the election campaign. A top government official, however, told bdnews24.com that the general, then a lieutenant colonel, had been investigated and cleared by the army long ago, after the accused militants mentioned his name during an interrogation. The speaker, in reply to a point of order, told parliament on Monday that he expected the government to deal with the matter seriously and issue a statement as soon as possible. Suranjit Sengupta had brought the topic up. The ruling party MP, on the point of order, demanded a statement from the defence minister over the allegation against the general. "The Prothom Alo published a report on the military secretary to the president," said Sengupta, who chairs the standing committee on law. "He has now been transferred to another important post, the GOC of Rangpur division. I don't know whether it is a promotion or demotion," he said. News of the general's transfer leaked out Sunday, the same day the Alo's report came out, though government officials insisted the transfer had nothing to do with the newspaper report but had been decided days before. Sengupta told parliament Monday, "We expected a statement from the defence minister on the general's suitability for his current position. Instead he was transferred." The MP said, as per existing military rules, army personnel charged with any accusation should be suspended from performing their specific duty until they are cleared of the charge. Sengupta said, "I expect the government to deal with the matter seriously and the relevant minister to deliver a statement on it as soon as possible." bdnews24.
