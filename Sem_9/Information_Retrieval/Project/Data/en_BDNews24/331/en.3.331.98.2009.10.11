<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid on Sunday vented his frustration over absence of senior ministers and ruling party MPs in parliament. A testy speaker drew prime minister Sheikh Hasina's attention to the issue and said he could not stomach the ministers' absence. "I cannot take it easy that ministers and senior MPs on the front row will remain absent," an angry Hamid told the House before starting the business. "The leader of the House, the prime minister, is present while they are absent. "The House was supposed to hold discussion on the PRSP (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper-II). But the MPs who are interested in the discussion and the minister in charge is absent," said Hamid. "Even the chief whip is also absent." Hasina then took floor and said the ministers were at a meeting with her until 2:30pm. She suggested Hamid hold the discussion on PRSP-2 on Oct 13. "But I cannot take the ministers absence easy," Hamid repeated after the prime minister's comment. Law minister Shafique Ahmed, civil aviation minister G M Quader, land minister Rezaul Karim Hira, water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, commerce minister Farque Khan and state minister for land Mostafizur Rahman were the ministers present when the House went into session at around 4:10pm. Out of 345, 87 MPs were present in the House. Hamid also ordered the MPs not to talk loudly while other speak on issues. "Honourable members, please do not talk aloud while the House is in session. "Some of you are talking in such a way that you have made the House a fish market," Hamid said in his ruling while he was disposing of notices of public importance. As per the Rules of the Procedure of parliament, no MP should talk while others take the floor. Parliament resumes sitting last Sunday following an 18-day break over the Eid-ul-Fitr and Durga Puja. bdnews24.
