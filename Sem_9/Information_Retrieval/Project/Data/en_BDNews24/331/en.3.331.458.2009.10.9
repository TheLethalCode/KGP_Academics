Al Odah said the Kuwaiti government has built a rehabilitation facility to provide detainees access to education, medical care and other services after their detention at Guantanamo.

Al Rabiah's lawyers argued it was a case of mistaken identity and the judge found the US government's case lacked credibility. "We're pressing the United States government to release him as soon as possible," said David Cynamon, a lawyer for the Kuwaitis. Another Kuwaiti detainee, Fawzi Al Odah, had his petition to be released from Guantanamo denied by a federal ju
