 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh is one of the countries that benefited most from the work of Norman E. Borlaug, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said on Saturday in a tribute to the "Father of the Green Revolution" who died in September. Borlaug's great achievement was to prove that intensive, modern agriculture could be made to work in fast-growing developing countries. "Like Dr. Borlaug we must contribute to the agriculture sector through our research efforts and this is the lesson that we should take from the life of this Nobel laureate," the minister said as chief guest at a memorial for the renowned scientist at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council. Chowdhury expressed heart-felt condolence at Borlaug's passing away, saying his achievements in plant breeding led to spectacular success in increasing food production in Asia and Latin America. During his career Borlaug developed wheat varieties that gave three to six times higher yields which the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation attributes to saving one billion people from famine worldwide in the 1970s. Matia termed him the "real famine fighter" and called on scientists in the audience to work hard especially with regard to the quick adoption of new technologies in agriculture. She also said there would be no further rise in wheat production unless heat and drought tolerant varieties are developed. She underscored the need too for large scale tropical sugar beet cultivation instead of long duration sugarcane cultivation. Scientist Kazi Badruddoza, who worked closely with Borlaug in Bangladesh, recalled those days and the great scientist's contribution to agricultural research in the country. FAO representative Ad Spijkers referred to an estimate of the Rockefeller Foundation, that about half the world's population goes to bed every night after consuming grain descended from one of the high-yield varieties developed by Borlaug and his colleagues of the Green Revolution. Borlaug won the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace by ensuring food security through greater food production. He died on Sept 12 aged 95
