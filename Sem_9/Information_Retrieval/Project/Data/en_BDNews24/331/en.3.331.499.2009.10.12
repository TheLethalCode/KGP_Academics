 Dhaka, Oct 11(bdnews24.com)Stringent action is being taken against those polluting the environment, the state minister for land said on Sunday. Some 104 mills and factories around Dhaka and its surrounding districts have been sued for contaminating the environment, Mostafizur Rahman said in the House. Initiative has been taken to amend Bangladesh Enviroment Protection Law-1995 for checking sound pollution, he said as he was taking questions on behalf of state minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud. Answering a question from ruling Awami League MP Mahmud Us Samad Chowdhury from Sylhet-3, the minister said a notice had been served against eight industries for fining them after assessing the losses in terms of money in line with section 7 of Environment Protection Law-1995. Fixing losses caused by other 40 industries are underway, he said. Replying to a query from Aslamul Haque from Dhaka-14, he said effective measures are being launched against industries responsible for environment pollution in the capital. In line with High Court verdict, all the tanneries of Hazaribagh would be shifted beyond the capital by Feb 28 next year, he said. To a query from Benazir Ahmed from Dhaka-20, the minister said desertification process looms large in northeastern part of the country when water flow wanes during dry season thanks to the influence of Farraka Barrage. The saline water of the sea enters into the rivers in the southern parts of the country when flow of sweet water wanes during dry season, he said As a result, agriculture and fish production are declining sharply, he said and added excessive silt fills the river bed due to lean flow of river water. To a question from Harunur Rahid from Chandpur-4, the minister said initiative had been undertaken to amend Bangladesh Environment Protection Law-1995 to control sound pollution. Necessary steps have been launched to promptly try the perpetrators by bringing the provisions under mobile court. bdnews24.
