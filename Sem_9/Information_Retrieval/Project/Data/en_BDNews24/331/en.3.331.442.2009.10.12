The speaker went up to the media gallery in the afternoon and said, "I have become grandfather and there is arrangements for sweets for you." On Sunday, he vented his anger over the absence of senior ministers and ruling party MPs. Pointing to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, he said, "I cannot take the matter easy."
