 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  Marcus Trescothick, the former England batsman, has been named the Professional Cricketers' Association's Player of the Year. He had earlier scooped the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year award as well, reports Cricinfo. The opening batsman topped the overall scoring charts in the county championship with 1817 runs, including eight centuries, at an average of 75.70 and helped Somerset finish third. He was in top form in the other formats as well, finishing the season with a total of 2934 runs across all competitions. Trescothick, who quit the England team in the 2006-07 Ashes tour due to a stress-related illness, is currently in India for the Champions League. He was also named in the PCA Team of the Year alongside England players Andrew Strauss, Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Jonathan Trott. Another player picking up the awards after a strong county season is Leicestershire's 19-year-old batsman, James Taylor. He scored 1,177 first-class runs in 16 matches at an average of 58.85. That haul included three hundreds and six fifties, with a highest score of 207 not out against Surrey at The Oval in July. Last month he had picked up the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year award, beating all-rounder Stuart Broad to the prize. 2009 PCA awards: Player of the Year: Marcus Trescothick (Somerset) Young Player of the Year: James Taylor (Leicestershire) ECB Special Award: Michael Vaughan Special Merit Award: Andrew Strauss Umpire of the Year: Richard Kettleborough Sixes League: Dwayne Smith Impossible is Nothing Award: Graham Stevenson Team of the Year 2009: Marcus Trescothick (Somerset), Andrew Strauss (captain - Middlesex & England), Jonathan Trott (Warwickshire & England), Ed Joyce (Sussex), Ian Blackwell (Durham), Craig Kieswetter (Somerset), James Foster (wicketkeeper - Essex), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire & England), James Tredwell (Kent), Graham Onions (Durham & England), Steve Kirby (Gloucestersh
