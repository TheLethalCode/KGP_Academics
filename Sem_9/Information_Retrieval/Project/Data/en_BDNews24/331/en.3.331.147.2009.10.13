 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 30,000 telephone numbers under Moghbazar Telephone Exchange, beginning with digits 93, have gone out of order due to "technical glitches", a BTCL official said Tuesday. Mir Mohammad Morshed, a deputy director at BTCL, told bdnews24.com late Tuesday evening that the problem with the numbers had begun sometime after 4pm. "A technical glitch occurred in the Switch Room of Moghbazar Telephone Exchange," he said. Morshed said work was on to repair the telephone line with assistance over the phone of officials of French company Alcatel that equipped the telephone exchange. "In addition, local Alcatel agents are now on the scene." "The telephone numbers should be operative very soon," he said at around 10.30pm. He added, another series, numbers starting with 83, under the same exchange were not affected and are in working order. bd
