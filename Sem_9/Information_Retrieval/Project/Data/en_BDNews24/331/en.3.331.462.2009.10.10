 BEIJING, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea wants better ties with the United States, Japan and South Korea, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on Saturday, days after he visited Pyongyang for talks, adding that time for making progress was limited. "North Korea does not only hope to improve relations with the United States, it also hopes to do so with South Korea and Japan," Wen told a news conference on Saturday after a summit with Japan and South Korea. "This is the deepest impression I got from my visit." Leaders from the three countries met in Beijing on Saturday. Wen visited North Korea in recent days. The North's supreme leader Kim Jong-il made a heavily hedged statement that he could return to six-party nuclear disarmament negotiations, but made bilateral talks with the United States his priority. Wen said there was limited time for progress in the dispute, and said Beijing would welcome "conscientious" two-way talks between Pyongyang and Washington. After Wen spoke, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said he welcomed the idea of Seoul having its own two-way talks with North Korea. "I welcome the idea. But the final purpose of any talks between South and North Korea should be denuclearisation of North Korea.
