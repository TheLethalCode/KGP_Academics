 Narayanganj, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Residents of three five-storied buildings in densely populated Hajiganj, in Narayanganj district, are evacuating after two of the buildings began tilting dangerously towards one another. Most of the residents left, terrorised, after noticing the tilt on Saturday evening. More families left on Sunday morning with their possessions. Fire service officers said the buildings sank 1 foot beneath the ground as they were constructed on land acquired by filling ponds and water bodies with sand. They are under severe risk. District administration advised people not to panic as necessary steps are being taken about the buildings. Witnessed told bdnews24.com that on Saturday evening residents of the area noticed that school teacher Hosne Ara's five-storied building tilted into Dubai-resident 'Ashraf''s building in the south and Italy-resident Bhulu Mia's building tilted into the building from the east. Hundreds of people crowded to see the three buildings. High officials of the district administration and police rushed to the site on getting news. They tensed seeing the situation and ordered the families residing in the building to evacuate. Extra police were assigned to protect the possessions left behind. Mir Abu Touhid, assistant superintendent of police (ASP), told reporters that tilted buildings are in a risky state. "The residents have been instructed to evacuate the buildings. Police have been assigned on site to protect properties in the buildings. Roushan Ara Begum, resident of second floor of Bhulu Mia's building, said, "We spent the night in panic in the tilted building. The fear of the building collapsing worked through the night. I will be relieved if I can leave the building with my children." Shamsuddin Ahmed, a neighbour, said, "Some families are still living in the building risking their lives." He also said, "Hosne Ara Begum built a four-storey building in 2001. But later she constructed another floor on that." A visit to the tilted buildings revealed big cracks in the roof and walls on the fifth floor. The building's second to fourth floor are now leaning into Ashraf's building. Ashraf said that his five-storied building is fine. He constructed the five-storied building on a foundational structure for six storeys. Bhulu Mia's building also leaned into the building from the east and so, the building is in risk, he added. The tenants of the building have already been evacuated, he added. Hosne Ara Begum declined comments. Aminul Islam Khan, executive engineer of Naryanganj's Public Works Department, said, "The owners and the tenants of the buildings have been told to evacuate the building for safety measure. But chances of a big accident are slim." Deputy commissioner Shamsur Rahman said, "Rajuk chairman has been informed of the incident. Rajuk will send a specialists' team to observe and analyse the buildings. We will act according to their suggestions." Police superintendent Biswas Afzal Hossain visited the site. bdne
