 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)--Heavy interest rates on housing loans are making flats unaffordable for middle-class buyers, a real estate developer has said. "Current average interest rate on housing loans of various banks is 13 percent. It is too heavy for middle-class buyers. But the special package loan on 1200 square feet flats offered by Bangladesh Bank has an interest rate of 9 percent," Toufiq M Seraj, managing director of Sheltech Ltd, said. Seraj, a former president of Real Estate & Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB), said all housing loans on all flat sizes should be 9 percent. "Flats are still unaffordable for middle class buyers. They need flats the most. And the government should take measures as developer companies cannot do anything on their own. "It is only possible if the government, developers and customers work together," he said at a news conference on various aspects of 'Sheltech Housing Fair2009' at "Sheltech Lounge" in Panthapath. The fair from Oct 1519 will be held at Panthapath Sheltech Tower daily from 10am to 7pm. Sharif Hossain Bhuiyan, head of operation, and Mushfiqur Rahman Khan, deputy general manager of sales, along with others, answered questions of journalists. Seraj said "During the tenure of the caretaker government in 2007-08, growth of flat sales decreased. We hoped for an increase after a political government came to power. "But it is not as much as we predicted. Still it is a big step that buyers have regained their urge to invest." bd
