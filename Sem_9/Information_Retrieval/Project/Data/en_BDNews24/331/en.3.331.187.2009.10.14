 MOSCOW, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds meetings involving local people in Moscow and Kazan on Wednesday to demonstrate a US wish to reset relations with Russia as a whole. But she failed to win specific pledges from Moscow on tougher sanctions against Iran if Tehran does not allay concerns that it wants to build a nuclear bomb. Clinton, finishing a European trip that included stops in Zurich, London and Belfast, will hold a town hall-style meeting at Moscow State University and fly to the ethnically diverse Republic of Tatarstan to hold a "roundtable" discussion. President Barack Obama has said he wants the United States to improve its relationship with the Russian government as well as its people, and Clinton's trip has worked to achieve that. The planned back-and-forth with a local audience, a campaign-like format that has become a hallmark of Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, may give Russians a chance to express views on US policies and practices they do not like. International issues dominated talks Clinton held with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and President Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday. Clinton failed to win specific pledges from Moscow on tougher sanctions against Iran if Tehran does not allay concerns that it wants to build a nuclear bomb. A US official said, however, that Medvedev reiterated his stance that sanctions would be necessary if Iran did not fulfil promises it made to world powers at a meeting in Geneva. HUMAN RIGHTS Human rights -- another issue where Washington and Moscow have often disagreed -- also came up in Clinton's meetings with leaders and could draw attention at Wednesday's events. "It's not only because we believe that universal values support human rights being recognised and respected, but we think that it's in the best interests for economic growth and political stability," Clinton said on Tuesday when asked to spell out the U.S. strategy over the issue in Russia. Clinton's trip to Kazan in Russia's Republic of Tatarstan is also meant to illustrate how people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds can live together. More than 10,000 people of eight different nationalities live in the republic, according to its official web site. More than half the population practices Islam, while Orthodox Christianity is the other main religion there. Philip Gordon, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, told reporters before the trip that Clinton hoped to learn about Kazan's experience in fostering tolerance and promoting interfaith dialogue. "The Secretary will be hoping to gain a better understanding of what's worked well in Tatarstan's development and solicit advice from religious leaders, young Muslims ... and civil society representatives on how to apply the lessons from their experience in other societies," he said
