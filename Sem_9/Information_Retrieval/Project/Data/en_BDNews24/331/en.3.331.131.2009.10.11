Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military cooperation, including Israeli air force training in Turkish air space. The two countries also share intelligence and have strong trade ties, including the sale of important military equipment. Relations were strained after Erdogan publicly criticized Israel over the Gaza campaign and walked out on Israeli President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in January.

A Palestinian rights group says 1,417 Palestinians, including 926 civilians, were killed in the war.

Fourteen Israelis were killed during the conflict which Israel launched with the declared aim of curtailing cross-border rocket attacks from the Gaza St
