 Khagrachhari, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)The United People's Democratic Front on Friday called for an indefinite general strike beginning on Saturday at Lakkhichhari Upazila in Khagrachhari to press its demand for withdrawal of an army and a police officers. Aung Grojai, UPDF's Khagrachhari district chapter leader, told bdnews24.com on Friday night the shutdown will be enforced for the withdrawal of Khagrachhari region captain lieutenant colonel Sharif Ahmed and Lakkhichhari Upazila Police chief Farid Ahmed after they had stopped the UPDF doing organisational work. Mithun Chakma, president of the UPDF's associate organisation Democratic Youth Forum said the general strike would continue until the two officers were withdrawn. Lt col Sharif Ahmed could not be contacted. UPDF leaders alleged that they had been barred by members of Chittagong Hill Tracts National Forum (CHTNF) and then army and police men as they had been on the way to attend the cremation ceremony of former central UPDF leader Ruikhoi Marma. The CHTNF is an army-backed organisation, they claimed. UPDF leader Angya Marma said Ruikhoi Marma was killed by local 'Mukhosh Bahini' (masked force) on Oct 2. The UPDF, which is opposed to the 1997 peace agreement between the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity and the 1996-2001 Awami League government, has been campaigning for full autonomy in CHT. The Awami League, now heading a broad coalition government installed on Jan 6 this year , withdrew a complete brigade, including three infantry battalions, in Sept. Thirty-five camps of security forces have also been withdrawn. Khagrachhari's UPDF leader Ang Grojai also said the CHTNF members intercepted them at the UPDF office of Lakshmichhari Upazila Bazaar at midday on the way to Ruikhoi's house. Later, lt col Sharif and Farid went to the UPDF office and suggested that they had better not attend the ceremony, he said. They provoked the inhabitants of clustered villages to harass them after failing to cajole them to not go there, he also alleged. UPDF leader Milon Chakma said they had at least six workers injured in the attack by CHTNF leaders and workers.The injured were Nenson Chakma, 20, Pratul Chakma, 18, Mongsajai Marma, 22, Minoti Chakma, 15, Joya Chakma, 14 and Zico Chakma, 25. Three of their activists--Rumi Chakma, 14, Chanchana Chakma, 15, and Paitui Chakma, 23, were also missing, Grojai claimed. Lakkhichhari Upazila chairman Ramrachai Chowdhury said the CHTNF members had detained him in his room from Thursday morning to midday. Police later rescued him. "I myself am suffering from insecurity. Lieutenant colonel Sharif should be withdrawn immediately." bdnews24.c
