<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to withdraw another 297 cases, filed for 'political persecution', among a total of 4,433 applications from district-level committees, the state minister for law has said. The decision was made at the eighth meeting of the scrutiny committee for recommendation, Quamrul Islam, also the committee's chairman, told reporters on Tuesday. Of the total 297 cases, 270 were filed under the penal code and 27 by the Anticorruption Commission, Islam said, taking the tally of cases withdrawn to 875 in eight phases. Some 683 cases were placed before the meeting, among which 37 were filed by the ACC and 646 under the panel code. Tuesday's recommendations to withdraw ACC cases were against Chittagong mayor A B M Mohiuddin Chowdhury, former minister Mosharraf Hossain, Jatiya Party chairman H M Ershad and secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawlader. Cases field under the penll code includes BNP's Tarique Rahman, fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas, Awami League's Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim MP, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir MP, Mofazzal Hossian Chowdhury Maya MP, Elias Uddin Mollah MP, Hazi Mohammed Selim and Sayeed Khokon, and NGO Proshika's former chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed. The committee suggested withdrawal of one case against each of them. This is the second case to be dropped against a BNP leader, after the scrutiny committee in its sixth meeting decided to cancel a case against BNP MP Moudud Ahmed for keeping foreign alcohol. On the cancellation of case against Tarique, also senior joint secretary general of BNP, Islam said: "We have got the application to drop the case. We have decided to withdraw the case considering that it was filed for political harassment." While asked about not withdrawing the case against Khaleda on Niko corruption case, where prime minister Sheikh Hasina is also accused, Islam said, "We don't have any application to withdraw the case against the opposition leader." The committee has already recommended for withdrawing the case against Hasina. The state minister after the seventh meeting said the committee would make a positive decision if Khaleda and her two sons Tarique and Arafat Rahman Coco applied for withdrawal of their cases provided they are "really politically harassed". Regarding the case against Ershad, the state minister said, "It was filed with the Anti-Corruption Bureau long time ago and was politically motivated." In reply to a question about considering political identity while recommending, Islam said, "We're suggesting withdrawal of those cases we believe were filed for political harassment. We'll also consider the cases coming up later." Many cases were filed against the AL leaders and supporters during 2001-2007, he said and claimed that no harassment cases were filed during the incumbent government. Islam said, "Among the Anticorruption Commission cases two were rejected as those cannot be withdrawn and eight cases would be presented in the next meeting for scrutiny." Among the cases under the panel code, 12 were rejected and 364 would be brought in the next meeting, he added. The Awami League-led government, soon after assuming office in January, announced that it would look into cases filed under past administrations against politicians and others for "political harassment only". The government invited applications seeking cancellation of such cases from February, forming district-level vetting committees and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The deadline for applications was extended three times up to July 12. The scrutiny committee has so far recommended 578 cases to be quashed, and 14 to be partially withdrawn, since its first sitting. Its first meeting, on June 10, recommended withdrawal of 62 cases, including 12 against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. On June 21, it approved another 46 cases to be cancelled. In its third meeting on July 1, the committee recommended quashing another 66 cases. On July 15 it recommended 69 cases be cancelled. On Aug 5, in its fifth meeting, the committee recommended cancellation of 121 cases, on Aug 26 in its sixth meeting, it recommended withdrawal of 105 cases and on Sept 16 in its seventh meeting, it recommended another 123 cases. Most of the cases to be quashed were filed against leaders of the ruling Awami League and its associate organisations. bdnew
