 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has rejected bail sought by controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun in a tax dodge case. Amar Kumar Roy of the Second Special Judge's Court made the order on Tuesday and set Nov 15 for hearing on framing charges against Mamun. Mamun was produced before the court from jail. According to case details, Mamun, a close friend and business partner of Tarique Rahman, elder son of main opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia, submitted a false statement of income tax by concealing income of Tk 54 crore from 2001-02 to 2006-07 tax year while he was director of Unitex Apparels. He also evaded tax to the tune of Tk 14 crore on his concealed income. Deputy tax commissioner Ayesha Siddika Shelly filed the case against Mamun on Aug 26. The Supreme Court on Sunday halted a High Court order until Oct 18 that granted him bail in four cases. Joint forces arrested Mamun on Jan 30, 2007
