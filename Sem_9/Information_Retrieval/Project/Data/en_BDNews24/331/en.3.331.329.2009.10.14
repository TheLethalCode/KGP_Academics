 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange on Wednesday touched an all-time high after topping Tk 12 billion. The premier bourse's benchmark general index also touched a new high, closing at 3296 points, after it topped 3280 points on Tuesday. The daily transaction surged to Tk 12.01 billion, increasing by a billion from the previous day. The previous turnover high was at Tk 11.49 billion on July 2. Wednesday's high was backed by a huge trading in Bex Tex with turnover of Tk 820 million and state-owned energy entities, Titas Gas and Jamuna Oil, whose turnovers crossed Tk 500 million. Experts said increased participation by both retail and institutional investors caused the market to surge. "But, hypes did not follow fundamentals, posing a disturbing sign for long-term investments," Salahuddin Ahmed, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange, said. He added that a lot of new investors have entered in the market over the last two months, lured by the Grameenphone floating. "Those funds are pouring in, creating a bubble." The market is getting overheated with all this new funds and would definitely have to go through a correction, said Khan. "If the correction means a hard landing, it would hit the small-scale investors hard." He suggested careful consideration on putting money on issues at the moment.
