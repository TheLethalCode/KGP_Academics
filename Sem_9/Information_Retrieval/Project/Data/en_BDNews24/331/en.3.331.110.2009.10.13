 MUMBAI, Oct 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's economy will grow slightly less than expected this year as the weakest monsoon in nearly 40 years weighs on the agriculture sector, but growth will pick up next year in line with a global recovery, a Reuters poll shows. Asia's third-largest economy is expected to grow 6.0 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2010, the slowest in seven years and down from a forecast of 6.3 percent in a similar Reuters poll three months ago. But analysts now expect growth in 2010/11 will accelerate to 7.5 percent, up from a previous forecast of 7.2 percent and boosting the chances of interest rate hikes next year. The government expects growth of 6.3 percent or higher this year, accelerating to around 7 percent in 2010/11. The economy grew 6.7 percent in 2008/09, slowing from rates of 9 percent or more in the previous three years, as the global credit crisis and business slowdown hit harder than expected. "Agriculture will certainly act as a dampener (this year)," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. "Though the direct impact of agriculture on the overall GDP growth is not much, the indirect impact on rural consumption, allied activities, services and industrial sector could be significant." June-September monsoon rains were 23 percent below normal, the weakest since 1972, and the prospect of smaller harvests pushed food prices up an annual 15.5 percent in late September. Wholesale price inflation, the most watched price barometer in India, is forecast to accelerate from an average of 2.8 percent in 2009/10 to 6.0 percent in 2010/11 as economic activity picks up domestically and globally. Analysts had expected lower levels of 2.0 and 5.5 percent, respectively, in the previous poll. The combination of strengthening growth and rising inflation has analysts expecting that by early 2010 the Reserve Bank of India will start unwinding some of the stimulus measures taken in late 2008 and early 2009, although it has said it will ensure that the recovery is secure before beginning to hike rates. The poll forecasts interest rates will rise in the first quarter of fiscal 2010/11, a few months sooner than expected in the previous poll. The rupee, which was quoted at 46.11 to the US dollar on Tuesday, is set to appreciate by 5 percent between now and the end of fiscal 2010/11, the poll sh
