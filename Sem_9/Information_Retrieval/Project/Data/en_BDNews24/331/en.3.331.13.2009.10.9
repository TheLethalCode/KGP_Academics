 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com) Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said Friday the Nobel Committee had sent a "powerful message" to the world by naming US president Barack Obama the 2009 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, "Obama represented hope around the world and had "changed the leadership of the world," the 2006 Nobel peace winner said, according to Middle East Online. Yunus, who is dubbed as 'the banker to the poor, won the peace prize along with his Grameen Bank in 2006 because of his contribution to lift millions of people out of extreme poverty. "Barack Obama has taken the world and put it back on the right track, in terms of nuclear disarmament, in terms of bringing peace in Iraq and in terms of multilateral diplomacy," the 69-year-old Yunus said. "He has excited the young people of the world. There's now meaning and direction for the world." "It's an endorsement of him and the direction he is taking. It's as much about what he will achieve as what he has already achieved. It's a powerful message that the peace prize has given." In August, Obama presented Yunus with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in Washington
