 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Ziaur Rahman was probably involved in the incidents of Aug 15, 1975 that left independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman killed, the Supreme Court heard on Thursday. Death convict retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin made the inference in his confessional statement in 1996 that Zia had a hand in the events since he did not take punitive measures against Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman and Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan who had been involved. . The statement that Mohiuddin (artillery) gave on Nov 27 that year before then additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Habibur Rahman was delivered before the five-judge Appellate Division bench now hearing the appeals of five convicts for a reversal of their death sentences. Mohiuddin also said discontent was raging in the army at the time and a rebellion was in the offing. Faruk and Shahriar had been keeping in contact with then army chief of staff Zia to tackle the situation, but Zia expressed his inability. Barrister Abdullah al Mamun read out from the paperbook--which included statements of witnesses and defendants, First Information Report, charge sheet, verdicts of the trial and higher courts, among other things--during the fourth day's hearing that resumed at 9:50am amid tight security. At the hearing, adjourned until 9:30am on Sunday, the court warned barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts retired major Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin, to be careful in delivering briefings on the appeals hearing. It also asked the media to present authentic reports on the proceedings. The court at Tuesday's hearing had asked the media and lawyers to be careful in delivering briefing. Barrister Mamun told reporters after the hearing that he had finished until page 1140 of the paperbook at Thursday's hearing. "I have finished reading of the ruling by Justice Md Ruhul Amin and started the ruling by Justice ABM Khairul Haque," he said. "I have read out the confessional statements by convicts Faruk Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and artillery Mohiuddin Ahmed. Faruk gave a briefing on the night before Aug 15, the lawyer said. He (Faruk) said in the briefing: 'The country cannot be run that way. If it continues the country will go under the rule of India. "Under the circumstances, Bangabandhu will be brought to the Racecourse ground or any other ground and asked to deliver a speech. "If any obstruction comes, Bangabandhu will be killed," Faruk said. Anisul Haque, chief state counsel, said: "The court has asked the media not to publish any imaginary statement regarding this important case. "The defence counsel and the media concerned have been warned on the matter," Haque said. The court heard the ruling by Justice Ruhul Amin on convicts Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. A security archway was set up at the entrance to the trial room as part of heightened security measures considering the sensitivity of the case and . "After the defence is done with their arguments the prosecution will start delivering its explanations. Then the court will give its ruling," attorney general Mahbubey Alam said on Wednesday. Barrister Mamun said on Wednesday the court did not accept convict retired lieutenant colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan's confessional statement. "He was awarded death sentence after he was found guilty based on other evidence," Mamun said. There were different witnesses' accounts about the dress of Bazlul Huda, he said. On lancer Mohiuddin he said: "Those who were at Dhanmondi 32 house that night could not identify Mohiudin. He was given death sentence based on testimony of other witnesses." On retired lieutenant colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), Mamun said: "The trial was held in his absence. One witness identified Lancer Mohiuddin for Artillery Mohiuddin." There were discrepancies in the accounts given by the witnesses, the lawyer said. Mamun said then army chief major general K M Shafiullah and col Shafayet Jamil had said in their statement parade was mandatory at night twice in a month until before Aug 15. Justice Ruhul Amin in his ruling said attending the parade cannot be termed as conspiracy, he said. On the second day, the court had asked all including the media and lawyers to be careful in delivering briefings on the hearing. Alam, the attorney general, told reporters after Tuesday's hearing that statements were being delivered in talk shows on the merit of the case. "This should not take place during an ongoing trial." The freshly formed bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing appeals on Mujib murder case on Monday. Earlier on Sunday, Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons.

Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding.
