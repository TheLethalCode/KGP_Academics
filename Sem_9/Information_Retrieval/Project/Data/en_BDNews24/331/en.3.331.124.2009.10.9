 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have softened their conditions and processes regarding loan assistance for Bangladesh, the finance minister said Friday. The WB has set Bangladesh free to spend its unused $ 1.7 billion, stuck for different conditions, on any project it wants, A M A Muhith told reporters at the ZIA International Airport, after returning from two key international conferences in Cyprus and Turkey. "Officials at the WB-IMF annual meeting, upon our request, have said that they would soften conditions for Bangladesh. Along with that they have permitted us to spend the idle $ 1.7 billion on any project." The fund, due to non-compliance of different conditions, was not used, he added. The minister also said that WB has promised increased assistance to deal with the affects of the global recession. "They did not say anything about the size of the assistance, but promised extra funds for development projects including the Padma Bridge." Muhith said that the IMF usually provides fund to stabilise a country's balance of payments (BoPs). "Recently, they (IMF) have helped us with $ 300 million; our balance of payment is quite good now. I have told the IMF that we don't need their assistance at this moment." A high-level six-member delegation from Bangladesh, led by Muhith, left on Sep 30 to join the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Conference and the Annual General Meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Commonwealth finance ministers sat in Limasol, Cyprus, from Sept 30 to Oct 3, while the Turkish city of Istanbul, hosted the WB-IMF annual meeting on Oct 6 and Oct 7. Muhith said that both conferences focused on the ongoing global recession. "The developed nations have been quite affected by the recession, some of the countries witnessed a 20 percent or more fall in employment. Business and investment situation are not well also. "It seems that the recession would take time to fade out," he said, while sharing his experience with the media. Representatives from different nations recommended "stimulus packages" to face this disaster. "Bangladesh also needs to be cautious about the downturn." The delegation included Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, finance secretary Mohammmad Tareq, Economic Relations Division secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan and prime minister's economic affairs adviser Moshiur Rahman. bdn
