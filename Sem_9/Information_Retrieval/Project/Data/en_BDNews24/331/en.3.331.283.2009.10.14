<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com) A human-rights organisation has filed a contempt of court petition against Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka charging him with overlooking High Court orders. Advocate Asaduzaman Siddiqui filed the petition on behalf of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, urging the High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam to draw contempt proceedings against Khoka. The hearing is likely to take place on Thursday afternoon, Siddiqui's lawyer advocate Manjil Morshed said. According to the allegation, the High Court on June 29 ordered the Dhaka mayor to take effective measure not to set up cattle markets on roads and open places before the Eid-ul-Azha and remove animal wastes 24 hours into their slaughter. The court had also asked the mayor to inform it by Oct 11 about the implementation of the directives. But the mayor did not do so, it said. bdne
