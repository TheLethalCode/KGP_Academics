 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid Tuesday came to the rescue of his 'corrupt' predecessor, Mohammed Jamiruddin Sircar, by refusing to allow MPs to vote on a proposal to strip him of his membership on charges a parliamentary probe found true. In a landmark ruling, the speaker said: "There is no specific provision in our constitution or rules of procedure for cancelling membership of an MP for these sort of offences." But the House unanimously passed a set of resolutions which included referring the charges against Sircar, now a BNP MP, to the Anticorruption Commission for further action. Parliament also asked the government to realise Tk 1.75 crore from Sircar, former deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain for "unauthorised" use of public money. It proposed that the ACC should also take up the allegations against Siddiqui and Hossain for further investigation. Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon MP presented the proposal to the House for cancelling Sircar's membership. He also suggested that the House should ask the authorities to realise the "unauthorised" expenses from the three BNP leaders and scrap all "illegal appointments" in the parliament secretariat. Menon also said departmental cases should be filed against those public servants who were found involved in the corruption of the three leaders during the eighth parliament. "The other proposals may be adopted," said Hamid, whereupon the MPs shouted out 'Yes!' for their adoption. Speaker Hamid in the face of demands by MPs formed an 11-member probe-body on March 19, headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, to inquire into the charges of corruption, misuse of authority and public funds against Sircar, Siddiqui and Hossain. The probe committee on July 9 submitted its long report recommending cancellation of Sircar's membership. bdnews24.
