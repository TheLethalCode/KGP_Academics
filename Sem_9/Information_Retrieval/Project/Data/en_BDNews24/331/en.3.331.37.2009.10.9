 LOS ANGELES, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actress Elizabeth Taylor said on Thursday that her heart surgery went off "perfectly," saying that "it's like having a brand new ticker." Taylor, 77, made the announcement on her Twitter page, which has replaced her publicist as her primary form of communication. She revealed on Tuesday that she would be entering an undisclosed hospital for the procedure. The surgery involved implanting a clip to prevent blood leaking back into her heart through the mitral valve. "Dear Friends, My heart procedure went off perfectly," she wrote. "It's like having a brand new ticker. Thank you for your prayers and good wishes. I know they all helped. Love you, Elizabeth." Taylor was diagnosed with congestive heart failure five years ago and also has endured severe back problems and a benign brain tumor operation. She often uses a wheelchair in her rare public appearances
