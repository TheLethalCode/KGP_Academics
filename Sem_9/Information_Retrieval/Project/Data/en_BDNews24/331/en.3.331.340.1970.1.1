<TITLE> BNP wants 'proper experts' for UN arbitration process </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka,Oct10 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP has called for involvement of experienced individuals for winning "the battle" over maritime boundaries with India and Myanmar through the recently announced UN arbitration process. It also urged formation of a team of independent experts for resolving the Tipaimukh Dam issue with India. On Bangladesh's move for UN arbitration over the sea border disputes, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said, "It would have been much better if the government had initiated the steps much earlier." "India and Myanmar will naturally prioritise their own interests. It was not right for us to think of gaining anything from them through diplomacy." "We must try heart and soul to win the arbitration by employing efficient and experienced experts," said the senior opposition figure, whose party has refused to attend parliament for the past two sessions over a seating dispute. Foreign minister Dipu Moni announced last Thursday that the government had opted for compulsory arbitration as Bangladesh had failed to resolve the disputes with the two neighbouring countries in the past 35 years. She told newsmen on Saturday that settling the maritime boundary disputes with India and Myanmar is critical for Bangladesh's progress. She said, "Progress according to our development plans and ensuring best use of our limited resources requires retrieval of mineral resources from the sea." "It is critical that we settle sea boundary disputes with India and Myanmar." Dipu Moni said, as per UN practice, a decision, which would be final under international law, was likely to come in four to five years from initiating the arbitration process. The demarcation would establish Dhaka's right to extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal. The foreign minister disclosed the arbitration decision a day after prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament that her government would extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal. The government has recently awarded the three offshore blocks to two foreign companies for oil and exploration, with a provision that no exploration can take place in any disputed waters of the blocks. The government endorsed proposals in August on leasing out blocks 5, 10 and 11 to US-based ConocoPhillips and Irish company Tullow Oil. But India has since raised questions over blocks deep sea blocks 5 and 10 and Myanmar has disputed shallow sea block 11 on the grounds of their sea boundary being breached. 'A Tipaimukh expert team' Delwar also told reporters at the party headquarters at Naya Paltan in the capital on Saturday, "We will join the proposed committee on the Tipaimukh Dam if it is made up of neutral, non-partisan and internationally renowned experts." "BNP will not be there if the committee is formed with people loyal to any party," he said. "Earlier, we urged the government to send a neutral expert team to visit the project but they did not pay heed to us," "Rather they sent a parliamentary delegation who submitted a 'yes report'," Delwar said. He said the Tipaimukh Dam would "expose Bangladesh to another terrible disaster". "It will be another death trap like Farraka Dam." "India is turning a deaf ear to the serious possible consequences that might loom large following construction of the Tipaimukh Dam," he said Abdul Razzaque MP, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources, said on Friday that the government would form an expert team without consulting BNP unless they returned to parliament. On Tuesday, the parliamentary committee presented its report on the Tipaimukh Dam to the House, on findings of the parliamentary delegation that visited the Indian dam site earlier this year. b
