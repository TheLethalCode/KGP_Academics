 Chitagong, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Eshaq Brothers Industries Ltd, the controversial manager for handling the container terminal at Chittagong port, on Monday asked for Tk 25 crore in damages for the cancelled contract with Chittagong Port Authority. In a letter, it also threatened the CPA with legal actions if the money is not paid by 15 days. The CPA last Thursday cancelled the contract eight months into the signing of the deal following the recommendations by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry. The day before, the cabinet committee on economic affairs approved the recommendation of the standing committee to let Saif Power Tech to handle CCT until Nov 10. Managing director of Eshaq, Haji Mohammad Younus, issued the letter to CPA on Sunday. It said the compensation was asked to meet the loss against investment in manpower, machinery, and damage to goodwill and business. The management denied the complaints against them regarding the tender. The letter said the firm had been successfully managing a private container depot with modern machinery. Some 2,00,000 containers were handled in the depot in 2008. So the 'complaints of not being skilled' against them was illogical and baseless. The CPA signed the deal with Eshaq Brothers for CCT operations in Feb 2, 2009. Former shipping adviser to the caretaker government M A Matin illegally awarded the contract to the 'novice' firm. The standing committee found "massive irregularities" done by Matin and eight others on the last day of his office on Jan 6. Committee chairman Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury said the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. The government awarded Saif the contract to operate the port for another month in the fourth phase. The company was earlier given work contract to handle the CCT even after its term expired in June. The parliamentary probe body accused Matin of violating government rule in awarding the contract. It alleged that false certificate was given in favour of Eshaq. The Anticorruption Commission on Sept 30 quizzed him over the charges. Matin claimed himself innocent at the hearing and said his move saved public funds. The standing committee found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Eshaq after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the committee said. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the CPA awarded the work to Eshaq at 9pm when the new government was taking oath at the Bangabhaban. bdnews24.com
