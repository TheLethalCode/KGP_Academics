 Kushtia, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  A suspected extremist was killed in an encounter with police at Kumarkhali upazila in Kushtia on Monday. Police said 42-year old Ajbahar alias Bahar was a commander of outlawed extremist group called Gano Muktifouj. Some 26 people were killed in gunfight with law enforcers in the district in last one and a half months. Kushtia general circle assistant superintendent of police CA Halim told bdnews24.com that acting on a tip-off about a secret meeting of the group at the Koya College ground in Koya village under Kunarkhali upazila, a joint team of detectives and police raided the spot at around 4:30am. Sensing the presence of the law enforcers the criminals fired shots, forcing the police team to retaliate, Halim claimed. Bahar was shot dead at one stage of the shootout, he said. Police recovered two shutter guns and four rounds of bullet from the scene. Kumarkhali police chief Liakat Hossain told bdnews24.com that Bahar was an accused in a case involving murder of Kumarkhali upazila Awami League leader and Koya Union Parishad chairman Jamil Hasan Bachchu. Bahar faced 12 cases, including murder and extortion cases, the police official said. The number of people killed in such encounters appears to be on the rise despite criticisms from human-rights organisations, who have expressed concern over extra judicial killings. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. Home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Huq Tuku, however, have claimed that no extra-judicial killings were taking place. They said that law enforcers only resort to firing in self defence when they come under attack. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called crossfire or encounters should not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in or out of custody. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February this year that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. bdnew
