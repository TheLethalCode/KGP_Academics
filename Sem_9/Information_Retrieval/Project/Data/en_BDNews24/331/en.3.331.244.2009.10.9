 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Maradona fights for his future as Argentina's World Cup coach when he sends his team out against Peru on Saturday. Maradona, whose side are flirting with elimination in a playoff berth, believes his players will get the victories they need to remain on course for the 2010 finals in South Africa. "I didn't expect to get to a situation like this. We have to beat Peru and then win in Uruguay," Maradona told a news conference on Thursday. "As a coach these are surely (my toughest matches) and I have a lot of confidence in myself," said Argentina's 1986 World Cup-winning captain.

With Aimar's Benfica team-mate Angel Di Maria back on the left wing after a four-match suspension, only Barcelona's Lionel Messi is set to keep his place in attack from the team that lost the last three qualifiers, scoring one goal, against Ecuador, Brazil and Paraguay. "He's our ace of spades," said Maradona. Maradona said he expected Peru, bottom of the group and out of the running, to be dangerous in attack but "when they defend they are not so secure". Reports have come out of Peru of financial incentives for the Peruvian players to beat Argentina. With Brazil and Paraguay already qualified, five other nations are vying for two automatic berths and the playoff place. "There's no money that can buy you glory," Maradona said. "In the match, when it's eleven against eleven, (the Argentine players) play for their li
