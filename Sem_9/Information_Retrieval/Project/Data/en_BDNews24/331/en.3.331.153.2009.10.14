 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)--A parliamentary watchdog has alleged the Biman Bangladesh Airlines management had resorted to "irregularities" in the tendering process for taking lease of two aircraft for Dhaka-New York routes. The parliamentary standing committee on civil aviation ministry at its meeting on Wednesday recommended cancelling the lease agreement with the company, Euro Atlantic, if Biman failed to resume Dhaka-New York route by Oct 26. The committee members said if Biman went ahead with the lease agreement, the country would have to count a staggering $76 million a year in losses. Civil aviation minister G M Quader termed the allegations "correct" and said his ministry had nothing to do as Biman was an autonomous public limited company. "There are massive irregularities in the tendering process. The company is going to supply aircraft with poor facilities and specifications," Moinuddin Khan Badal, a committee member, told journalists after the meeting at parliament building. "As per the terms and conditions of the tender, the suppliers are to provide Boeing 777-200-ER version, but they are going to supply Boeing 777-200 version--a poor version," said Badal. "The committee has recommended Biman float fresh tender if it fails to relaunch Dhaka-New York route by the Oct 26 deadline," he said. Badal told journalists that the operation costs of Boeing 777-200, which would be supplied to Biman in place of Boeing 777-200-ER, were much higher and would make the route a loss-making one. Committee chairman Mosharraf Hossain, a former civil aviation minister, was also present at the press briefing at the parliament's media centre. "As per the Biman's papers presented to the standing committee, we have to accept annual loss of 76 million US dollars," Quader told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "My ministry has formally opposed this lease move of Biman," the minister said. "Biman is a public limited company. Its chairman and board of directors are totally independent of the ministry. "So, I cannot take responsibility for any irregularities." The Awami League government in its election pledge promised re-launching Dhaka-New York routes for the convenience of the expatriate Bangladeshis in the US. Mosharraf Hossain told the committee meeting that there was no need to rush since Biman was almost certainly miss the Oct 26 deadline to start Dhaka-New York flights. "If you fail the deadline, you should not hurry for procuring the same aircraft from the same company," the committee chairman said.
