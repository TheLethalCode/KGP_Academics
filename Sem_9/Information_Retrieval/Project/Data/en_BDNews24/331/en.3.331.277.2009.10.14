 MOSCOW, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian opposition lawmakers walked out of the country's parliament on Wednesday in protest at Sunday's elections, which saw the ruling United Russia win crushing victories across the country in disputed circumstances. "We demand a meeting with the president," said nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. "Until we meet him we are not going to participate in the Duma (parliament)," Zhirinovsky said, declining further detail. Opposition leaders have complained about the results of Sunday's regional elections, saying there were numerous violations of the rules. The authorities have dismissed the complaints. Protests by lawmakers from the three opposition parties represented in the lower house of parliament, or Duma, are very unusual in Russia. Although United Russia holds more than two-thirds of the seats in the Duma, the LDPR, the Communist Party and Fair Russia also have deputies. Russia's Central Election Commission chief Vladimir Churov, commenting on the surprise walkout, told Interfax news agency: "No comment. It is just politics". Churov has already derided complaints about the elections as "improper hysteria"
