 LISBON, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Bosingwa have recovered from injuries in time for Portugal's World Cup qualifier against Hungary Saturday, coach Carlos Queiroz said Friday. "Only (Juventus midfielder) Tiago did not recover; all the others have recovered and are fit to contribute," Queiroz told a news conference. Ronaldo said he hoped to be fit enough to play the full 90 minutes in Lisbon after his ankle injury. "I am almost at 100 percent, and with more treatments today and tomorrow I will be in full condition to play," he added. Ronaldo sprained an ankle playing for Real Madrid in a Champions League match against Marseille last week and missed the club's league defeat at Sevilla Saturday. Chelsea right-back Bosingwa missed his club's last domestic match, a 2-0 home win over Liverpool, due to an unspecified muscle injury. Malaga defender Duda and Guimaraes midfielder Nuno Assis have shaken off knocks in time for Saturday's qualifier, Queiroz said. Portugal are third in Group One and must win Saturday, and against Malta next Wednesday, while hoping that Sweden drop points, if they are to reach the playoffs.
