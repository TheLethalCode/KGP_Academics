 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court, which concluded hearings on appeals in Bangabandhu murder case on Wednesday, will begin hearing arguments on Thursday, a defence counsel said. "The Supreme Court will start hearing the arguments on Thursday," barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin, told reporters on the eighth day of appeals hearing on Wednesday. Mamun finished reading out from the ruling given by a third High Court judge, Justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim. He said: "The third judge in his ruling said though the crime of killing Bangabandhu along with his family falls in the nature of rebellion, emotion is not influenced by the nature of crime. "We won't ever know that whether anybody else except the convicts had any links to the killing of Bangabandhu and his family members. "So the evidence on record of the case should be analysed with caution, the judge said," according to Mamun. "The ruling said most witnesses had testified against the accused. We should be cautions to find out the crime of the real criminals doubtlessly. "The statements of Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman and Lt Col Sultan Shariar Rashid Khan have been kept out of consideration. The two judges in their split verdict could not be unanimous that their confessional statements were true and voluntary. "The statement of Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) was proved true and voluntary. So the statement will go against him. "But his statement involving Maj Ahmed Shariful Hossain, captain Kismat Hashem and captain Nazmul Hosain Ansar was not proved. "Since the prosecution failed to prove allegations against them the three convicts have been acquitted. "The trial court verdict of awarding death sentence to Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), captain Abdul Mazed and risalder Moslem Uddin was right. Their death reference has been accepted." Chief public prosecutor advocate Anisul Haque told reporters after Wednesday's ruling that the Appellate Division had granted 'leave to appeal' on five points. All convicts will be allowed to give their statements on four points while they will be able to give separate statements on the fifth point. The court told the defence that one lawyer would be allowed to place his presentation on the matter. The defence would inform the court whether they would deliver statements together or separately. Haque said the third judge had decided that 12 convicts should be executed on seeing law, statements and evidence. "In the evidence on record in the ruling of the third judge it was said that after then army chief Gen Shafiullah had gone to radio station Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed told him, 'You have done a job'." "But Gen Shafiullah said that he did not do that work." Barrister Mamun said though there were discussions only over six convicts in the ruling of the third judge the decision was made on 15 convicts. As the third judge did not consider the testimony of all witnesses the convicts were deprived of justice, he said. The five-judge bench of the Appellate Division led by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam concluded the hearing of appeals at around 1:30pm. The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
