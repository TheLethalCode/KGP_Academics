<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) The Supreme Court has again warned defence counsel barrister Abdullah Al Mamun to be careful in delivering briefings on appeals hearing on the Bangabandhu murder trial. The five-judge Appellate Division bench resumed the fourth day's hearing at 9:50am on Thursday in the third trial room of the court building amid tight security. The apex court also asked the media to present authentic reports. Mamun, counsel for convicts retired major Bazlul Huda and lancer AKM Mohiuddin, started reading out from page 985 of the appeal petition. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam on Wednesday said the apex court would hear the confessional statements by the death convicts at Thursday's hearing. The third day heard the ruling by Justice Ruhul Amin on convicts Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, he said. The reading of the part of Mohidduin (artillery) started, Alam said. A security archway was set up at the entrance of the trial room 'on security grounds'. Asked what the paperbook contains, Alam said: "All papers such as First Information Report, chargesheet, witnesses' account, the verdicts of the trial court and the High Court and ruling on leave to appeal are furnished in the paperbook." After the presentation of paperbook, the defence will deliver their arguments before the court, he said. "After the defence is done with their arguments the prosecution will start delivering its explanations. Then the court will give its ruling," the attorney general explained. Abdullah Al Mamun said on Wednesday the court did not accept convict retired lieutenant colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan's confessional statement. "He was awarded death sentence after he was found guilty based on other evidence," Mamun said. There were different witnesses' accounts about the dress of Bazlul Huda, he said. On lancer Mohiuddin he said: "Those who were at Dhanmondi 32 house that night could not identify Mohiudin. He was given death sentence based on testimony of other witnesses." On retired lieutenant colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), Mamun said: "The trial was held in his absence. One witness identified lancer Mohiuddin for artillery Mohiuddin." There were discrepancies in the accounts given by the witnesses, the lawyer said. Mamun said the then army chief major general K M Shafiullah and col Shafayet Jamil had said in their statement parade was mandatory at night twice in a month until before Aug 15. Justice Ruhul Amin in his ruling said attending the parade cannot be termed as conspiracy, he said. On the second day, the court had asked all including the media and lawyers to be careful in delivering briefings on the hearing. Alam, the attorney general, told reporters after Tuesday's hearing that statements were being delivered in talk shows on the merit of the case. "This should not take place during an ongoing trial." The freshly formed bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing appeals on Mujib murder case on Monday. Earlier on Sunday, Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
