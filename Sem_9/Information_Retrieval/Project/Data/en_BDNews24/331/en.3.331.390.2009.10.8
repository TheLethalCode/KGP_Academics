 NEW DELHI, Oct 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's headline inflation rose at a slower-than-expected pace at the end of September on firm food prices, adding to the debate over when the central bank should exit from its accommodative monetary stance. The widely watched wholesale price index rose by 0.7 percent in the 12 months to Sept 26, below both market forecasts and the previous week's 0.83 percent annual rise. On Monday, Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said while there was broad agreement India needed to wind back some of its easy policy stance, there were risks if the move was mistimed. A day later, Australia become the first Group of 20 economy to raise interest rates as the global financial crisis eases. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said on Wednesday India needed more time before deciding on an exit from accommodative policy, and monetary and fiscal policies needed to move in tandem. Short supply of some food items after a poor monsoon pushed the food articles index up by an annual 15.45 percent, although that was below the previous week's 16.3 percent annual rise. "Even though this week's number looks much lower than what was expected, inflation is set to rise at a galloping pace as the rise in food prices has been ongoing since even before the current drought," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist of Bank of Baroda. "Once the pricing power returns to the manufacturing sector, we will see cost-push impulses getting translated into demand-pull pressures. Inflation by the end of the year will be closer to 8 percent," she added. The finance minister has said inflation was a concern and it could climb to 5-6 percent by the end of the 2009/10 fiscal year. The WPI has already risen over 6 percent from March 28, the last reading of the 2008/09 fiscal year, and annual consumer price inflation in August stood at 11.72 percent. Mukherjee has said he would discuss the monetary stance with Subbarao before the October 27 monetary policy review. "Demand pressures to inflation are still quite weak. The RBI should not be reacting to this because growth is still fragile," said D.K. Joshi, principal economist at rating agency CRISIL. The central bank expects the economy to grow about 6 percent in the 2009/10 fiscal year, compared with 6.7 percent last year and 9 percent or more in between 2005/06 and 2007/08. The central bank left its key policy rate unchanged at its last quarterly review, after cutting it by 425 basis points between October and April to support economic recovery in Asia's third-largest econ
