<TITLE> Chakma Raja 'harassed' by Indian diplomats </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Subhra Kanti Gupta Kolkata, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Chakma Raja Tridib Roy, who sided with Pakistan during the 1971 war, has been "harassed" by Indian diplomats, sources close to him have alleged. The octogenerian Raja, who had settled in Pakistan after the 1971 war and was even appointed a Pakistani ambassador, was not granted a visa to visit Bodh Gaya via Calcutta, where he wanted to fly in from Thailand. "Rather, he has been asked to enter the country through Delhi, which is strange," said a family member, who did not wish to be identified. Tridib Roy now stays in Bangkok with his eldest daughter Chandra, who works for the UNDP. He is planning a visit to Bodh Gaya in India in the last week of October. Many Indian Chakmas are expected to greet him there to seek blessings and counsel. Indian intelligence is also reportedly closely monitoring those with whom Tridib Roy is likely to stay in Delhi and Bodh Gaya. "We think he will be under close intelligence watch," a Chakma human rights campaigner in Delhi said. Many Chakmas fled to India in past decades forced to leave their homeland as insurgency broke out in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. At the present rate of population growth, Indian Chakmas could outnumber those in Bangladesh in another decade.
