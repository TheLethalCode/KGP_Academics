 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)--Speakers at a roundtable on Thursday stressed innovative public-private partnership to address poverty and hunger, according to a WFP news release. Private sector and development partners have important roles in fighting poverty and advancing economic development, they also said. Speaking at a roundtable on Thursday, titled 'Food Security and Child HungerPolicy Discussion on CSR' prof Wahiduddin Mahmud said, "The cost of hunger, the silent disaster, affecting about 65 million people in Bangladesh, needs greater understanding and appreciation." He stressed the need for an innovative and low cost solution to the malnutrition through private-public-NGO partnership. The speakers also agreed on a huge need to link up Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities with development programmes to sustainably lift millions of people out of extreme poverty. WFP Bangladesh representative John Aylieff said, "This is the time to seriously explore effective partnership." "It seems that a CSR programme with strong links to mainstream development programmes is most effective in reducing poverty and hunger in a sustainable way." In his keynote speech, Brett Rierson, senior officer, Private Partnerships, WFP, appreciated the private sector's global roles in fighting poverty and malnutrition. "Globally, the private sector is playing a greater role, serving as a catalyst in the fight against poverty and malnutrition." "Their creativity as problem solvers, and their marketing cloutreaching millions, convincing the public to become part of the solution to hungerare vital tools for the WFP." "Their 'service innovations' are now leading to social innovations as we stand together, fighting hunger worldwide." In the wrap-up session, Aylieff called for a concerted effort through forming a 'Corporate alliance against hunger' to address malnutrition and hunger in Bangladesh. The workshop was co-organised by Financial Express and the United Nation's World Food Programme at Hotel Sheraton
