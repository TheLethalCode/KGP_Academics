<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand international Jacob Oram has retired from Test cricket in a bid to prolong his injury-blighted career in the shortened form of the game. The 31-year-old all-rounder said his body could no longer cope with the workload of both batting and bowling in all three forms of the game for up to 10 months a year. "For the sake of longevity I have had to make a decision that will decrease my workload, so I can concentrate all my efforts on the shorter forms of the game," Oram said in a statement. The decision to favour one-day and Twenty20 cricket was based around playing opportunities, with the chance to play events such as the World Cup, Champions Trophy and the Indian Premier League, Oram said. Oram has played 33 Tests since his debut in December 2002. Renowned as a powerful striker of the ball, he has scored 1780 runs at an average of 36.3, with five centuries and six half centuries. His medium pace bowling has netted 60 wickets with a best of 4 for 41. He has also played 132 one-day internationals and 20 Twenty20 matches.
