A team of Dhaka's Special Branch of police cell on preventing militants, with the help of local police, launched the drive in Rajshahi metropolitan, Naogaon and Natore on Wednesday and Thursday, Rajshahi Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Sarder Nurul Amin said at a news conference on Friday at the RMP office.

Following the statements of the arrestees police arrested Shahabuddin and his associate Rahidul at Baraigram of Natore the same day. The arrestees were planning to carry out destructive activities, the deputy commissioner said. They were being grilled under police custody, RMP East Zone deputy commissioner Sajjadur Rahman said. The raid was carried out after a successful drive of the special team against a militant party, 'Islam o Muslim', in Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj from July 14 to Aug 2. Nurul Amin said the arrestees were running their activities more carefully and changed strategy after the arrest of 'Islam o Muslim' activists. Boalia model police chief Jashim Uddin said a case was underway. Since the formation of JMB by Shaikh Abdur Rahman the party was most active in Rajshahi. There is allegation that a number of BNP leaders are also working behind the scenes with them. JMB created sensation after carrying out countrywide bomb explosions in 2005. Later, the party kingpins Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Siddiqur Rahman alis 'Bangla Bhai' were arrested and executed during the caretaker government regime. bdnews
