 LONDON, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A dogged Germany, late-scoring Denmark, stylish Serbia and dramatic Italy all booked their places in the World Cup finals on the penultimate night of European qualifying on Saturday. Bosnia, France and Ireland secured places in next month's seeded playoffs which will provide another four qualifiers. Switzerland are also assured of a least a playoff berth but remain well-placed for automatic qualification. Group stage qualifying is completed on Wednesday with the two-legged playoffs taking place on November 12 and 16. Germany again marched impressively into the finals when a 1-0 win at chief rivals Russia secured top place in Group Four. The key moment came after 35 minutes when Miroslav Klose capitalised on a defensive mix-up on the artificial surface to score his 50th international goal. Germany, who had defender Jerome Boateng sent off in the 69th minute, held firm in the face of some lively Russian attacking in the second half and top the group on 25 points. Russia, on 21, were already assured of a playoff place. GILARDINO EQUALISER Italy looked as if they would need their final Group Eight qualifier against Cyprus to make sure of progressing after Sean St Ledger put Ireland 2-1 up with a brilliant diving header three minutes from time in Dublin. But Alberto Gilardino levelled in the 90th minute to secure top spot on 21 points and leave Ireland in the playoffs -- which they were guaranteed anyway thanks to Bulgaria's surprise 4-1 defeat in Cyprus. Serbia swamped Romania 5-0 to qualify in style ahead of 2006 runners-up France in Group Seven. Nikola Zigic, Marko Pantelic, Zdravko Kuzmanovic and two from Milan Jovanovic took Serbia to 22 points. Andre-Pierre Gignac got two in France's regulation 5-0 win over the Faroe Islands. Denmark, who missed out on the last two major championships, went through from Group One as Jakob Poulsen struck 12 minutes from time to secure a 1-0 home win over Sweden. Sweden now look likely to miss out altogether as they dropped to third on 15 points behind Portugal, who beat Hungary 3-0 with two goals from Simao Sabrosa to move to 16. Portugal, who looked out of it weeks ago, finish off at home to Malta where a win will secure a playoff berth. BOSNIA CLOSE Bosnia, who have never qualified for a major tournament, moved closer after their 2-0 win in Estonia secured second place in Group Five. Edin Dzeko headed Bosnia into a 32nd minute lead and Vedad Ibisevic settled it midway through the second half. Bosnia have 19 points, seven clear of Turkey, who lost 2-0 in Belgium. Group winners Spain made it nine wins out of nine when they beat Armenia 2-1 away with goals by Cesc Fabregas and Juan Mata from the penalty spot. Defender Philippe Senderos scored two headers as Switzerland cruised past Luxembourg 3-0 to get to 20 points in Group Two. A point at home to Israel on Wednesday will guarantee progress. Greece are still just in the hunt for top spot as Theofanis Gekas scored four goals in a 5-2 home win over Latvia to move to 17 points with a home game against Luxembourg to come. Group Three will go to the wire after Slovenia secured a superb 2-0 away win over leaders Slovakia. Valter Birsa and Nejc Pecnik were on target to take Slovenia to 17 points, two behind Slovakia. The Slovaks are away to Poland on Wednesday while Slovenia visit San Marino. Czech Republic, who beat Poland 2-0, and Northern Ireland are theoretically still in the hunt for a playoff berth. They meet on Wednesday in Prague. England's run of eight successive wins was brought to an end in Ukraine when the home side's 1-0 success put them in a great position to snatch second spot in Group Six ahead of Croatia. England had keeper Robert Green sent off after 14 minutes and, though Andriy Shevchenko missed the penalty, Sergiy Nazarenko's deflected shot after 29 minutes took Ukraine to 18 points, one ahead of Croatia with a trip to Andorra to come.
