 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)The number of letters handled by the government post offices decreases by one crore a yearthanks to the fast-growing mobile telephony and Internet services that became the quickest and easiest mode of communication. As nations around the world observe the World Postal Day on Friday, designated since 1874 to underline the importance of mail service, many kept wondering whether it would survive as an indispensible communication utility. Such fears about a decaying postal service stem from the stunning development of new communication technologies, particularly mobile telephony and Internetthe wonderful information superhighways that are shaping today's knowledge-based world of business and academia. Postal department officials say they get fewer letters for dispatch these days as people now hardly write letters to their near and dear ones. Their landline telegraph and telephone systems seem to have become redundant too. Bangladesh Post Office director general Mobasherur Rahman told bdnews24.com that they now handle some 15 to 16 crore letters a year. "We used to handle 20 crore letters a year five to six years ago and 24 crore letters 10 years ago," he said. But delivery of letters came down by about 10 crore in last 10 years, the DG said. Rahman said the total number of letters decreased as the number of personal letters came down. Most people these days simply do not write letters; they would rather prefer to use mobile phones and e-mail which are easy, cheap and convenient, he said. Modern technologies like mobile phones and internet and the couriers service which are easily available to people are blamed for the bad days for the postal service. Though courier services cost a bit higher, people prefer them as they ensure safe and quick dispatch of letters, parcels and money. Over the years, the postal service has become inefficient, slow and even corrupt, people who had bitter experience in dealing with postal department complained. "There is no assurance that letters sent through post offices will reach the address in time," said Shamsul Huq, a retired government employee who lives in a village in Savar, near Dhaka. "In many cases, letters sent through the post office were lost." Telegram and telex services also became redundant in this age of cellphone and internet communication. And people prefer cellphones to landline telephones, which is largely a state monopoly in Bangladesh, because they are easier to get connection, efficient and above all, cheap. Mahbubuddin Khokan, a member of parliament from Noakhali on Thursday proposed in the House for reactivating two old post offices in his constituency. Authorities are also expanding and diversifying the services of postal department, introducing different kinds of services, officials said. The postal department is now providing services like transferring money through mobile phone, delivering remittances sent by expatriates workers, handling passport application forms and fees, depositing money in savings accounts, releasing prize bonds in the market, selling revenue stamps and payment of utility bills. The DG Post Office said they would soon introduce cash cards the subscribers of which would be able to withdraw money from post offices with ATM cards like the clients of the commercial banks do. Courier services, though a bit costly, have become popular over the years, lugging significant numbers of letters and parcels from one place to other. Mobasherur Rahman informed that as many as four to five crore letters are dispatched through courier services a year. "We are making efforts to bring many changes in our service to compete with courier service... To provide quick services and efficient we have started the process of recruiting some 2,850 people," he said. The DG said the number of departmental post offices is over 1,600, rural or extra departmental post offices are 8,000. The postal department employs as many as 17,000 full-time staff and over 24,000 part-time workers. The postal system was introduced during the rule of Kutubuddin Aibek (1206-1210) from Delhi to Subah (province) of Bengal. Those early postal services were run through fast galloping horsemen relaying the mails to the remote corners. But Postal system was modernized during the British period with the introduction of many services  railway mail was introduced in 1864, money order in 1880, express telegram in 1909 and air mail was introduced in 1933. bdnews2
